I. PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND RESULTS MONITORING 

A. Background, problems addressed, and rationale 

1.1 Property rights over land and agricultural competitiveness. The agriculture 
sector is one of the most important sectors of the Bolivian economy. Between 2002 
and 2014, average annual growth in the sector was 4.16%, accounting for close to 
13.4% of gross domestic product. It employs 30% of the total labor force nationally 
and is even more significant in rural areas where it employs 62% of the labor force. 
The agriculture sector also makes a significant contribution to Bolivian exports; 
between 1999 and 2014, exports grew at an average annual rate of 13%, leaping 
from US$247 million to US$1.29 billion. Over this period, the agriculture sector 
accounted for between 14% and 18% of the total value of the country’s exports.1 
Considering that the economy of rural households is closely tied to agricultural 
activities, growth in the sector contributed to a 21 percentage point reduction in 
rural poverty levels, with poverty falling from 62% to 39% (Castellani and Zenteno, 
2015).  

1.2 Despite the importance of the agriculture sector, a detailed examination shows low 
productivity levels. According to the United Nations’ Food and Agricultural 
Organization (FAO), agricultural yield from grain production is 57% of the average 
for South America and 39% in the case of starchy root crops. In addition, a Bank 
analysis shows that growth in Bolivia’s total factor productivity has been lower than 
the regional average, with a decline in efficiency but increases in technological 
change (Nin-Pratt et al., 2015). Data from the Social and Economic Policy Analysis 
Unit indicate that the area under cultivation increased by 460,000 hectares 
between 2006 and 2014. This means that sector growth has been due more to 
expansion of the area under cultivation than to increased productivity. Sector 
growth was concentrated in a small group of items intended for export in the 
eastern part of the country, where producers have benefited from the region’s 
natural characteristics (soils, topography, and water), a good level of public 
spending on sector public goods, and private investments in intensive systems of 
production with access to financing and the latest technologies. 

1.3 The agriculture sector’s potential contribution to economic growth and rural poverty 
reduction depends on farmers’ increased productivity, particularly among small and 
medium-sized producers (World Bank, 2008; Escobal, J., 2012). In Bolivia, most 
small and medium-sized producers are located in the valleys and highlands. The 
main items of those agricultural producers are crops such as potato, corn, and 
grains. More than 80% of the parcels with pending regularization and titling belong 
to the small farmer category, which includes rural producers with fewer than two 
hectares in the highlands and up to 50 hectares in the lowlands. These agricultural 
producers are estimated to represent 83% of the country’s rural households.2 

1.4 Improving agriculture sector productivity and thus efficiency and sustainability in 
the use of land in Bolivia requires investments in sector public goods to promote 
farmers’ private productive investments (Lopez, 2004, Blackman et al. 2014, 
Quisumbing and Kumar, 2014; Ali, et al., 2014). A requirement for achieving this

objective is to establish secure property rights over land. According to the available 
empirical evidence, such rights reduce the risk of expropriation and give farmers 
the incentive to make investments that increase productivity and the sustainability 
of rural properties. In the Bolivian case, the empirical evidence is limited because 
no rigorous assessments of the impacts of titling on the productivity and 
sustainable management of agricultural producers’ natural resources have been 
done. Nonetheless, empirical evidence in the region shows the positive impact of 
titling on the use of inputs, increased productive investments, stimulation of the 
land market, reduced deforestation, and farmers’ income (Aldana and Fort, 2001, 
Ghatak and Besley, 2010; Deininger and Chamorro, 2004; Hernández and 
Reardon, 2012; Foltz, Larson and Lopez, 2000, Torrero and Field, 2005; Zegarra, 
2008, Gignoux, J. et al. 2013; Lawry et al. 2014; and Rockson et al., 2013). 

1.5 Property rights, sustainability, and conflicts. Property rights in and of 
themselves do not guarantee the sustainable use of natural resources. In 
Nicaragua, the assignment of property rights improved agricultural productivity and 
also increased the rate of deforestation (Liscow, 2013). The preliminary data for 
Bolivia (Santa Cruz) indicate that land titling, particularly for ranchers, increases 
deforestation (Murguia, 2016). Thus, if the regularization of rural property rights is 
not accompanied by a legal framework and the corresponding environmental 
management instruments, the results of rural titling tend to generate environmental 
degradation. In this regard, the evidence shows that a requirement for ensuring the 
positive impacts of rural land titling on environmental management is the ability to 
monitor and penalize violations (OECD, 2009). With respect to social conflicts, 
10% of the last 25 million hectares subject to intervention are paralyzed by social 
conflicts. This problem is estimated to be significant in the area where property 

rights are yet to be regularized, covering 15 million hectares (paragraph 1.6), in that 
small landholdings (minifundios) are involved (Carrasco, 2016). Under this 
scenario, dispute resolution is important to remove barriers to titling. 

1.6 Status of regularization and titling. The Bolivian government has made 
significant strides in the regularization of rural property and the regularization, 
cadastre, titling, and registration of rural lands is reaching its final stage. Table 1 
indicates that the regularization and titling target was approximately 106 million 
hectares. Between 1996 and 2014, the National Agrarian Reform Institute (INRA) 
has been involved in interventions covering approximately 93 million hectares as 
follows: (i) it regularized and titled approximately 41 million private hectares, which 
included collective properties (Territorios Indígenas Comunitarios Campesinos 
[Rural Community Indigenous Territories] (TIOCs) and Comunidades 
Interculturales Originarias [Native Intercultural Communities (CIOCs)) and 
individual properties; (ii) it regularized approximately 25 million hectares of public 
lands; and (iii) it made headway with the regularization of rural lands that did not 
yet comply with all the legal and technical requirements, involving 27 million 
hectares. The work of regularization, titling, and registration of rural lands that is 
pending for the next few years is to continue in the areas not yet subject to 
intervention, amounting to 15 million hectares, and to finalize the regularization 
process in 25 million hectares that were already subject to intervention but have 
not yet complied with all the requirements of the regularization process. 

1.7 The indigenous peoples and intercultural communities were the primary 
beneficiaries of INRA’s interventions, for a total of approximately 32 million titled 
hectares, which represents 78% of the total titled area in the country (Table 1). 

pcdocs://IDBDOCS/40320821/R

This is the result of the effect of Law 3,545, which gave priority to the regularization 
and titling of TIOCs and CIOCs. Small and medium-sized properties occupy 
second place in terms of titled area, with 5.6 million hectares, which represents 
14% of the country’s titled area. According to INRA, this individual titling progress 
occurs in settlement areas, Andean-Amazonian transition areas, and integrated 
management areas of the Amboró National Park (Cochabamba and Santa Cruz). 
Lastly, three million hectares held by agricultural companies were dealt with in the 
regularization process, representing 8% of the country’s titled area. The company-
held properties are located in Santa Cruz, Pando, and Beni.

1.8 According to data from INRA (Andrade, 2016), the areas still not covered by the 
titling policy are distributed throughout the country. Nonetheless, the demand for 
titling of rural lands is concentrated primarily in La Paz, Potosí, Oruro, 
Cochabamba, Beni, and Santa Cruz. In terms of the number of titles to be 
delivered, La Paz (48%) has the highest percentage, followed by Potosí (15%) and 
Cochabamba (14%). The departments with the largest areas to be titled are: 
Santa Cruz (30%), La Paz (22%), and Beni (22%). 

1.9 Institutional framework of property rights.  The institutional structure for 
establishing property rights over rural land was developed under the Agrarian Law 
of 1953. That law created the National Agrarian Reform Service, which is headed 
by the President and implemented through the National Agrarian Reform Council. 
The Council controlled the operational aspects of the work of titling rural lands at 
that time. This institutional framework was redesigned in 1996 with the enactment 
of Law 1,715/96. With the new law, the Council was replaced by INRA, identified 
under Law 1,715/96 as a technical and legal institution with operational 
responsibilities for defining rural land ownership rights. In 2006, Law 3,545/06, 
which reinstituted the agrarian reform on a community basis, amended Law 
1,715/96 by facilitating the titling of collective lands and establishing that all 
available public lands would preferably be assigned to indigenous or campesino 
peoples or communities that had limited land. It also established that private lands 
(medium-sized property owners and companies) would revert to the State if they 
failed to serve an economic and social function (Endo, 2016; Colque et al., 2016). 

1.10 Laws 1,715/96 and 3,545/06 retained the National Agrarian Reform Service as the 
body responsible for planning, executing, and consolidating the agrarian reform 
process. The Service is made up of: (i) the President, the supreme authority 



- 4 - 

responsible for signing title deeds, among other duties; (ii) the Ministry of Rural 
Development and Land (MDRyT), which is responsible for implementing policies 
and other strategic activities in the sector; (iii) the National Agrarian Commission, a 
mixed government/civil society agency charged with community oversight and the 
strategic course of the agrarian reform process; (iv) the Agrarian Judicatura [bench 
of judges], a specialized body for the administration of agrarian justice, made up of 
the Agri-Environmental Tribunal and the Agri-Environmental Courts, for the 
resolution of disputes arising from land ownership and property rights, which was 
conceived as an independent institution and is thus not part of the Service; and 
(v) INRA, an autonomous decentralized public agency under the MDRyT 
responsible, among other things, for steering, coordinating, and executing agrarian 
property regularization policies (Endo, 2016; Colque, et al., 2016). 

1.11 Law 1,715/96 kept unchanged the rural property types previously defined by the 
Agrarian Law of 1953. Rural property types include: campesino site, small 
property, medium-sized property, and agricultural enterprise. However, Law 
1,715/96 added a new type of collective property, the Native Community Land, and 
recognized equal property rights for men and women, defining parity criteria in land 
distribution, management, tenure, and use. Another important change introduced 
by Law 1,715/96 was the development of new instruments recognizing rural 
property rights. The regularization instruments were developed to implement the 
multiple objectives of Law 1,715/96: to regularize property rights, consolidate 
indigenous territories, recover idle lands, certify public lands and distribute them to 
those who need them, resolve disputes, and develop the rural cadastre (Endo, 
2016). 

1.12 The Real Property Rights Registry (DDRR) supplements the institutional 
framework of property rights mentioned above. The DDRR is the Judicial Council 
entity responsible for recording all entries and annotations covering real property 
rights, including real estate and real estate rights, in Bolivia. It was created by the 
Law on the Registration of Real Property Rights of 1887; its operational rules are 
defined in the Civil Code and the regulations approved by Supreme Decree 29,757 
of 2004. For a large-scale rural land regularization and titling operation like that 
proposed in this program, the technical, operational, and technological link 
between INRA and the DDRR is very important for expediting the registration of 
rural properties that have been regularized and surveyed. The workloads 
generated by INRA exceed the existing capacities of the DDRR, which sometimes 
receives packets of more than 10,000 property titles in files and titling data maps 
all at once. 

1.13 Bank actions and other sources of financing. Various funding agencies have 
supported the activities involved in regularizing rural land property rights. The 
World Bank granted a loan of US$24.7 million; the Nordic Development Fund 
financed US$7.5 million; the Kingdom of the Netherlands provided support through 
a nonreimbursable fund of US$8.8 million; the European Union contributed 
US$4 million to the process. The Bank began its support for land titling in Bolivia 
through the “Environmental and Social Protection Project in the Santa Cruz – 
Puerto Suárez Corridor” (1099/SF-BO), through which it financed a titling 
subcomponent amounting to US$2.4 million. The Bank consolidated its 
participation in this area with a land titling operation for US$22 million called the 
“Land Regularization and Legal Cadastre Program” (1512/SF-BO). These funds 
totaled US$70 million and were executed between 1996 and 2012.

1.14 The advances made in the area of land regularization are part of a series of 
reforms in the country’s legal framework. Since the National Agrarian Reform 
Council was replaced by INRA, a series of rules was developed to expedite the 
process of regularizing rural lands. Although an institutional structure was created, 
INRA still lacked the capacity to implement the new legal framework for land 
regularization. To overcome the institutional constraints, the decision was made to 
contract land regularization companies, which transferred regularization 
technologies and trained local specialists during contract implementation. With the 
entry into force of Law 3,545/06, the method whereby companies were contracted 
for land regularization became obsolete and INRA assumed the direct execution of 
land regularization. The existing financial resources were thus reallocated to 
finance INRA’s specialized brigades (equipment, vehicles, and specialists). The 
Bank also supported the development, implementation, and linkage of the initial 
versions of the rural property cadastre and registration systems.3 

1.15 Problems in land regularization, cadastre, titling, and registration. The 
diagnostic assessments of the process of regularization, titling, and registration of 
rural land indicate that the following issues need to be addressed:  

1.16 Limitations of the regulatory framework. According to the diagnostic 
assessment of the existing legal framework (Endo, 2016), the latter permits 
program execution to start. Nonetheless, the following problems must be 
overcome during program execution: (i) the regularization, titling, and cadastre 
manuals are outdated; (ii) the rural land regularization procedures are not entirely 
suited to the new areas of intervention; (iii) the rural land regularization procedures 
do not incorporate technological changes that will have a positive impact on titling; 
(iv) the current dispute resolution mechanism needs to be reformulated to reduce 
the burden of pending litigation in titling processes; (v) the ability to use land as a 
guarantee for obtaining credit is restricted to medium-sized property and 
agricultural enterprises; and (vi) the costs for maintaining the formal status of rural 
properties are high and the incentives for maintaining the rural cadastre are 
insufficient. 

1.17 Limitations of the regularization process. The cadastral sweep (barrido 
catastral)4 is the most efficient methodology for large-scale regularization of land 
tenure in rural areas with large numbers of producers and low titling levels. The 
cadastral sweep takes advantage of economies of scale; per title costs are thus 
lower than regularization based on individual demand. Operation 1512/SF-BO 
helped the government to implement the cadastral sweep method. Operation 
1512/SF-BO financed the basic inputs for implementing the sweep, including: 
(i) the formation of regularization specialist brigades – contracting of specialists; 
(ii) the purchase of equipment for the field work; and (iii) logistical support. 
According to the regularization diagnostic assessment (Andrade, 2016), in order to 
achieve the program targets, it is essential that: (i) brigade staff members working 
in INRA under contingent contracts be retained throughout program execution; 
(ii) equipment for the field work be modernized; and (iii) the logistical support 
infrastructure be replaced. An estimated 150 to 200 field brigades will need to be

made by the Bank and the government to overcome the challenges of regularization work in Bolivia.

  The cadastral sweep is a methodology for systemic surveying of each and every one of the rural parcels 

in an area to gather the technical and legal information on the property and its owner for the mass 
regularization of rural property tenure.

financed each year. These brigades are made up of seven regularization 
specialists. Each brigade’s field operations require a minimum infrastructure of 
GPS equipment, portable computers, complete stations, and vehicles. 

1.18 Deficiencies of the technological platform. According to the diagnostic 
assessment of the technological platform (Solíz, 2016), the current technology is 
capable of continuing the rural land regularization, cadastre, titling, and registration 
process. However, the following problems must be overcome: (i) consolidating the 
Land Maintenance and Management System (SIMAT) and the Integrated Cadastre 
System (SIC) as technical tools; (ii) migrating data from the Integrated 
Regularization and Titling System (SIST) to the SIMAT/SIC systems; (iii) replacing 
the use of the SIST with the SIMAT/SIC in all INRA offices; (iv) improving the 
electronic link between INRA and the DDRR for the large-scale property tilting and 
registration process; (v) reorganizing the data centers and updating the data 
servers; (vi) updating the equipment (computers); (vii) developing the INRA nexus 
with GeoBolivia; (viii) reviewing and consolidating administrative systems; 
(ix) cleaning spatial data; (x) completing the process of digitization and indexation 
of the INRA documentary collection; and (xi) developing the INRA platform. 

1.19 Limitations of environmental and social management tools. According to the 
results from the program’s Strategic Environmental and Social Assessment 
(SESA) (see Carrasco, 2016), the current legal framework is sufficiently developed 
for the environmental and social management of the rural property regularization 
process. However, the management tools for handling potential environmental and 
social problems stemming from rural property regularization are not fully 
developed. The main conclusion of the SESA indicates that the above weaknesses 
produce a situation in which current regulations are not fully enforced and/or 
compliance with them is not verified. Accordingly, the following problems must be 
overcome during program execution: (i) forest coverage monitoring does not 
generate information in real time for monitoring and controlling deforestation; 
(ii) the rural cadastre does not include the environmental information needed to 
facilitate monitoring and control at each rural property; and (iii) the tools that INRA 
has for managing social conflicts are inadequate for addressing the complexity of 
the conflicts and the processes for resolving them.  

1.20 Lessons learned. The proposed project has taken into account lessons learned 
from loans 1099/SF-BO and 1512/SF-BO and other similar Bank-financed 
operations in the region (see Table 2).

Problem by work area Reflected in project design 

Legal framework. It is necessary to 

ensure that the legal framework 
allows rural titling to be carried out. 

While the current legal framework allows for moving 
forward with the regularization, titling, and registration of 
rural lands, the program will finance activities to improve 
the regulatory framework. 

Institutional organization. Titling 

requires the participation of various 
public agencies that neither share 
information nor coordinate activities 
well. 

The project will finance the strengthening of key 
institutions involved in the process of regularizing rural 
property.  

Information safeguards. The rural 

cadastre information must be 
protected.  

The working methodology for the cadastral survey will be 
100% digital with backup systems.  

Cadastral survey. The cadastral 

sweep methodology has yielded good 
results. 

The sweep methodology will be improved for working in 
highland areas with small landholdings, through the use 
of unmanned aerial vehicles, for example. 

Monitoring and quality control 
system. The lack of monitoring 

systems makes it difficult to manage 
progress made in rural titling. 

The project will develop an integrated system for 
monitoring progress, including the reactivation of 
participatory monitoring mechanisms. 

Community participation. The 

communities’ participation in the 
titling process was a key factor in the 
success of the operation. 

The program will reinstall the interagency titling 
committees with the participation of authorities from 
indigenous communities and territories. 

Support for permanent institutions. 

It is important to focus efforts on 
supporting permanent institutions. 

The project will support INRA, the DDRR, the Forest and 
Land Social Control and Oversight Authority (ABT), and 
the Mother Earth Plurinational Authority (APMT), which 
are permanent government institutions, in the work of 
regularization and environmental and social 
management of rural property.  

Management of the regularization 
brigades. It is critical to design a 

cadastral sweep methodology with 
incentives and penalties. 

In the first year of program execution, funds will be 
earmarked for the design of a system to monitor the field 
brigades, taking into account incentives for achieving 
goals and penalties.

projects: 906/OC-PE, 1340/OC-PE, 1099/SF-BO, and 1512/SF-BO. 

 

1.21 Conceptual overview of the operation. The project is conceived as an operation 
that continues the rural property regularization process initiated by the Government 
of Bolivia through loans 1099/SF-BO and 1512/SF-BO. The project design 
emphasizes the key aspects identified in the diagnostic assessment of the current 
situation: (i) the strengthening of integrated mass sweep campaigns for the 
regularization of rural property, which will make it possible to proceed with rural 
titling on a cost-effective basis; (ii) modernization of the cadastre and public 
registry system, which will help to strengthen the integration of titling entities and 
public registries, as well as the efficient and secure management of cadastral 
information; (iii) strengthening of environmental and social management tools, 
which will help to reduce the environmental and social problems identified; and 
(iv) maintenance of the cadastre and public registry of rural properties, which will 
help to reduce transaction costs for the end user. 

1.22 Strategic alignment with the Update to the Institutional Strategy 2010-2020, 
the Corporate Results Framework (CRF) 2016-2019, and the Bank’s strategy 
with Bolivia 2016-2020. The program is consistent with the Update to the 
Institutional Strategy 2010-2020 (document AB-3008). Specifically, the program is 



- 8 - 

in line with the challenge of low productivity and innovation, by increasing farmers’ 
productivity related to the establishment of secure land ownership rights. The 
program is aligned with the Bank’s country strategy with Bolivia 2016-2020 
(document GN-2843) in that it contributes to the priority area of increasing 
productivity and diversification in the economy as well as with its strategic 
objectives: (i) promotion of innovation and (ii) provision of quality public goods and 
services. The operation is included in the 2016 Country Programming Document  
and the 2016 Operational Program Report (document GN-2849). Lastly, the 
program is consistent with the Agriculture and Natural Resources Management 
Sector Framework (document GN-2709-5), which identifies security of land tenure 
as a key activity for improving productivity and the sustainable use of natural 
resources. 

B. Objectives, components, and cost. The objective of the program is to increase 
legal certainty over rural property. 

1.23 Target population. The program beneficiaries are small and medium-sized 
agricultural producers and indigenous communities. Small and medium-sized 
producers characteristically have small family farming operations, primarily for their 
own consumption and with low levels of access to financing and productive 
technologies. The livelihood of the indigenous communities is based on the use of 
natural resources, along with small-scale farming usually occupying less than one 
hectare.  

1.24 Component 1: Land regularization, titling, and registration (US$74.9 million). 
This component will support rural land regularization, titling, and registration. In this 
respect, the following stages in the process need to be financed: (i) preparatory 
stage, which will support: evaluations of the areas of intervention, preparation of 
the technical and legal diagnostic assessment, increased density of geodetic 
points; (ii) field survey, which will support: dissemination of regularization, signage 
of vertices and boundaries, signing of records of agreement, survey of the rural 
property file, verification of the social function and/or social and economic function, 
dispute resolution, and development of the cadastral database; and (iii) titling and 
registration, which will finance: the preparation of draft resolutions, the signing of 
resolutions, the issuance of property titles, and registration of the titles in the 
DDRR. This component will also support management of social conflicts and the 
activities to be financed include: dispute resolution training for INRA staff; 
implementation of dispute resolution brigades; strengthening of the 
Agri-Environmental Tribunal for dispute resolution, development and 
implementation of customer service protocols and mechanisms, and strengthening 
of INRA’s Transparency Unit. 

1.25 Component 1 will use loan proceeds to finance key inputs for continuing with rural 
land regularization (paragraph 1.17). The key inputs for carrying out the 
regularization work include: (i) retention of INRA temporary staff; (ii) purchase of 
computer equipment, navigation and measuring equipment, and furniture; and 
(iii)  purchase of logistical support vehicles. Up to US$47 million in loan proceeds 
will be used to finance staffing requirements, to hire technical personnel to perform 
land regularization work. The “service delivery contractor” model indicated in 
paragraph 3.21 of the Policies for the selection and contracting of consultants 
financed by the IDB (document GN-2350-9) was identified as being suited to 
INRA’s needs. According to this Bank policy, this model is recommended when 



- 9 - 

project execution requires the hiring of large numbers of individuals who deliver 
services on a contract basis. 

1.26 Component 2: Land management (US$14.04 million). This component will 
finance: (i) modernization of INRA’s rural cadastre technological platform and the 
DDRR’s rural land registration platform to facilitate the administration of mass rural 
land cadastre, titling, and registration processes; and (ii) the program’s 
Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP), which will contribute to the 
social and environmental management of titled land. 

1.27 To modernize INRA’s cadastral system, the component will finance: the 
consolidation of the SIMAT and SIC as technical tools for rural land administration, 
the development and implementation of the INRA–GeoBolivia nexus, the design 
and implementation of the INRA services platform, and the digitization and 
indexation of the INRA documentary collection. To modernize the DDRR 
registration system, the component includes: the development of the DDRR 
services platform; training for DDRR office staff in the use of the platform 
developed; and the implementation of the cadastral maintenance campaigns. To 
implement the ESMP, the component will finance: the strengthening of the national 
forest coverage monitoring system; the development of the environmental 
dimension of the rural cadastre; indigenous land management measures; and 
measures to strengthen the gender focus and interculturality in the titling process.5 

C. Results matrix and key indicators 

1.28 The program has a results matrix (see Annex II) agreed upon with INRA; it shows 
impact, outcome, and output indicators with their respective baselines, targets, and 
means of verification. The program’s main outcomes are: (i) to regularize and title 
approximately 24.5 million hectares; (ii) to record property rights in the DDRR for 
approximately 1,340,000 parcels of small and medium-sized rural producers, 
benefiting approximately 490,000 families; (iii) to regularize and title the pending 
indigenous territories; (iv) to modernize the cadastral and registration information 
systems; and (v) to institutionally strengthen the Bolivian government in order to 
improve the environmental and social management of land. Over the long-term, 
the impact of the program will be reflected in increased agricultural income for 
small and medium-sized agricultural producers.

  In the final stage of the design of the Rural Land Regularization Program, the Ministry of the 

Environment and Water, the technical focal point for the Global Environment Facility (GEF), asked the 
IDB for an additional project to be financed by the GEF Fund to implement the environmental dimension 
of the rural cadastre in the amount of approximately US$6 million. This additional project will 
complement the activities envisaged in the program (ESMP).

II. FINANCING STRUCTURE AND MAIN RISKS 

A. Financing instruments 

2.1 The total cost of the program is US$100 million, which will be financed by the Bank 
through a blended loan as follows: US$51 million from Ordinary Capital funds and 
US$9 million from the Fund for Special Operations (FSO). The local counterpart is 
US$40 million. The distribution of the financing by source is shown in Table 4

B. Economic viability 

2.3 The ex ante economic analysis of the program uses a cost-benefit methodology. 
The analysis is based on the program’s expected incremental costs and benefits 
using a time horizon of 15 years and a discount rate of 12%. Program costs 
include investment, operation, and maintenance. The benefits stem from an 
estimate of marginal changes in agricultural income as a result of improvements in 
land tenure certainty and reduced processing time for registering property. Data 
from the 2008 Agricultural Survey, the 2013 Agricultural Census, and INRA titling 
databases were used to quantify the direct benefits associated with an 
improvement in the land tenure situation. The results indicate that the families that 
obtained title to their land increased their annual agricultural income by US$336 
and the gross value of agricultural production by US$216/household. Surveys and 
process analyses at both INRA and the DDRR office were used to estimate the 
benefits of reduced costs and processing time at the DDRR office. The results 
show benefits amounting to US$22.1 million due to a 16% reduction in processing 
times. The cost-benefit analysis indicates that the program has a positive net 
present value and an internal rate of return (IRR) of 51%. An analysis was done of 
the sensitivity to variations in the speed with which the benefits of titling were 
generated. In the worst case, in which the benefits increase gradually, the IRR is 
36%. The benefits of reduced processing time for registration exceed the expected 

http://idbdocs.iadb.org/wsdocs/getDocument.aspx?DOCNUM=40319553


- 11 - 

costs of maintaining the cadastre, which increases system sustainability by 
transferring these benefits to the users. 

C. Environmental and social risks 

2.4 This program has been classified as a Category B operation in accordance with 
the Bank’s Environment and Safeguards Compliance Policy (OP-703). During the 
preparation of the program a Strategic Environmental and Social Assessment 
(SESA) was developed; it determined that the program would have significant 
positive impacts and negative risks and impacts. The principal risks identified in the 
SESA were summarized in the program’s environmental and social management 
report (ESMR). They include: (i) failure to meet the indigenous peoples’ demand 
for titling due to conflicts already existing in the area of intervention; (ii) weakening 
of campesino communities’ organizations due to the demand for individual titling; 
(iii) maintenance of gender inequality in terms of access to and use of the land; 
(iv) exacerbation of existing social conflicts and creation of new conflicts due to 
land titling; and (v) loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services in lowlands due to 
the deforestation of titled properties. A program environmental and social 
management plan (ESMP) was developed to mitigate these risks and negative 
impacts. Table 6 summarizes the main risks and mitigation measures proposed in 
the ESMP. Thus, the requirements of the Bank’s safeguard policies have been 
fulfilled, especially those of the Indigenous Peoples Policy (OP-765). The ESMR 
presents compliance with the safeguards policies in detail (paragraph 3.18 of the 
ESMR). Lastly, consultation processes have been carried out, resulting in records 
of agreement with the program signed by the principal national organizations 
representing the program’s beneficiaries (paragraphs 3.22 and 3.23 of the ESMR). 

Table 6. Main Risks and Mitigation measures  

Problem and risks (ESMR) Main Mitigation Measures (ESMP) 

Problem: Remaining demand from indigenous 

people in lowlands consists of lands where 
third parties are present.  
Risk: Failure to provide titling for indigenous 

populations and potential fragmentation of 
their territories. 

(i) Participatory mechanisms will be implemented for the 
titling of the remaining areas; 
(ii) The extent to which the territorial demand of the 
indigenous populations is met will be evaluated; 
(iii) INRA will be trained to incorporate the intercultural 
approach in rural land titling activities.  

Problem: Parceling of collective lands in 

peasant communities. 
Risk: Weakening of community organizations. 

(i) Will contribute to making decisions that are appropriate 
for communities by providing information on the 
advantages and disadvantages of collective and individual 
titling. 

Problem: Gender inequality in access to and 

use of land. 
Risk: Continued gender inequality in access to 

and use of land through rural titling. 
 

(i) INRA’s Gender Unit will be strengthened; 
(ii) INRA will be trained to implement a gender approach 
in titling and registration; 
(iii) Women’s knowledge/exercise of their rights over the 
land will be promoted.  

Problem: Exacerbation of existing conflicts 

and emergence of new social conflicts; 
Risk: Delay in the regularization of property 

rights.  

(i) A comprehensive strategy for resolving disputes over 
rural land will be implemented; 
(ii) INRA staff will be trained in dispute resolution; 
(iii) Specialized dispute resolution brigades will be formed 
in INRA; 
(iv) The dispute resolution capacity of the Agri-
environmental Tribunal will be strengthened. 

Problem: Increased deforestation of titled 

properties; 
Risk: Loss of biodiversity and ecosystem 

services.  

(i) The national plant cover monitoring system will be 
strengthened; 
(ii) The environmental dimension of the rural cadastre will 
be developed; 
(iii) Soil use plans will be updated.

D. Fiduciary risks 

2.5 Based on the results of the institutional assessment, INRA has the institutional 
capacity needed to assume responsibilities as the executing agency for the 
proposed operation. The results indicate that programming and organizational 
capacity, execution capacity, and control capacity are at a satisfactory level of 
development and present a low level of risk. However, based on the risk analysis, 
some institutional weaknesses affecting the institution’s fiduciary capacity have 
been identified. Accordingly, an institutional development plan was drawn up to 
mitigate the risks identified. The main actions include: (i) contracting procurement 
and financing specialists to strengthen execution capacities; (ii) deepening and 
institutionalizing an operational framework for risk management; and 
(iii) developing a framework of internal procedures for accounting and cash flow, as 
well as updating internal administrative management documents. 

E. Other project risks 

2.6 The SESA has identified the risk that the presence of third parties with legitimate 
rights within the lowland TIOCs may become an obstacle for completing the titling 
of all the territory claimed by these TIOCs. This could turn into a reputational risk 
for the Bank. To mitigate this risk, Component 1 includes participatory titling 
mechanisms6 that involve the authorities of the TIOCs, to reach consensus on 
titling processes and results. In addition, the ESMP includes a diagnostic 
assessment of the extent to which the territorial demand of lowland indigenous 
peoples is met, as well as the formulation of new public policies in the event that 
this demand has not been addressed. An extensive process of consultation with 
the principal organizations representing those benefiting from and affected by land 
titling was carried out during the preparation of the program. These consultations 
have resulted in the signing of records of agreement with the program by the 
participants, beyond what is required for projects with the identified level of risk and 
impacts (see paragraphs 3.20 to 3.24 of the ESMR for more details on the 
consultations). 

2.7 As indicated earlier, the Bolivian government has been financially supporting the 
regularization of rural property for the last 20 years. The proposed program, with a 
total cost of US$100 million, will complete the work of regularizing rural lands 
throughout the country, involving 106 million hectares. Once the investment for 
regularizing rural properties is completed, long-term sustainability will depend on 
the ability of the key stakeholders to keep the information on rural properties up to 
date, both in the rural cadastre system (INRA) and in the Real Property Rights 
Registry (DDRR) system, as identified in the report on the legal framework for the 
regularization of rural property (Endo, 2016). The program seeks to improve, 
simplify, and reduce the costs of rural cadastre and property registration services, 
as well as to generate information on obligations and benefits so that owners will 
have incentives and will report to the official entities the existence of changes in 
property rights (through market transfers or inheritance) or through cadastral 
conservation processes (subdivisions or consolidations).

  The Interagency Titling Committees are the main mechanism of participation. The participants in these 

committees are the authorities of indigenous and campesino organizations and the representatives of 
the program’s beneficiaries. The role of the committee is to reach agreement with INRA on the work 
plans for the titling of beneficiary communities and TIOCs and to promote the beneficiary population’s 
participation in and monitoring of the execution of these plans. The role of the committees will be duly 
clarified in the program’s Operating Regulations.

III. IMPLEMENTATION AND MANAGEMENT PLAN 

A. Summary of implementation arrangements 

3.1 The borrower will be the Plurinational State of Bolivia and the executing agency will 
be INRA, legally established under Law 1,715/96 as a decentralized public entity of 
the MDRyT with national jurisdiction and legal status.  

3.2 INRA’s responsibilities as executing agency include: (i) maintaining consolidated 
accounting records that make it possible to identify the sources and uses of 
program funds by component; (ii) preparing and submitting disbursement requests 
and supporting documentation to the Bank, together with the financial statements 
for the components under its responsibility; (iii) contracting the program’s annual 
external audits and submitting the respective reports to the Bank; (iv) preparing 
open calls for proposals and bid processes, processing contracts and payments, 
and providing technical supervision of the contracts for activities under its 
responsibility; (v) preparing the consolidated monitoring and evaluation reports 
required, submitting them to the Bank, and making them publicly available; and 
(vi) ensuring compliance with the contractual clauses established in the loan 
contract, the program’s Operating Regulations, and the agreements signed for 
program implementation. A condition precedent to the first disbursement will 
be the signing of a subsidiary agreement between the Ministry of Economy 
and Public Finance, the Ministry of Development Planning, and INRA 
defining the following aspects among others: (i) the method to be used to 
transfer the loan proceeds to INRA; and (ii) INRA’s commitment to conduct 
program activities in accordance with the terms of the loan contract.  

3.3 Program execution will use INRA’s existing organizational structure, in both 
technical and fiduciary (procurement and finances) and legal matters. In this 
respect, the Planning Bureau (DGP) will be designated as the entity responsible for 
the general coordination of the program and the ESMP; the Regularization and 
Titling Bureau will be designated as the entity responsible for the execution of 
Component 1; the Land Management Bureau will be designated as the entity 
responsible for the execution of Component 2; and, lastly, the Administration and 
Finances Bureau will manage the program’s budget, procurement, legal analysis, 
and financial control. 

3.4 The Director of INRA’s DGP will serve as the general coordinator of the program 
with sufficient autonomy to make operational decisions, prepare all documents, 
program actions, and coordinate with the participating entities and the IDB. A 
condition precedent to the first disbursement will be the appointment of the 
Director of INRA’s DGP as the general coordinator of the program, 
appointment of the program component coordinators, in accordance with 
the terms previously agreed upon with the Bank, and the contracting of 
financial, procurement, planning, environmental management, and social 
management specialists through a competitive process, in accordance with 
the terms previously agreed upon with the Bank.  

3.5 During program preparation, provision was made for the signing of interagency 
collaboration agreements between INRA and the DDRR Office, the APMT, INE, 
and the ABT. These agreements will lay the foundation for cooperation among 
those involved and will describe the activities covered under the agreement, the 
parties’ commitments, including the operation and maintenance of investments, 



- 14 - 

and other conditions necessary for execution. Evidence of the signing and entry 
into force of the following interagency cooperation agreements: (i) between INRA 
and the DDRR, will be a special condition for the disbursement of financing for 
activities related to public registries under Component 2; (ii) between INRA, the 
ABT, the APMT, and the Office of the Deputy Minister for Land, will be a special 
condition for the disbursement of financing for activities related to the program’s 
ESMP under Component 2; and (iii) between INRA and INE, will be a special 
condition for the disbursement of financing for activities related to the baseline of 
the program’s monitoring and evaluation plan. 

3.6 To facilitate implementation of the ESMP, in the context of the program, INRA may 
provide cooperation and technical coordination to the relevant public institutions 
that assist in achieving the program’s objective. 

3.7 Program Operating Regulations. Execution of the program will be governed by 
the program’s Operating Regulations. These regulations establish guidelines and 
operational procedures related to: (i) the responsibilities of the entities participating 
in the program; (ii) operational procedures for the planning and programming of the 
activities to be financed; (iii) financial and procurement instructions; (iv) procedures 
for the program’s environmental and social management; and (v) operational 
instructions for the implementation of activities to monitor and evaluate the 
program’s impact. The entry into force of the program’s Operating 
Regulations, under terms previously agreed upon with the Bank, will be a 
contractual condition precedent to the first disbursement.  

3.8 Procurement. The procurement of works, goods, and consulting services funded 
with program resources will be carried out in accordance with the Bank’s policies 
as set forth in documents GN-2349-9 and GN-2350-9 and the provisions of the 
loan contract and the program’s Fiduciary Agreements and Requirements (see 
Annex III), including the procurement plan for the first 18 months. That plan 
includes the purchase of vehicles, operations and computer equipment, furniture, 
the contracting of individual consultants and consulting firms, and other items. In 
addition, the procurement plan includes the contracting of “service delivery 
contractors” corresponding to the staff engaged in the regularization and titling 
process (paragraph 1.25). The contracting procedures currently used by INRA for 
annual or multiyear periods will continue to be used for these individual 
consultants. The procurement plan will be updated each year or whenever there 
are substantial changes, subject to the Bank’s approval. Procurement may be 
made using the ex post review method as established in Annex II. 

3.9 Recognition of retroactive expenses. The Bank may recognize and charge 
against the local contribution up to US$6,000,000 (15% of the local contribution) in 
eligible expenses incurred by INRA prior to the loan approval date for operational 
and temporary staffing expenses, provided that requirements substantially similar 
to those established in the loan contract have been met. Said expenses must have 
been incurred on or after 6 January 2016, the program profile approval date, but in 
no case may they include expenses incurred more than 18 months prior to the loan 
approval date. 

3.10 Audit. During the loan disbursement period, within 120 days following the end of 
INRA’s fiscal year, the program’s annual audited financial statements will be 
submitted to the Bank. The audit will be performed by a firm of independent 
auditors acceptable to the Bank. The determination of the scope and other related 

http://idbdocs.iadb.org/wsdocs/getDocument.aspx?DOCNUM=40320765


- 15 - 

aspects will be governed by the Guide to Financial Management for Projects 
Financed by the IDB (OP-273-6) and the guide on financial statements and 
external audit.  

B. Summary of results monitoring arrangements 

3.11 Monitoring. The program has a monitoring and evaluation plan. INRA will prepare 
and send a monitoring report to the Bank no later than 60 days following the end of 
each six-month period during project execution. These reports will focus on the 
achievement of the output indicators and progress made in terms of outcomes, the 
identification of problems encountered and corrective measures adopted. INRA will 
submit to the Bank’s satisfaction the annual work plan (AWP) corresponding to the 
upcoming year, no later than within the final quarter of each year during project 
execution. INRA will perform two independent evaluations financed using loan 
proceeds: (i) the midterm evaluation will be submitted to the Bank no later than 
90 days after 50% of the loan proceeds have been executed; and (ii) the final 
evaluation will be conducted no later than 90 days after 90% of the project’s funds 
have been executed. These reports will include an evaluation of the quality of the 
data in the monitoring system, the degree to which the expected outputs, 
outcomes, and impacts established in the Results Matrix have been achieved, as 
well as the level of compliance with the ESMP, including progress made in the 
social and environmental indicators. 

3.12 Evaluation. The impact estimates will be based on the differences-in-differences 
method applied to a panel of households that includes a treatment group and two 
control groups. To this end, provision has been made for two surveys, a baseline 
and the final evaluation. The proposed sample includes the non-random 
identification of a group of municipios with a high percentage of titling in the first 
two years of the program. Later, through a propensity score matching process, a 
control group of municipios with a high percentage of titling prior to 2016 (control 
group 1) and another control group of municipios that will be titled at the end of the 
program (control group 2) will be identified. The municipios in control group 1 will 
serve to verify the proportion of attributable marginal change over time, while the 
municipios in control group 2 will be used to measure the program’s impact in the 
execution period. The sample for the baseline study is estimated to include 3,500 
farmers distributed in 50 municipios (20 treated and 30 in the two control groups; 
households will be selected at random within each municipio). A similar sample will 
be used for the final evaluation. The data collection budget has been included in 
the project. The design of the operation provides a good opportunity for generating 
empirical evidence on the impact of rural land titling on productivity, income, and 
the sustainable use of natural resources.

I. DESCRIPTION AND RESULTS MONITORING 

A. Background, problem addressed, and rationale 

 Recent context on the development of the agricultural sector in Argentina  

1.1 In Argentina, the agrifood sector accounts for around 10% of gross domestic product 
(GDP), and 20% of GDP including the agroindustry sector. The sector generates 
65% of total exports (US$35 billion) and 36% of employment. The country’s Pampa 
region1 generates 90% of agricultural production by value and 80% of the sector’s 
exports. The non-Pampa agriculture sector accounts for around 65% of agricultural 
exploitation, generates 20% of total production, and provides 54% of all rural jobs to 
220,000 rural families, the majority of them without their own capital (INDEC, 
Gallacher, and Lema, 2014).  

1.2 Over the last 10 years, Argentina’s agricultural sector passed through three distinct 
periods of sector and macroeconomic context that significantly affected its structure 
and performance. Between 2006 and 2012, the strong growth of the sector’s grain 
exports stood out, a result mainly of high demand from Asian countries and the 
agricultural capacity of the Pampa to meet growing international demand. Six 
products accounted for 65% of all exports, with a significant contribution from the 
soy chain and with export destinations highly concentrated: 82% of the soy was 
exported to China and 60% of the wheat to Brazil. For agricultural products, 30% is 
exported without any processing, and only 54% of agribusiness exports are products 
with basic processing (soy oil and flour). Although the expansion of soy was 
concentrated in the Pampa provinces, growing areas have also expanded to other 
regions, causing changes in land use and replacement of traditional crops (Anlló, 
Bisang, and Salvatierra, 2010).  

1.3 A second contextual period from 2012 to 2015 was characterized by the application 
of policies resulting in strong macroeconomic distortions: taxes and quantitative 
restrictions on agricultural exports (grains mainly), foreign-exchange controls and 
differentiated exchange rates, import controls, price controls, and targeted 
subsidies. Estimates from the IDB Agrimonitor (2014) show that from 2007 to 2012, 
producers generated net transfers to the public purse (via tax collection) and to 
consumers (through lower prices) that averaged US$11 billion annually, accounting 
for more than 30% of the value of the sector’s production. This policy framework 
caused productive and export activity in general to stall, but particularly impacted the 
non-Pampa regional economies, since as described in the following section, these 
regions face significant development gaps, forcing them to compete with greater 
disadvantages (Gallacher and Lema, 2014). 

1.4 A third period of context began with the change of government in December 2015, 
one of whose first measures was to eliminate the macroeconomic and sector policy 
distortions (Argentina, Country Development Challenge 2016 – CDC). Along these 
lines, restrictions on corn and wheat were eliminated and restrictions on soy were 
reduced; the exchange rate was free floated and foreign exchange restrictions were 
removed, as were administrative price and import controls. The new government 
seeks to reposition Argentine agriculture to make it competitive in external markets, 

                                                
1  Argentina’s provinces are grouped into the following five broad geographic regions: (i) Pampa region; 

(ii) Northeast region (NEA); (iii) Northwest region (NWA); (iv) Cuyo Region; and (v) Patagonia region.

incentivize private investment in cutting-edge technology, and focus attention on 
structural shortcomings and development gaps that affect the sector, particularly in 
the more vulnerable regional economies that have fallen behind in terms of social 
and economic development (Belgrano Plan). 

 Gaps in regional development and priorities for competitiveness and 
developing rural regional economies  

1.5 Development gaps in regional economies, particularly the Norte Grande (NG) 
provinces, are notable. The per capita GDP in the NG is 47.5% of that of the nation 
as a whole. With 20.7% of the total population, the NG only generates 9.8% of the 
country’s GDP and exports around 10% of the national total. (Meloni, 2012; 
Argentina CDC). In a study on production and technology gaps for the agricultural 
sector, Cuervo (2016) tracks the Global Yield Gap in Agriculture. The index 
measures the production gap based on maximum achievable yield and actual yield 
(farm yield) for national-scale field crops. The production gap shows low relative 
levels of technical efficiency: 41.5% for corn, followed by wheat with 41% and soy 
with 31.7%. Measured as “yield” differences in the production of national field crops 
(cereals and oilseeds) for the 2011-2014 period, the productive gap figures show 
that the NG’s technical efficiency index in corn is 62% that of the humid Pampa area, 
while for soy it is 82%, for wheat it is only 53%, sorghum stands at 62%, and 
sunflower at 74%. 

1.6 A number of factors affect the regional gaps in technology and development for 
Argentina’s rural regional economies, with the following generally standing out: (i) a 
deficit in production infrastructure, particularly irrigation, connectivity, and rural 
logistics infrastructure, as well as dependable access to energy sources; (ii) climate 
change and its implications for water availability for high quality and high volume 
agricultural production; (iii) deficits in services for improving competitiveness and 
value added, restricting productivity and innovation; and (iv) institutional, 
governance, and social participation weaknesses, both public and within private 
organizations and associations of small and medium-sized rural producers. (Lema, 
2010; Lissi and Losi, 2010; Leyva, 2016; Bisang, Campi, and Aniló, 2013). These 
factors are described below. 

1.7 Productive infrastructure: Irrigation. According to the 2014 National Irrigation 
Plan and the study “Potencial de Ampliación del Riego en la Argentina,” [Potential 
for Expanding Irrigation in Argentina, United Nations Food and Agriculture 
Organization (FAO), PROSAP, World Bank, 2015], Argentina has a little more than 
2 million hectares of irrigated land, with potential to expand that to around 6 million 
hectares.2 The non-Pampa regions are the most dependent on this infrastructure for 
agricultural development. Half of all irrigated land is in dry regions with annual 
precipitation of less than 500 mm (e.g. the Andean areas of Jujuy, Salta, Tucumán, 
Catamarca, La Rioja, San Juan, and Mendoza), while 20% is in the semi-dry central 
and northern regions, with between 600 mm and 800 mm of rain during the summer. 
The water stress situation in these regions is worsening due to the effects of climate 
change and more intense drought periods. Irrigation accounts for 70% of total water 
consumption in Argentina, and 75% of the water used for this purpose comes from 

                                                
2  Including expansion over existing areas, new areas, and complementary irrigation.

surface sources, generally reservoirs created by dams and river diversion, with the 
other 25% coming from aquifers through individual wells. 

1.8 The four irrigation systems identified by the program have low efficiency (60%) as a 
result of: (i) main canals that are not lined (75%); (ii) secondary canals that are not 
lined (80%); and (iii) little use of pressurized irrigation systems (25% of farmers). The 
records and technical evaluations of the systems rehabilitated by PROSAP show 
that it is possible to increase initial efficiency levels from 60% to over 90% in terms 
of water loss reduction. Also, in terms of technology, at the level of the individual 
farm, the use of inefficient irrigation technology is still prevalent (e.g. surface 
irrigation) partly due to limited management capacity and knowledge, but also 
because of the property investment costs. The improved gravity systems have an 
average cost of US$398/hectare, but with objective efficiency of 65%, while 
pressurized irrigation systems (micro spray, drip, pivot) that achieve efficiency of 
80% to 90%, cost between US$2,600/hectare and US$4,000/hectare 
(FAO-PROSAP).  

1.9 The PROSAP interventions address the investment niche needed to rehabilitate 
existing systems and expand irrigated areas in provinces with a high degree of water 
stress, while targeting the needs of small and medium-sized producers. In the NG, 
investments have been identified of around US$3.6 billion that would make it 
possible to increase arable land by between 22% and 50% (approximately 320,000 
hectares). In any case, the success of irrigation interventions requires ensuring 
proper coordination between three areas: (i) institutional and legal, including 
regulatory frameworks, land titling and registration, institution-strengthening, and 
development of financially-autonomous user organizations; (ii) economic, including 
accessible financing instruments, viable public-private partnership models, 
affordable water fees and prices, and tax incentives; and (iii) technical, for dealing 
with cutting-edge engineering and technology, modern water information systems, 
and environmental studies. Investments in irrigation infrastructure financed by 
PROSAP have included actions in these three areas and contributed to improving 
productivity in the intervention areas (see paragraphs 1.19, 1.20, and 1.21).  

1.10 Productive infrastructure: Rural roads and rural energy. Of the total volume of 
cargo transported, 95% is moved over the country’s road network. Annual average 
daily traffic has been increasing, but not evenly across all regions, with significant 
imbalances for cargo traffic (Agosta, R. 2010). For rural economies in the non-
Pampa provinces, the poor condition of secondary and tertiary roads results in: 
(i) high transportation and logistical costs; and (ii) poor accessibility to large 
expanses of territory. For example, the project for secondary route RT13 in 
Corrientes province shows that the route is closed on average more than 80 days 
out of the year. RT13 is 163 km, unpaved and without drainage. In the rainy season, 
70 km of it (43%) is impassable. This worsens the competitiveness of non-Pampa 
rural areas considering that for the main exportable grains and oilseeds, logistical 
costs of transportation to the ports or mill account for 30% of the price for NEA and 
NWA producers (IDEA. FIEL, 2009). Likewise, regarding the rural public energy 
infrastructure, significant gaps and coverage needs are evident. Nationally, more 
than 60% of rural homes do not have access to electricity, with the farms furthest 
from the grid’s main lines being the most affected (Mendoza, 2016).

1.11 Climate change challenges. Given the fundamental role that Argentina plays in 

global food security, addressing extreme events resulting from climate change is of 
vital importance considering their impact on agricultural activity and the production 
and provision of food. Agricultural and livestock activity are estimated to contribute 
28% of the country’s total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, for which reason these 
sectors are a central focus for the government as it complies with its goal of reducing 
GHG emissions by 15% by 2030, as established in its intended nationally 
determined contribution (INDC) under the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change.  

1.12 According to Argentina’s Second National Message on Climate Change, there is 
evidence that the effects of climate change have contributed to glacier melt in the 
Andes Mountains, increasing desertification, and an increased recurrence in forest 
fires over the last 10 years. From the perspective of impact on agriculture, the most 
severe effects manifest themselves through water stress and water availability for 
production, particularly in the areas of Cuyo, NEA, and NWA where PROSAP is 
engaged (Argentina: Second National Message; ECLAC 2012; Ludeña, Wilk, and 
Quiroga).  

1.13 The Cuyo region has been under a water emergency during 7 of the last 10 years, 
and the trend toward declining availability of water directly impacts availability of the 
irrigation needed to maintain the current levels of irrigation-dependent wine and fruit 
production (Brown, 2015). According to a study entitled “The Economics of Climate 
Change in Argentina” (ECLAC, 2014), if adaptation measures are not taken, climate 
change-related productivity losses could reach 17% of the national agriculture 
sector’s value added, along with drops in yield of between 11% and 16% for wheat, 
15% and 24% for corn, and 14% and 25% for soy. In terms of its effect on irrigation, 
in a study of Argentina’s irrigation potential, the FAO reports potential climate 
change-related productivity losses in areas under irrigation equivalent to the loss of 
325,000 hectares, or production value of US$900 million.

1.14 Competitiveness services gaps. Integration of agricultural producers into clusters 
and value chains is necessary for regional economies to take off. The diagnosis of 
Argentina’s CDC indicates that the lower competitiveness of the non-Pampa 
agricultural systems can be partly attributed to the lower degree of sophistication of 
scientific-technological-educational subsystems and of management in general, as 
well as their poor links to agricultural technology supply companies. Along these 
lines, Martin, Mayer, and Mayneris (2008) find that the benefits of increased sector 
clustering are positive and highly significant, although to be effective it requires 
strengthened institutions. Likewise, using company-level data, Long and Zhang 
(2011) show that China’s rapid industrialization is characterized by the growing 
formation of clusters. They find that the clusters help overcome the credit restrictions 
that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) face. Scalice (2016) finds in an 
analysis of nine agrifood supply chains in Argentina’s NG that more than 80% of 
small producers of are not part of a value chain, nor do they have access to financial 
services. The author also identifies a number of limitations to developing competitive 
chains and clusters, including: (i) low product quality; (ii) limited access to capital; 
(iii) lack of economies of scale; (iv) weak organizational capacity; and (v) limited 
capacity to innovate. Regarding access to capital, Sanguinetti (2011) identifies 
access to financial services as one of the main restrictions faced by rural areas of 
regional economies, and Lapelle (2007) finds that more than 80% of SMEs in 
regional economies are self-financing. 

1.15 Weaknesses in institutions, governance, and social participation. The various 
provinces are distinctly heterogeneous in terms of their institutional capacities. The 
provinces in the NWA and NEA have institutional quality gaps averaging -2.3 
and -1.2, respectively This means that, compared to the national average, these 
regions are being left behind. (Villalobos, 2015, CDC Argentina). In terms of social 
participation, which is an integral part of governance, unequal access for and 
participation by women is a key weakness. The URC report entitled “Las nuevas 
generaciones de mujeres rurales como promotoras de cambio (2015)” [New 
generations of rural women as agents of change] conducts a quantitative and 
qualitative analysis of the needs of and opportunities for young rural women. This 
study provides evidence of the relatively low impact of participation among women 
in rural areas, although regional differences are noteworthy (between 5% and 20%), 
and for young women facing a series of disadvantages that intensify in remote rural 
areas, the differences are related to difficulties participating in the labor market while 
caring for members of the household. PROSAP project design has found that only 
5% of the beneficiaries of training or technical assistance are women, and only 
between 0.3% and 3% of land owners in irrigator organizations are women.  

 Progress and outcomes of PROSAP loans from the CLIPP 

1.16 The national government implemented PROSAP in the mid-1990s to support 
agricultural development in the rural economies of the non-Pampa provinces. The 
implementation of this program was mainly focused on the construction of rural 
public works. PROSAP’s first phase was financed by the Bank through operation 
899/OC-AR. Based on that program’s outcomes, in 2008, the Government of 
Argentina requested a CCLIP (AR-X1006) for US$600 million. The CCLIP began 
with operation 1956/OC-AR (PROSAP II), execution of which completed in 2014.

The second operation, 2573/OC-AR (PROSAP III) was approved in 2011. Its level 
of execution is 90%, and it is set for closure in March 2017. Project completion 
reports (PCR) for loans 899/OC-AR and 1956/OC-AR, as well as the midterm 
evaluation for 2573/OC-AR, describe in detail the outputs and outcomes achieved, 
as well as the lessons learned in each operation. The following table summarizes 
the scope and main outputs of the PROSAP operations.

1.17 The types of outputs that have been generated from PROSAP I to PROSAP III 
reflect the evolution of the interventions from an approach predominately aimed at 
physical infrastructure to interventions that are more balanced with technical 
assistance and soft components on management and market development. The 
PCRs for the completed PROSAP projects show that they have achieved the direct 
outcomes and effects expected, including: (i) productive overhaul of irrigation 
projects, with increases in surface area irrigated, better water availability and quality 
throughout the year for irrigators, and improved irrigation efficiency; (ii) improved 
productivity at the level of individual farms for specific crops; (iii) irrigator 
organizations strengthened and taking over the operation, maintenance, and 
financial management of their systems; (iv) the rural roads that were financed are 
usable year-round; and (v) development and consolidation of clusters that have 
been able to diversify into and/or export processed products for the first time. An 
ex post economic assessment of the Canal del Norte and 25 de Mayo, San Juan 
rehabilitation projects and the project to improve rural roads in productive areas in 
Entre Ríos, Zone VII, based on surveys conducted upon project completion shows 
that both projects achieved economic benefits demonstrating their economic return, 
with economic internal rates of return (EIRR) of 21.1% and 19.4%, respectively.  

1.18 Other noteworthy outcomes of PROSAP are institutional and strategic. Among them, 
PROSAP has provided the Ministry of Agroindustry with a land management 
operating model that enables it to strengthen and leverage programs with greater 
scope and coverage in the provinces as part of its provincial strategies for the 
agrifood sector (PSAS) and its development and competitiveness improvement 
plans (DCIP). Among other outcomes, this has enabled the strengthening of an

environmental and social area that enables it to move forward on these issues 
proactively, incorporating the inclusion of the gender dimension in rural 
development, as well as addressing climate change, resulting in the Ministry 
qualifying as an executing agency for the Climate Change Adaptation Fund.  

1.19 PROSAP impact evaluations. During the design of PROSAP I and PROSAP II, 
impact evaluations were not performed for experimental designs. Recently, 
PROSAP III has incorporated a methodology for evaluating the impact of quasi-
experimental designs that will enable analysis of how outcomes are attributed to the 
program’s investments. These evaluations will be conducted once PROSAP III ends 
in 2017. However, some partial and complimentary impact evaluations have been 
conducted using data generated by PROSAP projects, as described below. 

1.20 Using quasi-experimental methodologies, Gibbons, Maffioli, and Rossi (2016) and 
Rossi (2016) evaluated the impact of the PROSAP component providing improved 
irrigation channels in the provinces of Mendoza and San Juan. These studies 
conclude that PROSAP had positive impacts on both production and per-hectare 
productivity, showing that producers who participate in the program produce 9.4% 
more than nonparticipants, with per-hectare yields higher by 7%. 

1.21 Lastly, the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture conducted a study 
entitled The Territorial Impact of Public Policies: The case of PROSAP (2016), which 
evaluated the outcomes of PROSAP I projects from 1998 to 2010. The study applied 
a synthetic methodology by comparing administrative data from departments that 
had PROSAP interventions with data from departments that did not. The study finds 
that out of all the departments, those with PROSAP projects had better development 
results in each of the dimensions analyzed and in the total synthetic index. The 
degree of overall development of the departments without PROSAP was almost 
37%, while for those benefiting from PROSAP it was almost 50%. 

 Lessons learned for PROSAP IV design and compliance with CCLIP 
requirements 

1.22 The main lessons learned from the execution of PROSAP II and III were taken into 
account when preparing this operation and formed the basis for the inclusion of 
certain adjustments. The following table provides a summary of these lessons. 

 
Table 3. Lessons learned and adjustment measures for PROSAP IV 

Lesson learned Agreed measures 

Institutional consolidation. The creation of a 

comprehensive strategic coordination 
structure, with the same functions as the URC, 
has been the basis for better PROSAP project 
performance  

The Ministry of Agroindustry has decided to 
maintain the URC’s functional structure and 
has launched a process to consolidate it 
internally as a specialized agency for 
coordinating investment with external funding. 

Coordination of public interventions in the 
field. Prioritizing projects in the framework of 

the PSASs, which were introduced starting 
with PROSAP II, has enabled participatory 
processes that offer better coordination and 
strategic synergy with a variety of initiatives, 
expanding the area of impact.  

The proposal is to strengthen and consolidate 
these processes for territory and microregion 
management in the framework of the PSAS so 
as to achieve synergies among PROSAP 
projects and other URC projects, in addition to 
better coordinating the intervention of other 
public policy instruments in the same areas.

Table 3. Lessons learned and adjustment measures for PROSAP IV 

Lesson learned Agreed measures 

Priority on investment in public goods, 
complemented by direct support that is 
intelligent and well targeted on producers. 

The initial focus of the first PROSAP on 
building public works demonstrated the need 
for supporting small and medium-sized 
producers with technical assistance and NRC 
for in-field improvements and development of 
new products. The evaluations conducted, 
including those of the Office of Evaluation and 
Oversight (OVE), found that the instrument 
had positive outcomes, but that it was 
necessary to ensure that the NRCs were 
applied with stricter diagnostic, eligibility, real 
market failure justification, measurement, and 
variability criteria.  

The Technology Modernization Fund, which 
includes NRC, has been redesigned based on 
the standards established in the recent 
Agriculture and Natural Resources 
Management Sector Framework Document: 
(i) focus on technological support for mitigation 
of and adaptation to climate change and 
environmental sustainability; (ii) eligibility of 
small producers lacking access to credit and 
associations organized to establish new local 
networks and value added in new markets; 
(iii) technical assistance to promote the 
participation of the banking sector in financing 
the sector’s technological modernization, in 
coordination with private sector operations; 
and (iv) transient nature of the support and 
transparent, flexible, and evaluable 
mechanisms for granting it.  

Minor infrastructure works for rural 
development. During PROSAP III, a pilot 

program of minor works intended to meet the 
local production needs of small producers was 
piloted successfully. These works, which are 
prioritized in the PSAS, saw high ownership 
and participation levels among producers. 

The minor works component is continued in a 
reinforced context of PSAS interventions in 
priority microregions, along with technical 
assistance for local organizations to ensure 
the works’ sustainability. 

 

1.23 Eligibility of the operation under the CCLIP. Compliance with the eligibility 
conditions for a new individual operation under CCLIP AR-X1006 of 17 April 2008 
has been verified: (i) the program is framed within the sectors and components 
defined under the CCLIP; (ii) its objectives are related to the Bank’s country strategy, 
and it is included in the country program; (iii) the aforementioned agreement 
stipulated that the executing agency would be the same for all the individual loans 
under the line, which is the case given that the URC will continue to be in charge of 
execution; (iv) the outcomes obtained by the URC in these two individual operations 
are satisfactory and have been supported by the corresponding performance 
evaluations for PROSAP II and PROSAP III, meaning the project team and national 
authorities can expect the new proposed program will perform satisfactorily; 
(v) regarding the financial execution of PROSAP III, under execution, 84% of the 
loan proceeds have been committed, while 94% of the proceeds have been 
disbursed; and (vi) the borrower and executing agency have fulfilled the conditions 
of the loan contract and the Bank’s policies on disbursements and procurement of 
goods and services, including updated financial statements.3 

 Design of PROSAP IV  

1.24 As the third individual operation under CCLIP AR-X1006, PROSAP IV has the same 
design as the first two operations. Specifically, PROSAP IV is designed to bolster 

                                                
3  The most recent report including audited financial statements includes a minor qualification that does not 

affect the reasonableness thereof. This minor qualification refers to a debt observed by the Office of the 
National Auditor General between contractors and the provinces of Mendoza, Entre Ríos, and Catamarca, 
set forth in a note to the financial statements, representing an integral part thereof.

local production systems via the strengthening of critical local assets (public goods: 
the economic infrastructure—irrigation, transportation, energy, social capital—
business culture; quality of regional associations and business networks) and 
improve the effectiveness of the intergovernmental framework. These actions 
contribute to improving the efficiency of local production systems by creating positive 
externalities through clustering and by resolving market and coordination failures. 

1.25 In particular, PROSAP IV will strengthen local development mechanisms, bolstering 
public-private partnerships in order to increase the competitiveness of producers 
and their associations. Also, the following specific objectives will be consolidated 
and strengthened: (i) internalization of measures for adapting to climate change with 
special emphasis on managing water resources and implementing climate-smart 
irrigation systems; (ii) the comprehensive incorporation of the gender dimension in 
the program through implementation of specific gender action plans for each 
provincial public investment project that include gender diagnostics, training, 
technical assistance, access to available funds, and monitoring of indicators; and 
(iii) consolidation of mechanisms for measuring outcomes and impacts.  

1.26 Strategic alignment with the Update to the Institutional Strategy (UIS) 
2010-2020, and the Corporate Results Framework (CRF) 2016-2019. The 
program is consistent with UIS 2010-2020 (document AB-3008) and strategically 
aligned with the development challenges of productivity and innovation through 
investments in productive public infrastructure and technical assistance that will 
enable increases in the productivity of rural producers in the program’s work areas. 
The program is also in line with the crosscutting issue of climate change and 
environmental sustainability through improved use of water and land via investments 
in irrigation technology. A full 100% of the proceeds of the operation are invested in 
climate change adaptation activities, according to the as climate financing for 
adaptation to climate change according to the multilateral development banks’ joint 
methodology for tracking climate finance. These resources contribute to the IDB 
Group target of increasing financing for projects related to climate change to 30% of 
all operation approvals through 2020. The program provides additionality in terms of 
gender equality through specific activities for promoting the participation of women 
in the training provided by the program through gender action plans. In addition, the 
program will contribute to the goals of CRF 2016-2019 (document GN-2727-6) via 
the indicator of the number of beneficiaries that improve their management and use 
of natural resources. 

1.27 Alignment with the IDB country strategy. The operation is aligned with the IDB 
Country Strategy with Argentina 2012-2015 (document GN-2687), in particular with 
the priority area “Alleviating Obstacles to Growth” in the area of rural and agricultural 
development, the objectives of which include supporting investment programs in 
basic rural infrastructure in regional economies. It is also aligned with the priorities 
of the new Country Strategy with Argentina (2016-2019), which is in the approval 
process as of the distribution date of this loan proposal, in particular with the 
following strategic areas: (i) business climate improvement by fostering 
environmentally sustainable solutions; and (ii) strengthening of private-sector 
integration and insertion into value chains by developing public goods for innovation 
and cluster development.

B. Objectives, components, and cost 

1.28 The objective of the CCLIP is to contribute to the competitiveness and development 
of regional rural economies through the execution of individual programs consistent 
with this purpose. Specifically, the third individual operation proposed herein seeks 
improvements to productivity and an increase in sales and value-added for small 
and medium-sized agricultural producers, with a focus on strengthening resilience 
to climate change. The program is structured in two main components. 

1.29 Component 1: Investment to support competitiveness (loan amount: 
US$80.2 million). This component includes: (i) a subcomponent for strengthening 
public infrastructure of major works aimed at increasing the coverage and quality of 
rural infrastructure in the provinces by executing the public investment projects 
prioritized in the PSAS. Investments include the rehabilitation of irrigation and 
drainage systems, forest fire prevention, and tertiary roads in climactically vulnerable 
areas with a focus on adaptation and resilience, and (ii) a subcomponent for minor 
infrastructure works for building, overhauling, or expanding public works and 
community improvements. All investments include financing for the technical 
assistance and training necessary for execution, use, and maintenance of the works 
and for strengthening local governance and the provincial and municipal agencies 
that manage water resources for irrigation while managing the promotion of 
participation by women. The objective of all the works and activities under this 
component is to support adaptation of the agricultural productive activity to scenarios 
and conditions of climactic vulnerability, with technical designs that take those 
scenarios into account in the long-term.  

1.30 The major infrastructure works to be financed whose final technical, economic, 
social, climactic, and environmental designs are in place are the following:

improvement project in Colalao del Valle, Tucumán; (iii) water system improvement 
project in Angulos, La Rioja; (iv) improvements to the irrigation infrastructure of the 
water system in Figueroa, Santiago del Estero; and (v) micro reservoirs in the Cano 
River basin, Córdoba.  

1.32 Component 2: Support services for competitiveness (loan amount: 
US$14.4 million). This component finances technical assistance and business 
plans aimed at strengthening the competitiveness and value-added of agricultural 
products in regional economies, with a priority on complementing the major and 
minor works projects of Component 1. The criteria for prioritizing and selecting 
business plans and technical assistance activities is detailed in the program 
Operating Regulations and the technical annexes for each of the three instruments, 
with technical, economic, financial, institutional, social, and environmental feasibility 
being a priority prerequisite: (i) Technology modernization fund, which uses NRCs 
to cofinance in-field  and partnership-building projects that contribute to closing 
technological gaps, bolstering value added at origin; and promoting environmentally 
sustainable practices and climate smart agriculture (CSA) to address the challenges 
of climate change. The focus of the fund is generating positive externalities and 
seeking synergies with private initiatives that promote producer access to formal 
banking and its financial product lines, including access to green financing;4 
(ii) Territorial development initiatives for financing development projects and 
consolidating agrifood clusters that are formulated and prioritized in the participatory 
framework of the DCIPs, which bring together public/private actors with 
scientific/technology actors and producers in the provinces. These projects finance 
technical assistance activities, generating knowledge and cutting edge technology 
that benefit the cluster and the regions where they are developed; (iii) Institutional 
strengthening and preinvestment, providing underlying and crosscutting support for 
technical assistance and training activities to improve management in provincial 
institutions, including raising awareness on climate change and improving capacities 
to identify, prepare, and monitor public investment projects. 

1.33 The program’s beneficiary provinces are the non-Pampa provinces, which will be 
prioritized based on the criteria set forth in the program’s Operating Regulations, 
including: (i) relative degree to which they lag behind; (ii) vulnerability to climate 
change; (iii) provincial sector strategies with a time horizon of at least 10 years; 
(iv) provincial association in place with adequate human and technical resources; 
and (v) due authorizations in place for the province to take on debt in order to accept 
PROSAP resources. The projects are chosen through a planning process consistent 
with the priorities of Argentina’s CDCs and the diagnostics performed. The program 
Operating Regulations defines project eligibility criteria, considering the different 
decision levels, type of project, criteria for analysis, and the project cycle from 
identification and preparation through to approval and execution.  

1.34 Program coordination, monitoring, and evaluation will also be financed. 
Under this item, support will be provided for the strengthening, operation, and 
maintenance of the project monitoring and evaluation system; the URC’s 
incremental operating expenses; the preparation of studies, including impact 

                                                
4  MIF project AR-T1170 includes financing technology packages for small producers and their cooperatives 

through a new line of credit between the Fund and Banco Credicoop. As part of the actions to integrate the 
IDB Group, once the MIF operation is approved, the proposal is to offer PROSAP producers this line of credit.

evaluations, progress reports, and audit reports; and environmental and social 
monitoring. 

C. Key results indicators  

1.35 The program has a Results Matrix agreed upon with the executing agency 
(Annex II). It includes indicators for impact, as well as outcomes and outputs, with 
their corresponding baseline values, targets, and means of verification. The main 
outputs include 31,638 hectares under irrigation, 71 km of main irrigation channels; 
and 44 km of rural roads. The main outcomes expected from the sample projects 
are described in Table 5. The program is expected to directly benefit 18,200 rural 
producers in six provinces. Over the long term, the program’s impact will be reflected 
in higher gross value of the production of rural producers and lower losses from 
drought associated with climate change.

1.36 Economic viability of the program. Overall analysis of the program yields an 
average weighted EIRR of 20.6% for a time horizon of 20 years. The benefits include 
marginal changes to productivity and increases in the area under irrigation. The 
costs include the total investment in the program, opportunity costs for training the 
farmers; operation and maintenance; and additional investment on the plot (see 
Annex). At a discount rate of 12%, overall net present value (NPV) is 
US$77.7 million. The sensitivity analysis considered: (i) modification of investment 
costs; (ii) changes in crop yields; (iii) changes in the costs of investment 
sustainability; (iv) delays in benefit realization; and (v) technology adoption rates. 
For a 30% increase in costs, the NPV is US$52.3 million, and the EIRR is 16.9%. 
For a three-year delay in benefit realization, the NPV is US$77.7 million and EIRR 
is 17.1%. For an adoption rate of 70%, the EIRR is 15.5%, with NPV of 
US$28.3 million.

B. Environmental and social risks 

2.3 In accordance with the Environment and Safeguards Compliance Policy 
(Operational Policy OP-703), and pursuant to the applied safeguards forms, this 
program has been classified as a category “B” operation. This program is designed 
to promote better management of natural resources related to agricultural production 
and improve producers’ climate resilience and adaptation. Irrigation projects 

                                                
5  Total financing of the CCLIP (AR-X1006) was set at US$600 million, of which US$200 million were executed 

under the first operation (1956/OC-AR) and US$230 million were allocated to the second operation 
(2573/OC-AR), leaving US$170 million available. In the context of programming loans with the Bank for 2016, 
the government has decided to allocate US$100 million to the financing of this third operation, leaving a 
remainder of US$70 million. No additional operations are expected.

internalize measures for adapting to hydrometeorological and climate change risks 
(e.g., expanding drainage for rural roads, reviewing hydrological series for irrigation 
works), as well as elements of sustainability and water use efficiency. Another 
benefit is climate change mitigation through the project to improve rural roads in 
Corrientes by reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 69.9 tons of CO2 equivalent 
thanks to reductions in fuel consumption, or an emissions cut of 43.2% from the 
scenario without the project. 

2.4 The execution of the PROSAP program is governed by the program Operating 
Regulations and the respective Environmental and Social Manual (ESM), with 
updated guides for environmental and social evaluation, including involuntary 
resettlement and mitigation and control procedures, as well as public consultation 
and monitoring and evaluation. In line with directive B.14 of Operational Policy 
OP-703, during preparation, an independent socioenvironmental review of the 
execution of PROSAP III was conducted. It found that the executing agencies had 
improved their socioenvironmental management capacity, and no 
socioenvironmental liabilities were identified. 

2.5 All of the infrastructure projects have socioenvironmental impact studies and 
environmental and social management plans that comply with IDB policies. The 
program Operating Regulations and ESM were reviewed mainly to incorporate 
gender equality opportunities and actions to prevent and adapt to the risks from 
disasters and climate change. Also, monitoring measures were strengthened by 
defining evaluation and monitoring indicators. Where applicable, projects include 
plans to ensure that indigenous peoples share in the projects’ benefits, in keeping 
with Operational Policy OP-765. Plans are also in place to address effects on assets, 
in keeping with Operational Policy OP-710. Likewise, all the projects include plans 
for pest management in their training and assistance programs, as well as plans for 
taking action on gender with a view toward increasing the participation of women in 
training programs, technical assistance, and other services, consistent with 
Operational Policy OP-761 of the Bank. 

2.6 Participatory consultative meetings were held in the areas to benefit from the 
projects as part of the design process. Prior to the Bank’s no objection for contracting 
the works, where necessary, the provinces will submit the pertinent environmental 
permits granted by the corresponding authorities. As established in the program 
Operating Regulations, prior to issuing the public tender for the works, the URC will 
present evidence to the Bank that it has obtained those permits. The environmental 
and social studies are available for consultation at the URC/PROSAP and Bank 
websites. The environmental and social management report (ESMR) summarizes 
the outcomes of and recommendations for environmental and social management 
to ensure the operation’s environmental and social sustainability. The borrower 
agrees to carry out—through the executing agency—the program activities in 
accordance with the environmental and social standards and recommendations 
included in the program Operating Regulations, including its ESM and the program’s 
environmental and social management plan (ESMP). The special contractual 
conditions on environmental and social management are detailed in paragraph 6.4 
of the ESMR.

C. Fiduciary risks  

2.7 The main fiduciary risks identified are associated with processes of interaction 
between the national and provincial levels, which are often complex. These risks 
include: (i) delays in procurement processes; (ii) delays in the submission of 
AWPs/procurement plans by the provinces and deficient quality thereof; and 
(iii) delays in providing accounting information to the Bank. Experience with 
execution has demonstrated that these risks are medium, that the executing agency 
has adequate execution capacity, and that the executing agency has been able to 
manage the aforementioned risks effectively in previous operations. The following 
were agreed upon as the main mitigation measures: (i) quarterly update and 
management of the procurement plan; (ii) implementation of Subcomponent 2.3: 
Provincial Institution Strengthening; and (iii) permanent 65% flexibility for justification 
of expenses for disbursement of advances of funds (see Annex III). 

D. Other project risks and special issues  

2.8 An inherent risk involved in rural infrastructure works is weak commitment by 
beneficiaries to operating and maintaining the infrastructure works. The main 
mitigation measure for this comes in the framework of participatory processes for 
local empowerment, as well as the implementation of training and technical 
assistance programs. Also, the risks associated with changes to the national and 
provincial government are: weak interagency coordination between the program’s 
executing agencies, as well as scattered and uncoordinated implementation of 
external financing for agricultural projects The main mitigation measure is thus the 
implementation of targeted training plans for the provincial execution units. 

2.9 Regarding the program’s overall sustainability, at the level of the provincial 
governments and producer organizations, PROSAP has been able to build 
management mechanisms and secure commitments to ensure the operation and 
maintenance of the works. It has also been able to consolidate the capacities and 
processes developed in Component 2 (See program Operating Regulations).  

III. IMPLEMENTATION AND MANAGEMENT PLAN 

A. Summary of implementation arrangements 

3.1 The borrower is the Argentine Republic, and the Ministry of Agroindustry will be the 
executing agency, through the Unit for Rural Change (URC). The URC will be 
responsible for the execution, administration, and supervision of the program. Within 
it, the Program and Project Management Area will be in charge of executing the 
activities of the projects financed under the program. It will also have support from 
the crosscutting support areas and units that are part of the URC. 

3.2 The Ministry of Agroindustry is responsible for the local counterpart of the national 
projects. The URC’s main responsibilities include: preparing the budget and 
controlling and supervising fulfillment of the local contribution by the provinces and 
other participating agencies; supervising and coordinating the preparation of the 
AWPs, procurement plans, and financial plans; preparing and verifying 
disbursement requests; supervising work and providing legal and administrative 
support to the subexecuting agencies in procurement processes; paying contractors 
and suppliers; coordinating all program activities with the provinces and other 

http://idbdocs.iadb.org/wsdocs/getDocument.aspx?DOCNUM=40670869


 - 16 - 
 
 

 
beneficiaries; monitoring and evaluating project and program activities; and 
commissioning and serving as counterpart for the external audit. 

3.3 The program’s execution is governed by the program Operating Regulations, which 
contain the details required to guide and regulate program operations, including the 
requirements for transferring resources to the provincial projects. The program 
Operating Regulations and their annexes also describe the specific execution 
mechanism for each component. As a special condition precedent to the first 
disbursement of loan proceeds, the executing agency, through the URC, will 
provide evidence that the updated program Operating Regulations have been 
approved and entered into effect, and have been reviewed in accordance with 
the terms previously agreed upon with the Bank, including the ESM. The review 
will include updating the description of the program’s components and excluding 
investment projects with Category “A” socioenvironmental impacts under the 
environmental and social safeguard policies from eligibility. 

3.4 Component 1 of the program is executed through the URC’s Program and Project 
Management area and its Infrastructure and Services unit, which coordinates the 
relationships with the liaison entities and the units executing the projects at the 
provincial level, as established in the program Operating Regulations. For each 
case, specific planning, execution, monitoring, and evaluation functions are 
established for the projects. Component 2 of the program is executed by the 
Program and Project Management area through its Competitiveness unit and 
through NRC. The process for executing this component includes the following 
phases: identification and eligibility of clusters and territorial initiatives based on 
prioritization criteria; preparation and evaluation of specific plans for improving 
competitiveness; and implementation, monitoring, and technical evaluation of the 
projects. The execution of both components is supported by the following 
crosscutting areas of the URC: institutional development, environmental 
management, legal issues, internal control, finance and accounting, procurement, 
and management oversight and outcomes. 

3.5 Furthermore, the main fiduciary measures to be applied to the proposed operation 
were agreed upon during preparation. These measures are described in Annex III 
and include aspects of disbursements and audits, as well as thresholds for 
procurement processes, in accordance with the Bank’s policies and procedures as 
set forth in documents GN-2349-9 and GN-2350-9. 

B. Summary of arrangements for monitoring results 

3.6 Monitoring. The program has a Monitoring and Evaluation Plan. During project 
execution, the executing agency will prepare and send the Bank a monitoring report 
no later than 60 days from the end of each six-month period. These reports will focus 
on fulfillment of the output indicators and progress on outcomes, identifying 
problems encountered, and corrective measures taken. No later than during the last 
quarter of each year during project execution, the executing agency will submit the 
AWP for the following year, to the Bank’s satisfaction. 

3.7 Evaluation. The executing agency will conduct two independent evaluations funded 
by the loan proceeds: (i) the midterm evaluation will be submitted to the Bank no 
later than 90 days after 50% of the loan proceeds have been disbursed or two years 
have passed from the date of the Bank’s first disbursement of the loan proceeds, 

http://idbdocs.iadb.org/wsdocs/getDocument.aspx?DOCNUM=40670869
http://idbdocs.iadb.org/wsdocs/getDocument.aspx?DOCNUM=40679756


 - 17 - 
 
 

 
whichever occurs first; and (ii) the final evaluation, no later than 90 days after 90% 
of the loan proceeds have been disbursed by the Bank. These reports will include: 
(i) an evaluation of the quality of the data provided by the monitoring system; (ii) the 
level of fulfillment of the expected outputs, outcomes, and progress on the expected 
impacts as established in the Results Matrix; and (iii) the level of compliance with 
the ESMPs for the program and the investment projects, including a summary of the 
socioenvironmental audits and the progress in the social and environmental 
indicators. 

3.8 Impact evaluation. Evaluation of the program’s impact will have two parts. The 
proposed impact evaluation for public infrastructure will be conducted for two 
irrigation systems and a rural road. Impact estimates will be based on the difference 
in differences method applied to a panel of homes divided into a treatment group 
and a control group. For this, two surveys—a baseline and a final evaluation—are 
planned. The sample size for the treatment group will be 465, as well as 465 for the 
control group (total for the three projects). For the beneficiaries of the public 
investment projects, the control group will be comprised of farmers with no access 
to irrigation systems and/or improved roads. Farmers will be selected at random 
from the lists available in the executing agency’s archives.  

3.9 To evaluate the impact of the NRCs and clusters, the phase-in and difference in 
differences methods will be used. The implementation strategy will identify a 
treatment/control group based on the year in which producers enter the program. 
NRC not involving pressurized irrigation will be included in the evaluation (as they 
are included in the evaluation of public works investment). Thus, 220 NRCs will be 
evaluated. The sample will be 155 producers, selected at random from among the 
NRC. The control group will be defined based on farms that requested NRC but did 
not receive funding. 



counting will be used and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) will 
be followed when applicable in accordance with established national criteria. The 
following financial reports will be required: (i) financial execution plan for up to 
180 days following a request for an advance of funds; (ii) audited annual financial 
statements as stipulated in Article 7.03 paragraph (a) of the General Conditions of 
the loan contract; and (iii) other reports required by the fiduciary specialists.  

 Internal control and internal audit 

6.7 The national internal control body is the Sindicatura General de la Nación [Office of 
the Comptroller General] (SIGEN). The internal audit of each executing agency is 
performed through the Internal Audit Unit. The unit, which reports directly to the 
minister, is in charge of conducting audits and making recommendations pursuant 
to the powers granted under Law 24,156 (Financial Administration Act).  

 External control: External financial audit and project reports 

6.8 In 2011, the Bank concluded a diagnostic on the government auditing practices of 
the AGN, the result of which was to validate the AGN as auditor of Bank projects. 

6.9 However, based on the track record of the promptness of audit submissions, in 
October 2014, it was agreed with Argentina to reduce the AGN’s portfolio to match 
its real compliance capacity. Programs 2853/OC-AR, 2740/OC-AR, 3255/OC-AR,

Recommendation for approval
The Executive Board is invited to approve the recommendation for the proposed loan
and grant to the Argentine Republic for the Goat Value Chain Development
Programme, as contained in paragraph 33.

Proposed loan and grant to the Argentine Republic for
the Goat Value Chain Development Programme

I. Strategic context and rationale
A. Country, rural development and poverty context
1. Argentina is one of the largest economies in Latin America and one of the world's

major producers of agricultural commodities, especially soybeans, maize and beef.
In addition, there are some 251,000 family farms in the country. Many of these are
run by poor families, the majority of whom live in the greater north region. In
addition, Argentina is home to about 950,000 indigenous peoples. In 2010, 18 per
cent of the rural population and 22 per cent of rural dispersed households had
unmet basic needs. About 46,000 farms are raising goats, principally smallholders.

2. Poverty is especially severe in farming families, indigenous communities, rural
working families and large families without fixed incomes. Youth unemployment is a
serious problem in rural areas, and outmigration of young rural women is common.

B. Rationale and alignment with government priorities and
RB-COSOP

3. The Government of Argentina aims to reduce rural poverty through income
generation based on sustainable agricultural production. The Unit for Rural Change
(UCAR), of the Ministry of Agroindustry (MAI), has demonstrated the capacity to
improve the performance of IFAD's portfolio, which is implemented within its
country programme as an instrumental part of public policy to support family
farming. Specialized technical institutions cooperate with UCAR in this task.

II. Programme description
A. Programme area and target group
4. The programme leverages public policy priorities, lessons learned in the IFAD

country programme and opportunities within the country to reduce rural poverty by
integrating family farming into value chains. Its design is based on the insertion of
smallholder goat breeders into value chains, following participatory planning by
producers’ organizations within goat production basins. Value chains include:
(i) meat; (ii) fibre, especially mohair and cashmere; and (iii) milk products. The
chains are not very developed, with limitations faced by family farmers and
processing companies.

5. The programme area includes the five provinces of Chaco, Formosa, Neuquén,
Mendoza and Santiago del Estero, which include some 60 per cent of the total
number of goats in the country.

6. Beneficiaries will include men and women producers (including indigenous
communities) engaged in goat breeding and organized in producers’ organizations.
The programme will prioritize existing organizations and promote incorporation of
vulnerable groups, especially indigenous peoples, women and youth.

B. Programme development objective
7. The programme’s development objective is to raise the incomes of goat-breeding

families through their sustainable integration into value chains. The six-year
programme aims to reach 8,000 families.

C. Components and outcomes
8. The programme has three components:

 Component 1: Development of markets and sectoral policies. This
component will strengthen development of emerging value chains by creating
a conducive commercial environment, including marketing, policy and
normative aspects. To develop markets for goat products, it will support
market analysis and promotion, exploration of foreign markets and technical
assistance to processing companies. It will also promote product
standardization conforming to official normative rules, and creation of a
natural-resource monitoring framework for sustainable goat management.
Moreover, it will develop human resources by supporting technical exchange
visits and basic financial education.

 Component 2: Productive, organizational and commercial
development. To improve the functioning of value chains, the programme
will provide the following territorial support to participating organizations:

(a) Goat basin identification, the creation of goat basin forums and
participatory planning and monitoring of market-based sectoral
development.

(b) In the pre-investment phase, it will support preparation of participatory
rapid appraisals of producers’ organizations, institutional strengthening
and eventually the formulation of business plans in the framework of
business alliances in accordance with goat basin plans.

(c) In the investment phase, it will finance implementation of approved
business plans – including physical assets, training, technical assistance
and working capital – through revolving funds for credit administered by
producers’ organizations. Additionally, the programme will finance
guarantee funds to facilitate operating capital loans from financial
institutions to the associated lead companies in the value chains.

 Component 3: Programme management. This component includes
programme management by UCAR and provincial management units. It will
include the adaptation of systems for planning, monitoring and evaluation,
and also for knowledge management, with a special focus on South-South and
triangular cooperation (SSTC).

III. Programme implementation
ApproachA.

9. The programme’s operational strategy will be based on: (i) sector-wide investments
in goat product markets and policies; (ii) participatory goat basin plans; and
(iii) business plans as the principal instruments of producers’ organizations’ for
training, investment, technical assistance and operating capital.

Organizational frameworkB.
10. MAI, through the UCAR, will be responsible for programme implementation and will

directly execute the activities in components 1 and 3. Provincial governments will
be responsible for implementing component 2 through provincial management
units, based on provincial financing agreements with MAI. Beneficiary organizations
will be responsible for developing and executing business plans through
participatory processes.



EB 2016/LOT/P.18/Rev.1

11. Beneficiary participation is central to the programme. Producers’ organizations will
participate in goat basin forums to prepare and monitor basin plans. They will be
responsible for planning and implementing business plans, including procurement.
Finally, they will monitor and evaluate implementation of their business plans,
which will provide the programme’s system with data.

Planning, monitoring and evaluation, learning and knowledgeC.
management

12. Planning will be based on defined goals and objectives. The programme’s annual
planning exercise will provide the flexibility needed for implementation, in
coordination with provincial authorities. Goat basin plans will be prepared with the
participation of provincial authorities, producers’ organizations, private enterprises
and public institutions.

13. For the programme’s data and knowledge system, UCAR will apply results-based
management methods using an organizational matrix to manage the development
of goat basin and business plans. The system will be integrated into UCAR’s existing
management system, allowing monitoring of physical progress based on data
entered at the provincial level. A tracking sheet will facilitate analysis of information
critical to measuring results. For impact evaluation, implementers will collect
information from beneficiary households using a family questionnaire that includes
IFAD’s Results and Impact Management System (RIMS) survey. Institutional
advancement will be tracked by monitoring the participating producers’
organizations. Thematic studies will be carried out to analyse experiences in
programme implementation.

Financial management, procurement and governanceD.
14. Financial management. MAI, through UCAR, will be responsible for financial

management of all programme resources, including flow of funds, disbursement,
internal controls, accounting, financial reporting and audit. UCAR has been the
implementing agency of IFAD programmes since its creation in 2009. It has
extensive experience and adequate systems and procedures. For programme
implementation, UCAR will use its existing accounting system, which is satisfactory
to IFAD. Funding for start-up costs may be used for early programme expenditures.

15. Flow of funds. IFAD loan and grant resources will be disbursed to a receiving
account in United States dollars in the Central Bank of Argentina. Funds will then be
transferred to the two designated accounts in United States dollars in the Banco de
la Nación Argentina, to two designated accounts in United States dollars in the
central bank of Argentina. The accounts will be used exclusively for the proceeds of
the loan and grant, respectively. From each designated account, funds will flow to
the respective operational account denominated in Argentine pesos, which will be
managed by UCAR. Provincial-level implementation units will open provincial
operational accounts in Argentine pesos.

16. Procurement. The programme will follow national procurement regulations to the
extent these are compatible with IFAD’s procurement guidelines. UCAR, the
provincial management units and producers’ organizations will carry out
procurement on the basis of agreed procurement plans. Procurement of works,
goods and services in the framework of business plans, and accounting for these
expenditures, will be the responsibility of producers’ organizations, in line with
IFAD’s community-based procurement directives, with support from provincial
units.

17. Audit. The programme’s consolidated financial statements will be audited annually
by the national auditor general in accordance with IFAD’s Guidelines on Project
Audits. All programme accounts will be audited, including all sources of funding.
The scope of the audit will include visits to producers’ organizations. Annual audit
reports will be submitted to IFAD within six months of the end of each fiscal year.



EB 2016/LOT/P.18/Rev.1

SupervisionE.
18. The programme will be supervised directly by IFAD in accordance with the

methodology agreed by IFAD and UCAR. Initial supervision tasks include support for
rapid programme start-up and set-up of the accounting, planning, and monitoring
and evaluation systems.

Exception to IFAD’s General Conditions for AgriculturalF.
Development Financing and operational policies

19. With respect to retroactive financing, expenses related to goat basin forums and to
SSTC for activities begun as of the date of negotiations will be considered eligible
up to US$500,000 under the expense categories “Goods, services and inputs for
beneficiaries” and “Consultancies (technical assistance)” from both the loan and
grant accounts. Activities to be financed by retroactive financing and their source of
funding will require prior “no objection” from IFAD to be considered eligible. For
expenses for reimbursement to be recognized, the borrower/recipient must submit
them to IFAD once disbursement conditions have been met.

IV. Programme costs, financing, benefits
A. Programme costs
20. The total cost for six years of implementation will be US$25.5 million, including

contingencies, of which: US$2.7 million relates to component 1; US$19.0 million to
component 2; and US$3.8 million to component 3. Management costs make up
15 per cent of programme costs. Costs include 6 per cent for contingencies with
respect to price escalation for goods, services and operating expenses, and
0.001 per cent for physical contingencies with respect to goods and services.

B. Programme financing
21. The programme will be financed by: (i) the central government, with a contribution

of US$7.0 million to cofinance business plans of producers’ organizations and
management costs; (ii) provincial governments, with a contribution of
US$3.0 million to cofinance business plans and provincial management costs;
(iii) IFAD, through a loan of US$12.3 million and a grant of US$1.0 million for
SSTC; and (iv) beneficiaries, with in-kind contributions of US$2.2 million to
cofinance business plans. Programme costs by component and expenditure

C. Benefit summary and economic analysis
22. The programme will serve some 8,000 rural families (approximately 40,000

people), including 5,600 smallholder families and 2,400 indigenous families. Small-
scale producers, organized in approximately 160 producers’ organizations, including
48 indigenous communities, will generate the programme’s expected benefits.

23. The financial and economic evaluation indicates the activities’ viability at farm and
programme levels. The internal rate of return is 23.3 per cent, and the net present
value US$19.6 million.

D. Sustainability
24. The programme’s sustainability will be ensured by: (i) collaboration of producers’

organizations with processing companies in the goat basin forums; (ii) support to
beneficiary organizations that will continue operating after programme completion;
(iii) sector-wide support provided in component 1, including the vegetation
monitoring system and SSTC activities; (iv) environmental, climate change
adaptation and commercial support measures to be integrated into business plans;
and (v) linkage of participating companies to commercial financial institutions.

E. Risk identification and mitigation
25. The programme’s potential adverse impacts and risks of failing to achieve its

objectives are limited. The main risks include: (i) political and institutional risks,
which are low in view of the country’s stable poverty-reduction policy framework
and UCAR’s track record in implementing poverty reduction programmes;
(ii) possible delay in incorporating participating provinces into the programme,
which has been mitigated by their identification and participation in programme
design; (iii) companies’ difficulties in joining the programme, which will be reduced
by inviting them to participate in the goat basin forums, and by technical assistance
and loan guarantees; (iv) market risks, which are already low by virtue of observed
demand for goat products, will be further reduced by addressing supply and
marketing constraints; (v) technological and climatic risks, which will be mitigated
through local technical assistance and support to integration of climate-proofing
measures into business plans and participating companies’ operations; and
(vi) fiduciary risk: based on a 2015 Transparency International Corruption
Perceptions Index score of 32, and IFAD experience in the country, the
programme’s fiduciary risk has been rated as medium. However, the solid
experience and systems of UCAR, along with close implementation support from
IFAD, are considered sufficient to mitigate fiduciary risk.



EB 2016/LOT/P.18/Rev.1

V. Corporate considerations
Compliance with IFAD policiesA.

26. The programme approach and implementation modalities are consistent with IFAD
strategies and policies. They specifically support IFAD’s fiduciary compliance and
are aligned with the IFAD Strategic Framework 2016-2025 and the policies on rural
finance, indigenous peoples, environment and natural resource management,
gender equality and women’s empowerment, and targeting.

Alignment and harmonizationB.
27. The programme is in line with government objectives and the Federal and

Participative Agri-food and Agribusiness Strategic Plan, 2010/2016 (PEA2). It is also
consistent with the recommendations of IFAD’s 2010 country programme
evaluation in seeking a programme approach, expanding the range of financial
services and introducing the use of grants to boost knowledge management.

Innovations and scaling upC.
28. The programme’s innovations include: (i) focusing on specific value chains with a

high incidence of poverty and sound commercial potential; (ii) bringing together
smallholder producers, companies and public administration in forums to plan the
development of goat value chains; (iii) integrating sector-support activities such as
market analysis and promotion and policy support; (iv) introducing systematic
natural resource monitoring; (v) widening the spectrum of rural financial services,
including financial education and loan guarantees for participating companies; and
(vi) SSTC to support market and policy development activities.

Policy engagementD.
29. The programme will support development of public policies to promote sustainable

smallholder goat breeding in Argentina and beyond by generating and
communicating evidence of the value chain development approach it applies. Best
practices will be learned and disseminated in the framework of the SSTC
programme.

VI. Legal instruments and authority
30. A financing agreement between the Argentine Republic and IFAD will constitute the

legal instrument for extending the proposed financing to the borrower/recipient. A
copy of the negotiated financing agreement is attached as appendix I.

31. The Argentine Republic is empowered under its laws to receive financing from IFAD.

32. I am satisfied that the proposed financing will comply with the Agreement
Establishing IFAD and the Policies and Criteria for IFAD Financing.

VII. Recommendation
33. I recommend that the Executive Board approve the proposed financing in terms of

the following resolutions:

RESOLVED: that the Fund shall provide a loan on ordinary terms to the
Argentine Republic in the amount of twelve million three hundred thousand
dollars (US$12,300,000), and upon such terms and conditions as shall be
substantially in accordance with the terms and conditions presented herein.

RESOLVED FURTHER: that the Fund shall provide a grant to the Argentine
Republic in the amount of one million seventeen thousand dollars
(US$1,017,000), and upon such terms and conditions as shall be substantially
in accordance with the terms and conditions presented herein.

Recommendation for approval

The Executive Board is invited to approve the recommendation for the proposed
financing to Cooperative Republic of Guyana for the Hinterland Environmentally
Sustainable Agricultural Development Project, as contained in paragraph 59.

Proposed loan and grant to the Cooperative Republic of
Guyana for the Hinterland Environmentally Sustainable
Agricultural Development Project

I. Strategic context and rationale
A. Country and rural development and poverty context
1. Situated on the northern coast of South America, Guyana borders the Atlantic

Ocean, Brazil, Suriname and Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela; it belongs to the
Guiana Shield region, part of the Amazon Biome. Guyana hosts a vast expanse of
primary tropical forest, freshwater resources and a unique savannah ecosystem. It
covers an area of 215,000 km2 with a population of 747,883. Indigenous peoples
account for more than three quarters of the population in regions 8 and 9
(75.9 per cent and 89.2 per cent, respectively) and about two thirds of the
population in region 1 (62.2 per cent).

2. The World Bank estimates that Guyana’s GDP, based on the Atlas Method, was
US$3,763 in 2014. According to the Economist Intelligence Unit, economic growth
is expected to reach 3.2 per cent in 2016 and 3.7 per cent in 2017 as substantial
new gold mining projects are launched.

3. Agriculture and rural development. Agriculture is a significant contributor to the
country’s development. It is predominantly undertaken by small-scale farmers and
indigenous people farming less than 5 ha of land. Cultivated crops include rice
(90,000 ha), sugar (48,000 ha) and coconut (25,000 ha); non-traditional crops
occupy between 30,000 and 40,000 ha while 158,473 ha are used for livestock.
Agricultural products, excluding forest products, make up approximately
31 per cent of total exports; the main exported commodities are rice and sugar.

4. Poverty, nutrition and food security. According to the United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP), since 1992, the proportion of households living
in moderate poverty (on US$2 per day) has declined from 43 per cent to
36.3 per cent, and extreme poverty has dropped from 28.7 per cent to
19.1 per cent. The outlook remains far less favourable for indigenous peoples,
77 per cent of whom are poor, and inhabitants of the hinterland, where three out of
four people are poor.

5. Studies show that household food security in hinterland region 9 is compromised;
the situation worsens during drought and flood seasons. A rising dependence on
remittances, driven by migration towards mining and logging areas, is negatively
affecting consumption patterns in indigenous areas. Changes in indigenous peoples’
diets (which include increased consumption of refined carbohydrates, processed
foods, sweetened and calorie-dense foods) are likely responsible for the rise in
chronic diseases in this region.

6. Main natural resource constraints for agriculture and rural people in
regions 1 and 9. Agriculture and rural livelihoods in regions 1 and 9 are affected
by increased variability in rainfall patterns. In region 9, severe floods and prolonged
dry spells, coupled with a lack of adequate water-management technologies and



EB 2016/LOT/P.12/Rev.1

2

low fertility of the savannah soil, are major challenges for agriculture and livestock.
In region 1, salt water intrusion is a major impact of climate change, which over
time will affect arable land and freshwater resources in coastal areas. Climate
change is affecting the sustainability of established production patterns in both
regions, and the transition to new production patterns needs to involve greater
adaptability to changing climatic and economic conditions. This will require access
to knowledge, investment and technologies for natural resource management,
which are currently lacking.

7. Economic constraints in regions 1 and 9. The remoteness of regions 1 and 9
remains a challenge for the generation of business and income-generation
opportunities. Poor transportation and telecommunication networks limit market
access and hinder these regions’ integration into the national economy. There is
also a lack of access to information, technology and energy needed to support
investments in productive activities, and promote adaptation to changing economic
and environmental conditions.

8. Main challenges. Persistent poverty and climate change are severely straining the
target group’s resilience and social cohesion. The capacity of hinterland
communities to respond to new economic and environmental challenges is further
limited by a lack of incentives for investments that reduce economic and climate
risks.

9. Opportunities to improve livelihoods of indigenous people and small
farmers in the project area. Despite these challenges, both regions offer
opportunities for improving the livelihoods of the target group and generating
income from agriculture and related activities.

10. In the long term, the Ministry of Agriculture intends to strengthen hinterland
agriculture by moving production away from traditional export products and from
coastal areas that are vulnerable to salinization. In the short term, consultations
and field visits in regions 1 and 9 have confirmed that these regions offer: (i) high
levels of human capital, including education, skills, motivation and entrepreneurial
attitude; (ii) widespread awareness of the need to improve livelihood strategies to
adapt to economic, environmental and climate challenges; (iii) appreciation of the
value of ecosystems and biodiversity; (iv) common land titles, strong community
governance and familiarity with participatory planning approaches; (v) local
markets and local public procurement, which provide opportunities for small and
medium-sized agricultural producers (with little competition from large businesses);
and (vi) producer groups (including women’s associations) that have established
partnerships with NGOs and local government agencies.

B. Rationale and alignment with government priorities and the
COSOP

11. The favorable conditions highlighted above provide an opportunity for the project to
support rural households and communities in identifying and developing value
chains that generate new income opportunities and contribute to rural livelihood
diversification. Both regions offer viable opportunities to increase the
competitiveness, inclusiveness and sustainability of local value chains through
improvements in natural resources management, production, processing, storage,
quality-enhancing technologies and smallholder market access. Preliminary
consultations have identified the following value chains as possible targets for
development: cassava and its main by-products farine and cassava bread; peanuts,
fruit and livestock in region 9; and spices such as ginger, turmeric and black pepper
in region 1.

12. The project strategy will combine decentralized participatory community
development, natural resource management and value chain approaches to
strengthen livelihood resilience by increasing income-generating opportunities,



EB 2016/LOT/P.12/Rev.1

3

access to resilience-building assets and food and nutrition security. This strategy
will also support an inclusive participatory planning process that strengthens the
organizational capacities of communities and producer groups, and enhances
institutional coordination among national and local institutions.

13. The project is aligned with IFAD’s strategy for Guyana as defined in the country
strategy note. Previous IFAD projects in Guyana mainly operated in the coastal
region, focusing on strengthening producers’ capacity and expanding opportunities
to develop small-scale enterprises. The proposed project applies experience gained
in previous projects to remote hinterland areas largely populated by indigenous
peoples. Through this strategy, IFAD supports the Government of Guyana in its
efforts to bridge the coast-hinterland divide and reduce poverty in isolated rural
communities.

II. Project description
A. Project area and target group
14. The project will be carried out in all sub-regions of region 9 and in the Mabaruma

and Moruca sub-regions of region 1. Beneficiaries will be located in approximately
80 of the 128 communities in regions 1 and 9 (60 communities in region 9 and 20
communities in region 1). Considering the remoteness, vastness and low population
density of region 9, a phased implementation approach will be adopted for this
region. The project will initially focus on North Rupununi in order to capitalize on
government efforts to exploit this sub-region’s significant agricultural potential.
Lessons learned from project implementation in North Rupununi will later be applied
to Central and South Rupununi. The target group will include 6,000 poor
households, equivalent to 94 per cent of all poor households in the project area. At
least 15 per cent of these households (900) will be headed by women, reflecting
the overall proportion of women-headed households in the project area.

15. These 6,000 households represent approximately 30,000 direct and indirect
beneficiaries, comprising men and women of different age groups. At least
75 per cent of project beneficiaries will be from indigenous groups. At least
30 per cent will be between 15 and 44 years old, and at least 50 per cent will be
women. As a result of the project’s phased approach, figures for the target
population may be revised at the midterm review.

B. Project development objective
16. The development objective of the project, responding to the priorities identified in

the country strategy note, is improved livelihood resilience through income
generation, access to assets, improved nutrition and adaptation to climate
variability.

17. Livelihood resilience will be strengthened by the following activities:

(a) Increasing income-generating opportunities through the identification of
commodities drives the inclusion of small farmers in markets, increases local
demand for services and labour, and supports beneficiaries’ inclusive and
informed participation in market opportunities that improve household
income.

(b) Improving access to public goods, knowledge and technologies builds
community resilience and creates an enabling environment for production
through: technology, knowledge and information for better planning and
natural resource management; improved water availability for agriculture and
human consumption; better soil-management practices; diffusion of
information and communications technologies; adoption of renewable energy;
and valuation of agro-biodiversity.

(c) Enhancing food security and nutrition identifies and promotes
commodities, including crops, fish and forest products that sustainably



EB 2016/LOT/P.12/Rev.1

4

improve household diets and increase nutrition awareness through nutrition
education and behaviour change activities, including food-based dietary
guidelines.

C. Components/outcomes
18. Component 1. This component aims to support village and community councils

(in region 9), value chain roundtables (in region 1) and regional development
councils in planning and prioritizing investments in local value chains1 and resilient
communities. As a result, communities and producer groups will have strengthened
capacities to identify investment opportunities and manage economic and climate
change risks. The main instruments to be developed through this component are
community production development plans for region 9 and value chain action plans
for region 1. These medium-term plans will be the basis for developing three types
of investment plans to be implemented with project support: public/collective
investment plans (P/CIPs), community training plans (CTPs) and business plans.

19. Component 2. While component 1 will provide training, studies and
capacity-building needed to develop investment plans, component 2 will support
these plans’ implementation. Under component 2, an investment fund will be
established to finance public and common goods and services, through
non-reimbursable mechanisms, to be included in each type of investment plan.
They will comprise: (i) investments that reduce climate and investment risks
(included in P/CIPs); (ii) training, capacity-building and awareness-raising
activities, and related research that contributes to a reduction in climate, economic
and nutritional risks (included in CTPs); and (iii) technical assistance and services
to support the diffusion of knowledge, technologies and capacities that improve
livelihood resilience by reducing climate, economic and nutritional risks (included in
business plans).

20. Component 3. The third component will establish management and administrative
procedures, including accounting and auditing, monitoring and evaluation
mechanisms in accordance with IFAD and national guidelines. Evidence-based
knowledge products will be developed on the basis of project experience in order to
extract lessons and best practices, scale up innovative solutions and achieve better
outcomes and greater impact from development resources.

III. Project implementation
ApproachA.

21. The project strategy aims to improve the target group’s livelihood resilience by
addressing major risks arising from contextual challenges in the project area. Since
natural resources and local governance systems are threatened by these economic
and environmental risks, in order to strengthen the resilience of target
communities, the prioritization of opportunities and the planning of investments and
activities will be carried out through a participatory process, which will include local
actors and governing bodies.

B. Organizational framework
22. The lead agency for the implementation of the hinterland project will be the

Ministry of Agriculture through its Agriculture Sector Development Unit (ASDU). For
activities such as consultative village planning, agricultural technology transfer,
technical assistance, natural resource management and regional investment
planning, the Ministry of Agriculture will be assisted by the Ministries of Indigenous
People’s Affairs, Natural Resources, Communities and Business, other government
agencies, NGOs, community-based organizations, academia and individual service
providers.

1 In region 1, there is also significant potential for developing linkages to international markets; this is particularly true for
spices such as ginger and turmeric.



EB 2016/LOT/P.12/Rev.1

23. The project management unit will comprise an office at the Ministry of Agriculture in
Georgetown and regional offices in regions 1 and 9. A national steering committee
and regional management committees will be established to provide policy
direction, support implementation, advise on annual workplans and budgets, and
encourage collaboration among stakeholders.

C. Planning, monitoring and evaluation, and learning and
knowledge management

24. The project will provide support to strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of
Agriculture’s Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Unit and ensure that project
monitoring is linked to the Ministry’s performance monitoring and Agriculture
Strategy indicators. M&E will be conducted using a participatory approach; data
collection will be kept simple and brief, focusing on the reliability and usefulness of
collected data. Evidence-based knowledge products will be developed to extract
lessons and best practices from project experiences, replicate innovative solutions,
maximize outcomes and impact from development resources, and disseminate
knowledge to support national, regional and local decision-making and policy
processes. A baseline study will be carried out immediately following the approval
of the financing agreement and before implementation.

D. Financial management, procurement and governance
25. Financial management. Financial management and procurement for the project

will be undertaken by ASDU, which has adequate capacity, an appropriate
accounting system and extensive experience in implementing internationally funded
projects, including the IFAD-funded Rural Enterprise and Agricultural Development
Project. A qualified finance officer will be recruited through a competitive process as
a condition of disbursement for the loan and grant. Due to the remoteness of
project areas, an administrative/finance officer will be recruited at each regional
office through a competitive process and will be responsible for performing
administrative and basic accounting functions.

26. Flow of funds. The borrower will open a designated account in United States
dollars in the Central Bank of Guyana exclusively for the loan and grant, in which
advance funds will be deposited and from which funds will be transferred to the
project operational account in Guyanese dollars.

27. Retroactive financing. As an exception to section 4.08(a)(ii) of the General
Conditions for Agricultural Development Financing, specific eligible expenditures
incurred from the date of approval by the Executive Board until the date of entry
into force of the financing agreement will be considered eligible up to the amount of
US$300,000 in accordance with and as specified in the financing agreement. These
eligible expenditures will consist of the costs related to: the detailed value chains
study for spices in region 1; a state of food and agriculture study in the Mabaruma
and Moruca sub-regions of region 1; and the hiring of personnel.

28. Procurement. Procurement of goods and services will be carried out by ASDU in
line with national regulations, IFAD’s Project Procurement Guidelines and the
provisions of the financing agreement. A procurement officer, exclusively assigned
to the hinterland project, will be hired by ASDU.

29. Audit. Annual consolidated financial statements for the project will be
independently audited pursuant to the agreed terms of reference and in accordance
with International Standards on Auditing and IFAD's guidelines on project audits. In
line with the 2004 Guyana Audit Act, the Auditor General shall be responsible for
conducting financial, compliance, performance and value-for-money audits of the
accounts of all projects funded by loans or grants from any foreign state or
organization. The Guyana Auditor General Audit Office will audit the project
financial statements. Annual audit reports will be submitted to IFAD within six
months of the end of each fiscal year.

E. Supervision
30. IFAD will directly supervise the project, complemented by implementation-support

missions. One supervision mission will be planned each year. The first supervision
mission, undertaken approximately six months after project effectiveness, will
monitor progress against the timeframe defined in the implementation plan, and
will assess fiduciary aspects, expenditures, counterpart contributions of funds and
compliance with the financing agreement. Implementation-support missions will be
planned to cover the issues recommended by supervision missions.

IV. Project costs, financing, and benefits
A. Project costs
31. The total cost of the project is US$11.14 million over a period of six years. Of this

total, US$10.54 million (95 per cent) are baseline costs and US$610,000 (5 per cent)
are physical and price contingencies.

C. Summary benefit and economic analysis
33. Financial analysis. To verify the financial viability of project activities, the flow of

annual incremental net benefits was calculated over a period of ten years, both for
rural households’ agricultural production and for producer groups’ enterprises. All
models confirmed increases in benefits, family net income, sales and labour.
Financial viability was positive in all models, with financial internal rates of return
between 23 per cent and 312 per cent.

34. Economic analysis. Economic viability indicators are positive, with an economic
internal rate of return of 21 per cent and an expected net present value of
US$6.97 million. Viability indicators are not highly sensitive to the reduction of
benefits and to delays in obtaining them; these indicators are moderately sensitive
to cost increases.

D. Sustainability
35. Political and institutional sustainability. The project is aligned with the national

policy framework, which: highlights the development of hinterland agriculture;
seeks to reduce the poverty and isolation of indigenous communities; and supports
the adoption of environmentally sustainable development. Coordination between
national government agencies and local authorities is already taking place in region
9, and the project will contribute to dialogue and coordination between government
agencies, indigenous communities, international donors and civil society
organizations operating in hinterland areas.

36. Sustainability, upscaling and replication. Previous IFAD projects in Guyana
mostly concentrated on coastal areas and communities. This project builds upon
and adapts IFAD’s approach to the unique conditions in the hinterland, and paves
the way for replication and scaling up in other remote areas of the country with
similar conditions. Of particular relevance is the phased implementation approach
adopted for region 1, where a state of food and agriculture study will be conducted
in the first year of the project. The knowledge and lessons learned in Mabaruma
and Moruca sub-regions can be used to replicate the project in other areas of
region 1. Using a participatory planning approach, the project will build upon the
planning capacity developed in villages that have already established community
development plans, and it will strengthen skills and capacities for climate- and
nutrition-sensitive planning.

37. Food security and nutritional quality. Awareness-raising activities and training
materials on nutritional quality will also be created through the project.

38. Environmental sustainability. The adoption of climate-resilient measures such as
the identification of drought-tolerant and climate-resilient crop varieties, and the
definition of climate-proof agricultural technologies will sustain productivity and
quality improvements. The state of food and agriculture study in region 1 will fill
the knowledge gap on environmental and socio-economic conditions in the region,
thus contributing to better planning.

E. Risk identification and mitigation
39. The risks identified during the project design include economic risks,

climate-change risks, social risks and institutional risks.

40. Economic risks include excessive specialization and competition for labour from
other sectors. These risks will be mitigated through training and support activities
that build awareness of specialization risks and help communities and producers’
groups to integrate new income-generating activities into diversified livelihood
strategies. The project will promote the strengthening of local value chains and
increase access to information needed for target households’ equitable participation
in agricultural markets. It will also provide technical assistance and investment
incentives to maximize incomes and employment.



EB 2016/LOT/P.12/Rev.1

8

41. Climate-change risks will be addressed through support for investments in public
and collective goods included in P/CIPs and CTPs that increase access to
knowledge, technology and information for improved water and natural resource
management. The project will promote the adoption of good natural resource
management practices and measures for adapting to climate change within
business plans. Business plans will also include mitigation strategies to reduce the
negative effects of productive specialization on climate change resilience and
nutrition through the use of agro-biodiversity and the diversification of livelihoods.

42. Social risks will be reduced through the adoption of free, prior and informed
consent plans, and by strengthening participatory community planning. The
participation of vulnerable groups, including women and youth, will be promoted
through the targeting strategy, the inclusion of skills development and training for
youth and women in CTPs, and by prioritizing business plans that involve vulnerable
groups.

43. Risks to nutrition and food security will be addressed through training and technical
assistance that strengthens the links between income generation and nutrition
quality in order to: (i) help households to make more informed dietary choices;
(ii) increase the adoption of dietary recommendations; and (iii) increase the
richness, variety and nutritional quality of the local food system.

44. Institutional risks relate to limited regional coordination among stakeholders and to
the weak organizational capacities of communities and producer groups. The
project will strengthen national and regional coordination through its national
steering committee and regional management committee, facilitating linkages
among ministries, other government agencies and programmes, NGOs and other
projects.

45. Based on Guyana’s 2015 Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index
score of 29 and public financial management assessments, the project’s fiduciary
risk has been rated as medium. The measures highlighted in section III.D of this
report are considered sufficient to mitigate any fiduciary risks.

V. Corporate considerations
Compliance with IFAD policiesA.

46. IFAD’s target group comprises rural people living in poverty and experiencing food
insecurity; IFAD proactively strives to reach extremely poor people (in line with
Sustainable Development Goal 1) with the potential to benefit from improved
access to agricultural production and rural income generation. In the case of
Guyana, poor people principally live in hinterland areas. Therefore, the geographical
focus of this project is in regions 1 and 9 – hinterland areas where indigenous
peoples constitute the majority of the population. Targeting will be monitored using
participatory monitoring and evaluation, and will be assessed at mid-term review.

47. To meet the requirements of IFAD’s demand–driven and consultative targeting
approach, participatory mapping of resource use and economic activities will be
carried out under component 1. IFAD will work with the Government and other
stakeholders to establish a shared understanding of the causes poverty and
exclusion in hinterland areas.

48. Compliance with IFAD policies for environment and natural resource
management. The project complies with IFAD’s Climate and Natural Resources
Management Policy, specifically principles 3 and 4, and will adopt an integrated
climate-smart approach. Local value chains will be identified through participatory
processes to ensure that their development contributes to increasing community-
and household-level resilience to climate change. Priority will be given to initiatives
that promote climate-related disaster risk reduction and management, and the
establishment of agroecological systems. The project will also provide technical



EB 2016/LOT/P.12/Rev.1

9

assistance for the incorporation of technologies and good practices for better
national resource management and climate-change adaptation into investment
plans.

49. Compliance with IFAD’s Policy on Gender Equality and Women’s
Empowerment. The hinterland project is aligned with IFAD’s Policy on Gender
Equality and Women’s Empowerment through a participatory approach designed to
ensure that the voices of different rural population segments are equally heard and
valued. Specific gender actions to ensure gender equity have been included in the
project design and budget. By working with entire households, the project will
leverage the complementary knowledge and skills of women and men (in line with
Strategic Objective 2).

50. Compliance with IFAD’s Nutrition Action Plan 2016-2018. The project is
nutrition sensitive as defined in the IFAD Nutrition Action Plan 2016-2018. It
contributes to families’ improved food and nutrition security by linking local food
production with the improved nutritional quality of diets.

Alignment and harmonizationB.
51. The project is aligned with the national policy framework, which highlights the

development of hinterland agriculture; reduction of poverty and isolation in
indigenous communities; and adoption of environmentally sustainable development
strategies to mitigate increased threats from climate change.

52. In region 9, the project will harness complementarities with the Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) Sustainable Agricultural Development Project. This project
aims to increase the productivity of the agricultural sector while maintaining the
sustainable and climate-resilient use of natural resources in regions 5, 9 and 10.
IDB will support the Ministry of Agriculture in the preparation and implementation
of an extension strategy that includes incentives for small farmers to adopt
technologies for cassava, peanuts, livestock, orchards and pastures. To enhance
synergies and improve national and regional coordination, the two projects will use
the same national steering committee and regional management committee in
region 9. Collaboration will also be sought with IDB to utilize information and
communication technologies in rural areas.

53. The project will be harmonized with the IDB multilateral investment fund project
Leveraging Natural Capital in the Rupununi Region (region 9). This project aims to
create and strengthen environmentally sustainable local-level initiatives, and
enhance market access for community-based enterprises. It will be also
harmonized with Guyana’s Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest
Degradation Plus Investment Fund, which aims to invest in low-carbon approaches
identified in the Low Carbon Development Strategy. In addition, collaboration will
be sought with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)
on the state of food and agriculture study in region 1, and to support
implementation of the Integrated Sustainable Agriculture Development Strategy for
region 9 2015-2020 (developed by the Ministry of Agriculture, FAO and
Conservation International).

Innovations and scaling upC.
54. Previous IFAD projects in Guyana were concentrated in coastal areas. This project

builds upon and adapts IFAD’s approach to the unique conditions in the hinterland,
and paves the way for replication and scaling up in other remote areas of the
country with similar conditions.

Policy engagementD.
55. The project, which will be mainly implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture, is

aligned with government decentralization strategies involving local governments
and indigenous peoples’ institutions through the Ministries of Communities and



EB 2016/LOT/P.12/Rev.1

10

Indigenous Peoples’ Affairs (in partnership with other government agencies,
international donors and international NGOs). Coordination between national
government agencies and local authorities is already taking place in region 9; closer
cooperation will be sought throughout the project to strengthen capacities within
the Government and civil society for natural resource management, nutrition- and
climate-sensitive planning.

VI. Legal instruments and authority
56. A project financing agreement between the Cooperative Republic of Guyana and

IFAD will constitute the legal instrument for extending the proposed financing to the
borrower/recipient. A copy of the negotiated financing agreement is attached in
appendix I.

57. The Cooperative Republic of Guyana is empowered under its laws to receive
financing from IFAD.

58. I am satisfied that the proposed financing will comply with the Agreement
Establishing IFAD and the Policies and Criteria for IFAD Financing.

VII. Recommendation
59. I recommend that the Executive Board approve the proposed financing in terms of

the following resolutions:

RESOLVED: that the Fund shall provide a loan on blend terms to the
Cooperative Republic of Guyana in the amount of seven million nine hundred
and sixty thousand United States dollars (US$7,960,000), and upon such

Recommendation for approval

The Executive Board is invited to approve the recommendation for the proposed
loan to the Republic of Cuba for the Livestock Cooperatives Development Project in
the Central-Eastern Region as contained in paragraph 58.

Proposed loan to the Republic of Cuba for the Livestock
Cooperatives Development Project in the Central-Eastern
Region

I. Strategic context and rationale
A. Country and rural development and poverty context
1. Cuba is a middle-income country that in 2014 had a population of 11.2 million,

23 per cent living in rural areas. In 2014, Cuba’s nominal gross domestic product
(GDP) was US$80,656 million, equivalent to a GDP per capita of US$7,186.
However, care must be taken when analysing per capita GDP in view of the
country’s regulated dual monetary system, in which the Cuban Peso (CUP) and the
Cuban Convertible Peso (CUC) coexist. According to the World Food Programme
(WFP), between 60 per cent and 75 per cent of households’ income is spent on
food, which is high compared to other middle-income countries (the average is
between 20 per cent and 45 per cent).

2. With social policies guaranteeing food and nutritional security, and targeting the
most vulnerable populations, Cuba has made major strides in eradicating extreme
poverty and hunger. It is the only country in Latin America and the Caribbean to
have eliminated severe infant malnutrition. According to the 2015 Human
Development Report, Cuba is advanced in terms of human development, with a
score of 0.769, ranking 67th out of 188 countries. Cuba’s score is above average for
countries rated as high in human development (0.744).

3. Cuba’s agricultural sector accounts for about 4 per cent of its GDP but employs
approximately 20 per cent of the workforce, 16 per cent of whom are women. The
agricultural sector is in transition, with an increasing role played by private
cooperatives and individual farmers, which account for over 90 per cent of
agricultural production on 70 per cent of the land. While the state purchased
80 per cent of national production in 2007, this figure decreased to 60 per cent in
2012. Growing domestic food markets and demand from the increasing tourist
sector are providing opportunities for local producers; however producers must
enhance the quality and quantity of their production in order to serve these
markets.

B. Rationale and alignment with government priorities
4. Food security is a strategic priority for the Cuban Government. The agricultural

sector’s current productivity is well below the country’s potential, considering the
availability of natural resources and human and technological capital. As a result,
local food production is insufficient to cover demand and Cuba is highly dependent
on food imports.

5. A decline of productivity in Cuba’s livestock sector was caused by gradual
decapitalization since the 1990s. As a result, the livestock sector changed from an
advanced production system based on the intensive use of inputs to a dispersed
system of pastoralism. National milk production fell from 982 million litres in 1989
to 434 million litres in 2014, and meat production decreased from 271 thousand
tons in 1990 to 119 thousand tons in 2014.

6. Improving agricultural productivity is therefore at the core of Cuba’s public policy
agenda. Since April 2011, Cuba has begun a series of political, institutional and
economic reforms known as the Economic and Social Policy Guidelines. These
guidelines call for a gradual transformation of the agricultural sector by introducing
more market incentives and private-sector production, and reducing controls on
prices and wages.

7. As outlined in the country strategy note, IFAD can play an important role in
supporting the transformation of Cuba’s agricultural sector by supporting
smallholders organized into private cooperatives, who represent the productive
backbone of the sector. In order to meet the challenges of changing economic
conditions and benefit from new opportunities, these smallholders need productive
assets, inputs and capacity-building.

8. The Livestock Cooperatives Development Project in the Central-Eastern Region
(PRODEGAN) aims to support private cooperatives comprised of smallholders
managing dual-purpose cattle and focused on milk and meat production. The
Government currently imports nearly 50,000 tons of milk powder per year to cover
50 percent of local demand in a world market characterized by volatile prices.

9. The proposed project builds upon the experience gained from the ongoing
Cooperative Rural Development Project in the Oriental Region (PRODECOR), which
focuses on production of maize and beans in the eastern provinces of Las Tunas,
Holguín, Granma and Santiago de Cuba. As in PRODECOR, the focus of this project
is on increasing the productivity of private cooperatives through participatory
development plans and improved service provision.

II. Project description
A. Project area and target group
10. The project area encompasses the province of Camagüey, in which four priority

municipalities have been selected: Guaímaro, Sibanicú, Camagüey and Jimaguayú.
These municipalities comprise 45 per cent of the province’s cattle population and
57 per cent of its milk production. The area was selected because of its long
tradition of livestock production, its productive potential, the presence of processing
plants with spare capacity and the concentration of cooperatives that are already
integrated into existing value chains.

11. Since the 1990s, the economy in Camagüey province has suffered because of a
decline in the livestock sector caused by decreasing investments, a lack of inputs,
limited technical assistance, land degradation and the effects of climate change and
variability. The proposed project aims to reverse this trend.

12. PRODEGAN will directly benefit 11,500 rural families organized in 105 cooperatives,
for a total of 34,500 direct beneficiaries. These direct beneficiaries will include:
(i) members of cooperatives producing meat, milk and dairy products such as
cheese; (ii) wage-earning rural workers employed by the cooperatives; and
(iii) technicians employed by the service providers of livestock cooperatives.

13. The cooperatives average between 60 and 140 members; women represent
13 per cent of cooperative membership and young people 11 per cent. PRODEGAN
will focus on reaching women (at least 20 per cent) and youth (at least 15
per cent), and will support their inclusion in cooperatives’ decision-making and
productive activities.

14. Three types of cooperatives exist in Cuba. Credit and service cooperatives, created
in 1963, are characterized by individual land ownership and comprise
approximately 60 per cent of the cooperatives in the area; they are considered to
be the most efficient form of cooperative. Basic cooperative production units are
former state farms transformed in 1993. Characterized by collective ownership
structures, they comprise approximately 30 per cent of cooperatives in the area. In
agricultural production cooperatives, which were created in 1975, individuals

..]

voluntarily agree on collective ownership (they comprise approximately 10 per cent
of the cooperatives in the area).

B. Project development objective
15. The development objective of the project is to promote the sustainable growth of

the livestock sector by increasing the production and sale of milk and meat, raising
the incomes of beneficiary families in cooperatives. The main outcomes for the
primary target group will be: (i) higher average net incomes for members of
participating cooperatives; (ii) increased delivery of cold milk from cooperatives to
the industry from 17 million litres to 47 million liters per year; and (iii) increased
sale of beef by cooperatives from 5,000 tons to 6,000 tons per year.

C. Components/outcomes
16. PRODEGAN has three inter-linked technical components and one component for

project management. The main focus of component 1 is on strengthening milk and
meat producing cooperatives, which currently have significant manual labour
capacity, high mortality and low birth rates of cattle, insufficient pastures and
limited water availability. Through component 2, service providers in the project
area will be strengthened in order to free up land, increase water availability,
improve artificial insemination and veterinary services, and build cooperatives’
capacity. Finally, in order to ensure sufficient capacity to collect and process the
increased milk and meat produced, agro-industry in the project area will be
supported through component 3. The main expected outcomes of each component
are detailed below:

(a) Component 1: Strengthening smallholder livestock cooperatives. By
implementing cooperative development plans (CDPs), livestock farmers will
increase their cattle populations and milk and meat production in a
sustainable manner. The project also aims to improve their managerial and
organizational capacities, with a focus on gender. Specific outcomes will
include: (i) an increase in annual milk production per lactating cow from
600 liters to 1,300 liters; (ii) decreased mortality of herds from 7 per cent to
4 per cent; and (iii) an increase in the percentage of women in managerial
positions within cooperatives from 14 per cent to 20 per cent.

(b) Component 2: Strengthening service providers. The project is expected
to enable service providers to substantially improve the frequency and quality
of their services, including technical assistance and provision of quality inputs.
Specifically: (i) the percentage of pregnant inseminated cows is expected to
increase from 45 per cent to 60 per cent; (ii) improved pastureland in the
project area will increase from 4,000 hectare to 8,000 hectare per year; and
(iii) 200 water-capture infrastructures will be rehabilitated.

(c) Component 3: Strengthening agro-industry. Through component 3, milk
and meat transport and industry processing capacity will be strengthened; the
exact outcomes will be defined by a value chain study. Expected outcomes
include: (i) an increase in transport capacity for the collection of milk; and
(ii) an increase of the processing capacity of the meat industry in Camagüey.

(d) Component 4: Project management and coordination. This component
consists of project management and monitoring and evaluation (M&E)
activities. It includes the development of strategy and operational guidelines,
and the responsibility for technically sound project implementation. The M&E
system will be an important input into the knowledge management agenda of
IFAD’s country programme, which is the basis for IFAD’s dialogue with the
Government on rural development.

III. Project implementation
ApproachA.

17. In line with experience from PRODECOR, the implementation approach is based on
the definition of community-driven CDPs. Through these plans, livestock farmers
will assess their strengths and weaknesses, and the opportunities and threats they
face, and define the most appropriate development strategy for their cooperatives.

18. In parallel with the development of the first CDPs, a participatory value chain
analysis will be carried out involving major stakeholders in the livestock sector. The
objective of this study is to identify the main weaknesses and entry points in the
milk and meat value chains in order to guide the development of
service-strengthening plans.

19. It is foreseen that cooperatives, most service providers and agro-industry
stakeholders will finance their investments through bank loans in the local currency
– mainly from the Bank for Credit and Trade. A similar mechanism is currently
being implemented through PRODECOR. Service providers such as environmental
agencies, institutes for land and water, and the University of Camagüey, which
cannot utilize credit, will be supported through budgetary allocations by the
Government.

20. The CDPs and service-strengthening plans are expected to be formulated over a
three-year period and each will have a time horizon of two to three years. The
overall duration of the project is expected to be six years.

B. Organizational framework
21. The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Foreign Investment will act as legal

representative of the borrower. The responsibility for execution will be delegated to
the Ministry of Agriculture, which regulates all activities related to milk and meat
production. Within the Ministry of Agriculture, the responsible agency will be the
Livestock Business Group, which is responsible for providing production and
business services to livestock cooperatives. The Ministry of Agriculture will also
coordinate agro-industry investments with the Ministry of Food Industry and the
Food Industry Business Group.

22. In order to benefit from lessons learned, a national coordination office for IFAD
projects in Cuba will be established at the Ministry of Agriculture, employing staff
from PRODECOR. This office will be in charge of: (i) supporting the definition of
participatory development plans; (ii) administration, financial management and
procurement; (iii) planning and M&E; and (iv) knowledge management, including
South-South cooperation, exchanges, seminars and studies.

23. In addition, a technical implementation unit will be established within the Livestock
Business Group with a main office in Havana and a local office in Camagüey.

24. An investment evaluation committee will be set up to evaluate the individual
investment plans of cooperatives, service providers and agro-industry stakeholders.
In addition, a national project steering committee will be established to approve
annual workplans and budgets, and provide strategic guidance. Both committees
will be comprised of representatives from government ministries; IFAD will be an
observer on the national project steering committee.

C. Planning, monitoring and evaluation, and learning and
knowledge management

25. A planning, M&E and knowledge management system will be established to provide
timely information on project performance and support continuous improvement of
project management. The system will be designed and launched during the first six
months of implementation, benefitting from the experience of PRODECOR. Its
purpose is to: (i) generate updated information on project goals, outputs, results
and impact; and (ii) facilitate learning, the exchange of experiences and best
practices, and the dissemination of project results.

26. A midterm review will be conducted to: (i) assess the cost recovery of the service
providers; (ii) evaluate the performance of the different types of cooperatives; and
(iii) analyse the performance and impact of the reference farms. As a result of this
midterm review, any necessary adjustments will be discussed with the Government.

27. The National Statistics and Information Office is expected to participate in the
development of the baseline survey, midterm review and final impact study.

D. Financial management, procurement and governance
28. Financial management. Financial management and procurement for the project

will be undertaken by the national office for the management of IFAD-funded
projects within the Ministry of Agriculture. This arrangement will capitalize on the
experience gained by PRODECOR staff and is expected to promote project
readiness. This project will utilize the same accounting system as PRODECOR,
which complies with minimum IFAD requirements.

29. The financial management and procurement systems used by public entities in
Cuba are in line with national regulatory authorities including the Office of the
Comptroller General, the Ministry of Finance and Pricing, the Ministry of Economy
and Planning, and the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Foreign Investment.
Compliance with the standards and procedures governing these systems is
mandatory for all government agencies. This requirement also applies to the
Livestock Business Group, the national coordination office and technical
implementation unit.

30. Based on Cuba’s 2015 Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index
score of 47 and IFAD’s experience in the country, the project’s fiduciary risk has
been rated as medium. The measures highlighted in this section, along with
implementation support, are considered sufficient to mitigate fiduciary risks.

31. Flow of funds. The borrower will open a designated account in euros at the Bank
for Credit and Trade exclusively for the loan proceeds. Operating accounts in
convertible pesos will be opened at the same bank and administered by the national
coordination office.

32. Audit. The project team will submit annual consolidated financial statements
compliant with international standards. The annual consolidated financial
statements will be independently audited in line with terms of reference approved
by IFAD and in accordance with the International Standards on Auditing and IFAD’s
Guidelines on Project Audits. Annual audit reports will be submitted to IFAD within
six months from the end of the each fiscal year.

33. Procurement. Goods from abroad will be procured using the services of the
Caribbean Citrus Anonymous Society, the Ministry of Agriculture’s specialized
import-export agency. The delivery of external acquisitions and domestic
procurement will be handled by the Ministry of Agriculture’s Business Logistics
Group and the Livestock Insurance and Services Company. The national
coordination office will be required to seek IFAD’s approval on a no-objection basis
before replacing the procurement agency. Minor purchases will be handled by the
national coordination office, which will apply the provisions and regulations detailed
in the project operating manual in accordance with IFAD’s procurement guidelines.

34. Governance. To promote good governance, IFAD applies a policy of zero tolerance
against fraud, corruption and misconduct.

E. Supervision
35. PRODEGAN will be directly supervised by IFAD in line with its policy on supervision

and implementation support. As the lead agency, IFAD will also supervise
implementation of the portion of the project financed by French Development
Agency (AFD) based on an agreement between AFD and IFAD. AFD will participate
in supervision missions and will approve all annual workplans and budgets,
procurement plans, terms of reference, reports of external evaluations and
requirements for annual audit reports related to AFD financing.

36. The first supervision mission is planned for the first year of the project and will
focus on operational and financial progress achieved during initial implementation.
It will include a review and assessment of the project’s financial management
arrangements. Subsequent supervision missions will take place annually, including
field visits to verify progress and evaluate any implementation problems.

37. Implementation-support activities during the first 18 months are expected to
include:(i) supporting the fulfilment of conditions for the first disbursement;
(ii) organizing a start-up workshop; (iii) training staff of the national coordination
office and technical implementation unit in the preparation of annual workplans and
budgets, procurement plans and withdrawal applications, and fiduciary
requirements and procurement procedures; (iv) supporting the preparation of an
implementation strategy, value chain study and progress reports for each project
component; and (v) supporting the design and set-up of the planning, M&E and
knowledge management system.

F. Exceptions to the General Conditions for Agricultural
Development Financing and IFAD’s operating policies

38. Expenses incurred from the date of approval by the Executive Board until the date
of entry into force of the financing agreement will be considered eligible up to a
ceiling of EUR 300,000 for activities related to: (i) adjustments to the accounting
system; (ii) the start-up workshop; (iii) the baseline survey and gender
methodology; (iv) the value chain study; and (v) equipping and operating the
national coordination office and the technical implementation unit. Depending on
the nature of expenditures, the costs of these activities will be charged against the
relevant categories of expenditures indicated in the financing agreement.

39. In addition, it was agreed with the Government of Cuba that as an exception to
section 14.04(a) of the General Conditions for Agricultural Development Financing,
the number of arbitrators will be three, and the provisions of article 9 of the
Arbitration Rules 2012 of the Permanent Court of Arbitration will apply.

IV. Project costs, financing and benefits
A. Project costs
40. The base cost of the project is US$47.5 million, plus estimated contingencies, for a

total cost of US$50 million. Of the total cost, 5 per cent is for physical contingencies
and price increases.

1 In accordance with the Agreement Establishing IFAD and the General Conditions for Agricultural Development
Financing, IFAD usually calculates the value of government contributions using the exchange rate published by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF). However, Cuba is not a member of the IMF. According to the Central Bank of Cuba
and the United Nations Operational Rates of Exchange, the exchange rate of US$/CUP is 1:1, and is therefore the rate
used in this document for the US dollars value of the government contribution expressed in local currency. There is no
actual rate for foreign currency transaction to and from CUP within the country, and the exchange rate from CUP to CUC
used for private transactions in the country is significantly different than the US$/CUP rate. The actual value of the
government contribution will be subject to external audit based on expenditures incurred.

B. Project financing
41. The project will be financed by: (i) an IFAD loan denominated in euros (equivalent

to approximately to US$11.9 million); (ii) a loan from AFD for EUR 25 million
(equivalent to approximately US$28.1 million); and (iii) a counterpart contribution
from the Government estimated at US$10 million.

42. IFAD and AFD loans will cofinance components 1 and 2; external financing of
component 3 (strengthening agro-industry) will be provided by AFD; and
component 4 (project management) will be financed by IFAD. The borrower’s
contribution will cofinance all components and taxes.

C. Summary benefit and economic analysis
43. The main benefits expected from the project are: (i) an increase in domestic milk

and meat production and sales (which reduces the need for imports); (ii) the
strengthening of actors along the milk and meat value chains; and (iii) an increase
in the participation of women and youth, ensuring a better quality of life for
cooperative members.

44. The financial analysis shows that considering prices in Cuba’s livestock sector, the
proposed investments are financially viable. The financial rate of return ranges from
38 per cent to 87 per cent (whereby credit and service cooperatives have higher
rates of return than cooperatives characterized by common ownership structures).

45. The economic analysis, which considers economic prices and costs, shows that the
proposed project is competitive with imports, with an economic rate of return of
14.8 per cent and a net present value of US$26 million.

D. Sustainability
46. The project design is based on the sustainable development of the cooperative

organizations, with support also extended to service providers and local
agro-industry. Measures to promote sustainability include: (i) a special budget
dedicated to increasing the participation of women and youth, enabling the
sustainable development of human capital; (ii) integrating the area’s main
environmental agencies as service providers in order to ensure the sustainable
management of natural resources and the adoption of climate change adaptation
measures; and (iii) involving local financial institutions (especially the Bank for
Credit and Trade) as loan providers to ensure the financial sustainability of the
investment plans.

E. Risk identification and mitigation
47. The main identified risks and mitigation measures are described below:

Main risks Mitigation strategy

Changes in Cuba’s current
policy framework could lead to
changes in relative prices.

The project will strengthen the productive, organizational and
entrepreneurial capacities of participating cooperatives, increasing their
adaptive capacities to possible market changes. This will be achieved
through capacity-building and the sustainable provision of equipment and
inputs to increase their productivity and competitiveness.

Climate variability poses a risk
to project activities.

To ensure the sustainable management of natural resources, the
formulation and implementation of CDPs will take into consideration the
environmental context in which cooperatives operate; the Government’s
environmental agencies will be involved in this process.

A lack of understanding of the
project strategy, methodology
and implementation procedures
may have adverse effects on
implementation.

The establishment of a single coordination office with experience from
the PRODECOR project will allow the project to benefit from the lessons
learned in terms of methodology, administration, financial management,
procurement and M&E.

V. Corporate considerations
Compliance with IFAD policiesA.

48. The project is consistent with IFAD’s Strategic Framework 2016-2025, and aims to
increase rural people’s productive capacities while supporting market participation
and strengthening the environmental sustainability and climate resilience of their
activities. The project is also compliant with IFAD’s policies on: (i) targeting, by
applying geographical targeting (by province, municipality and cooperative),
self-targeting (through participatory development plans) and social targeting
(focused on women and youth); (ii) gender, through its strategy aimed at closing
the gender gap and increasing women’s participation in cooperatives;
(iii) environmental and natural resource management, by supporting
climate-resilient production and the sustainable management of land and water
resources; and (iv) rural finance, by providing access to rural financial services.

Alignment and harmonizationB.
49. The proposed project is aligned with the Government’s agricultural sector reform

agenda, as outlined in the Economic and Social Policy Guidelines. This includes:
(i) fostering the autonomy and productivity of cooperatives; (ii) supporting free
competition by facilitating producers’ direct access to inputs, equipment and
markets; (iii) reducing the amount of unproductive land and increasing agricultural
yields in an environmentally sustainable manner; and (iv) ensuring that banking
services are available to the agro-industry sector. In addition, the project is aligned
with Cuba’s Intended Nationally Determined Contribution to the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change since it includes climate change
adaptation activities and mitigation measures (e.g. renewable energy sources).

50. IFAD has engaged with development partners such as the United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP), WFP, Food and Agriculture Organization of the
United Nations (FAO), the United Nations Industrial Development Organization
(UNIDO) and the European Union to ensure that the project is aligned with their
activities in the country. The project’s integrated approach, which considers value
chains and long-term environmental sustainability, is based on lessons learned
from two projects on environmental investments in milk production managed by
UNDP and financed by the European Union and the Swiss Agency for Development
and Cooperation.

Innovations and scaling upC.
51. The main innovations that the project will introduce are: (i) the establishment of

"service cooperatives" providing support to other cooperatives (e.g. hay and
ensilage services, and equipment maintenance); (ii) 10 reference farms for
observing and disseminating new technologies (four of which will develop

innovative environmental practices such as automatic meteorological systems,
solar-powered electric fences and biodigesters); and (iii) the establishment of
10 hectare of silvo-pastoral areas for each cooperative. Other innovations will be
demand driven, emerging from cooperatives’ development plans. These innovations
will be disseminated through knowledge-sharing activities.

52. If the project successfully meets its objectives, it could be scaled up to other
municipalities in Camagüey province and the neighboring provinces of Ciego de
Ávila and Las Tunas – potentially doubling the number of beneficiaries.

Policy engagementD.
53. Policy dialogue will be driven by the national project steering committee, which will

include representatives of the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Foreign Trade
and Foreign Investment, the Ministry of Food Industry, the Ministry of Science,
Technology and Environment, the Ministry of Economy and Planning, the National
Institute of Water Resources, the National Statistics and Information Office, the
Central Bank of Cuba and the Bank for Credit and Trade, with IFAD and AFD as
observers. This dialogue will cover: (i) lessons learned from project innovations and
their potential for scale-up; (ii) the results of efforts to increase the participation of
women and youth in the livestock sector; (iii) progress in establishing a financing
mechanism with the Bank for Credit and Trade; and (iv) any risks related to the
Cuban economy’s gradual liberalization and changes in relative prices, along with
mitigation strategies.

54. M&E and knowledge management activities during project implementation will
assist both the Government and IFAD in making better use of the policies for the
cooperative sector as detailed in the Economic and Social Policy Guidelines.

VI. Legal instruments and authority
55. A project financing agreement between the Republic of Cuba and IFAD will

constitute the legal instrument for extending the proposed financing to the
borrower. A copy of the negotiated financing agreement is attached as appendix I.

56. The Republic of Cuba is empowered under its laws to receive financing from IFAD.

57. I am satisfied that the proposed financing will comply with the Agreement
Establishing IFAD and the Policies and Criteria for IFAD Financing.

VII. Recommendation
58. I recommend that the Executive Board approve the proposed financing in terms of

the following resolution:

RESOLVED: that the Fund shall provide a loan on ordinary terms to the
Republic of Cuba in an amount equivalent to ten million nine hundred
thousand euros (10,900,000) (equivalent to US$11.9 million), and upon such
terms and conditions as shall be substantially in accordance with the terms
and conditions presented herein.

Recommendation for approval

The Executive Board is invited to approve the recommendation for the proposed
financing to the Republic of Ecuador for the Catalysing Inclusive Value Chain
Partnerships Project (DINAMINGA), as contained in paragraph 59.

Proposed loan and grant to the Republic of Ecuador for
the Catalysing Inclusive Value Chain Partnerships Project
(DINAMINGA)

I. Strategic context and rationale
A. Country and rural development and poverty context
1. The Republic of Ecuador is classified as an upper middle-income country. In 2015

the country posted GDP growth of 4.1 per cent, with inflation and external debt of
4.0 per cent and 20.4 per cent, respectively. With sustained growth over the past
decade has come an expansion in the public sector, broad-based reforms and social
programmes, and upgraded infrastructure, particularly roads. This modernization
process has been funded largely with oil revenues. However, the gradual decline in
oil prices since 2014, difficulty accessing new sources of financing and dollar
appreciation have affected the general government budget, which was cut by
2.2 per cent of GDP in 2016.

2. The economic deceleration and contraction in domestic demand contributed to
pushing up poverty from 22.5 per cent to 23.3 per cent between 2014 and 2015,
resulting in a rise in rural poverty from 35.3 per cent to 39.3 per cent. Despite the
progress made on inequality, poverty and expanding access to services, the gaps
between urban and rural and vulnerable people – indigenous, Montubian and
Afro-Ecuadorean people – are even more marked. In addition, the current
macro-economic situation places this progress in jeopardy. Many of the families
who have risen above the poverty threshold are in a vulnerable situation that could
easily revert to absolute poverty.

3. In this context, one of this administration’s priority objectives is to make a shift in
production patterns by promoting the value chain approach and adding value to
commodities in order to boost exports.

B. Rationale and alignment with government priorities and
RB-COSOP

4. The project originated in the realization by the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock,
Aquaculture and Fisheries (MAGAP) that providing production support is not
sufficient to enable smallholder farmers to overcome poverty. What is needed is to
identify promising subsectors and act along the entire value chain to distribute
returns more fairly. To contribute to sustainable rural development it is crucial to
seek institutional partnerships with the private sector, in order to match supply to
demand and enable smallholder producers to benefit from market opportunities and
raise their incomes. The project’s collaboration with the Ministry of Industry and
Productivity (MIPRO) is a response to these needs, and the partnership with IFAD is
taking place in the context of major government policies.

5. The project is aligned with the strategic objectives of the country strategic
opportunities programme (COSOP), which are as follows: (i) to improve access to
assets and resources to support the diversification of Ecuador's rural economy by
promoting, inter alia, associational initiatives and investments that generate
employment and income for poor rural families in Ecuador; and (ii) build the

..]

capacities of poor rural producers and potential entrepreneurs to enable them to
participate in and benefit from the formulation of inclusive, pro-poor production
policies.

II. Project description
A. Project area and target group
6. The selected area includes 65 cantons in the provinces of Orellana, Napo

(Amazonia), Imbabura (Sierra Norte), Cotopaxi, Chimborazo, Bolívar and
Tungurahua (Sierra Centro), Guayas, Los Ríos, Manabí and Esmeraldas (Costa), the
latter two seriously affected by the earthquake earlier in 2016.

7. The selection criteria included the incidence of poverty in terms of unmet basic
needs and consumption; the presence of vulnerable groups; production volumes in
the selected subsectors; and the existence of smallholder producers organizations
(SPOs) in the value chains considered, with access to collection and/or processing
infrastructure.

8. The project target group comprises approximately 20,000 rural smallholder
producer families deriving most of their family incomes directly from one of the
selected subsectors – fine flavour or flavour cacao, blackberries and golden
berries – and are living near the poverty line.

9. The smallholder producers considered include people of mixed race (Montubians
from the Coastal area), and indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorean people. The social
targeting criteria are intended to promote the inclusion of smallholder producer
families and limit resource capture by non-needy families, and to adapt the project
to regional characteristics.

B. Project development objective
10. The goal of the Catalysing Inclusive Value Chain Partnerships Project (DINAMINGA)

is to improve the living conditions of smallholder families in strategic sectors. The
development objective is to improve the incomes of smallholder families producing
cacao, blackberries and golden berries within the project area.

11. The aim is to generate an increase in the margins derived from value addition and
redistribute income within the priority value chains so that profits reach smallholder
producers.

C. Components/outcomes
12. Component 1: Promoting partnerships1 by smallholder producers with the

agribusiness sector and markets. The objective is to forge win-win partnerships
between smallholder producers and agro-industrial enterprises, to enhance the
impact and sustainability of business initiatives supported within the selected value
chains. The expected outcome is better market access for the targeted smallholder
producers. Activities include: promoting commercial partnerships among value
chain actors; promoting trade in the selected subsectors; building competencies
and capacities for partnerships; and promoting access to financial products and
services.

13. Component 2: Building sustainable production, associational and
entrepreneurial capacities of smallholder producers. The objective is to
improve the capacities of targeted smallholder producers to boost productivity,
enhance quality, generate value added, and improve management and governance
of their production organizations or family enterprises. This component will
cofinance the execution of gap-closing plans. Activities include: promoting

1 Minga (mink'a or minga in quechua) means collective work done for the community; minca derives from
the quechua minccacuni, "to ask for help while promising something"). It refers to a pre-Columbian tradition of voluntary
community or collective work for a common (social) or reciprocal purpose. In Ecuador the term "minga" has been used
in the term “Gran Minga del Cacao nacional”, part of the MAGAP National Programme.

agricultural and post-harvest good practices; building entrepreneurial, associational
and gender equality capacities; and generating capacities to access financial
services.

14. Component 3: Knowledge development, management and administration.
This component consists of a planning, M&E, knowledge management, and
management and administration systems.

III. Project execution
A. Approach
15. Ecuador’s export agriculture sector, which provides 25 per cent of total

employment, plays a dominant role in the economy and contributed 36 per cent of
GDP in 2015, but continues to be a two-tier system. On one hand is a dynamic and
industrialized sector of medium-sized and large enterprises engaging in intensive
monocropping of banana, flowers and African palm. On the other, holding potential
for improvement – in cacao, coffee and fruit – is a sector composed of smallholder
producers who are the country’s poorest and do not as yet participate in value
chains with strong demand from domestic and international markets.

16. The fine flavour cacao and non-traditional Andean fruit (blackberry and golden
berry) value chains were selected on the basis of rising broad-based demand on
domestic and global markets, high potential for improvement, producers living in
conditions of poverty and vulnerability, and areas with high poverty rates.

17. IFAD will contribute significant value added under this project on the basis of past
experience in the cacao sector through public-private-producer partnerships (4Ps)
with local governments and cacao processors; previous projects in Ecuador; and
agro-enterprise operating models. The analysis done by IFAD shows the need for
flexibility and adaptability to different contexts. Moreover, three cases in the cacao
sector – in the Dominican Republic, Indonesia and Sao Tome and
Principe – have shown that an immediately operational and market-oriented private
sector allows for greater efficiency in projects.

18. The selected value chains feature similar constraints on allowing producers to
garner a larger share of the benefits. These are both endogenous – relating to
production, productivity, quality, traceability, certification and lack of business
capacity – and exogenous – a high level of intermediation, lack of recognition for
weight and quality of the products, and volatile prices. This creates an obstacle to
achieving stable quality in the supply of raw or processed materials, and to building
trust between members, and between members and buyers.

19. The project has been designed around the structure of the selected value chains,
both associational and individual, to address all bottlenecks identified within
them: at the production stage for Andean fruit, and in processing and marketing,
the main links in the chain, in the case of cacao. The strategic orientation set out by
MAGAP and MIPRO calls for linking producers’ associations to business demand both
on the domestic market and for export, including niche markets such as the organic
and fair trade segments. The strategy follows the 4P model, which consists of
building partnerships between the public sector, the private sector and smallholder
producers, represented by their leaders, with intermediation and facilitation by the
public sector, represented by the executing agencies MAGAP and MIPRO. To reflect
Ecuador's diverse realities, the model has been adapted to different
modalities. Through these, the aim is to facilitate and support the matching of
supply and demand so that supply responds to the requirements of demand, better
prices are obtained in recognition of quality and the level of intermediation is
lowered.

20. The greatest possible number of targeted beneficiaries will be reached by adopting
differentiated approaches. The project calls for: (i) an economies of scale approach



EB 2016/119/R.27/Rev.1

4

A
p
p
en

d
ix II

[C
lick h

ere an
d
 in

sert E

..]

by supporting selected SPOs in providing timely marketing and other services to
member and non-member providers; (ii) a family business approach in the form of
support for individual smallholder producers to enable them, through their leaders,
to participate in partnerships with enterprises; (iii) a women in development and
youth approach to ensure that opportunities to access project resources and
services are available equally to women and men involved in the cacao, blackberry
and golden berry production chains, by setting gender and age quotas for
beneficiaries and introducing affirmative action measures; and (iv) a vulnerable
population approach by including indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorean people among
the targeted producers.

21. The operating strategy contemplates two kinds of complementary support: support
for off-farm activities managed by organizations with at least one collection centre,
in the form of subsidies (nonreimbursable transfers) conditional upon the fulfilment
of terms agreed under the 4P partnership; and direct on-farm support for individual
smallholder producers, considering their family businesses as rural
microenterprises. The objective is for activities by organizations and farms to
conform to conditions demanded by the market and for producers to gain greater
capacities, empower themselves and strengthen their links with organizations and
agribusinesses.

B. Organizational framework
22. The executing agency is MAGAP, through a project executing unit (PEU) within the

organizational structure of MAGAP that will provide administration, coordination,
supervision, support and M&E, together with MIPRO and pursuant to a specific
agreement.

23. Project implementation will be outsourced to an operator. MAGAP will be
responsible for relations with the National Planning and Development Secretariat
(SENPLADES), the Ministry of Finance and IFAD in connection with budget
allocation, withdrawal requests and reports on the project’s technical and financial
progress.

C. Planning, M&E, and learning and knowledge management
24. The project will perform planning, M&E, and learning and knowledge management

(PMELKM) functions in accordance with national and MAGAP provisions on PMELKM
and IFAD guidelines contained in the Project M&E Manual and General Conditions
for Financing. A conceptual and methodological document will be prepared outlining
the main orientations of PMELKM, highlighting the respective responsibilities of
MAGAP, MIPRO and the operator, the schedule of activities and the expected
outcomes.

25. The main approach guiding the planning and M&E functions is the managing for
development results (MfDR) approach, which calls for obtaining observable and
verifiable change for the target group. MfDR falls within the MAGAP’s governing for
results (GfR) initiative whereby MAGAP generates information on previously
established indicators. MfDR will be applied in project execution and in planning and
M&E by adopting the following principles: effectiveness in achieving objectives;
quality in serving people’s needs; transparency and accountability;
complementarity with other public agencies; citizen participation; learning
promotion; and continuity through institutional strengthening.

26. This methodology is supported by an automated tool to systematize and monitor
results. SENPLADES engages in medium- and long-term M&E in connection with the
quantifiable targets set in the National Development Plan. The coordinating
ministries monitor short-term commitments through the Managing for Governance
System (SIGOB).

27. The planning and M&E system will conform to the requirements of the M&E
subsystems of GfR, the Public Administration Secretariat, SIGOB, the Ministry of

Production, Employment and Competitiveness and the Integrated Financial
Management System (SIGEF) of the Ministry of Finance.

28. An impact assessment plan has been agreed upon with the Government of Ecuador.
The quasi-experimental methodology will allow for a comparison of results by
producers and SPOs benefiting from the project (treatment group) with similar
producers and organizations that have not received any benefits (control group).
The intention is to measure the project’s causal impact on indicators of interest,
such as household income, production and sales, and other variables.

D. Financial management, procurement and governance
29. Financial management. Financial management will take place through the PEU

financial unit which, in coordination with the MAGAP Financial Administration
Coordination Office, will be responsible for proper administration of the resources.
The main responsibilities of the PEU financial unit will be as follows: (i) ensure that
the project has adequate liquidity and prepare withdrawal requests; (ii) review the
Plan of Action (POA) and prepare the annual procurement plan; (iii) make the
necessary arrangements for yearly budget allocations; (iv) manage disbursements
to the operator; (v) review the operator’s financial statements and relevant
documentation and monitor the operator’s financial management; (vi) prepare
annual financial statements and deliver them to IFAD; (vii) contract the audit firm
and deliver the annual audit report to IFAD; and (viii) ensure fulfilment of the
fiduciary conditions of the financial agreement.

30. Operationally, the project will be implemented by an operator selected by MAGAP
under a competitive and transparent process based on national public contracting
regulations and in accordance with IFAD guidelines on project procurement. IFAD
will evaluate the proposed operator’s financial management before the contracting
process is finalized. The findings of the financial management evaluation will be one
of the criteria considered by IFAD in issuing its non objection to contracting the
operator.

31. Based on the country’s rating of 32 on the Transparency International Corruption
Perceptions Index, as well as IFAD’s experience in the country, the project fiduciary
risk is considered moderate. The financial management arrangements provided for
this project, together with close implementation support by IFAD, are considered
sufficient to mitigate this fiduciary risk.

32. Flow of funds. The borrower will open and maintain two designated accounts in
United States dollars exclusively for advance deposit of the loan and grant
proceeds, respectively.

33. Audit. The project will prepare annual consolidated financial statements in
accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The
consolidated financial statements will be audited annually by an independent
private auditor in accordance with IFAD Project audit guidlines and international
auditing standards. All of the project accounts will be audited, including all financing
sources. The auditor’s terms of reference will include a detailed review of the
financial transactions carried out by th eoperator and all relevant documentation.
The audit reports will be submitted to IFAD within the first six months following the
end of the fiscal year under review.

34. Procurement. Procurement will take place in accordance with the Organic Law on
the National Public Procurement System and regulations, provided they are
compatible with IFADs’ procurement guidelines.

E. Supervision
35. IFAD will provide support for project implementation in the manner deemed most

advisable by the parties, seeking to improve effectiveness and ensure that the
objectives and desired outcomes are achieved. In addition, IFAD, in coordination

with MAGAP and MIPRO, will supervise the project directly, in accordance with the
Policy on Supervision and Implementation Support.

36. The implementation support and supervision plan will seek to contribute to reaching
the targets set and will monitor compliance with the commitments, provisions and
standards set forth in the financing agreement and operating manual. Support will
be provided from the time of formulation, taking advantage of the various
phases – review, negotiation, approval – for proper preparation of start-up. Among
other activities, plans call for providing support as follows: start-up workshop,
annual supervisión (two per year at the initial stage), midterm review and closing
workshop, and ongoing activities in support of execution. The plan will initially focus
on ensuring operating capacity for project management; preparing annual
workplans and procurement plans; and consolidate financial management
arrangements.

IV. Costs, financing, benefits

C. Summary benefit and economic analysis
39. In the farm models, the financial internal rate of return (FIRR) is higher than the

discount rate and the financial net present value (FNPV), at an average of
US$3,000, demonstrates the project's financial feasibility to a 10-year horizon.

40. Strengthening the associations and improving their production capacities is
expected to generate the following benefits: an increase in household assets of
19 per cent over the baseline, and an average increase in incomes of
21 per cent. This gives an idea of the prospects for the associations' sustainability,
improved access to value chains and better negotiating power with buyers.

41. The cost estimate done for economic feasibility took into account adjustments for
transfers to direct beneficiaries, strengthening of organizations, investments in
upgrading infrastructure and equipment; adjustments to price contingencies;
adjustments to value-added taxes to reflect transfer payments; adjustments to
economic prices for inputs, tradable goods and the social discount rate.

42. The results obtained show that the project is economically feasible, with an
economic IRR of 28.50 per cent; economic NPV of incremental net return of
US$23.9 million and a cost-benefit ratio of 1.77.

43. The project’s sensitivity analysis and economic feasibility indicators show that it is
more sensitive to a price reduction where with a fall of 10 per cent the EIRR falls to
12.18 per cent and a reduction in returns where a fall of 14 per cent causes a fall in
EIRR to 12.51 per cent. In addition, with a reduction in returns of
20 per cent the EIRR is 22.94 per cent and a cost increase of 20 per cent leads to
an EIRR 22.94 per cent. In terms of delays, the project can withstand two years
and still maintain positive returns above the discount rate.

D. Sustainability
44. The project will promote a match between supply and demand of quality products,

and will make use of existing financial services available in the marketplace, adapt
them to potential demand and enable the two parties to negotiate the services they
need and the prerequisites for accessing such services, with support and mediation
from the Government in its capacity as intermediary. This matching of supply and
demand will serve as the basis for the partnerships and will contribute to their long-
term sustainability, even after the project's conclusion.

45. Success in terms of the scope of goal and objectives, sustainability and replicability,
lies in strengthening the actors involved and their partnerships: SPOs and both
female and male members, both formal and comercial; enterprises; and
institutions. This institutional strengthening and consolidation of capacities for
analysis, training, marketing and formulation of proposals will be achieved with
training and advisory assistance, and with the same participation and shared

responsibility of the target groups and their involvement in the project M&E
process.

E. Risk identification and mitigation
46. The project’s socio-environmental classification is B in accordance with IFAD's

Social, Environmental and Climate Assessment Procedures. The project will not
finance activities covered by category A of IFAD’s environmental policy. All of the
risks and adverse environmental and social impacts are avoidable.

47. The climate vulnerability classification is moderate. The project is in line with the
National Climate Change Plan 2015-2018, which prioritizes agricultura, water
management, ecosystems, energy and capacity-building in environmental risk
management.

48. The main risks identified with a medium or high probability of occurring are given
below.

Risk Probability Mitigation strategy
No timely fiscal allocation and no
adequate countryl counterpart
contribution

Medium  MAGAP, MIPRO and IFA will exert all their influence to
ensure that the required amount is allocated in a timely
manner.
 Minimum country counterpart is set in view of the current
macroeconomic context and budget us in Ecuador

Demand for financing from collection
centres is limited given difficulties
meeting the requirements of financial
institutions

Medium Training and technical assistance (component 3) will support
organizations and overcome barriers in financial idiom,
procedures and consultations to meet requirements

Financial institutions are not interested
in financing producers’ organizations

Medium Training and assistance to financial institutions should
underscore promotion of the three agroindustrial value
chains and report on l inkages and opportunities for serving
this market niche

Liquidity in the financial sector
continues to fall to levels that do not
allow for earmarking resources to
these segments

High More emphasis will need to be given to international banks,
especially in the case of the export of products.

Unforeseen losses as a result of
market instability, sudden contraction
in demand, unusual drops in global
prices and the lack of a mechanism to
differentiate prices in the International
Coffee Organization and global
commodity exchanges, as well as
extreme climate events.

High The project promotes moving producers closer to
compensation mechanisms that can cover, albeit in part,
unforeseen losses for any of the reasons indicated
(emergency fund, insurance)

Main environmental risks: use of
agrochemicals, loss of genetic
biodiversity of cacao, improper
management of solid and liquid waste

Medium Financing investments at the collection level will be
conditional on developing an environmental profile, in
accordance with national environmental regulations, and
compliance by business plans with the sustainable
environmental management principles set forth in the
Operating Manual, the Guide on Coffee Growing Best
Practices, and the Cacao Post-harvest Best Practices
Manual (MAGAP)

Cadmium content in Ecuadorean
cacao not permitted in the European
and U.S. markets

Medium Field tests to identify the main causes, pilot interventions and
generalization of practices that limit the fixing of cadmium in
cacao

Main climate risks: reduced availability
of water during dry months (Sierra);
lower yields and plant production
capacity (Sierra); higher likelihood of
floods and landslides (Costa and
Amazonía);2 increase and distribution
of pests and their vectors

Medium Funded infrastructure should take the minimum
considerations of environmental safeguards and include a
localization analysis. Construction of infrastructure will
include the principles of labour security, risk analysis
(seismic risks), and will take place outside areas of flooding,
landslides or geological faults

2 Flooding and landslides are among the primary four threats to the country in the provinces of the Coast region, and to a
lesser extent in the Sierra and Amazon regions.

V. Corporate considerations
A. Compliance with IFAD policies
49. The project complies with the main IFAD policies on targeting rural poor people,

gender equality and women’s empowerment, implementation in relation to
indigenous peoples, natural resources management and environment, and strategy
on climate change.

B. Harmonization and alignment
50. The project is fully aligned with the priority government policy to effect a shift in

production patters, as set forth in the National Plan for Good Living 2013-2017, and
with three of the main government policies: the National Strategy for Equality and
Poverty Eradication (ENIEP, SENPLADES, 2014); Ecuadorean Agricultural Policy and
Sustainable Territorial Rural Development 2015-2025 (MAGAP, 2016). In addition,
the project will directly address the COSOP strategic objectives based on the results
for 2014-2018.

51. Linkages were developed with other donors through their initiatives in support of
the private sector (Multilateral Investment Fund of the Inter-American Development
Bank, the Development Bank of Latin America) during implementation of the
project to improve private investment.

52. Also, within the framework of collaboration among the Rome-based agencies, the
project will be supported by FAO in developing and implementing the nutrition pilot
in the cantons prioritized for their higher incidence of malnutrition and integrated
disease and pest management.

C. Innovation and scaling up
53. The innovation by the project is to put forward the 4P model, adapted to the

diverse realities of Ecuador, as the central thrust of the approach, and seeks to
replicate successful partnership models.

54. Knowledge management will include activities to collect, share and capitalize on
knowledge accumulated during project execution, with the goal of disseminating
best practices and practical knowledge available in the project territories.

D. Policy engagement
55. The compilation of experiences and learnings, and exchanges between actors

responsable for MAGAP and MIPRO and their members, will contribute to improving
their operations, and will serve as practical information on the use and functionality
of public policies, helping with reform as needed. The project will build the
capacities of these actors and the leaders of beneficiary organizations.

VI. Legal instruments and powers
56. A financing agreement between the Republic of Ecuador and IFAD will constitute

the legal instrument for extending the proposed financing to the borrower/recipient.
A copy of the negotiated financing agreement is attached in appendix I.

57. The Republic of Ecuador is empowered under its laws to receive financing from
IFAD.

58. I am satisfied that the proposed financing will comply with the Agreement
Establishing IFAD and the Lending Policies and Criteria.

Recommendation for approval

The Executive Board is invited to approve the recommendation for the proposed
loan to the Republic of Nicaragua for the Nicaraguan Dry Corridor Rural Family
Sustainable Development Project (NICAVIDA), as contained in paragraph 33.

Proposed loan to the Republic of Nicaragua for the
Nicaraguan Dry Corridor Rural Family Sustainable
Development Project (NICAVIDA)

I. Strategic context and rationale
A. Country and rural development and poverty context
1. The Republic of Nicaragua covers an area of 129,494 km² and has a population of

6.17 million people. The country has experienced macroeconomic stability and
sustained economic growth over recent decades. GDP increased between 2010 and
2014 by an average of 4.7 per cent per annum, reaching US$1,904 per capita in
2014. The agricultural sector accounted for 17 per cent of national GDP in 2014,
following a gradual reduction begun in the 1990s. Nonetheless, the sector
generates 31 per cent of employment and 70 per cent of overall exports, signalling
that Nicaragua’s economy remains in transition, with a significant presence in the
productive agricultural sector.

2. The 2014 National Household Living Standards Survey (NHLSS) found 29.6 per cent
of the population to be living below the poverty line and 8.3 per cent in extreme
poverty. These figures reflect a significant improvement on those from the 2009
NHLSS (42.5 per cent and 14.6 per cent, respectively). In rural areas over the
same period, the overall poverty rate decreased from 63.3 per cent to
50.1 per cent of rural population and the number affected by extreme poverty
declined from 26.8 per cent to 16.3 per cent. Despite this significant progress in
poverty reduction, half of the rural population still lives in poverty. Nicaragua is
highly vulnerable to extreme weather events: 25 per cent of the population lives in
locations at risk of hurricanes and tropical storms while 40 per cent is affected by
recurrent drought, with Dry Corridor inhabitants and food production feeling the
greatest effects.

B. Rationale and alignment with government priorities and
RB-COSOP

3. The proposed project is aligned with the IFAD country strategy as articulated in the
results-based country strategic opportunities programme (COSOP) (2013-2017).
NICAVIDA is further aligned with current policy priorities and follows the axes of the
national “Dry Corridor Strategic Framework” implemented by the Government in
response to the severe social, productive and environmental conditions affecting
the area. Under that Framework and in support of the Government’s programmatic
approach, the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit will coordinate the investments
of international and development organizations, such as the World Bank, the Inter-
American Development Bank, the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation,
the Central American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI) and IFAD.

4. As the factors contributing to rural poverty in the Dry Corridor not only persist but
worsen, the incidence of malnutrition in rural areas must be addressed. According
to the National Demographic and Health Survey 2011-2012, 21 per cent of boys
and girls aged less than five years in rural areas exhibit overall chronic
malnutrition. The Dry Corridor has a higher overall incidence (for rural and urban

areas combined) of chronic malnutrition (29.5 per cent in Madriz and 27.7 per cent
in Nueva Segovia). Agricultural activities are carried out against a backdrop of
deteriorating micro/sub-basins, depleting water resources and plant cover, and soil
degradation. The situation is further exacerbated by climate change and volatility,
with production projected to decline significantly.

5. NICAVIDA will support the economic diversification and productive transformation
strategies of families in rural areas, developing articulated links between the
diversification of their sources of income, environmental protection, adaptation to
climate change and food and nutrition security. To that end, the project builds on
lessons learned from previous IFAD-financed operations, including the Programme
for the Economic Development of the Dry Region in Nicaragua (PRODESEC), the
Technical Assistance Fund, the Inclusion of Small-scale Producers in Value Chains
and Market Access Project (PROCAVAL), the Agricultural, Fishery and Forestry
Productive Systems Development Programme in RAAN and RAAS Indigenous
Territories and the Adapting to Markets and Climate Change Project (NICADAPTA).
Those operations contributed to the implementation of national public policies and
proved successful in facilitating public investment processes, increased production
and productivity, food production, climate change-adaptation investments and
income generation.

II. Project description
A. Project area and target group
6. The NICAVIDA project area covers 58 municipios in the Dry Corridor. As per

agreement with the Government, initial project phases will prioritize the 37
municipios with the highest rates of poverty and at greatest risk of food and
nutrition insecurity and climate vulnerability. Natural ecosystems in the Dry
Corridor are undergoing severe degradation, with 52 per cent of soils overused and
40 per cent strongly or severely eroded. Falling production has led to food
insecurity and a decline in household incomes in rural parts of the area.

7. The target population of NICAVIDA comprises poor rural people and indigenous
peoples, with or without land, with a particular focus on women and young people.
The project will directly benefit 30,000 families, approximately 152,000 people,
characterized by the diversity of the activities in which they engage, combining
strategies for agricultural production with labour market integration. Rural
households living in the 37 priority municipios in 2015 were estimated to total
122,000, 11.2 per cent of which identified as indigenous.

B. Project development objective
8. The overall objective of NICAVIDA is to contribute to the attainment of national

targets to improve the living standards of rural families and indigenous peoples in
the Dry Corridor. The development objective is to support poor rural families in the
project area, including indigenous peoples, in boosting their incomes, enhancing the
nutritional content of their diets and strengthening their capacities to adapt to
climate change. Beneficiary incomes will be increased through the productive and
economic diversification of their activities, while their resilience to climate change
will be enhanced by the sustainable management of natural resources.

C. Components/outcomes
9. NICAVADA will be organized around the following three components:

 Component 1. Capacity-building and planning. This component will put in
place the conditions to allow families and their organizations, taking into
account their resources and climatic, economic and social context, to map their
own paths towards development that will allow them to improve their incomes,
strengthen their food and nutrition security, and enhance their resilience and
capacities to adapt to climate change.

..]

This component will address two strategic themes: (i) the food and nutrition
security of families, ensuring access to nutritious food and an adequate diet;
and (ii) natural resource management and adaptation to climate change,
strengthening capacities to manage natural resources sustainably,
incorporating climate change-adaptation practices and adopting strategies to
reduce vulnerability to production- and climate-related risks. This component
will achieve: (i) project targeting, both geographically and towards families,
indigenous peoples and communities, prioritizing women and young people;
(ii) adaptation to the territorial, socioeconomic and environmental context of
the Dry Corridor; (iii) the provision of training to build families’ capacities to
manage economic and social strategies; and (iv) capacity-building to increase
employment, business and productive opportunities.

The implementation of this component will be based on participatory
assessments used to develop family plans and business plans to promote
productive diversification and agricultural and non-agricultural income-
generating activities. Moreover, territorial plans will be developed, based on the
demands of families, organizations and institutions, to meet needs in terms of
productive infrastructure, the stewardship and management of natural
resources, access to water, road improvement and management of
microbasins.

 Component 2. Family, territorial and business investments. This
component includes the activities and resources for the implementation of the
family, business and territorial plans. Once approved by the project
management unit (PMU) within the Ministry for Family, Community,
Cooperative and Associative Economy (MEFCCA) pursuant to the relevant
approval mechanism detailed in the project implementation manual (PIM),
these plans will be financed under this component with funds allocated under
the Project’s Family, Territorial and Business Investment Fund (FTE). The PMU
will manage the FTE directly, in accordance with the standards and procedures
defined in the PIM.

The FTE will be able to finance: (i) territorial plans targeting investments in
public goods and services that will create conditions conducive to improving the
living standards of families in rural areas and of indigenous peoples; (ii) family
plans, seeking to improve how families use and manage their resources (land,
manpower, cash), agricultural and non-agricultural activities, and food and
nutrition security, and to boost income and quality of life; (iii) business plans,
aiming to promote the link between family income strategies, environmental
protection and adaptation to climate change. Such plans may include
productive agricultural activities, value-addition, access-to-market and small
business development activities, as well as commercial, service and
microenterprise activities.

 Component 3. Project management. This component seeks to ensure
effective and efficient project implementation and to build capacity for the
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of project activities, results and impact. A
timely, efficient and effective implementation system will be established within
MEFCCA at the central and district levels, with attention to inter-institutional
coordination. With regard to planning, monitoring and evaluation (PM&E), it is
hoped that IFAD-financed MEFCCA projects will have a single M&E system. This
component includes project management and administration, which comes
under MEFCCA’s institutional responsibilities, and shall be in coordination with
other IFAD-financed projects.

III. Project implementation
ApproachA.

10. Project activities follow an approach that places central importance on families and
on the territory of the project area. In this context, through the family, territorial and
business plans, it is hoped that the following will be achieved: (i) at the family level,
families are able to make adequate use of their resources (land, manpower, cash)
and pursue their own development strategies, improving food and nutrition security
and building resilience to climate change; (ii) at the territorial and indigenous
community levels, investments in public goods and services create an environment
conducive to improving the living standards of rural families and indigenous peoples,
including behavioural changes that enhance natural resource management, resilience
to climate change and inhabitants’ nutrition; and (iii) in the context of business plans,
families and their organizations embark on a process of rural transformation, linking
income generation and diversification with environmental protection and food and
nutrition security, and strengthening their resilience to climate change.

B. Organizational framework
11. MEFCCA will be responsible for project implementation. A PMU will be established

under the MEFCCA Project Division to coordinate and manage the project. In
coordination with IFAD operations already under way, a number of specialized units
will be set up to deal with financial management, procurement, PM&E and
knowledge management and will service all projects in IFAD’s portfolio. District-
level MEFCCA offices will play a key operational role and will be responsible for the
activities in their respective districts. The project will involve measures and
activities requiring the active participation of specialized entities – such as the
Ministry for the Environment and Natural Resources (MARENA), the Nicaraguan
Institute of Agricultural Technology (INTA) and the Nicaraguan Institute of
Territorial Studies (INETER), among others – with which specific agreements will be
established.

C. Planning, monitoring and evaluation, and learning and
knowledge management

12. NICAVIDA will implement a PM&E and knowledge management system based on
lessons learned from previous IFAD operations in the country. The project will
establish an M&E system, with short-term reporting (institutional, administrative
and first-level Results and Impact Management System (RIMS) reports), medium-
term reporting (national and sectorial statistics and second-level RIMS reports) and
long-term reporting (National Human Development Plan indicators and third-level
RIMS reports). Knowledge management will ensure the use of information and the
incorporation of lessons learned on key issues such as fiduciary aspects, business
plan implementation, climate change adaptation and food and nutrition security.
The project will complement and support the NICADAPTA efforts to establish a
MEFCCA PM&E system. A baseline study will be carried out immediately following
the adoption of the financing agreement by the IFAD Executive Board and prior to
project launch.

D. Financial management, procurement and governance
13. Financial management. MEFCCA will be charged with the financial management

of all project resources, in particular flow of funds, disbursements, internal controls,
accounting, financial reporting and audit. A specialized financial management unit
will be established within MEFCCA for all projects financed or cofinanced by IFAD.

14. Flow of funds. IFAD will open and deposit the loan principal in an account in
United States dollars in the name of the borrower. To receive the loan funds, the
borrower shall open and maintain in the Central Bank of Nicaragua an account
designated in United States dollars, under the control of the General Treasury of
the Republic, in which advance funds shall be deposited and from which funds will

be transferred to the operational account(s) of the project in MEFCCA. The latter
accounts will be opened by the borrower on terms acceptable to the Fund.

15. Retroactive financing. Expenses incurred prior to the date of entry into force of
the financing agreement will be considered eligible up to a total amount of
US$250,000, in accordance with and as specified in the financing agreement.

16. Procurement. Project procurement of goods and services will be carried out in
accordance with IFAD Project Procurement Guidelines and in accordance with the
provisions of the loan agreement. The specialized procurement unit will plan and
execute procurement processes. Any procurement required under the plans
developed by beneficiary families and organizations will be completed in compliance
with private commercial practices, in accordance with the procedures set out in the
PIM and the MEFCCA “Technical and Financial Administrative Rules”, and shall be
compatible with IFAD Guidelines. Any procurement to be carried out under the
territorial plans through agreements or contracts with public or private institutions
shall be governed by the applicable laws and must comply with IFAD guidelines.

17. Audit. The annual accounts and financial statements of the project will be
independently audited, pursuant to the terms of reference and in accordance with
International Standards on Audit and the IFAD Guidelines on Project Audits. Within
a period not longer than three (3) months from the effective date of project launch,
MEFCCA will engage an independent, external private company acceptable to IFAD
to audit the project. The annual report shall be submitted to IFAD within the six
months following the close of the fiscal year.

18. Governance and control. Principles of good governance, transparency and
participation will be agreed by all relevant parties, primarily MEFCCA and the
groups, organizations, communities and institutions involved in the project. These
agreements and procedures will be reflected in the PIM.

E. Supervision
19. IFAD will directly supervise the project and carry out implementation support

missions. As far as possible, such missions will be conducted in combination with
the supervision of other projects of the IFAD-financed portfolio in the country. The
first project supervision mission will take place approximately six months from the
entry into force of the project financing agreement. That mission will evaluate
progress against the timeline established in the implementation plan, and verify
progress on fiduciary aspects, expenditures, counterpart contributions and
compliance with the terms of the loan agreement. The second mission will take
place six months after the first.

IV. Project costs, financing and benefits
A. Project costs
20. The total cost of NICAVIDA over the six-year implementation period will be

US$48.46 million, comprising US$45.54 million in baseline costs (94 per cent of the
total cost) and US$2.92 million for physical and price contingencies (6 per cent of
total cost). Components 1 and 2 account for 93 per cent of base costs of the
project, with the majority of these funds going directly to beneficiaries and their
organizations. Project management (component 3) accounts for 8 per cent of base
costs.

C. Summary benefit and economic analysis
22. NICAVIDA will benefit 30,000 families in rural areas (approximately 152,100

people). It is estimated that: (a) 13,450 families will receive support to improve
their nutrition and food security, acquire non-agricultural income-generating
activities and improve their working conditions; (b) 14,500 families will receive a
combination of support in the areas of food security and agricultural production and
diversification, agricultural and non-agricultural income generation, and business
plans; (c) 2,050 families will receive a combination of the support above and will
develop productive processes and agricultural diversification through business plans
incorporating technology and cash crops. The economic internal rate of return is
22.7 per cent and the net present value is US$20.8 million.

D. Sustainability
23. The sustainability of the project will be ensured by: (i) its integration with the

Government's policy for fighting rural poverty and the strengthening and expansion
of that policy, and its response to the conditions affecting the Dry Corridor; (ii) its



EB 2016/LOT/P.7/Rev.1

7

A
p
p
en

d
ix II

 ../../R

..]

coherence and alignment with the Dry Corridor Strategic Framework; and (iii) its
approach seeking to ensure the sustainability of families in terms of food and
nutrition security, income, climate change adaptation and natural resource
management.

24. The sustainability of food security, enhanced nutrition and increased production will
be ensured by the central importance given to rural families as the focus of
NICAVIDA activities and interventions, and by the resources allocated to food
security and nutrition. At the same time, NICAVIDA also supports income-
generating activities for families through small businesses, value addition and
access to better employment opportunities through training. The project has a solid
strategic direction and dedicates resources to climate change adaptation and
climate variability-risk reduction. The integration of these measures with productive
agricultural activities will promote their sustainability.

E. Risk identification and mitigation
25. The approach and activities proposed under NICAVIDA aim to reduce risks relating

to food security, nutrition and climate change. The territorial investments and those
in farms aim to promote the sustainable management of natural resources, in
particular soil and water. The planned productive activities take into account
limitations reflecting the availability of tested technologies and the environmental
fragility of the land, and include measures for continuous monitoring and analysis
so timely preventative measures can be taken to mitigate such risks. Interventions
to improve access to water resources for human consumption and irrigation will be
accompanied by measures to improve the replenishment and protection of water
sources and analysis to ensure that improving access to water for irrigation does
not compete with its use for human consumption. In the present context,
institutional and political risks are limited. Risks relating to the efficiency of
management and administration, institutional coordination and agreements with
specialized institutions will be minimized by the application of measures drawn from
IFAD’s long experience implementing projects with MEFCCA and the Government.

V. Corporate considerations
Compliance with IFAD policiesA.

26. The approach, objectives and implementation modalities of NICAVIDA are
consistent with IFAD policies and strategies. The project pursues the objectives of
the COSOP 2013-2017 and is aligned with IFAD’s core policies: (i) the IFAD policy
on targeting, applying direct targeting mechanisms based on analyses of poverty,
food and nutrition insecurity and climate change risk, geographic targeting so as to
include indigenous peoples, and self-targeting within these groups and
communities; (ii) the IFAD policy on gender and youth, replicating and scaling up
lessons from previous projects applied directly to the beneficiaries;( iii) the IFAD
Policy on the Environment and Natural Resource Management, as well as the
Strategy on Climate Change, which includes the objective of maximizing the impact
of IFAD investments in rural poverty in the context of climate change and volatility;
iv) the policies on food and nutrition security, around which the project’s strategies
are built; and (v) the IFAD Policy on Engagement with Indigenous Peoples, applying
the principal of free, prior and informed consent, and with local territorial and
community authorities, recognizing the distinctive cultural identities of the
populations located in the project areas. The project is also fully aligned with IFAD
strategies devoting particular attention to building social capital, guiding
agricultural and non-agricultural productive activities and promoting market-
oriented small business.

Alignment and harmonizationB.
27. The project is aligned with: the National Human Development Plan; the Dry

Corridor Strategic Framework, which is the Government's instrument for addressing
development challenges in the dry zone; and the Government’s main rural
development and poverty-reduction initiatives and policies, such as asset-transfer



EB 2016/LOT/P.7/Rev.1

and -recovery mechanisms, systems for the provision of technical assistance and
training. Designed in close consultation with the Ministry of Finance and Public
Credit and other relevant institutions, NICAVIDA will support the process of
transforming the productive capacities of families in rural areas, thereby
contributing to the achievement of Government policy objectives promoting the
links between the diversification of agricultural and non-agricultural income,
environmental protection, family nutrition and income generation for poor rural
people looking for an opportunity to get out of poverty.

Innovations and scaling upC.
28. The project is in line with the joint Government-IFAD strategy aiming to establish a

rural development model that ensures food security, improves nutrition, supports
families in adapting to climate change and promotes sustainable income-generating
activities. The project contributes to the building of a robust joint approach in the
Dry Corridor, with close collaboration between the Government, MEFCCA, other
institutions — such as the MARENA, INTA and INETER — and IFAD, under the policy
guidance of the Ministries of Finance and Public Credit and of Foreign Affairs. The
model aims to build, by replicating and scaling up experience gained in previous
projects, a broad rural development framework of policies, programmes and
projects that the Government and IFAD plan to replicate and expand.

Policy engagementD.
29. NICAVIDA builds on the success of previous projects, in particular PRODESEC,

PROCAVAL and NICADAPTA, and is aligned with Government and IFAD policies. The
planned implementation methodology and instruments comply with IFAD
guidelines. The proposal is aligned with and supported by the Government in its use
of MEFCCA’s decentralization system and a system for partial asset transfers in the
form of incentives, as well as provisions for the recovery of transferred resources
and policies on the environment and climate change adaptation, inter-institutional
cooperation and improved access to the financial system for beneficiaries and their
organizations. The project is aligned with the policy, institutional and regulatory
framework and with the policies and instruments implemented by the Government
and MEFCCA.

VI. Legal instruments and authority
30. A financing agreement between the Republic of Nicaragua and IFAD will constitute

the legal instrument for extending the proposed financing to the borrower. A copy
of the negotiated financing agreement is attached as appendix I.

31. The Republic of Nicaragua is empowered under its laws to receive financing from
IFAD.

32. I am satisfied that the proposed financing will comply with the Agreement
Establishing IFAD and the Policies and Criteria for IFAD Financing.

VII. Recommendation
33. I recommend that the Executive Board approve the proposed financing in terms of

the following resolution:

RESOLVED: that the Fund shall provide a loan on highly concessional terms to
the Republic of Nicaragua in an amount equivalent to twenty million
five-hundred and four thousand United States dollars (US$20,504,000), and
upon such terms and conditions as shall be substantially in accordance with
the terms and conditions presented herein.

Services Improvement for Sustainable Territorial
Development in the Apurímac, Ene and Mantaro River
Basins Project (Sustainable Territorial Development
Project)

I. Strategic context and rationale
A. Country and rural development and poverty context
1. The Republic of Peru, with GDP per capita in 2014 of US$6,541, is currently

classified among the middle-income countries. The Peruvian economy has been one
of the best performing in Latin America, and visible progress has been made on
poverty reduction in recent years according to the International Monetary Fund
(IMF). However, Peru faced a challenging external context in 2014, together with
problems in domestic supply and declining public subnational investment –
aggravating the external shocks and leading to a marked deceleration in growth.
Although real GDP growth declined to 2.4 per cent in 2014 compared to 5.8 per
cent the previous year, Peru still posted double the regional average of about 1.2
per cent. Estimates place real GDP growth in 2015 at 3.26 per cent.

2. Peru continued to reduce poverty and extreme poverty levels in 2014, although at
a slower pace than in previous years. According to the National Statistics and
Informatics Institute (, poverty in 2014 stood at an estimated 22.7 per cent, 1.2
percentage points lower than in 2013 – meaning that over a quarter of a million
(289,000) people exited poverty. Overall figures for 2014 show that there were
6,995,000 Peruvians living in poverty. Average monthly income per capita for the
poorest rose by 2.2 per cent, mainly as a result of cash transfers under the Juntos,
Pension 65 and Beca 18 programmes. The incidence of poverty was higher in rural
areas at 46.0 per cent, three times the urban rate. Among the major causes of
rural poverty, the fact that communities are poorly integrated with the market
economy has been identified as one of the greatest obstacles to local development,
particularly in the Sierra region, causing the population to emigrate towards urban
centres.

3. A World Bank study done in 2013 indicates that 4.3 per cent of Peru's surface area
is occupied by agricultural activities. The main crops are coffee, potato, rice,
cotton, asparagus, sugar and maize. A modern and competitive agro-export sector
along the coast coexists with more traditional or subsistence farming in the Sierra
and Selva regions. Primary agriculture accounts for 9 per cent of GDP. Over the
last 12 years, Peruvian agriculture has grown at an average rate of 4.3. An
estimated 2.35 million families – close to 10 million people – depend on
agriculture, most of them concentrated in the Sierra. Agriculture in the Sierra
poses major challenges: low yields; small and fragmented plots with high
transaction costs; fragile soil with drainage, salinity and erosion problems; limited
availability of water; a lack of connectivity and an unpredictable climate.



EB 2016/117/R.13

B. Rationale and alignment with government priorities and RB-
COSOP

4. The project is based on IFAD's past and current interventions in Peru, is consistent
with the strategic objectives set forth in the country strategic opportunities
programme (COSOP) and takes into account the recommendations of the midterm
review that took place in November 2011. The project complies with both IFAD's
own requirements and those of the National Public Investment System (SNIP), and
contributes to: (i) strengthening territorial planning and citizen management
processes; (ii) promoting strategic partnerships on public-private platforms for
access to markets; (iii) promoting the organization of productive linkages between
rural small enterprises; (iv) providing greater support for financial inclusion
through savings, insurance and financial education; (v) including initiatives that
favour sustainable natural resource management, with actions to mitigate and
prevent the effects of climate change; and (vi) promoting actions to increase water
availability and equal access to water, to help prevent social conflicts within the
territory.

II. Project description
A. Project area and target group
5. The project area covers the area of influence of the Apurímac, Ene and Mantaro

River Valley (VRAEM), corresponding to the periphery in contrast to the central part
or direct intervention area. Both of these areas are considered priorities by country
authorities in view of their high incidence of poverty and extreme poverty and their
exclusion from the country's development.

6. The selected area encompasses 27 municipal districts in seven provinces in the
departments of Ayacucho, Huancavelica, Junín, Apurímac and Cusco. Included are
a highland or Sierra area at between 3,000 and 4,500 metres, a number of inter-
Andean valleys at between 1,500 and 3,000 metres, a foothills or Ceja de Selva
area at between 300 and 1,500 metres and part of the Amazon plain or Selva at
less than 300 metres.

7. Within this area, 76.5 per cent of the population is rural, using the strict definition
of a disperse rural population. That percentage rises to 87 per cent if villages with
less than 2,000 inhabitants are included. In addition, 74 per cent of the population
in the area are living below the monetary poverty line. Of these, 39 per cent are
extremely poor and 33 are poor but not extremely poor – values that place these
districts among the country's most vulnerable. Among those living in the project
area, 73 per cent are under 29 years of age and 66 per cent are indigenous.

8. The 27 districts located in the project area have a combined population of 58,681
families. Of these, the project will serve 50,936 rural families who are living in
conditions of rural poverty according to the 2014 national household survey.

9. Among the around 50,000 poor rural families making up the project's target
population, 27,000 families will benefit from the development services to be
provided under components 1 (governance and investments in territorial natural
resources) and 2 (local economic initiatives), and 23,000 poor rural families will
benefit from activities under component 3 (connectivity and territorial
infrastructure). The remaining 7,745 families (13 per cent of the population in the
intervention area), who reside in areas considered urban in Peru, will not be
included in the project's target population.

B. Development objective of the project
10. The goal of the project is to contribute to reducing poverty among rural families

through social and productive inclusion. The development objective is to increase
the human, social, natural, physical and financial assets of the project
beneficiaries.



EB 2016/117/R.13

C. Components/results
11. The project will be implemented over six years and will include the implementation

of three major components, in addition to project management and administration:

(a) Component 1. Governance and investments in territorial natural
resources. This component will focus on communities and families and will
build institutional capacities in the territory, including in local and provincial
governments, supporting initiatives to improve communal goods and
properties. The component activities will contribute to improving the
endowment and quality of natural resources in territories owned by the
beneficiaries and their community and indigenous associations – including
adapting to and mitigating climate change, and building capacities and
competencies for sustainable natural resource management and
development.

(b) Component 2. Local economic initiatives. The objective of this
component is to build a sustainable network of associations among potential
project beneficiaries to promote and expand opportunities for economic
development and social inclusion, providing support for economic activities by
interest groups such as farmers organizations together with financial inclusion
of families and associations. In a fragile and diverse associational context, the
component will support the creation, development and consolidation of
economic associations of beneficiaries that are oriented towards improving
their livelihood strategies and achieving greater and better participation in
markets for goods and services. To this end, the component will implement a
flexible and cumulative strategy with specific arrangements to support rural
producers organizations, based on the different types and levels of
associative development among rural people.

(c) Component 3. Connectivity and territorial infrastructure. The objective
of this component is to maintain physical conditions in the area of influence
where the project beneficiaries are located, in order to generate synergies
with interventions under the other components. In a context of relative
isolation caused by deteriorating rural roads, scarce communication services
and limited development of water and natural resources as a result of low
levels of investment in irrigation, the project will, inter alia, facilitate market
access in the intervention area for rural people, create jobs with start-ups or
contracting of communal or associational microenterprises for routine
maintenance of roads, provide for irrigation infrastructure at community
level, and promote water harvesting and collection.

(d) Component 4. Project management and administration. Under this
component, support will be provided on a cross-cutting basis to the three
preceding components to achieve the results and meet the targets set by the
project. This component includes project administration, knowledge
management and M&E.

III. Project implementation
A. Approach
12. The project will employ the following five main approaches:

(a) Territorial development: This approach combines two main aspects:
(i) institutional development to promote consultations among local and
external agents and include poor people in production transformation
processes and benefits; and (ii) production transformation to link the
territory's economy with dynamic markets.

(b) Community-driven development: Implies a degree of delegation of
accountability to communities to manage their own development, including
the design and implementation of subprojects. This approach facilitates



EB 2016/117/R.13

4

access to social, human, financial and physical capital and assets by rural
poor people, by transforming development agents from top-down planners to
bottom-up providers of client-oriented services.

(c) Geographical targeting: Takes into account government priorities defining
the VRAEM area of influence as a priority area in view of the high incidence of
poverty.

(d) Scaling up: The project is consistent with the scaling up approach adopted
by IFAD, encompassing the various dimensions of scaling up: (i) fiscal and
financial; (ii) political; (iii) policy-based; (iv) organizational; (v) cultural; and
(vi) learning-based.

(e) Social inclusion as cross-cutting intervention: The project benefits rural
women, men and young people in situations of poverty and recognizes the
tangible and intangible assets of campesino and indigenous populations. This
approach promotes the empowerment of the target groups and rural
associational development.

B. Organizational framework
13. The agency responsible for the project will be the Ministry of Agriculture and

Irrigation, through the Agro Rural programme acting as a central executing unit
(CEU) with the legal authority to administer the project, in close coordination with
three of its branches located in the regions of Huancavelica, Ayacucho and Cusco,
and with close coordination and collaboration from municipal and provincial
administrations.

14. Project implementation will be the responsibility of a project coordination unit
(PCU) reporting to Agro Rural through its agrarian development director and in
charge of coordinating physical and financial activities and monitoring progress on
meeting the targets set. The PCU will be composed of a project coordinator and
eight specialists in the following areas: (i) M&E; (ii) financial inclusion;
(iii) entrepreneurship; (iv) infrastructure; (v) natural resource management and
climate change; (vi) social inclusion; (vii) administration; and (viii) accounting and
support staff. Each local agency will have a team made up of a coordinator, an
administrative assistant and various specialists.

C. Planning, M&E, learning and knowledge management
15. The project will employ a system of planning, M&E, learning and knowledge

management that is in line with national regulations and with IFAD guidelines.

16. Planning. The project will be implemented on the basis of annual operating plans
(AOP) and procurement  plans subject to IFAD no objection. Progress made on
implementing the plans will be recorded in semi-annual progress reports.

17. M&E. The responsible agency, through the PCU, will conduct the baseline study
during the first 12 months of implementation, and will set up the M&E system and
an M&E plan that will be an integral part of the AOP. The system will report on
progress made in the process of strengthening associational social capital
throughout project implementation using participatory instruments. Agro Rural will
provide information to the SNIP monitoring operating system (SOSEM), which will
allow for verification of progress made on implementing public investment projects.

18. Knowledge management and learning. The main objective of learning and
knowledge management activities will be to enhance existing knowledge assets in
the project intervention area and disseminate content in an appropriate and timely
way to inform users.

D. Financial management, procurement and governance
19. Financial management. The financial management of the project will be the

responsibility of Agro Rural under the CEU procedure, as follows: (i) include project
resource requirements in its annual budget and arrange for approval by the



EB 2016/117/R.13

5

Ministry of Economy and Finance; (ii) implement and supervise implementation of
the project; (iii) perform financial and accounting administration and disbursement
functions; (iv) conduct tenders and contracting processes; and (v) hire external
auditors. Project accounting will comply with the provisions of the integrated
financial information system that is mandatory for all public sector entities
including budget and administrative modules.

20. Flow of funds. The Ministry of Economy and Finance will open a sub-account in
United States dollars within the single Treasury account as a designated account to
receive IFAD loan proceeds. These funds will then be transferred to a project
operating account in local currency, to be opened at Banco de la Nación and
administered by Agro Rural. The borrower will open an account in local currency to
hold the counterpart funds. Agro Rural will transfer the project proceeds to the
CEU, which will make payments for procurement and allocate resources to fund
initiatives by the project users.

21. Procurement. The procurement of works, goods and services will take place in
accordance with IFAD guidelines on procurement of goods and services. The PCU,
together with the administrative office and procurement unit of Agro Rural, will
prepare a procurement plan as part of the AOP specifying the procurement method
and determining the goods and services required, in addition to timelines,
estimated costs, procedures and sources of financing. Procurement will be done
generally by the producers organizations benefiting from the project and hence
receiving specific technical training in areas such as procurement of minor works
and procurement of production equipment, information technology equipment and
others needed for management.

22. Audit. The audit arrangements will include internal processes and will adhere to
IFAD's guidelines on project audits. In accordance with national regulations, Agro
Rural is subject to internal audit by its internal control office, which reports to the
Office of the Comptroller General (CGR). The annual consolidated financial
statements of the project will be audited independently in accordance with terms of
reference acceptable to IFAD, in accordance with international auditing standards
and IFAD guidelines on project audits. An external auditor acceptable to both IFAD
and CGR will be employed. All project accounts will be audited, including both IFAD
financing and counterpart funds. The audit report will be submitted to IFAD within
six months after the close of each fiscal year. For audit purposes the fiscal year will
coincide with the calendar year.

E. Supervision
23. The project will be directly supervised by IFAD in accordance with the prevailing

guidelines on direct supervision.

24. Approximately six months after the start-up workshop, IFAD will organize a first
supervision mission with the following objectives: (i) detect possible problems or
difficulties encountered in the initial implementation; (ii) review progress made
against the targets set; (iii) review the AOP being implemented and proposals for
the subsequent AOP; (iv) consult with project users on their perceptions of the
project and their participation levels; (v) review expenses incurred and
procurement carried out to date; (vi) verify compliance with the financing
agreement; (vii) prepare the project status report; and (viii) perform the financial
management evaluation. Commencing in year two of project implementation, and
in accordance with the guidelines on direct supervision, IFAD will, together with
Agro Rural, organize monitoring activities, provide support for implementation and
supervision and, in addition to meeting the objectives outlined above, analyse the
process of social mobilization and formation of groups of possible beneficiaries,
paying special attention to rural women and young people and indigenous peoples.

C. Economic analysis and benefit summary
27. Project implementation calls for obtaining the following benefits for participating

families and communities: an increase in physical assets for communities,
improved agricultural productivity, sustainable natural resource management, and
increased social capital promoting start-up and development of economic
associations to improve their access to value chains and promote their participation
in the benefits of territorial development. Over the long term, this will result in



EB 2016/117/R.13

higher incomes, greater employment, higher yields and better quality agricultural
products and by-products.

28. Financial analysis shows internal rates of return (IRR) for the activities funded by
the project at above the interbank rate of 13.19 per cent, ranging between 26 per
cent and 137 per cent. Net present values (NPV) range between US$45 and
US$12,456, showing that the project is financially feasible. Both models indicate
that family labour will be freed up, so that additional off-farm income and a
reduced workload for women can be expected.

29. An economic analysis indicates that the project is economically feasible, with the
following results: (i) an economic rate of return (EIRR) of 32.5 per cent; and (ii) an
economic NPV of US$214 million at a discount rate of 9 per cent, indicating a
profitable investment.

D. Sustainability
30. The project will ensure that its interventions are sustainable by increasing and

strengthening the social fabric and generating confidence by promoting
associational development processes. At the same time, it will build confidence and
open up opportunities for the development of individuals, families and
communities. Once conditions have been created for groups of individuals or
families to associate and carry out shared activities, the sustainability of such
groups will depend upon the social cohesion established and on external factors.
Political sustainability will be ensured by commitment on the part of national
authorities to address problems in the project area, promoting solid technical and
financial linkages with sector institutions and subnational governments.

31. Social sustainability will be based on already existing community organizations,
such as the campesino and indigenous communities present in the intervention
area, which will ensure social sustainability. At the same time, the sustainability of
the interest groups associating to undertake economic initiatives will be realized by
means of ongoing support to strengthen associative principles and consolidate
them.

32. Local governments will be strengthened and trained to improve the administration
of resources and respond to the population's needs, which will contribute to
institutional sustainability. The economic and financial sustainability of the
economic initiatives undertaken by associated groups is expected to be brought
about by providing specific advisory assistance in market analysis, support from
mentoring institutions and relationships with potential clients for the products or
services cofinanced by the project.

33. Technical sustainability will be ensured by promoting local talents to operate the
initiatives identified by the project clients. Environmental sustainability will be
ensured by promoting and adopting best practices in natural resource
management.

34. Finally, the sustainability of investments in road maintenance will be the
responsibility of the municipalities under the conditional programme transfers
managed by MTC with resources provided by the Ministry of Economy and Finance.
To ensure that the roads covered by scheduled and emergency maintenance are
included in regular maintenance plans, specific clauses will be included in the
agreements to be signed with provincial road authorities and municipalities in the
implementation area to ensure compliance with current Ministry of Economy and
Finance policy.

E. Risk determination and mitigation
35. Implementation of the project will involve moderate risks, and the measures

planned to mitigate them are outlined in table 3:

V. Corporate considerations
A. Compliance with IFAD policies
36. The proposed project is aligned with the overarching goal of the IFAD Strategic

Framework 2016-2025 and contributes to all three strategic objectives: increase
rural people’s productive capacities, increase rural people’s benefits from market
participation, and strengthen the environmental sustainability and climate
resistance of rural people’s economic activities. Moreover, the project approach and
implementation strategies are in compliance with the policies and strategies on
targeting rural poor people, gender equality and women's empowerment,
engagement with indigenous peoples (including free, prior and informed consent),
natural resources and environmental management, climate change, social,
environmental and climate procedures (SECAP note, category B), rural finance, and
knowledge management and innovation.

B. Harmonization and alignment
37. The project is consistent with the national policy environment promoting rural and

territorial development, decentralization and development of production. The
proposed project, to be implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation
through Agro Rural, will be consistent with the Medium-term Plan 2013-2016 and
its objective to reduce poverty and extreme poverty, improve local institutions and
management, generate competitiveness in agricultural production, and improve the
inclusion of producers by facilitating the sustainability of natural resources. The
proposed project will also be harmonized with the Ministry of Economy and Finance
programme Strengthening the Competitiveness of Rural Associative Enterprises
(PROCOMPITE) and its objective to achieve sustainability in production value chains
through development, adaptation and technology transfer. In addition, the use of
technical teams of local governments will build capacity to mobilize resources from
the Rural Economic Inclusion Fund (FONIE) to rehabilitate rural roads.
Furthermore, the project is fully justified and responsive to the decision by country
authorities to address problems in the intervention area under the VRAEM
Comprehensive Territorial Plan, which pursues the overall objective of shaping an
environment of security, legality and social peace that will improve the quality of
life and social inclusion of the inhabitants by making production activities more
profitable in the area.

C. Innovation and scaling up
38. Implementing the project will involve the use of new mechanisms in addition to

those already used and proven effective in previous IFAD-funded projects in Peru –



EB 2016/117/R.13

such as allocating financial resources competitively and transferring them to hire
technical assistance, processing and commercialization services, following a
participatory approach to identify, formulate, implement and monitor subprojects
using local resource allocation committees, with financial inclusion and the creation
of collaboration mechanisms with local governments to invest in business
facilitation.

39. In this project, the innovations in implementation will include strong support for
local and provincial governments in defining territorial assets, and shared financing
by administrative agencies within those governments to improve planning and
implementation of territorial investment projects, including: investing in road
network maintenance to mitigate barriers of connectivity to market access; using
mobile banking as a way of facilitating financial inclusion on a massive basis; and
creating incentives for the development of new financial products and services. The
inclusion of indigenous communities will mean adopting new mechanisms for
managing natural resources and financing community initiatives, with technical and
financial assistance. A systematic strategy will also be followed to build associative
capacities among beneficiary people, supporting organizational development
processes with results-based incentives. Finally, in addition to reinforcing gender
equity, the project calls for strategies, actions and financial resources to diversify
economic opportunities, including access to employment and decent employment.

D. Policy engagement
40. The project calls for actions and resources to promote and facilitate policy dialogue

using lessons learned and recommendations arising from the project
implementation process – to remove barriers that prevent poor rural people from
sharing in the benefits of territorial development. To this end, policy dialogue will
seek to have an influence on the actors involved in decision-making processes at
the local, regional and national levels. Generally speaking, the project will seek to
build an enabling environment from a policy, institutional and regulatory point of
view to advance the interests of poor rural people. Special attention will be paid to
constructing platforms for dialogue between and by indigenous communities,
seeking to open up a space whereby they can have an influence and improve their
participation and their social and economic inclusion.

VI. Legal instruments and authority
41. A financing agreement between the Republic of Peru and IFAD will constitute the

legal instrument for extending the proposed financing to the borrower. A copy of
the negotiated financing agreement is attached as an appendix.

42. The Republic of Peru is empowered under its laws to receive financing from IFAD.

43. I am satisfied that the proposed financing will comply with the Agreement
Establishing IFAD and the Policies and Criteria for IFAD Financing.

VII. Recommendation
44. I recommend that the Executive Board approve the proposed financing in terms of

the following resolution:

RESOLVED: that the Fund shall provide a loan on ordinary conditions to the
Republic of Peru in an amount equivalent to twenty million six hundred and
fifty thousand special drawing rights (SDR 20,650,000), and upon such terms
and conditions as shall be substantially in accordance with the terms and
conditions presented herein.
