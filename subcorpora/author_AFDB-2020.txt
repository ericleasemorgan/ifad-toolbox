Project Summary  

Project Overview: In Burundi, agriculture and livestock are among the priority sectors set out 

in the PND (2018- 2027) which aims to promote intensive and modernised agriculture to ensure 

food security and foster market agriculture. The Agriculture and Livestock Value Chains 

Development Support Project in Burundi (PADCAE-B), financed by the African Development 

Bank, is in line with this dynamic. The project will be implemented in Gitega, Kirundo and 

Muyinga Provinces in northern Burundi, with a total population estimated at 2,956,784 people 

(24% of the national population), a land area of 1,671 ha (or 18% of the national total) and a 

population density of 553 inhab/km².  

The overall objective of PADCAE-B is to contribute to the sustainable improvement of food 

and nutrition security and increase in the incomes of the populations. Project interventions will 

focus on a limited number of value chains (rice, maize, goats, pigs and fish) identified by 

beneficiaries, articulated around 4 components: (i) land development, integrated land 

management, land restoration and security; (ii) development of climate-resilient agriculture 

and support for nutrition (iii) institutional, capacity building and agricultural entrepreneurship 

support.; and (iv) project management and coordination. When implemented, the project will 

help to fight food and nutrition insecurity, promote youth employment and gender, boost 

agricultural output through resilient and sustainable agriculture, encourage the structuring, 

organisation and capacity and building of cooperatives, private sector stakeholders and 

operational State structures, and improve land management. PADCAE-B, to be implemented 

over a period of 5 years (2020-2025) for a total cost of UA 16.39 million will affect 138,060 

individuals, 56% of them women.   

Needs Assessment: In Burundi, over 90% of the population and 80% of women practise 

agriculture. This sector accounts for 44% of the country’s GDP and 95% of its export earnings. 

Close to 90% of developed land is used for food cultivation (banana, cassava, sweet potato, 

maize, beans, peas, sorghum and rice). These crops contribute 80% of the Agricultural GDP, 

with the farmers themselves consuming 80% of their production. Despite its many strengths (a 

hardworking agricultural workforce, the possibility of having several crop cycles annually, 

varied ecosystems and abundant watercourses), agriculture is fraught with both structural and 

functional constraints (poor soil fertility, inadequate use of agricultural inputs, fluctuating 

agricultural production due to climate change, insufficient technical and technological 

innovations, strong demographic pressure, limited human resources, and unsuitable regulatory 

and policy instruments, etc.). 

Bank’s Value Added: This added value stems from its experience through its interventions in 

the rural and agricultural sector. The project is consistent with the Bank’s Ten Year Strategy 

(2013-2022) and will help to achieve 3 of its 5 strategic priorities, namely Feed Africa, Improve 

the quality of life for the people of Africa and Industrialise Africa. The project is also in line 

with “Feed Africa: Strategy for Agricultural Transformation in Africa” (2016-2025); the Multi-

Sectoral Nutrition Action Plan; the Jobs for Youth in Africa Strategy; and the Feed Africa 

Response to COVID-19 (FAREC). It is also aligned with the ADF 15 operational and strategic 

priorities. Lastly, the project has adopted the objectives of the Technologies for African 

Agricultural Transformation (TAAT) Programme which aims to deploy technologies to boost 

output and production in the targeted agriculture and livestock value chains. The project 

activities through increased productivity will contribute to (i) improve food and nutrition 

security through crop diversification and promotion of high nutritional value crops, and (ii) 

secure and reduce post-harvest losses thus contributing to increase the income of the 

beneficiaries in the 3 provinces. Finally, the project will help promote agricultural 

entrepreneurship, gender, youth employment, digitalization of agriculture and land governance. 



 

v 

Knowledge Building: Thanks to TAAT compacts, the project will ensure the transfer of 

technology and knowledge to national R&D structures and onward to the field actors of the 

agriculture and livestock value chains. These technological aspects include the development of 

resilient seeds, the rational use of fertilisers and improvement of genetics and nutrition of 

livestock. To improve beneficiaries’ livelihoods and build their resilience to recurrent external 

shocks and crises, the project will adopt the Centre de Rayonnement C Collinaire 

(CRC)approach and Resilience Fund (CdR) which encompasses three dimensions: a 

productive/technical dimension, financial/economic dimension, and a social dimension.  

Lastly, the project will promote the digitisation of agriculture and land tenure by (i) setting up 

an Automated and Decentralised Monitoring and Evaluation (SEAD) mechanism and an 

agricultural database in MINEAGRIE, (ii) digitising agricultural advisory services, (iii) 

interconnecting different value chain stakeholders (production, processing and marketing), and 

(iv) strengthening good governance (control of supply channels, tracking of inputs supplied to 

farmers) and setting up land management system. One of the project aspects will be the 

promotion of youth entrepreneurship articulated around training (nurseries) and opening an 

employability support fund and a guarantee fund to resolve the acute problem of youth 

financing.

MANAGEMENT REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 

CONCERNING A PROPOSAL TO AWARD A GRANT TO THE REPUBLIC OF BURUNDI TO FINANCE 

THE: 

 

AGRICULTURE AND LIVESTOCK VALUE CHAINS SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 

SUPPORT PROJECT IN BURUNDI (PADCAE-B)  

 

Management hereby submits this report and recommendations concerning a proposal to award a Grant 

of UA 15 million (9.37 million under the ADF Window and 5.63 million from the Pillar 1 of the TSF 

resources) to the Republic of Burundi to finance PADCAE-B. 

I –  STRATEGIC THRUST AND RATIONALE 

1.1 Project Linkages with the Country Strategy and Objectives  

1.1.1 In Burundi, over 90% of the population practise agriculture which accounts for around 40% of 

the country’s GDP and 80% of export earnings1. Despite numerous assets (a hardworking agricultural 

workforce 80% of whom are women, the possibility of several crop cycles in one year, the existence of 

varied ecosystems and abundant watercourses), agriculture is constrained by structural and functional 

factors (lack of fertile soils, marginal use of agricultural inputs, fluctuating agricultural production due 

to the effects of climate change, insufficient technical/technological innovations, high demographic 

pressure, limited human resources, and unsuitable regulatory and policy instruments). Agriculture is 

characterised by complex traditional systems of hill polyculture (banana, beans, root crops and tubers, 

maize) and congested marshy valleys where tuber crops, beans, maize and rice are grown using 

exclusively manual techniques. Indeed, the agrarian landscape is saturated in very densely populated 

provinces and communes. The country is characterised by high demographic pressure and rapid 

population growth (3.1 to 3.3% yearly), one of the highest in the world. This induces: (i) a decrease of 

average farm sizes, (ii) a larger number of landless farmers, and (iii) the degradation of natural resources. 

This is compounded by the impact of climate change which not only disturbed the farming seasons but 

also impacted agricultural productivity in the country. As a result, yields are low and, despite three 

annual crop cycles, production is insufficient to cover the food needs of an ever-growing population. 

1.1.2.  The project is consistent with the country’s economic and social development policy papers. It 

is in line with the National Development Plan (2018-2027) under Thrust 1 (Development of agriculture, 

livestock and strengthening of food security2) of Strategic Area 1 (Revitalise growth-bearing sectors), 

whose actions target intensive and modernised agriculture to ensure food security and promote market 

agriculture. The project is also consistent with the National Agricultural Investment Plan in force (PNIA 

2012-2017 updated to 2016-2020) which comprises four (4) priority programmes: (i) Sustainable 

increase of food production and security; (ii) Professionalisation of farmers and promotion of 

innovation, (iii) Development of subsectors and agribusiness; and (iv) Strengthening of public 

institutions. Lastly, the project is in line with the objectives of strategic livestock guidance documents 

(DOS, 2014) which set out guidelines for the sector by 2030 and the National Employment Policy 

through Strategic Areas 1(Develop skills and employability) and 4 (Promote the employment of young 

people, women and persons living with disabilities and labour market inclusion). Finally, the climate 

change resilience component of the project is in line with the nationally determined contribution (NDC) 

of the country, as part of the implementation of the Paris agreement on climate change. 

 

 
1  Thus, nearly 90% of the developed land is allocated for food crop cultivation (banana, cassava, sweet potatoes, maize, 

beans, peas, sorghum and rice) which account for 80% of Agricultural Gross Domestic Product (AGDP) with farmers 

themselves consuming 80% of their production. 
2  Thrust 1 is divided into 3 strategic objectives: SO1: Strengthen institutional and organisational capacity, SO2: 

Sustainably increase agricultural, animal and fishery production, and SO3: Promote market agriculture.

 1.2 Rationale of the Bank Intervention  

1.2.1. The Bank’s Strategy in Burundi aims to build the country’s resilience by creating conditions 

for strong inclusive growth induced by greater buoyancy of the productive sectors of the economy. The 

Country Strategy Paper (CSP) for 2019-2023 has two pillars: (1) support for agricultural development 

and transformation; and (2) improvement of transport and energy infrastructure. The project is in line 

with the objectives of Pillar 13.  

1.2.2 The project is also in line with the Regional Integration Strategy Paper for the period 2018-2022 

(DSIR) in its Pillar II (Strengthening institutional and strategic frameworks for market integration, 

investment and value chain development). Indeed, the project promotes a value chain development 

approach and aims at strengthening institutional capacity to equip the country with frameworks and 

institutions contributing to economic transformation and value chain development. 

1.2.3.  The targeted operation is well anchored in the Bank Strategy for Addressing Fragility and 

Building Resilience in Africa for quality engagement in States in transition. Poverty was aggravated by 

the intensity of the drivers of fragility in Burundi.  

1.2.4  The project is consistent with the Bank’s Ten Year Strategy (2013-2022) and is expected to 

contribute to achieving 3 of its High 5s, namely, Feed Africa, Industrialise Africa, and Improve the 

quality of life for people in Africa. The project is also in line with the Bank’s Feed Africa: Strategy for 

Agricultural Transformation in Africa (2016-2025); the Multi-Sectoral Nutrition Action Plan; the Jobs 

for Youth in Africa Strategy; and the Feed Africa Response to COVID-19 (FAREC) which builds on 

the broader foundations of the COVID-19 Rapid Response Facility (CRF). Lastly, the project 

encompasses the goals of the Technologies for African Agricultural Transformation (TAAT) 

Programme that aims to apply technology to boost productivity and production in the target agriculture 

and livestock value chains.  

1.2.5  The project is in line with the ADF-15 operational and strategic priorities which aim to create 

a conducive environment for inclusive and sustainable transformation, decent jobs and stronger 

resilience. It integrates the two strategic pillars of ADF-154. 

1.3 Aid Coordination  

1.3.1 After over a decade of inaction, sector consultation frameworks are gradually being re-

established. These rely on PND’s institutional monitoring and evaluation arrangement built on sector 

groups, common consultation and programming platforms. The "Agriculture and rural development" 

Group is being formalised. The Bank, in association with other key partners of this sector, namely FAO, 

IFAD and the World Bank, is playing an active role in its restoration. Pending the effective 

commencement of the group, regular consultations are still held with TFPs to improve the 

complementarity of their interventions, and thus create synergy to maximise project impacts on 

economic and social development.  

1.3.2  The following table shows the main amounts currently committed by sources of financing in 

the agricultural sector in Burundi.  

 

 

 
3 PADCAE-B replaces PIPARV-B which was an agricultural project included in the CSP while keeping the same 

objectives. 
4 The 2 strategic pillars of ADF 15 are: (i) Develop quality and durable infrastructure to lend impetus to job-creating 

private sector investments and foster sustainable development, and (ii) Build human, governance and institutional 

capacities to enable individuals to participate in and benefit from job-creating opportunities for inclusive growth.

II PROJECT DESCRIPTION  

The sector objective is to help to sustainably strengthen food and nutrition security and build the 

resilience of the rural populations of Ngozi, Kirundo and Muyinga Provinces. The specific objectives 

are: (i) land development, integrated land management, land restoration and security, (ii) development 

of climate-resilient agriculture and livestock value chains and support to nutrition and (iii) institutional, 

capacity building and agricultural entrepreneurship support. 

2.1 Project Components  

2.1.1 Project Design: It is based on developing or adopting innovative integrated practices and using 

climate-resilient technology and systems associated with the development of agriculture and livestock 

value chains. The TAAT approach was used since it helps to significantly boost agricultural productivity 

and production through the dissemination of low-carbon eco-friendly technologies. Synergy and 

complementarity will be created with other partners operating in the agriculture and livestock sector5.  

2.1.2 Summary of Components: Project implementation will span a period of five years (2020-

2025) and comprise three components whose main outputs are detailed in Annex B3 and summarised 

in the following table: 

 
5 It was agreed that synergy and complementarity will be strengthened with (i) FAO to support the opening of resilience 

funds, and (iii) IFAD through their PIPARV-B project which is in the same project area and has similar activities.

2.2 Technical Solutions and Alternatives Explored  

2.2.1  Inclusive Value Chains: Project interventions will focus on a limited number of value chains 

(rice, maize, pigs, goats and fish) based not only on priorities defined by stakeholders and existing 

demand, but also on their contribution to the national economy and potential impact on (i) food and 

nutrition security, (ii) agriculture household incomes, and (iii) youth and women’s employment. The 

project aims to increase the output of agriculture and livestock products, optimise processing operations 

and facilitate farmers’ access to markets.  

2.2.2  Agricultural Intensification and Land Management: Burundi is characterised by a high 

population density and no agricultural land reserves. Due to these two factors, increasing agricultural 

productivity must necessarily require the intensification of agricultural practices. This intensification 

will be through (i) a rational use of land resources, (ii) the promotion and use of improved seeds and 

fertilisers, (iii) the genetic improvement of livestock through the introduction of improved breeds, (iv) 

improved animal feed and environmental protection through the promotion of fodder and the 

production of food with a high nutritional value, (v) the setting up of Centre de rayonnement  

collinaireand resilience funds at the level of cooperatives to train farmers on good agricultural 

practices and facilitate access to financing.     

2.2.3  Digitisation of agriculture and land tenure: The project will lay special emphasis on digitising 

this sector, notably through support for the monitoring and evaluation mechanism, the collection and 

analysis of agricultural data, the dissemination of weather information, the introduction of agricultural 

practices driven by agricultural information, stakeholders’ access to agricultural information to facilitate 

decision-making and strengthening of links among stakeholders. Digitising land tenure will help to 

strengthen good governance in the sector and promote private investments therein. 

 
6 To support youth entrepreneurship development in the three provinces, an incubator will be recruited to: (i) support the 

establishment of provincial hubs, (ii) ensure the technical and vocational training of young people in various crops and 

value chain segments, (iii) provide technical support to young people in setting up SMEs, (iv) offer support in preparing 

business plans, and (v) facilitate marketing and interconnection with markets etc.

Table 2.2.1: Alternatives solutions and reasons for rejection 

 

 Alternatives Succinct Description Reason for Rejection 

 

Soil fertilisation  

This involves using organic fertilisers 

prepared with natural animal or plant 

material. Organic fertilisers are 

obtained from livestock or 

agricultural products or sub-products 

without adding any mineral or 

chemical substances 

Stockbreeding is not practised in the PA 

to facilitate the collection of sufficient 

quantities of animal dung to treat all 

areas to be exploited. This option is 

sometimes considered on a small scale 

for secondary crops with a high 

nutritional value. Training will be done 

through CRC. 

 
Intensive stockbreeding of pig 

and goat pure breeds 

This consist in importing high yield 

exotic breeds 

This alternative is costly, unsustainable 

and not suited to stockbreeders’ low 

level of technicity. 

 

E-voucher, paper version 

The e-voucher helps to enhance good 

governance in the agriculture sector 

by guaranteeing the traceability of 

inputs 

The disadvantage of the e-voucher, 

paper version, is its impact on the 

environment. It also does not guarantee 

sustainable conservation and the real 

time  transmission of data. 

2.3 Project Type  

PADCAE-B is a stand-alone investment project in the form of an ADF and TSF-financed Grant.  

2.4 Project Cost and Financing Arrangement  

2.4.1 The total project cost, net of taxes and customs duty, is estimated at about UA 16.47 million 

(USD 22.73 million) including 27% in foreign exchange and 73% in local currency. The project will be 

financed thus: UA 9.37 million in the form of an ADF Grant; UA 5.63 million in the form of a TSF 

Grant and the remainder, UA 1.39 million, being the counterpart contribution of the Government and 

beneficiaries. Project activities will span a period of five (5) years. The summary of project cost, funding 

allocation and expenditure schedule are presented in Tables 2.4 -2.6.2.4.2. The Bank Grant will finance 

100% (tax exclusive) of works, including infrastructure. Goods and services will be financed 100% 

following the attached Financing Plan, while Government will take charge of staff salaries and part (1/3) 

of office rental costs. The counterpart of the beneficiaries will be represented by their contribution to 

the National Fertilizer Subsidy Program as well as by their participation in the earthworks on the ridges 

of the hills.

2.5 Project Area and Beneficiaries  

2.5.1 The project area (PA) covers Kirundo, Muyinga and Ngozi Provinces situated in northern 

Burundi with a total estimated population of 2,743,366 people, making 24% of the national population, 

and covering a land area of 1,671 ha (or 18% of the total land area of the country). It spans across 18 

hills and the following 9 communes: (i) Kirundo Province: Busoni, Vumbi and Bwambarangwe; (ii) 

Ngozi Province: Gashikanwa, Kiremba and Tangara; (iii) Muyinga Province: Giteranyi, Gasorwe and 

Gashoho. These three provinces are among those with the highest population density in the country, 

estimated at 553 inhab/km. 

2.5.2 The provinces and communes were selected by common agreement with the populations and 

provincial/communal authorities, based on the following criteria: (i) prevalence of chronic malnutrition7, 

(ii) rural population density8, (iii) potential for development through watersheds and marshlands, (iv) 

per capita investment from other projects9. The PA population are among the poorest in the country; the 

monetary poverty rates in Kirundo and Muyinga Provinces are higher than the national average (64.6%). 

2.5.3 The project has several beneficiaries at the central and decentralised levels. It will benefit 

directly 138,060 people, 56% of them women, and indirectly all 2,743,366 inhabitants of the 3 

provinces. At central level, the key beneficiaries are the Ministry in charge of Agriculture and its 

technical departments and allied structures such as R&D and training institutions. At the devolved and 

communal level, project implementation will benefit provincial departments of agriculture and 

livestock, sector cooperatives and value chains stakeholders’ organisations, agricultural households, 

particularly very vulnerable groups including young people and women, hill-agriculture 

supervisors/monitors, animal health workers as well as private enterprises. 

2.6 Participatory Approach in Project Identification, Design and Implementation 

2.6.1 At all study stages (identification, preparation and appraisal), PADCAE used a broad participatory 

and inclusive approach. Consultations were held with governmental authorities, the technical services 

of ministries involved (MINEAGRIE, Ministry of Finance, Budget and Development Cooperation, the 

Ministry of Health, the Ministry of National Education and Scientific Research), the relevant agriculture 

value chain stakeholders including the private sector (FOMI, Edenred, Mediabox) as well as Technical 

and Financial Partners with interventions in the agriculture sector (WB, FAO, IFAD, UNDP, UNICEF, 

WFP and the EU). Field visits paid during various project design missions revealed realities on the 

ground and made it possible to consult directly with stakeholders concerned (producers’ associations, 

women’s cooperatives, youth groups, local authorities and devolved technical services). Due to COVID-

19, the appraisal mission was conducted remotely via videoconferencing in which all stakeholders 

participated. However, the PATAREB coordination was able to have meetings and discussions in the 

field with the beneficiaries.

9 

2.6.2 These visits and consultations spotlighted major weaknesses in (i) production (difficulties 

obtaining input supplies, limited advisory support, weak organisation, unsuitable cultural practices, 

under-equipment, etc); (ii) processing (poor organisation, under-equipment, limited access to 

financing); and (iii) marketing segments. These were compounded by the absence of communication 

among value chain stakeholders. Consultations will continue with them during project implementation 

to ensure that interventions are efficient, effective and sustainable.  

2.6.3 This participatory, inclusive and holistic approach is based on lessons learned from similar 

projects and aims to lay a common foundation for participation in the project implementation stages, 

promote sustainable practices, facilitate the exchange of views among stakeholders, leverage 

information and generate supplementary knowledge within stakeholders. It helps to create a body of 

knowledge for informed and responsible decision-making, provide robust support for such decisions 

and collective ownership of problems and solutions, build local capacity, and facilitate experience 

exchanges and collaboration with other TFPs’ interventions for greater synergy.   

2.7.  Bank Group Experience and Lessons Reflected in the Project Design  

2.7.1  On 30 June 2020, the Bank’s active portfolio in Burundi comprised 19 ongoing public sector 

projects for a total commitment of UA 282.77 million. Its distribution is aligned with the priority thrusts 

of the Country Strategy Paper (CSP 2019-2023) and Burundi’s National Development Plan (PND) and 

covers the following areas: Transport (58.47%), Agriculture (4.24%), Energy (33.03%), Social (3.24%), 

Multi-sector (1.02%). According to the CPR, the performance of the active public sector portfolio is 

deemed satisfactory with an IP score of 3.3 on a scale of 1 to 4 for 8 operations. However, this score 

hides a poor performance resulting from multiple extensions of the implementation timeframes of most 

portfolio projects. The performance rating fell slightly (from 3.36 to 3.34) between March 2019 and 

March 2020. 

2.7.2  The portfolio review revealed persistent difficulties that negatively affect public portfolio 

performance: (i) poor quality of technical studies which led to a few adjustments of the initial design of 

some projects during the implementation phase ; (ii) weakness in mainstreaming cross-cutting issues 

(environment, gender and fragility) in project design, BDs and contractors/consultants’ contracts and 

during implementation of road and energy projects; (iii) late commencement of projects; (iv) weak 

capacity of the Administration’s technical structures to support the project design and implementation 

process; (v) poor performance of PIUs; (vi) poor performance of some contractors and consultants; (vii) 

long time taken to response to requests for the Bank’s NOO; (viii) long procurement time frames; (ix) 

multiple extensions of project closing deadlines; (x) late submission of audit reports; (xi) lateness in 

reimbursing and/or justifying special accounts balances; (xii) late submission of quarterly financial 

monitoring reports; (xiii) late payment of Government’s counterpart contribution. 

2.7.3  The project design reflects lessons learned from difficulties with PATAREB being 

implemented, including the known weaknesses in project governance and file processing delays 

attributable to the Bank and PMU. In order to speed up the processing of files, the Government has 

undertaken an institutional evaluation of the PATAREB with a view of taking appropriate measures for 

better functioning. At the level of project management, fiduciary-related risks will be mitigated mostly 

by using the fiduciary management system within PATAREB and building PMU’s procurement and 

financial management capacity10. 

2.7.4  Lastly, the project study process factors in the lessons learned from the IDEV11 evaluation of 

the Bank’s support for agricultural value chain development, whose recommendations concern five core 

principles: (i) analyse the entire value chain; (ii) prepare a strategy to ensure inclusiveness ; (iii) nurture

capacity to adapt to market trends; (iv) think in terms of profitability with value added; and (v) prepare 

plans to create lasting impact. 

2.8 Key Performance Indicators  

2.8.1. The key performance indicators to be monitored from the baseline situation to project 

completion are described in the following paragraphs: 

2.8.2.  Agriculture and value chains: the key indicators are the following: (i) area of marshland or 

watersheds rehabilitated/developed; (ii) area covered by hill irrigation, (iii) level of additional 

production (tonnes) and crop yields (t/ha); (iv) level of food insecurity and malnutrition, (v) number of 

infrastructure constructed (storage facilities of products and inputs, processing and development units 

etc.); (vi) number of farmers per type of gender-disaggregated works supported; (vii) area of new export 

crops; (viii) area covered by fruit plans; (ix) animal weight gain rate, etc. 

2.8.3.  Income and employment: (i) poverty level, (ii) level of income increase including that of 

women and young people; (iii) number of jobs created for young people and women in entrepreneurial 

initiatives in the various agricultural, animal and fisheries sectors; (iv) number of producers, processing 

agents and traders trained and organised in cooperatives.  

2.8.4.  Environment and land management: (i) land area restored, (ii) number of land certificates 

issued. 

All selected project indicators were aligned to the key indicators of CSP, PND and PNIA. 

III – PROJECT FEASIBILITY 

3.1 Economic and Financial Performance  

3.1.1  A project financial assessment was conducted with the aid of activity models and based on 

market prices. The main assumptions underlying the analyses include: (i) 50,000 farmers actively 

engaged in agriculture at full project capacity; (ii) the project will generate an additional 25% increase 

in incomes, (iii) farmers will adopt a variety of improved maize and rice seeds as well as improved 

livestock breeds, (iv) a period of 20 years was used to measure incremental benefits from the project; 

(iv) the opportunity cost of capital used to update future benefits was estimated at 12%.   

3.1.2  For economic analysis, (v) the value of salaried work force was adjusted by a conversion factor 

of 0.75; (vi) the rehabilitation of the seedlings system will ensure national supply of quality seeds. These 

analyses were done with the financial and economic costs generated using Costab 32. The summary 

financial and economic analysis is attached as Annex VII and developed in Annex B4 of Volume II of 

the Appraisal Report. 

Table 3.1: Key economic and financial data 

IRR: 16.3% NPV (baseline scenario) equivalent to USD 17.24 million  

ERR: 25.2% NPV (baseline scenario) equivalent to USD 33.02 

million 

 

 Note: Calculations are detailed in Annex B7 

3.1.3 Financial Analysis: Based on the above assumptions, the financial analysis generated a Net 

Present Value of USD 17.24 million and an Internal Rate of Return of 16.3%, as indicated in the 

Technical Annexes (B4). As a result, the project is deemed financially viable. The IRR of 16.3% is 

higher than the opportunity cost of capital (12%). 



 

11 

3.1.4 Economic Analysis: The economic analysis used the same approach as the financial analysis, 

based on the negotiable reference prices of goods and the total project cost. Other indirect expected 

benefits were, among other things, smaller post-harvest losses, the provision of a service centre for 

agricultural equipment, a reliable system of information on soils for mixing fertilisers, an effective 

system of input distribution via the farmers’ database system and lower transport costs of goods and 

services. However, it was difficult to assess these supplementary benefits in monetary terms due to the 

limited scope of this report. Under such circumstances, the economic analysis revealed an NPV of USD 

33.02 and an IRR of 25.2%, as indicated in the Technical Annexes. 

3.2 Environmental, Social and Climatic Impact

3.2.1.1  Categorisation: The project categorisation, as confirmed and approved on 21 February 2010, 

is Category 2 based on the Bank’s Integrated Safeguards System and the national legal framework 

governing environmental assessment. This categorisation is justified by the project activities which will 

be implemented in an ecosystem dedicated to these types of activities and without major risk of 

destroying new natural spaces. The significant environmental risks will be the effects of the poor use of 

phytosanitary products. Resettlement issues are foreseen in the context of land acquisition for 

infrastructure and development, but it will affect a fairly limited number of people. 

3.2.1.2  Necessary Environmental and Social Assessments: Two environmental and social safeguard 

instruments were proposed for project implementation: (i) the Environmental and Social Impact 

Assessment (ESIA) to cover project risks/impacts linked to support for the improvement/increase of 

agricultural production and the livestock sector, in particular small-scale animal husbandry as well as 

aquaculture; and (ii) the Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) to cover project 

risks/impacts linked to the construction/rehabilitation of rural infrastructure for storage/conservation 

(sheds), processing, transport and marketing of products, and support for income generating activities 

(IGA) for women and young people. The implementation of these activities will require the acquisition 

of land, but the localities where they will be carried out in the selected provinces are still unknown. The 

ESMF will propose procedures for assessing various risks (environmental, social including relocation) 

during the project implementation phase. Public consultations took place in July 2020 during preparation 

of these instruments and involved all stakeholders (all institutions concerned, representatives of potential 

beneficiaries: farmers of marshlands, farmers’ cooperatives around Lake Rweru and the inhabitants of 

the expected site of the hillside reservoirs). Thanks to the consultation, the populations’ opinions and 

views were taken into account in the project’s environmental and social assessment process. The 

populations expressed concern mainly about: (i) land insecurity in the marshes, (ii) the risk of conflicts 

related to the sharing of water, (iii) the sustainability of irrigation infrastructures, and (iv) the fight 

against erosion. 

3.2.1.3.  Project’s Potential Environmental and Social Impacts: The project will have several positive 

environment and social impacts, including: (i) the creation of temporary jobs on development sites; (ii) fewer 

conflicts due to better circulation of water in marshlands and consultations among peers in the PIU and AVECs 

(Rural Thrift and Loans Associations); (iii) availability of water through hill irrigation; (iv) increase of 

agricultural production and farmer incomes; (v) better organisation of farmers and harmonisation of crops and 

sowing/planting dates in the marshes; (vi) reduction of soil erosion on hills, floods and silting in the marshes; 

(vii) improvement of farmers’ living conditions; (viii) better protection of the buffer zone of Lake Rweru. The 

project’s potential negative impacts concern: (i) the loss of land portions in the marshes and on the hillside 

reservoir; (ii) economic loss if development occurs during the crop season; (iii) pollution of soil and water 

resources through increased use of phytosanitary products; (iv) the risk of drowning at the hillside reservoir; 

(v) the risk of social conflicts due to the influx of workers in the area; (vi) the risk of poisoning following the 

use of pesticides; (vii) increased vulnerability of soils to erosion on hills; (viii) occupational health and 

industrial safety risks in processing units and development sites; (ix) more problems of gender-based violence; 

and (x) greater risk of the populations contracting STDs/HIV, malaria and Covid19 . 



 

12 

3.2.1.4.  Mitigation Measures: Measures to manage these impacts/risks are proposed in the 

Environmental and Social Management Plan and the Environmental and Social Management 

Framework. Some of these specific measures are: (i) prioritise local manpower; (ii) sensitise the 

population to wear protective equipment when using phytosanitary products; (iii) develop marshes 

during the dry season to limit economic losses; (iv) put hygiene, health and safety measures in place on 

construction sites; (v) secure the limits of water reservoirs; (vi) compensate the populations in case of 

economic loss; (vii) raise awareness on STD/HIV, malaria and Covid19  issues and aspects that can lead 

to social conflicts; (viii) carry out environmental and social screening of sub-projects and requisite 

studies when necessary; and (ix) prepare an abbreviated RAP, as appropriate, to manage the social 

impacts of infrastructure development sub-projects.   

3.2.1.5  Cost and Institutional Arrangement for the Implementation of Safeguard Measures: The cost 

of implementing environmental and social impact mitigation measures, building borrower’s capacity 

and strengthening the management mechanism stands at USD 390,000. It is included in the project cost 

and detailed in the attached project implementation cost matrix. The resettlement estimated at the current 

stage at 50,000 dollars will be borne by the national party. An Environmental Safeguards Officer and 

Social Development Officer should be recruited to support the Project Coordination Unit. There are 

plans to provide technical and financial support to the Office Burundais de Protection de 

l’Environnement (Burundi Environmental Protection Authority) to monitor environmental and social 

safeguard instruments. 

3.2.2.   Climate Change  

PADCAE is classified in Category II. Agriculture is one of the five most vulnerable sectors identified 

in Burundi, including forestry, water resources, energy and health. The climatic risks identified are 

linked to: (i) the availability of water for irrigation; (ii) soil erosion; (iii) the impact of extreme weather 

conditions (heavy rains and intense heat); (iv) the sustainability of physical infrastructure; (v) farming 

and irrigation techniques & systems; (vi) livestock feed (fodder/feed); (vii) sustainability of stock 

breeding systems; and (viii) the prevention and control of parasites and animal diseases. The potential 

impacts include: the modification of the farming seasons and calendar; lower crop yields due to 

increased erosion; faster land degradation and loss of soil fertility due to very heavy rains and more 

frequent disasters linked to extreme weather events (flooding of marshes and shallows, mudslides and 

landslides, hail, storms, etc.).  PADCAE will build climate resilience through the choice of agricultural 

technologies and climate-resilient seeds, the training of senior staff/agents of institutions and farmers as 

well as reforestation, thereby contributing to climate finance. 

3.2.3. Gender and Women’s Empowerment  

3.2.3.1  The project is classified in Category 2 according to the Gender Marker System since many of 

its key outcomes contribute to bridging gender inequalities. Since the project’s objective is to sustainably 

boost agricultural productivity and production, women, who form the bulk of the agricultural work force, 

should be its prime beneficiaries.   

3.2.3.2  Project activities aim to further empower women economically and socially. If implemented, 

the project will facilitate: (i) women’s better access to production tools (notably land), (ii) women’s 

socio-economic empowerment, (iii) a greater male/female participation in promoting agribusiness in the 

project area, (iv) the equitable access of women and young people to project resources; (v) women’s 

increased participation in the decision-making process, (vi) greater technical capacity of MINEAGRIE 

and other key stakeholders to mainstream gender in their policies, strategies and activities, and (vii) a 

better understanding of gender specificities through the Country Gender Profile with special emphasis 

on the links between poverty, the agriculture sector and women’s empowerment. The project will also 

support activities related to monitoring and evaluation information disaggregated by gender in the 

reports generated. The major risks concern: (i) domestic conflicts caused by land certification, (ii) the 

unequal distribution of project gains favouring men and/or exclusive male control of the project, (iii) 



 

13 

the risk that the training given to MINEAGRIE officials and other partners does not translate into 

gender-sensitive interventions, (iv) the risk that the pro-women access to credit is usurped by their 

spouses, and (v) resistance to women’s participation in highly profitable value chain segments or in high 

income crops, subsequently generating social conflicts. The solutions to optimally mitigate these risks 

are described in the Technical Annexes (Volume II). 

3.2.4 Social  

PADCAE’s contribution to improving the populations’ living conditions is undeniable. It contributes to 

higher productivity, better organisation/relations among various agriculture and livestock value chain 

segments, better access to basic infrastructure (agricultural tracks, storage facilities, market), improved 

nutritional value of agricultural and livestock products, and gender inclusion (56% of beneficiaries are 

women). Furthermore, it will foster better living conditions for beneficiaries and improve the nutritional 

status of the population, particularly women and children. Digitising agriculture and the land tenure 

system will help to strengthen good governance, reduce social tensions and promote private sector 

investments in agriculture. By creating jobs for young people through the promotion of agricultural 

entrepreneurship, the project will help to reduce unemployment, fight against migration and rural exodus 

among the youth, and reduce the social inequalities of which they are a victim. Finally, the project will 

help reduce the risks12 associated with the factors of fragility affecting the country, as identified in the 

study report on Burundi's fragility and make the agricultural sector the engine of growth and the fight 

against poverty 

IV – IMPLEMENTATION 

4.1.  Implementation Arrangements 

4.1.1.  Implementation Arrangements-Monitoring and Evaluation Mechanism  

4.1.1.1  The Ministry of Environment, Agriculture and Livestock (MINEAGRIE) is the oversight 

authority of the project. Project activities will be managed, coordinated, monitored and supervised by 

the Management Unit of PATAREB located in the DPAE of Kirundo which includes: a coordinator, a 

rural engineering specialist, a procurement specialist, an agronomy/value chain specialist, a socio-

economist, an administrative and financial officer, an accountant, and a cashier. The Bank's preparation 

mission conducted in June 2019 concluded that the profile and experience of these staff members was 

acceptable after reviewing and analyzing their resumes. However, it did identify communication 

problems among team members that impede the optimal functioning of the PMC. A recent performance 

evaluation of project staff led to the non-renewal of the contract of the Administrative and Financial 

Manager for lack of results. The Government has also recently launched an evaluation of the PMU, the 

results of which and the actions resulting from it will help improve the project's performance. The Bank 

will also conduct close supervision missions that will contribute to better operation of the PMC. In 

addition, the PMU will also be strengthened by additional staff recruited on a competitive basis and 

including a PADCAE-B Project Manager, an environmental expert, a procurement assistant and an 

accountant. The selected activities will be implemented by the MINEAGRIE Provincial Bureaux of 

Agriculture and Livestock (BPAE) and service providers under specific contracts. Project focal points 

will be designated in the two BPAEs (Ngozi and Muyinga) to ensure liaison and monitoring.. At the 

central level in Bujumbura, PADCAE-B will use the PATAREB Project’s antenna to liaise with the 

supervisory Ministry, the project’s Technical and Financial Partners, the Administration’s central 

services, and research and development institutions. 

4.1.1.2  For the sake of coordination and harmonization, the framing and orientation of the execution, 

review and approval of work programs, annual budgets (PTBA), and activity reports of the PADCAE-

 
12 The risks identified relate to (i) land tenure security, (ii) low productivity in the agricultural sector and food insecurity , 

(iii) weak land use planning and infrastructure, (iv) social inequalities and unemployment, particularly among young 

people and women, and (v) exposure to natural disasters. 



 

14 

B project will be ensured by the same Steering Committee as that of PATAREB which will be enlarged 

with : (i) the Governors of the Provinces of Ngozi and Muyinga; (ii) the Provincial Directors (BPEAE) 

of Ngozi and Muyinga; (iii) the representatives of producers or agricultural producer organizations 

(OPAOs) of the Provinces of Ngozi and Muyiga; and (iv) a representative of the Forum of Agricultural 

Producers' Organizations of Burundi (FOPABU). 

4.1.1.3  In designing the project’s monitoring and evaluation system, account will be taken of the 

targeted indicators selected for project components/activities as well as the expected impact, outcomes 

and output indicators. For better coordination and harmonisation, the Results-based management (RBM) 

monitoring and evaluation arrangement will be incorporated in the Automated and Decentralised 

Monitoring and Evaluation (ADME) system used by MINEAGRIE and the PNSADR-IM Project 

financed by IFAD. Internal monitoring and evaluation will be conducted by the project’s Monitoring 

and Evaluation Unit, while external monitoring and evaluation will be conducted by DGPAE and the 

Ministry of Finance. The Bank will field annual monitoring and supervision missions while its Country 

Office in Burundi will monitor the project, maintaining ongoing dialogue with the country’s authorities, 

and Technical and Financial Partners. According to Bank rules and requirements, quarterly, annual, 

progress and audit reports will also be prepared and submitted to the Bank, pursuant to agreements 

signed.  

4.1.2.  Procurement Arrangements  

4.1.2.1  The national public procurement system in Burundi is currently governed by Law No. 1/04 of 

29 January 2018 amending Law No. 1/01 of 4 February 2008 instituting the Public Procurement Code 

(PPC). The legislative and regulatory framework of procurement is made up of the law and decrees 

laying down the establishment, organisation and operation of the Public Procurements Regulatory 

Authority (ARMP), the National Directorate of Public Procurement Control (DNCMP) and Public 

Procurement Management Units (CGMP) as well as ordinances defining procurement thresholds, 

control and publication of contracts. The scope of the PPC covers all procurement by contracting 

authorities as well as all types of public contracts without waivers, with the exception of contracts which 

are of a secret nature incompatible with any form of competition or publicity, or where the protection 

of the fundamental interests of national security so requires.   

4.1.2.2  The assessment of Burundi’s national public procurement system (NPS) led to the qualification 

of its procurement risk as moderate. This generic country risk was reviewed in the context of 

implementation of activities under the Agriculture and Livestock Value Chains Sustainable 

Development Support Project in Burundi (PADCAE-B) to be considered in determining the project's 

global procurement risk. The overall project procurement risk rating (PPRR) at the time of the 

assessment is deemed moderate.   

4.1.2.3  Consequently, NPS will be used for the procurement of goods, works and consultancy services 

for amounts not exceeding the thresholds defined in Annex B5 of the Technical Annexes and the Public 

Procurement Plan and which do not entail a significant risk for the project considering their value, 

specificity and availability on the national market. Other procurements with a significant risk if NPS is 

used, will be awarded using the Bank’s Procurement Methods and Procedures (PMP) pursuant to the 

Procurement Policy for Bank Group-funded Operations, dated October 2015 and using the Bank’s 

relevant standard bidding documents (SBD). 

4.1.3. Procurement Capacity and Risk Assessment (PCRA)  

Risks at country, sector and project levels and the Project Executing Agency’s (PEA) procurement 

capacity were assessed. A market analysis was also conducted notably to obtain information on the 

market characteristics, bills that could affect competition and the key players on sector markets. The 

assessment results and market analysis served to guide the decision to choose NPSNPS for certain 

project activities and PMP for other activities entailing significant risk. They also made it possible to 



 

15 

plan procurements, structure contracts, choose the best procurement methods and procedures (MPA or 

NPS) suited to the goal sought, define the framework of Bank review and supervision. Appropriate risk 

mitigation measures were included in the Procurement Risks and Capacity Assessment (PERCA) action 

plan set out in Annex B5. A procurement audit will be performed by an independent firm under the 

supervision of ARMP. The project will also support ARMP to build the procurement capacity of the 

staff of MINEAGRIE’s Public Procurement Unit and the Project Implementation Unit. A Global Action 

Plan for Improving the Procurement System is detailed in Annex B5 of the technical annexes. 

4.1.4. Financial Management and Disbursement  

Financial Management: Responsibility for the project’s administrative, accounting and financial 

management will be entrusted to the coordination unit of PATAREB whose capacity will be built with 

the recruitment of additional staff whose qualifications are specified in the Technical Annexes (Volume 

II). The institutional analysis showed that the Project Management Unit’s current financial management 

systems are not satisfactory overall and that the overall fiduciary risk is significant due to the absence 

of: (i.) a budget coupled with the schedule of activities, (ii.) an administrative, financial and accounting 

procedures manual, (iii.) an accountant and cashier, (iv.) distribution of financial tasks, (v.) fixed asset 

register and fuel tracking table, (vi.) an improved missions tracking table, (vii.) room and metal cabinets 

for accounting vouchers, (viii.) a cost accounting plan and specific budget accounting plan for the 

project, (ix.) an accounting software, (ix.) a cashflow forecast plan, (x.) quarterly and biannual progress 

reports comprising interim financial statements, and (xi.) an external audit firm to audit the project. To 

address these constraints, the Project Management Unit will: (i) upon project launching and at the 

beginning of the year, prepare a budget plan coupled with a provisional schedule of activities; (ii) finalise 

before project commencement the contract of the consultant tasked with preparing the administrative, 

financial and accounting procedures manual. The consultant will also design templates of the fuel 

tracking table, missions tracking statement and maintenance/repairs monitoring statement; (iii) finalise, 

before Project commencement,  the recruitment of the Accountant and Cashier; (iv) after the recruitment 

of the Accountant and Cashier, distribute financial tasks as mentioned above; (v) after project 

commencement, assign an office and procure secured metal cabinets for accounting vouchers to be 

arranged by year and sequentially; (vi) immediately draw up a fixed assets register initialled and 

containing the number, designation, amount and location thereof; (vii) immediately draw up a weekly 

fuel tracking table; (viii) immediately improve the missions tracking table; (ix) upon project 

commencement, prepare specific cost and budget accounting plans for the project; (x) before project 

commencement, procure a software with built-in modules for general and cost accounting and budget 

management. The software contract should provide for staff training and technical assistance; (xi) upon 

Grant effectiveness, open a special foreign exchange account and two special accounts in Burundi 

Francs, one of which for the national counterpart contribution, in an acceptable bank in Burundi ; (xii) 

upon project commencement, establish a petty cash fund for amounts not exceeding BIF100,000, or 

EUR 50; (xiii) upon first disbursement, draw up a cashflow plan; (xiv) upon project commencement and 

at the beginning of the year, prepare a budget coupled with a schedule of activities; (xv) within three 

and six months of project commencement, prepare quarterly and biannual progress reports incorporating 

interim financial statements and transmit same to the Bank, the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock 

and the Steering Committee; and (xvi) upon project commencement, recruit an external audit firm. 

Lastly, during the launching of the project, the Bank (AfDB) is expected to train the Coordinator, Head 

of the Administrative and Financial Service, the Accountant and Cashier on Bank financial management 

procedures. 

Disbursements: Pursuant to the provisions of the Disbursement manual in force at the Bank. On ADF 

resources: the proposed disbursement methods are: (a) the special account method (for operating 

expenses, capacity building activities and the management of some partnership agreements) and (b) the 

direct payment method for payment of works, goods and service provision contracts. As concerns TSF 

resources: (a) the special account method (for operating expenses, capacity building activities, and the 

management of some partnership agreements) and (b) the direct payment method for the payment of 

works, goods and service provision contracts. The reimbursement method will be used when eligible 



 

16 

expenses for TSF Grant resources have been pre-financed by the Government with the Bank’s approval. 

The project will open the following special accounts in the name of PADCAE-B, in local currency (BIF), 

in financial institutions deemed acceptable to the Bank. One special account will be opened per source 

of financing. Disbursement arrangements are detailed in the Technical Annexes (Volume II)

4.3 Governance  

4.3.1 Since the 2015 crisis, the country has made significant progress in consolidating economic and 

financial governance. Several structural reforms to improve and consolidate the macroeconomic and 

budget framework in terms of resource mobilisation and streamlining of public spending were carried 

through. The new government scaled down the State apparatus by reducing the number of ministries 

from 21 to 15. However, improvements are needed to mobilise internal resources to tackle the ever-

growing expenditure and to programme and allocate public resources to achieve the PND objectives. 

The public procurement system was marked by several reforms to enhance the transparency of the 

system. Despite this progress, improvements are still necessary in the areas of implementation, slowness 

of procedures, and disputes management to make the system compliant with the relevant standards.  

4.3.2  The persistence of customs and traditions governing land access and inheritance in a modern 

economy context hinders investments in the agricultural sector. By digitising the land tenure system and 

issuing land certificates, the project will contribute to good governance in this sector, thus fostering 

private sector investments and easing social tensions. The digitised management of the fertilisation 

system will improve the efficiency of the supply mechanism and strengthen good governance. Lastly, 

the project will use an Automated and Decentralised Monitoring and Evaluation system to allow for the 

regular monitoring of field activities and launch of alerts and warnings whenever necessary following a 

vertical approach for all project stakeholders.  

4.4  Sustainability   

4.4.1  The project aims to initiate a truly sustainable development, by placing the targeted value chain 

players at the centre of decision-making and building their capacity to take on new responsibilities. The 

design of this project is based on value chain stakeholders’ demand jointly expressed throughout the 

process and which helped to guarantee their full ownership of the project. All the retained crops and the 

associated value chains exist in the project zones. The project intervention aims to amplify and 

perpetuate existing initiatives through technological innovations and link up the various value chain 

segments. 



 

17 

4.4.2  The sustainability of investments and expected benefits build on participatory entrepreneurial 

approaches involving capacity building. These include: (i) the structuring and professionalisation of 

farmers’ cooperatives and other value chain stakeholders based on expressed demand, (ii) the 

empowerment of provincial technical services to implement project activities; (iii) the inclusion and 

empowerment of women and young people through training and funding access mechanisms; (iv) the 

choice of tested technologies that can be controlled locally; (v) participation and empowerment of value 

chain stakeholders and local communities in the management of constructed infrastructure; (vi) capacity 

building and empowerment of provincial and communal technical Directorates of MINEAGRIE and 

other ministries and research and development institutions in the areas of implementation of project 

activities and monitoring; and (vi) the setting up of well-trained water users’ associations (WUA) in 

irrigated areas. This will allow for good sustainable management and regular maintenance of works.

swaps and ownership by all parties involved 

4.6 Knowledge Building  

4.6.1  The project ensures technology/knowledge transfer to national research and development 

institutions, and from them to agriculture and livestock value chain stakeholders in the field, via the 

TAAT stakeholder intervention mechanism. These technology aspects include the development of 

resilient seeds, the rational use of fertilisers and the genetic improvement and feeding of livestock. In 

collaboration with AfricaRice, the project will pilot the use of the digital RiceAdvice tool to help rice 

farmers to better monitor crops and improve yields and their incomes through personalised advice on 

management and good agricultural practices.  

4.6.2  The use of new technologies will be built into the project, thanks to the Digitisation for 

Agriculture (D4Ag) concept and approach. Through D4Ag, the project will contribute to: (i) the 

establishment of SEAD, helping to strengthen the monitoring and evaluation mechanism, (ii) the 

establishment of MINEAGRIE’s agriculture database and digitisation of the advisory support system, 

(iii) the connection of different value chain stakeholders (production, processing and marketing), (iv) 



 

18 

the strengthening of good governance ensuring control over supply channels and traceability of inputs 

supplied to farmers with the adoption of e-vouchers, and (vi) setting up of the land management system 

(land certification). 

4.6.3  To improve beneficiaries’ livelihoods and build their resilience to recurrent shocks and crises, 

the project will adopt the Farmer Field School (FFS) approach and Resilience Fund (CdR) that capitalise 

on individual and collective expertise, knowledge, skills and capacity to better understand and exploit 

agro-ecosystems. Bad habits are gradually transformed into springboards for good agricultural, 

nutritional, economic and social practice. The Resilience Fund approach is community-centred and 

contains three dimensions: a productive/technical dimension (use of sustainable agricultural practices), 

a financial/economic dimension (access to credit), and a social dimension (strengthening of social 

cohesion and solidarity by creating or strengthening farmers’ or women’s associations). This approach 

aims to gather and diversify the production assets and knowledge of vulnerable agro-pastoral 

smallholders facing food insecurity, especially women. The approach is innovative since the support 

provided targets the three dimensions in a complementary manner, which opens up more opportunities 

for beneficiaries and enables them to better prepare themselves for multiple risks.  

4.6.4  With regard to gender, the project will prepare an updated diagnosis of all gender disparities in 

different domains – Country Gender Profile, with special emphasis on the links between poverty, 

agriculture sector and women’s empowerment.

Executive Summary 

 

 

Project overview: The Project to Strengthen Resilience of Rural Communities to Food and 

Nutrition Insecurity in Niger (PRECIS) aims to sustainably improve the food and nutrition 

security of rural households and strengthen their resilience to climatic and environmental 

shocks. It will support small-scale producers by removing production and marketing constraints 

in the cereal, market gardening, poultry and small livestock production sub-sectors, through 

two technical components that will have the following effects: (i) diversify production, increase 

yields and the capacity to adapt to external shocks, particularly climatic shocks, as well as 

improve the nutrition security of rural producers (including women and young people); and (ii) 

enhance the value of agro-sylvo-pastoral production surpluses through increased marketing on 

semi-wholesale markets and the promotion of agricultural entrepreneurship with sustainable 

integration into the local, regional and national economy.  

The main achievements expected from PRECIS include: (i) increased income for some 210,000 

households, or approximately 1,470,000 persons; (ii) the building of 117 water harnessing 

structures; (iii) the creation/strengthening of 30,040 Rural Young Enterprises (RYEs), 

including at least 30% owned by women; (iv) direct support for 35,000 households in the form 

of nutrition education, benefiting 245,000 persons; (v) the opening of 660 literacy centres to 

build the capacity of 33,000 household members; (vi) the strengthening/consolidation of 2,080 

producer organisations/groups to improve their technical and management capacity; (vii) the 

creation/consolidation of approximately 45,060 direct jobs in rural areas; (viii) the training of 

at least 33,000 beneficiaries in the various themes related to climate change adaptation and the 

management and promotion of micro-enterprises; (ix) the construction of 9 semi-wholesale 

markets and 18 operational collection centres; (x) the setting up of 10 operational farmers' 

houses offering input and production equipment supply services to family farmers; (xi) the 

rehabilitation of 348 km of roads linking production areas to collection centres and semi-

wholesale markets; and (xii) enhancement, in the short and long term, of the resilience of 

communities in the target areas enabling them to cope with the effects of COVID-19 and other 

natural and health shocks in the future.  

The overall programme will be implemented over a six-year period for a total sum of UA 147.80 

million (Bank financing will cover a five-year period). The Bank's contribution to the project 

financing will amount to UA 25.859 million, provided in the form of a grant from the Transition 

Support Facility (TSF). More specifically, the Bank's financing will be earmarked for the "water 

harnessing" and "agricultural entrepreneurship" components and will be incorporated into the 

operational mechanism of the IFAD-funded Family Farming Development Programme 

(ProDAF), which will be strengthened.  

In the context of the response to post-COVID-19, the project plans to carry out a short- and 

medium-term emergency programme to help people affected by the disease who were obliged 

to deplete their stocks and savings. This operation will restore the productive base of farmers 

in the project area who have been severely hit by the pandemic.  

Needs assessment: The size and fertility of farmland in the project area is steadily declining 

due to lack of water, loss of vegetation cover, arid climate, erosion and increasing population 

pressure. Surface water resources are severely affected by recurrent and chronic droughts. 

Moreover, Niger is facing a situation of growing insecurity, characterized by terrorist attacks 

on the borders with Nigeria and Mali, aggravating the people’s vulnerability. The livelihood of 

the population concerned by the project consists mainly of small-scale agriculture and family 

livestock farming, which employ more than 85% of the workforce. Agriculture is the leading 



 

v 

 

sector in terms of economic activity in the region and in the country, accounting for the largest 

contribution to GDP, estimated at 43.4% in 2018. However, the region has huge, but 

inadequately exploited, resources in the agro-pastoral sector. The under-exploitation of these 

resources leaves the rural sector vulnerable to the vagaries of climate, which adversely impact 

agriculture by causing the degradation of natural resources. As a result, performance in terms 

of output and productivity is poor and food insecurity is a virtually permanent problem. With 

an estimated 200,000 hectares of land lost to desert encroachment annually, the environmental 

situation of the project is all the more precarious due to the magnitude of land degradation, poor 

preservation of biodiversity, and difficulties in ensuring the sustainable management of land 

and water resources. This project aims to sustainably improve the food and nutrition security 

of rural households in the targeted areas and to strengthen their resilience to climatic shocks 

and natural resource degradation. It will work towards the emergence of development poles in 

four regions of the country, which are home to 12.9 million inhabitants, representing 60.2% of 

the national population.  

Value added for the African Development Bank: For more than 20 years, the Bank has 

accumulated special experience in Niger in the area of water harnessing and natural resource 

protection. It has financed about a dozen studies and projects (PMET Tahoua, PADAZ Zinder, 

PADL Diffa, PVDT Dosso-Tillaberi, PMERSA-MTZ, PROMOVARE, PDIPC, P2RS, etc.) for 

specific regions of the country, and which have improved the living conditions of men and 

women in rural areas, while developing technical and organisational approaches tailored to 

local contexts. The Bank has become a privileged partner in this sector thanks to its success in 

water control and harnessing. On the strength of this experience and given the numerous 

challenges that Niger still faces (climatic, economic, security, etc.), the Bank must continue its 

efforts in the areas of water harnessing, women's empowerment and support for agricultural 

entrepreneurship. The Bank's operations will help reduce poverty, promote youth and women's 

employment, strengthen adaptation to climate change and increase the resilience of vulnerable 

segments of the population to food and nutrition insecurity. By co-financing PRECIS, the Bank, 

in full compliance with its strategic guidelines, will strengthen the partnerships already 

established with other TFPs and contribute significantly to the mobilization of financial 

resources for a wide-ranging programme. 

Knowledge building: PRECIS will contribute to the training and the consolidation of the 

know-how of producers. With regard to resilience to climate change, the project will develop 

and disseminate innovative technologies in agriculture and small-scale livestock farming, for 

both production and processing activities, while enhancing local know-how and skills in the 

Sahelian environment. In an inclusive manner, it will enable young people and women to 

develop technical and entrepreneurial capacities by settling on land with modern infrastructure 

and means of exploitation and will promote the development of para-agricultural activities 

through supported rural micro-enterprises. Furthermore, it will support the water harnessing at 

regional level and provide expertise in terms of irrigation techniques at the individual and local 

levels, coupled with the judicious use of climate information. The project will help to build 

women's leadership capacity and strengthen their economic empowerment, as well as contribute 

to the greater implementation of gender equality-promoting policies. The mechanisms for 

disseminating and capitalizing on the project's outcomes and best practices, and the process of 

generating endogenous value for the benefit of vulnerable groups through the development of 

value chains will also contribute to knowledge building. 

  



 

vi 

 

 

The project will be coordinated by the staff of the National Representation and Technical 

Assistance Unit (CENRAT), which will benefit from skills transfer. Best practices in water 

resource management, irrigation, agricultural extension, database management, dissemination 

and use of climate information, youth entrepreneurship and environmental and social 

safeguards will be capitalized on and disseminated, using various communication mechanisms 

already set up under PRECIS (awareness-raising meetings, agricultural advisory services, 

farmer field schools, etc.).

NIGER 

 

PROJECT TO STRENGTHEN RESILIENCE OF RURAL COMMUNITIES TO FOOD 

AND NUTRITION INSECURITY IN NIGER (PRECIS) 

 

Management submits this report and recommendations concerning the proposed award of a TSF 

grant of UA 25.859 million to the Republic of Niger to finance the Project to Strengthen Resilience 

of Rural Communities to Food and Nutrition Insecurity in Niger (PRECIS). 

I  STRATEGIC THRUST AND RATIONALE  

1.1. Project Linkages with Country Strategy and Objectives  

1.1.1 Niger's 2018-2022 Country Strategy Paper (CSP) is based on two strategic pillars, with 

two main sub-pillars, namely: mobilisation and harnessing of water resources, and development 

of agro-pastoral value chains. These two areas are already being supported by the Bank and 

other TFPs, whose efforts have yielded encouraging outcomes that will be consolidated and 

amplified by PRECIS, as part of the consolidation of the "development poles" approach that is 

already in place and which aims to promote the transformation of production systems and the 

establishment of strong links between the various segments of the value chains within the main 

agro-pastoral sub-sectors. PRECIS is also in line with the foundations of the 3N (Nigeriens 

Nourish Nigeriens) Initiative, which aims to protect the people of Niger from hunger and 

malnutrition, in the long term, and to create conditions enabling them to participate fully in 

national production and improve their income. Furthermore, in 2018, the Government of Niger 

developed an "Integrated Programme for Resilience to Food and Nutrition Insecurity" (Pro-

resilience Programme 2019-2021), aimed at, inter alia: (i) increasing and diversifying agro-

sylvo-pastoral and fisheries production; (ii) ensuring the regular supply of agricultural and agri-

food products to rural and urban markets; and (iii) improving the people's resilience to food 

crises and natural disasters and/or climatic shocks. The project activities will also be in line 

with the Small-Scale Irrigation Strategy in Niger (SPIN), which is currently being implemented, 

as well as with the Five-Year Action Plan for the implementation of the National Gender Policy 

(NGP), whose vision for 2027 is to "build, with all stakeholders, a society, without 

discrimination, where men and women, girls and boys have equal opportunities to participate 

in its development and enjoy the benefits of its growth". Lastly, the project is consistent with 

Niger's nationally determined contribution (NDC), particularly in the context of climate 

adaptation and resilience in the agricultural sector, as well as the reduction of emissions related 

to land use patterns and land allocation.  

1.2. Rationale for Bank Intervention  

1.2.1 For more than 20 years, the Bank has accumulated special experience in Niger in the 

area of water harnessing and natural resource protection. Indeed, it has financed about a dozen 

studies and projects (PMET Tahoua, PADAZ Zinder, PADL Diffa, PVDT Dosso-Tillaberi, 

PMERSA-MTZ, PROMOVARE, PDIPC, P2RS, etc.) targeted at the regions, and which have 

improved the living conditions of men and women in rural areas, while developing technical 

and organisational approaches tailored to local contexts. The Bank has become a privileged 

partner in this sector thanks to its success in water control and harnessing.  

 

1.2.2 The portfolio review, conducted by the Bank in December 2019, revealed that the 

Bank's active portfolio in Niger comprises 15 operations worth a total of just over UA 

476,000,000, with national projects accounting for 49.21%, multinational projects for 48.08%, 



 

2 

 

and a private sector operation for 2.7%. The average timeframe for fulfilling the conditions 

precedent to first disbursement is longer than the institutional standard, but the projects 

approved in 2019 performed well in terms of the timeframes for signature (1 month) and 

effectiveness (2.8 months). The review also noted satisfactory progress in the performance of 

the agricultural project portfolio. In particular, the PMERSA-MTZ, which was closed in 

September 2019, yielded satisfactory results, reflected especially in the completion of 69 water 

harnessing works, the development of 2,343 ha of small irrigated areas (PPI) and the 

reclamation of 2,100 ha of degraded land, making it possible to: (i) harness more than 70 million 

cubic metres of water; (ii) increase production by more than 168,720 tonnes (irrigated/flood-

recession and rain-fed crops); (iii) create more than 41,805 jobs; and (iv) multiply the income 

of producers by 3.9 times compared with the baseline situation. On the strength of the 

experience it has acquired over the past two decades, and given the numerous challenges that 

Niger still faces (climatic, economic, security, etc.), the Bank must continue its efforts on water 

harnessing, women's empowerment and support for agricultural entrepreneurship. By co-

financing PRECIS, the Bank, in line with its strategic orientations, will strengthen the 

partnerships already established with other TFPs (such as the co-financing of the Kandadji dam) 

and contribute to the significant mobilisation of financial resources. This type of investment is 

likely to limit security risks by targeting the most vulnerable local communities.  

 

1.2.3 The objectives of PRECIS are in keeping with the Bank's High 5s, which aim to feed 

Africa by 2025 and improve the living conditions of people of the continent by developing 

value chains, building the capacities of stakeholders, creating jobs and generating income. The 

project is directly linked to the specific areas of the Bank's Long-Term Strategy (LTS 2013-

2022), dealing with agriculture and food security, as well as gender issues. Moreover, by 

involving producers in private initiative, the project is aligned with the Bank's Ten-Year 

Strategy (2013-2022) and particularly with the objective of inclusive growth. The project also 

dovetails with the guidelines of the Bank's Agricultural Sector Strategy (2016-2025), which 

give pre-eminence to the development of value chains and agricultural entrepreneurship. 

Furthermore, the project supports the Bank's Climate Change Action Plan (CCAP II 2016-

2020), especially Pillar I on climate adaptation and resilience in key sectors including 

agriculture, as well as Pillar II which aims to promote low-emission development. 

1.3. Aid Coordination  

1.3.1 In Niger, official development assistance is coordinated by the consultative and 

consultation bodies of the Economic and Social Development Plan (PDES). Thus, several sector 

coordination poles have been set up. The Bank co-chairs the PDES “Infrastructure” sector 

coordination pole with the Ministry of Equipment. It is a member of the "rural areas 

transformation" pole. The Bank's role has been strengthened following the opening of its 

Country Office in Niger. The TFPs are also involved in the National Technical Committee in 

charge of monitoring PDES implementation. The technical partners are engaged in a constant 

process of dialogue and mutual consultation with a view to ensuring the effective coordination 

of their respective operations in Niger.

1.3.2  The operations of the various partners in the broader rural sector (agriculture, livestock, 
fisheries, environment, etc.) are presented in Annex A4 of Volume 2 and may be summarised as 

follows: 

II  PROJECT DESCRIPTION 

2.1. Project Components  

2.1.1 The overall objective of PRECIS is to sustainably improve the food and nutrition 

security of rural households and strengthen their resilience to climate shocks and natural 

resource degradation. The specific development objectives of the project are to increase rural 

household incomes, improve livelihoods and lives, and the socio-economic integration of young 

people (men and women) into productive rural occupations. 

2.1.2 PRECIS covers a period of five years and is structured around three main components: 

Component A, which will focus on sustainable agricultural development, strengthening the 

resilience of rural households and short-term response to the effects of COVID-19; Component 

B, which will focus on promoting youth entrepreneurship and market access; and Component 

C, which will be dedicated to coordination, management, monitoring/evaluation and knowledge 

transfer. The following table presents the main activities planned by component and sub-

beneficiaries. The design of water harnessing structures (mini-dams and weirs) takes into 

account the experience gained over more than two decades at both technical and organisational 

levels. The roads will be rehabilitated with special focus on the treatment of the critical points, 

which will allow uninterrupted and smooth traffic all year round. The table below summarises 

the main alternatives that were considered and finally rejected. 

Table 2.2: Alternative Solutions Considered and Reasons for Rejection  

Alternative 

Solutions  
Brief Description Reasons for Rejection 

Bank interventions 
in all components 

and sub-

components of 

PRECIS. 

TSF resources for this 
programme are limited and are 

mobilized to partially finance the 

various project activities, with 

no specific targeting. 

Spreading the Bank's funding across multiple 

activities would limit its impact and make 
implementation more difficult. Focusing TSF 

financing on water harnessing and youth 

employment facilitates implementation while 

remaining consistent with CSP priorities. 

Development of 

large irrigated 

areas downstream 

of dams. 

Development of large irrigated 

areas downstream of new dams. 

This solution is ill-adapted to all regional 

configurations and entails significant capital 

requirements, which would limit the number of 

structures and hence the number of people affected. 

Light resurfacing 

of the roads to be 

rehabilitated. 

Repairing existing roads by 

lightly resurfacing the wearing 

course in place. 

The targeted areas will not be opened up on a 

sustainable basis due to numerous critical points 

and crossings that have not been repaired. The 

option of comprehensive rehabilitation, including 

all the critical areas, was therefore selected. 

2.3. Project Type  

PRECIS is an investment operation that is in line with a programmatic approach co-financed 

from various resources including those of TSF, OFID, GEF, GCF and IFAD. The Government 

of Niger has not yet fully committed itself to implementing projects and programmes through 

the sector-based approach, on account of several institutional constraints. The programme-

based co-financing approach is at this stage more advisable, since it guarantees the achievement 

of outcomes and ensures the effective and efficient use of the resources allocated to the project 

which will, in addition, capitalise on the Bank's achievements in Niger. 

2.4. Project Cost and Financing Arrangements 

2.4.1 The total project cost is estimated at UA 147.802 million (CFAF 119.450 billion), of 

which UA 34.620 million is in foreign exchange (CFAF 27.979 billion) and UA 113.181 

million in local currency (CFAF 91.470 billion). Customs duties and taxes have been accounted 

for and will be borne by the State which will take the necessary steps to ensure that this 

arrangement is adhered to. The foreign exchange portion constitutes 23.4% of the total cost and 

the local currency portion amounts to 76.6%. Contingencies have thus been estimated at UA 

14.647 million (CFAF 11.837 million). The project cost by component and by expenditure 

category is summarized in tables 2.3 and 2.4 below.

2.4.3 Slightly more than two-thirds of the Bank's financing is allocated to the Agricultural 

Development and Resilience component, mainly for the extension and development of irrigated 

land. About 15.5% is devoted to the promotion of youth and women's entrepreneurship and 

9.4% to operating expenses. Physical contingences account for 3% and financial contingencies 

for 5.5%. 

For ADF financing, and considering the country's tight budgetary context, the Government will 

not be required to make any financial contribution, apart from granting exemptions. Given the 

specific character of this programme and the nature of the activities financed, the various TFPs 

have decided to finance the project on a parallel basis. 

2.5. Project Area and Beneficiaries  

2.5.1 In its entirety, PRECIS covers 186 municipalities located in the regions of Dosso, 

Tahoua, Maradi and Zinder (PRECIS-AfDB will not be involved in the Dosso region), and will 

directly affect nearly 210,000 households, or approximately 1,470,000 people. The population 

of the neighbouring areas should also benefit indirectly from the momentum created by the 

Economic Development Pole (PDE) approach. The agro-socio-economic environment of the 

resident rural inhabitants is characterised by a low rate of access to support and development 

infrastructure, especially roads, shops and other infrastructure for processing and for promoting 

rural entrepreneurship, required to stabilise young people, ease the chores of women and reduce 

their economic vulnerability in the regions concerned. 

2.5.2 PRECIS will target more specifically: (i) sedentary small farmers engaged in cereal 

production (maize, sorghum, millet), rice farming in the Dosso region, market gardening, 

poultry farming and small-scale stockbreeding; (ii) employed or unemployed young men and 

women (18 to 35 years old) who wish to set up their own micro and small enterprises in the 

various selected sub-sectors; (iii) women farmers or women wishing to carry out income-

generating activities; (iv) actors upstream and downstream of the production chain, engaged in 

related trades and in service provision; (v) professional organizations (grassroots groups, 

cooperatives, unions and federations); (vi) vulnerable farming households that are motivated 

and wish to enlarge and develop their farms; and (vii) persons with disabilities in rural areas 



 

8 

 

who participate or intend to participate in activities along the selected value chains. PRECIS 

aims ultimately to achieve gender parity by ensuring that women (youth and adults) make up 

50% of project beneficiaries and that at least 30% of Rural Young Enterprises (RYEs) set up 

and/or strengthened are women-owned. 

2.6. Participatory Approach to Project Identification, Design and Implementation 

2.6.1 The project is the result of a participatory and inclusive approach that involves all 

stakeholders: technical services, producers' organisations, women/youth groups, civil society, 

the private sector, TFPs and projects, etc. These broad consultations, which took place at all the 

formulation and evaluation stages, focused particularly on the criteria for choosing operation 

sites, the prospects for developing the value chains of profitable sub-sectors, the opportunities 

for promoting youth employment and entrepreneurship and their financing mechanisms, the 

lessons derived from previous similar projects, the shortcomings noted during the 

implementation of the projects, the main PRECIS intervention guidelines and strategies, the 

role of various actors in the new project context and the operating methods for ensuring proper 

implementation of the project, and the opinions and recommendations of key players.  

2.6.2 The project design was based on experience gained from carrying out or having carried 

out operations on the ground (PMERSA, ProDAF), and conducted in close collaboration with 

rural communities and local stakeholders. The activities identified are the result of ongoing 

consultations conducted during implementation and take into account the needs expressed by 

the population, civil society (including women), partner NGOs, producers and development 

partners. During project preparation, IFAD and the Bank carried out numerous field visits to 

potential intervention sites and to sites where projects have already been implemented. These 

visits offered an opportunity to have discussions with the communities concerned in order to 

better identify the difficulties facing them and to define the priority interventions to be carried 

out. The implementation mechanisms planned at the regional level will enable this inclusive 

approach to be continued during the implementation phase. 

2.7. Consideration of the Bank's Experience and Lessons in the Project Design 

For more than 20 years, the Bank has accumulated special experience in Niger in the area of 

water harnessing and natural resource protection. Indeed, it has financed about a dozen studies 

and projects (PMET Tahoua, PADAZ Zinder, PADL Diffa, PVDT Dosso-Tillaberi, PMERSA-

MTZ, PROMOVARE, PDIPC, P2RS, etc.) targeted at the regions, and which have improved 

the living conditions of men and women in rural areas, while developing technical and 

organisational approaches tailored to local contexts. In particular, the PMERSA-MTZ project, 

worth UA 30.36 million, was concluded in September 2019, and its completion report, 

produced in November 2019, showed satisfactory outcomes with a rating of 3 out of 4. The 

design of the current project will incorporate lessons from the implementation of Bank portfolio 

projects in Niger, particularly in the agricultural sector, as well as those of TFPs, including 

IFAD. Overall, the main generic lessons derived from the implementation of water harnessing 

projects in Niger may be summarised as follows:  

 

  



 

9 

 

 

Commitments  Arrangements Adopted for PRECIS 

Delays in the start-up of initial works: For 

irrigation infrastructure projects, there are 

often significant delays in the start-up of 
works due to the non-availability of final 

design studies (FDS) and bidding documents 

(BDs). 

- Majority of existing FDS and BDs. Use of existing FDS and 

BDs already produced by PRODAF, PMERSA and DGGR;  

- Launching of the maximum number of procurements during 
years 1 and 2, including for major works; 

- Recruitment of an additional water resource management 

expert for the "water harnessing" component. 

Delays and bottlenecks encountered in the 

procurement process: The lengthy timeframes 

for the appraisal of procurement files, 

involving various parties (PMU, Bank, Govt., 

etc.), are often the cause of delays and have an 

impact on compliance with the schedule. 

- Quality in the preparation of BDs; 

- Strengthening of qualified staff at CENRAT; 

- Implementation of the recent circular prohibiting double ex-

ante controls (Govt. and AfDB); 

- Close monitoring of the validation and signing processes 

(posting of dedicated staff); and 

- Conduct of ex-post reviews/audits. 

Overall weakness and failure of enterprises: 

Irrigation projects in Niger are hampered by 

the low technical, organisational and financial 
capacity of enterprises, which makes it 

difficult to carry out works on time and in 

accordance with the required standards. 

- Quality of specifications in BDs; 

- Choice of suitable allotments; 

- Stringency in the procurement process; need to verify the 
actual experience of the companies and the projects they have 

previously implemented; 

- Adoption of a system for the close monitoring of works, 

involving qualified technicians; and 

- Capacity-building activities (companies; oversight offices,  

 and technical services). 

Difficulties in assuming responsibility for 

management and maintenance: Beneficiaries 

often find it difficult to ensure the proper 

management and maintenance of the 

infrastructure provided, and to meet operating 

costs. 

- Involvement of the communes and beneficiaries at all stages, 

including requiring financial and/or physical contributions 

from beneficiaries; 

- Setting up and training of representative and empowered 

structures in charge of management; 

- Capacity building and support for management structures; 

- Introduction of a water pricing system; and 

- Use of solar energy whenever possible to limit operating 

costs. 

2.8. Key Performance Indicators 

The monitoring and evaluation mechanism of the TSF financing will be part of the overall 

framework of the PRECIS mechanism, which is itself based on the existing PRoDAF 

mechanism. This system has a consolidator at central level (CENRAT), and M&E managers at 



 

10 

 

regional level supported by assistants. The mechanism is supported by a computerised system, 

with on-line information at regional level that geo-localises all the interventions. It is possible 

to filter requests by funding source. The system is based on permanent internal monitoring and 

periodic internal and external evaluations. Information is regularly collected and analysed, 

notably on: (i) progress towards the expected outcomes as set out in the project's logical 

framework, with the possibility of isolating those of TSF funding, and the performance of the 

actors involved in the implementation of activities; (ii) the recording and assessment of the 

effective involvement of beneficiaries, disaggregated by gender, at various stages of 

implementation; (iii) the attention given to cross-cutting aspects, nutrition, gender, youth, 

climate change, and fragility/vulnerability; and (iv) the effects and impacts of the project on 

beneficiaries, disaggregated by gender, through various types of surveys. A baseline study will 

be carried out at the start of the PRECIS to establish the values of the quantitative and qualitative 

indicators by region. The main indicators monitored, relating to TSF financing, will concern 

the number of water harnessing structures built, the areas benefiting from irrigation (hectares), 

the number of kilometres of roads rehabilitated, the number of jobs and micro-enterprises 

created, with special focus on the situation of young people and women, the number of young 

people supported, production levels (tonnes) and crop yields (t/ha) in the project area. 

III.  PROJECT FEASIBILITY 

3.1. Economic and Financial Performance 

Table 3.1: Key Economic and Financial Data 

NPV (baseline scenario) USD 102 million  

IRR (baseline scenario) 17.3 % 

ERR (baseline scenario) 18.8 %` 

3.1.1 The economic and financial analysis of PRECIS was conducted from the standpoint 

of national interest and covers the entire programme in calculating the overall return on the 

investments to be made. The analysis is based on the following assumptions: (i) a 20-year 

lifespan for the project, (ii) an opportunity rate of 10% was used to reflect the opportunity cost 

of capital in Niger, (iii) the analysis was done in constant prices and the economic benefits were 

expressed in constant values, and (iv) the supplementary agricultural production of farmers 

(millet, sorghum, cowpea, onions, cabbages, etc.) was enhanced. Crop budgets as calculated in 

the financial analysis were transformed into economic budgets by taking into account the 

economic prices (obtained using the benchmark price method) of outputs and inputs, and by 

eliminating financial costs. The detailed assumptions of the financial and economic analysis, 

the operating model tables (the baseline situation and the situation with project) and the 

financial and economic flows are recorded in Annex B7 of Volume 2. The results of the 

financial and economic analysis show that PRECIS is financially and economically viable. 

3.1.2 Financial performance: The analysis of financial return was based on the results 

produced by ProDAF's updated Economic and Financial Analysis system. For the main 

products, the results obtained suggest a satisfactory financial return for all production models. 

For market gardening, the internal rate of return (IRR) of the production models is between 

11.9% and 36%. For rain-fed cereal production (millet, sorghum and cowpea), gross margins 

are established according to the combinations between CFAF 14,000/ha and CFAF 85,000/ha, 

for IRRs of between 12% and 33%. In the case of micro-enterprises in the animal sector, gross 

margins are estimated at CFAF 58,000 (family chicken farming), CFAF 205,000 (family guinea 



 

11 

 

fowl farming), CFAF 1,033,000 (goat farming), and CFAF 1,860,000 (poultry marketing). The 

financial analysis also shows that specific youth activities offer opportunities for wealth and 

employment creation in rural areas. The following financial margins were thus recorded for the 

main activities (in CFAF million): 2.9 for meat grilling, 1.3 to 4 for onion conservation, 3 for 

egg production, 2 for bourgou production from two hectares of land, etc. 

3.1.3 Economic performance: On the basis of the adopted assumptions, the project's 

overall economic rate of return (ERR) is 18.9% and the net present value (NPV) of the net 

economic cash flow generated by PRECIS will be USD 102 million, which is a satisfactory 

result. A sensitivity analysis was carried out to test the ERR variation on the assumption of: (i) 

a 10% reduction/increase in costs and a 10% reduction/increase in profits, (ii) a variation in the 

survival rate of Rural Micro-Enterprises (RMEs), and (iii) a reduction in the size of the areas 

developed for irrigated crops. The results show that the ERR is sensitive to an increase in profits 

linked to an improvement in selling prices. In all cases, the ERR remains above the 10% 

opportunity rate. The other economic impacts of the project also concern the upstream effects 

of additional income generation on service providers (NGOs, enterprises, suppliers, 

consultancy firms, etc.), and the downstream effects of additional income generation on 

producers, traders and those engaged in processing, who are women for the most part. For 

households, the benefits of the project will include improved nutrition for vulnerable groups 

(children, women of childbearing age and the elderly), reduced medical bills, reduced hardship 

for agricultural workers, especially women, reduced incidence of monetary and non-monetary 

poverty, enhanced livelihoods and strengthened resilience to food insecurity and the effects of 

climate change for those targeted by PRECIS. 

3.2. Environmental and Social Impact 

3.2.1 Environment: PRECIS is classified in environmental and social category 1, in 

accordance with Niger's environmental and social assessment regulations and the Bank's 

Integrated Safeguard System. The prepared Environmental and Social Management Framework 

(ESMF) and the Pest and Pesticides Management Plan (PPMP) were reviewed and approved 

by the Bank, prior to their publication by the Borrower on 15 May 2020, and then by the Bank 

on 27 May 2020 following the Borrower's authorization of 25 May 2020. The Bank has 

ascertained that public consultations were duly held by the Borrower and the minutes thereof 

are annexed to the safeguard instruments that were prepared. 

The expected positive impacts are: (i) water control and land restoration; (ii) the preservation 

of pools of great biological interest; (iii) improved soil productivity; and (iv) decreased water 

erosion and land degradation within and downstream of developed areas. However, the 

following major and moderate adverse risks and impacts are expected: (i) bacteriological and 

physio-chemical pollution due to the increased use of agricultural inputs (chemical fertilisers 

and pesticides), coupled with the misuse of phyto-sanitary products; (ii) over-exploitation of 

wood for the construction of dead hedges around plots following their development for 

irrigation purposes; and (iii) outbreaks of waterborne diseases and cases of poisoning, etc. To 

address these risks and adverse impacts, environmental safeguard instruments that have been 

developed: (i) specify the procedure for ensuring the environmental and social management of 

project activities, and (ii) outline the environmental surveillance and monitoring programme as 

well as the arrangements for implementing safeguard measures, including the preparation of 

ESIAs/ESMPs and the conduct of audits during project implementation. 

  



 

12 

 

3.2.2 Social: A Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) developed pursuant to Decree No. 

2019-027/PRN/MESU/DD of 11 January 2019 was reviewed and approved by the Bank and 

published on the same dates as the ESMF and PMP.3.2.6. In terms of benefits, the project will 

directly affect nearly 210,000 households, or approximately 1,470,000 people. However, the 

potential social risks and impacts, ranging from major and moderate, are: (i) encroachment on 

the landed property of certain households during the construction of water control infrastructure 

(dams), irrigation facilities, market infrastructure and rural roads, etc.; (ii) land conflicts due to 

irrigation facilities (irrigated areas, various reservoirs, etc.), which will lead to a rapid surge in 

the value of land; and (iii) conflicts between farmers and herdsmen. 

The budget for the implementation of safeguard instruments is estimated at CFAF 612,000,000. 

To that, should be added the sum of CFAF 100,000,000 for the compensation of project-

affected persons (PAPs) in anticipation of the construction of water harnessing infrastructure 

and irrigation development works.  

At the institutional level, the National Representation and Technical Assistance Unit 

(CENRAT), which serves as the Project Implementation Unit, has a social safeguard specialist, 

and the process to recruit an IFAD-financed environmental safeguard and climate change 

specialist is under way. As far as Regional Project Management Units (RPMUs) are concerned, 

the recruitment of four environmental and social safeguard experts is planned, two of whom 

will be financed by the AfDB and the other two by IFAD. 

3.2.3 Climate change and green growth: The project is classified in Category 2 according 

to the Bank's climate information system. The project is therefore vulnerable to the impacts of 

climate change as it is located in the Sahel, a region highly sensitive to climate change. Niger 

is a country that is extremely vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The ND-GAIN 

climate vulnerability index ranks Niger as the second most vulnerable country in the world to 

climate change after Somalia. Niger's climate has become increasingly arid, with a sharp decline 

in rainfall and an increase in temperatures in recent decades. A more intense variability of 

Niger's climate is projected by 2050, characterized by higher risks of aridity, according to the 

dry scenario (a sharp drop in rainfall and rising temperatures), or by excessive humidity, 

according to the wet scenario. With regard to climate risks, the models indicate a predominance 

of droughts, heat waves, an upsurge in extreme wet events and locust invasions. Project 

operations may therefore be severely affected by climate change. The main climate risks that 

may affect the project outcomes are droughts, floods, increasing temperatures and irregular 

rainfall. The project as a whole aims to reduce climate vulnerability and strengthen the 

resilience of small-scale farmers to water scarcity and droughts through the harnessing and 

control of water, the development of small irrigation areas with solar-powered dewatering 

systems, agricultural diversification, improving access to climate-resilient seeds for family 

farmers, supporting the production, dissemination and use of climate information and services, 

as well as promoting youth agricultural entrepreneurship and market access. The reclamation 

of degraded agricultural land, watershed management and erosion control will also help to 

foster the long-term resilience of farmers to flood risks and water scarcity and ensure the 

sustainability of food production systems in Niger. The project will also contribute to climate 

change forecasting by producing and disseminating meteorological information to 

prevent/anticipate climatic shocks.  

3.2.4 Gender: Niger ranks 157th out of 189 countries on the gender inequality index of the 

2016 Human Development Report. This poor ranking is due to the persistence of gender 

discrimination and inequality in Niger, which causes enormous economic and social losses for 

the country. The loss of income associated with gender inequality was estimated in 2015 by the 



 

13 

 

IMF at 32% of GDP. Female-headed households are more severely affected by food insecurity 

at 59.4%, compared with 38.2% of male-headed households.  

To address the shortcomings hindering gender equality, the initiatives undertaken during the 

implementation of the IFAD-funded PRoDAF programme will be continued and strengthened 

within the context of PRECIS. These include, in particular: (i) improving the resilience of the 

most vulnerable households through the establishment of women's granaries; (ii) improving 

food, nutrition and hygiene practices in households; (iii) supporting the development of income-

generating activities for women and young people in the agricultural, pastoral, poultry and craft 

sectors; (iv) ensuring information, education, communication and advocacy for a change in 

behaviour that should lead to equitable access to productive resources for women and young 

people; (v) building the entrepreneurial capacity of women and young people by means of 

functional literacy training, institutional and organisational development of women's groups, 

study tours and training in self-employment through women's centres; (vi) providing chores-

easing equipment (grinding mills, boreholes, processing units, improved stoves, etc.) for 

women in the villages covered by the project; (vii) recruiting local assistants to organise and 

rally women's and youth groups around the structures built; and (viii) developing a gender 

strategy specific to PRECIS, drawing on the experience gained from implementing ProDAF.  

The project has thus been classified in category 2 of the Bank's gender marker system. The 

budget allocated more specifically to gender promotion and women's economic empowerment 

activities is estimated at UA 6 million. 

IV.  IMPLEMENTATION  

4.1. Implementation Arrangements  

4.1.1 Implementation modalities: PRECIS will be under the technical supervision of the 

Ministry in charge of Agriculture. It will be coordinated by the National Representation and 

Technical Assistance Unit (CENRAT), whose fiduciary and technical capacities were assessed 

and deemed acceptable by the Bank. Two orders, respectively designating CENRAT as the 

management and coordination unit for TSF financing and the Senior National Technical 

Assistant in charge of Policy Dialogue as Project Coordinator, will be signed by the Minister 

of Agriculture and Livestock. The signing of these two orders will constitute a condition 

precedent to project implementation. The current Steering Committee of ProDAF will also 

serve as the Steering Committee of PRECIS. Establishment Order No. xxxxx will be revised to 

accommodate the actors that are not yet included, in order to ensure the consistency of the 

operations and facilitate work coordination. This committee shall meet twice a year, and as 

many times as necessary, to review project outcomes, validate financial statements, discuss 

programmes and approve related budgets. To ensure implementation of the project, the current 

ProDAF mechanism, operating in the regions of Maradi, Tahoua and Zinder, will be used after 

adjustment to the specific context of PRECIS (for more details, see the current ProDAF 

mechanism in Annex C1). The project’s management will thus benefit from the various existing 

mechanisms relating to coordination, financial management, procurement, monitoring and 

evaluation, communication, etc. (for more details, see the current ProDAF mechanism in Annex 

C1). An assessment of the various existing mechanisms indicates that it should be relatively 

easy to adapt the current systems to the addition of a new source of financing and also to the 

requirements of the Bank, especially its rules and procedures.  

  



 

14 

 

To support the implementation of AfDB financing, additional staff will be recruited, funded 

with TSF resources. The additional staff should include: (i) one (1) resource management (RM) 

expert embedded in CENRAT to coordinate the "water harnessing" component; he/she will also 

specifically ensure the monitoring of all AfDB financing activities, focused on structuring 

works; (ii) two (2) environmental protection and social safeguard experts, who will be added to 

the two other IFAD-supported experts; (iii) one (1) procurement expert within CENRAT, in 

charge of the preparation and close monitoring of procurement files for Bank-financed 

operations; (iv) one (1) senior accountant specifically in charge of processing TSF financing 

accounts, under the responsibility of the CENRAT Administrative and Financial Manager 

(AFM); (v) two (2) "Youth Entrepreneurship" assistants who will be under the responsibility of 

the RPMU component manager and will maintain close working relations with the National 

Technical Assistant of CENRAT; three (3) accounting assistants under the responsibility of the 

AFMs of the Regional Project Management Units (RPMUs) in Maradi, Tahoua and Zinder; ten 

(10) local development assistants (LDAs), including six for the Agricultural Council and four 

for monitoring and evaluation. Of these 10 LDAs, 9 will be assigned to RPMUs and only 1 to 

CENRAT to strengthen the monitoring and evaluation team. These LDAs will be equipped with 

motorbikes and will be added to the water harnessing assistants already in place. They will be 

distributed in each region, according to the areas of concentration of the work in progress. 

Special attention will be paid to gender parity in the staff recruitment, given that mixed teams 

will be more efficient. 

4.1.2 Procurement: All goods, works and consulting services financed with Bank resources 

will be procured in accordance with the Procurement Policy for Bank Group-Financed 

Operations ("AfDB Financing Policy"), October 2015 edition, and in accordance with the 

provisions set out in the Financing Agreement. Pursuant to this policy, the country system was 

assessed in 2019 using the critical indicators assessment method defined by the Bank. Based 

on the findings of the assessment, the overall level of risk associated with the use of the country 

system for Bank-financed operations was deemed "Substantial" and certain procurements will 

be done following the country's procurement system ("National System") enshrined by law 

(Law No. 2011/037 of 28 October 2011 on the general principles, control and regulation of 

public procurement and public service delegations), decree (Decree No. 2016-641/PRN/PM of 

1 December 2016 establishing the Public Procurement Code and Public Service Delegations) 

and various implementing instruments, based on national standard bidding documents 

(NSBDs). 

Using the national system for part of the project will improve efficiency thanks to better 

ownership of the procurement system to be used by the executing agency. However, the Bank 

reserves the right to request the Borrower to revert to the use of the Bank's system if: (a) Niger's 

legal procurement framework happens to change to a system that is unsatisfactory to the Bank; 

(b) the executing agency fails to comply with the arrangements in force; or (c) the appropriate 

risk mitigation measures included in the risk assessment action plan that was made at the time 

of the project appraisal are not adhered to. The procurement risk mitigation action plan is 

annexed to Volume 2. 

4.1.3 Financial Management: The National Representation and Technical Assistance Unit 

(CENRAT), based in Niamey and placed under the supervision of the Ministry of Agriculture 

and Livestock, will be responsible for the administrative, financial and accounting management 

of the project. The activities will be carried out by three Regional Project Management Units 

(RPMUs) based in Maradi, Tahoua, Zinder.  

  



 

15 

 

CENRAT and the RPMUs have financial management staff with extensive experience in the 

accounting and financial management of development projects, and who are also familiar with 

most of the tools required for proper recording of financial operations, and for monitoring the 

financial execution of activities and accountability. Regarding the needs of PRECIS, the 

financial management staff in place will be strengthened through the recruitment of a senior 

accountant for CENRAT and an accounting assistant for each RPMU. The staff will also be 

trained in the Bank's financial management and disbursement rules and procedures at the launch 

of the project and in the use of the software.  

 

The budgetary management of PRECIS will be based on the existing mechanism in CENRAT 

and the RPMUs. The Project will continue to produce an annual work plan and budget (AWPB) 

that will incorporate the resources of the Bank as well as those of the national counterpart. It 

will be validated by the Steering Committee and submitted to the Bank for its no-objection 

before 31 December of the current year. The TOM2PRO software will be reconfigured to 

support PRECIS by allowing the Budget execution and the production of quarterly financial 

monitoring reports based on the implementation of the work plan and the annual budget, 

annexed to the quarterly progress reports transmitted to the Bank within 45 days following the 

end of each quarter.  

 

The accounting system will be private in nature and will be in conformity with the standards of 

the revised SYSCOHADA and based on the TOM2PRO software. It will make it possible to 

perform the three types of accounting (general, budgetary and analytical) and to produce annual 

financial statements which will be audited. 

 

Internal oversight is based on the existing procedures manual, but the manual will be revised 

and submitted to the Bank for its no-objection. The internal audit will be conducted by the 

internal auditor who will be recruited with IFAD funding. The General Finance Inspectorate 

(IGF) could provide support to the internal auditor, covering part of the project's internal audit 

activities. The administrative, accounting and financial procedures manual will be subject to 

the Bank's no-objection. 

 

Financial reporting will be based on consolidated quarterly financial monitoring reports which 

will be transmitted to the Bank no later than forty-five (45) days after the end of the quarter. 

The assessment of CENRAT's capacities is provided in detail in the technical annexes, as well 

as the financial management risk, which was assessed to be substantial. 

4.1.4 Disbursements: Three (3) payment methods will be used for the financial 

implementation of the project namely: (i) reimbursement, (ii) the special account, and (iii) direct 

payment. The special account method will be used to finance minor operating expenses, short 

training courses and miscellaneous expenses. A special account will be opened for this purpose 

with a commercial bank acceptable to the Bank. The opening of this account will be a condition 

precedent to first disbursement. This special account will be used to receive an initial advance, 

whose amount will be determined on the basis of the provisional operating budget for six 

months of project activity. The special account will be replenished on the same basis, after the 

borrower has justified at least 50% of the amount of the previous advance. The direct payment 

method will be used for disbursement for contracts relating to the goods, services and works 

categories. Training in the Bank's disbursement rules and procedures will be provided at the 

launch of the project.

4.1.5 Audits: In accordance with the general conditions applicable to the financing 

agreements of the African Development Fund, the country will be required account for the use 

of the resources allocated to it. An independent and competent external audit firm will therefore 

verify once a year the accuracy of the annual consolidated financial statements prepared by the 

project management team and assess the functioning of the internal oversight system of the 

entire project. It will be recruited by CENRAT on the basis of terms of reference previously 

agreed on with the Bank and in accordance with Bank rules and procedures. The audit contract 

will be for a maximum duration of three fiscal years, and the auditor will be required to submit 

his/her report no later than six (6) months after the end of the fiscal year to which the audit 

relates. The audit fees will not be paid in full unless the report is approved by the Bank. The 

auditor shall not be allowed to render services in respect of a year unless the services of the 

previous year were satisfactorily performed. 

 

The country will also be required to carry out an environmental and social performance audit 

on a yearly basis. To that end, an independent consultant will to be recruited to carry out that 

environmental and social audit. 

4.2. Monitoring  

4.2.1 Monitoring mechanisms: The monitoring and evaluation mechanism of 

PRECIS/AfDB will be part of the overall framework of the PRECIS mechanism, itself backed 

up by that of ProDAF, which is already in place. A baseline situation will be established at the 

start of the project to set the quantitative and qualitative values of the indicators selected for the 

logical framework. The M&E system is based on a continuous internal monitoring of selected 

activities with emphasis on the effects and changes brought about by the project's achievements. 

This system will be participatory and will involve the beneficiaries and actors of the project in 

the collection of data and information feedback from the field (difficulties encountered, possible 

risks and delays, etc.). Thematic surveys and external evaluations will be conducted in order to 

better assess issues relating to food security, nutrition, job creation, gender mainstreaming and 

aspects associated with resilience. External monitoring tasks, involving relevant line ministries, 

will also be regularly organised by the Government, in addition to the two annual supervision 

missions organised by the Bank and the close monitoring carried out by the Bank’s Country 

Office in Niger (CONE). Several participatory workshops will also be organised to enable local 

actors to evaluate by themselves the operations implemented. A mid-term review and a final 

evaluation are planned, involving the Bank and the Government, in order to allow for possible 

readjustments and capitalisation of achievements, respectively, accompanied by an evaluation 

of the Bank's contribution to outcomes on the ground. The monitoring and evaluation 

framework will systematically include gender-disaggregated data to ensure greater readability 

of the outcomes on women and vulnerable groups. A baseline study will be carried out at the 

start of PRECIS to establish the values of quantitative and qualitative indicators by region. The 

system in place currently has a consolidator at the central level (CENRAT), and M&E officers 

at regional level supported by assistants. The mechanism is supported by a computerised system 

that provides on-line information at regional level and geo-localises all operations. It is possible 

to filter requests by funding source.

4.3. Governance 

The project falls within the framework of the Economic and Social Development Plan (PDES, 

2017-2021) which is founded on the strategy to ensure sustainable development and inclusive 

growth by 2035. Under this strategy, the country continues to work towards the consolidation 

of democratic institutions and the promotion of good governance. Niger has made significant 

strides in improving the overall governance framework in recent years and has finalized the 

establishment of all the institutions of the Republic, in accordance with the Constitution of 25 

November 2010. Niger is also in the process of implementing the National Justice and Human 

Rights Policy adopted in 2016, which led to the adoption in October 2017 of a bill on the 

organisation and jurisdiction of courts, aimed at improving public access to fair justice. With 

regard to combating corruption, the powers of the Supreme Authority to Combat Corruption 

and Related Offences (HALCIA) were strengthened in 2016 by law. According to Transparency 

International, Niger ranks 112th out of 180 countries. Niger has also been working on improving 

public finance governance for at least a decade. Accordingly, it adopted implementing 

instruments for the six WAEMU directives on public finance management; adopted a new 

customs code in line with community directives; delegated financial controls to the country's 

regional capitals; conducted the 2013 and 2014 public procurement audits; drafted and adopted 

a new public procurement code (in 2016); prepared implementing instruments and new BDs; 

and adopted and implemented a comprehensive public procurement capacity-building plan. 

Thus, the national procurement system is deemed to be largely compliant with international 

standards, even if certain provisions need to be strengthened, notably in order to (i) cap the 

proportion of direct agreement contracts at 15%; (ii) build the professional capacity of the actors 

involved in the procurement and contract execution process; and (iii) institute a policy to 

promote and strengthen the participation of national companies in competitive bidding. 

4.4. Sustainability  

4.4.1 Sustainability is a central concern for PRECIS. This is evident in the choice of 

transformative investments in socio-economic areas (Development Pole) that promote the 

transformation of production systems and the forging of strong links between various segments 

of the value chains of the main agro-pastoral sub-sectors. These transformative investments, 



 

18 

 

whose quality will be subject to ongoing control (works control and supervision and 

procurement audits), will be supplemented by technical and organisational capacity-building 

for beneficiaries. The emphasis placed on promoting youth entrepreneurship and women's 

empowerment will also be continued and scaled up beyond the project's financing period. 

4.4.2 The institutional structure of the project, the approach of outsourcing tasks to 

established institutions and the involvement of beneficiaries right from the planning to the 

operation stages (in the case of infrastructure) will guarantee the sustainability of PRECIS 

achievements after the project ends. Indeed, the PRECIS project is modelled on ProDAF, and 

stands to benefit from ProDAF staff who are already experienced in most of the implementation 

strategies, and also from ProDAF methods, tools and lessons, as well as from the availability 

of FDS on water harnessing structures; this will help to avoid the delays often experienced 

project commencement. Furthermore, this will help to ensure the rapid and timely deployment 

of all operations, thereby allowing sufficient time to support producers and to monitor the 

capitalisation and the strengthening of gains by the beneficiaries. Following the example of 

ProDAF and PMERSA, PRECIS will help to build the capacities of established entities with 

which it will collaborate during implementation (STC, STD, NGOs, RECA, CRA, POs, etc.). 

This will help to strengthen them and to provide them with the resources required to continue 

monitoring the activities entrusted to them after the end of the partnerships.  

4.4.3 Regarding the implementation strategy, the civil and social engineering duo will 

promote greater ownership by the beneficiaries and their empowerment. Thus, many of the 

project activities will contribute to its sustainability, especially in terms of securing land tenure, 

supporting the organisation of beneficiaries and introducing management tools to ensure better 

maintenance and coverage of recurrent infrastructure costs (water harnessing works, irrigation 

development works, markets, shops, farm-to-market roads, etc.), and strengthening of the 

organisation of producers. In addition, the activities included in the components relating to the 

promotion of rural entrepreneurship, processing and market access, will generate value-added 

and create wealth, thereby contributing to ownership of the project's achievements by the direct 

beneficiaries. With regard to the entrepreneurship component, the exit strategy will be based on 

the establishment of business development service (SDE) providers and building their capacity 

so that they can set up their own businesses. 

4.5. Risk Management  

The potential risks identified in PRECIS implementation and their mitigation measures are 

summarised in the table below: 

 

Risks Mitigation Measures 

Worsening of security conditions, 

particularly in localities of the 

northern part of Tahoua 

-Targeting of areas currently without security problems; 

-Political commitment of the authorities and support from regional 

actors and the international community; 

-An outsourcing approach that is reliant on local economic and civil 

society actors; and 

-Integration of pastoral water projects in the North. 

The sometimes protracted delays in 

procurement procedures, which 
undermine the capacity to absorb 

available funding; 

-Anticipation of procurement operations thanks to the existing 

agencies and the availability of BDs; 

-Decentralisation of part of the procurement process to the regions; 

and 

 



 

19 

 

-Recruitment of a procurement assistant to follow up the files at the 

Ministry. 

Unfavourable environmental and 

climatic conditions in the Sahel 

region, which could lead to 

decapitalisation of the most 

vulnerable groups during severe 

crises 

- Development and implementation of environmental and social 

safeguard instruments (ESMF, RPF, PPMP, ESIA/ESMP, RAP); 

-Planned water harnessing activities; and  

-Specific attention to vulnerable groups. 

Socio-cultural barriers that do not 

always favour the access of women 
and young people to factors of 

production 

-A proactive approach of the project and specific activities carried 

out in favour of women and young people; and 

-Addressing land tenure issues through an agreement with the Rural 

Code Secretariat and support for grassroots land commissions 

(COFOB and COFOCOM). 

Difficulties relating to ownership and 

management of the new areas by the 

communities 

- Training and structuring activities; 

- Organisation of exchange visits; and 

- Ongoing support of beneficiaries. 

Lack of interest among young people  

(18-24 years of age) 

- Conduct of communication, information and awareness-raising 

activities for young people; and 

- Continuous mentoring and support for young people and the most 

vulnerable groups. 

4.6. Knowledge-Building  

PRECIS activities that will lead to better knowledge management and development may be 

summarised as follows: (i) strengthening of local expertise in terms of resilience and the 

capacity of local communities to adapt to the recurrent effects of climate change, through 

irrigation development and better control and management of water resources; (ii) 

dissemination of new production and processing technologies: development of expertise in 

localised irrigation techniques at the individual level, promotion of appropriate crop sequencing 

techniques for the Sahel region, dissemination/extension of assisted natural regeneration 

(ANR), promotion of improved stoves made from local materials, etc.; (iii) setting up of 

demonstration units and dissemination of best practices: farmer field schools (FFS) and small 

livestock innovation demonstration units (DIPE) which will help to disseminate knowledge and 

improve productivity and yields, integrated soil fertility management (ISFM), sustainable land 

and water management (SLWM), and integrated predator and pest management (IPPM) which 

will enable the protection and preservation of resources and help to mitigate the vulnerability 

of soil resources; (iv) organisation of production and processing technology review workshops 

and exchange visits, as tools for interaction between researchers, support and extension agents 

and producers with a view to adapting technologies to the local context; (v) awareness-raising 

and dissemination of information, through various communication channels (community radio, 

media programmes, website, films, etc.), aimed at promoting the use of these technologies in 

water resource management; (vi) strengthening of women's leadership and economic 

empowerment, supported by a commitment to policy dialogue with the ministries concerned, 

with a view to greater implementation of policies that promote gender equality; and (vii) 

promotion of innovative activities to improve the employability of young people and women, 

and the development of rural micro and small enterprises, through targeted support and 

customized assistance.

Project Summary 
 

Project Overview:  
The Agricultural Markets, Value Addition and Trade Development Project (AMVAT) uses an 

agricultural value chain approach with emphasis on the development of producer associations. 

The development goal of AMVAT is to contribute to reduced food insecurity, poverty 

reduction and building of community and household resilience. Specific objectives include: (i) 

increased agricultural productivity, (ii) increased agro-processing, aggregation and marketing 

of agricultural produce, and (iii) trade and export of agricultural products and merchandise. 

This will be achieved through four components: (i) increase agricultural productivity and 

production; (ii) improve market-place economic and social infrastructure; (iii) enhance market 

and trade enabling environment; and (iv) project management and coordination. The project 

will be implemented over a five-year period (2020-2024). The total project cost is UA 10.79 

million from an African Development Fund (ADF-15) grant of UA 5.53 million performance-

based country allocation, Transition Support Facility Pillar I (TSF-I) grant of UA 4.47 million, 

a Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) grant of UA 0.20 million and UA 0.59 million as 

counterpart contribution (in-kind land for the market in Juba) from the Government of South 

Sudan. Due to capacity limitations in the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security, the Food 

and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations will implement the project on behalf 

of the Government.   

 

Beneficiaries: The Project will support 20,000 farming households (about 120,000 individuals) 

to increase agricultural productivity and incomes, in the three states of Central Equatoria, 

Eastern Equatoria and Jonglei. The project will target households that have been receiving food 

aid over the past several years (many of them IDP returnees) but are now ready to graduate into 

agricultural market development activities to produce agricultural commodities for food and 

marketing for increased incomes. About fifty percent of these households are women headed 

households. The project will establish 20 Aggregation Business Centres (ABCs), 100 Business 

Producer Associations (BPAs) and 10 Seed Enterprise Groups (SEGs) to provide improved 
seeds to the BPAs and outside markets. Women and youth will be targeted to participate in the 

management and activities of the ABCs, BPAs and SEGs and will also be beneficiaries in the agro-

processing activities at the urban market. The project will also provide food safety training for 

laboratory technicians and other stakeholders in the food chain market system which will provide safer 

and more healthy food for over 500,000 people.  

 

Needs Assessment: South Sudan has a largely unrealised agricultural potential. Over 95% of 

the total area (658,842 km2) is considered suitable for agriculture, 50% of which is prime 

agricultural land where soil and climatic conditions are conducive for production of a variety 

of crops and livestock. However, the periodic armed conflicts in South Sudan have had serious 
negative effects on food production and security and this has resulted in a huge food import bill (43% 

of total imports in 2017), despite the country being well-endowed with natural resources that are good 

for agriculture to thrive. According to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification issued in June 

2019, 6.35 million people (over 50% of the population) were facing crisis (IPC Phase 3 and above) 

of food insecurity. Despite the extensive agricultural potential, agricultural and food products 

rarely find their way into markets and thus are not traded on a significant scale as such, they 

have not been able to generate the much-needed foreign exchange for the country. In addition, 
South Sudan has high levels of malnutrition: 33 percent of boys and 29 percent of girls are stunted. The 

Government’s agenda for economic diversification is anchored on the agriculture sector, which is vital 

for economic activities. The agriculture sector contributes about ten percent (10%) of GDP but employs 

seventy-eight percent (78%) of the population – there is therefore considerable room for improvement 

of the sector. The AMVAT project will provide much needed skills and inputs for farmers to increase 

productivity, aggregation capacity and post-harvest agro-processing equipment to improve value 

addition. It will also provide capacity building to improve the marketing and trade environment for 

agricultural products to increase incomes and create jobs. 

 

 

 



 

 vi 

Bank’s Value Added: The Bank has considerable experience and expertise across the 

continent working with partners to increase agricultural productivity, add value and develop 

markets. This is demonstrated by the Bank’s Technologies for African Agricultural 

Transformation (TAAT) flagship whose objectives are to expand access of smallholder 

farmers, majority being women, to high yielding agricultural technologies to improve their 

food production, assure food security, raise rural incomes and scaling up agricultural 

technologies across similar agro-ecological zones. The Bank has also successfully 

implemented the Markets and Agricultural Trade Improvement Project (MATIP) in Uganda 

which established over 20 markets across the country and increase trade in agricultural products 

significantly. A second phase of the MATIP is currently being implemented. In South Sudan, 

the Bank has implemented the Short-Term Regional Emergency Response Project (STRERP - 

UA 31.5 million) under the Bank’s Say No to Famine Framework, with highly favourable 

outcomes. In addition, the Bank has supported the water and sanitation sector, power 

transmission and distribution systems, good governance and non-oil revenue mobilization and 

accountability projects in South Sudan. Implementation of projects in the country portfolio 

continued even during the period of conflict and the COVID-19 pandemic and this effort has 

been instrumental in helping to improve the lives of the people of South Sudan. 

 

Knowledge Management: The ability for farmers to enhance productivity and trade depends 

highly on access to suitable technologies, markets and other allied services whereby famers’ 

linkage with other actors in the value chains remains essential and requires support. The Project 

will therefore generate critical knowledge for supporting farmers to move from subsistence to 

commercial agriculture in the selected states, which will build up lessons for the design and 

management of similar interventions, to be scaled in other states, as well as in other Regional 

Member Countries (RMCs). A series of training and coaching activities for different categories 

of farmers and traders has been embedded in the project and a number of agricultural 

commodity studies planned. In line with the Bank’s Knowledge Management Strategy (2015-

2020), the knowledge obtained will be captured through regular supervision, progress reporting 

and mid-term review, and as part of project completion report (PCR) preparation process, 

documented and shared within the Bank and with other development partners (DPs) and RMCs. 

Given that the project covers four selected crops in three different states, with varying 

opportunities and challenges, there is potential to generate useful lessons.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE MANAGEMENT OF THE AFDB GROUP TO THE BOARD OF 

DIRECTORS ON THE PROPOSED ADF-15 AND TSF PILLAR-I GRANTS TO THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH 

SUDAN FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AGRICULTURAL MARKETS, VALUE 

ADDITION, AND TRADE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (AMVAT). 

 

Management hereby submits the following report and its recommendation concerning a proposed 

African Development Fund (ADF-15) grant of UA 5.53 million (USD 7.80 million) performance-based 

country allocation and  Transition Support Facility Pillar I (TSF-I)  grant of UA 4.47 million (USD 6.30 

million)  to the Republic of South Sudan to finance activities to support the Agricultural Markets, Value 

Addition and Trade Development Project (AMVAT) in South Sudan. 

 

I – STRATEGIC THRUST & RATIONALE 

1.1. Project linkages with country strategy and objectives  

 

1.1.1 AMVAT is fully aligned with and supported by South Sudan’s National Development Strategy 

(NDS) (2018-2021) whose overarching objective is to Consolidate Peace and Stabilize the Economy and 

in particular, its strategic priority no. 3 Ensuring Secure Access to Adequate and Nutritious Food. The 

NDS is divided into Clusters and the priority actions of the Economic Cluster includes to expedite 

economic infrastructure development (including agricultural infrastructure) and to fast-track 

development of legal, regulatory and institutional frameworks – activities that are integrated in the 

AMVAT components. Furthermore, AMVAT will provide gender-sensitive capacity development to the 

Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security, Ministry of Trade and Industry and other stakeholders, 

including the development of multi-stakeholder platforms for cereals and oil seeds. AMVAT is also 

aligned to the Government of South Sudan’s climate change adaptation plans for the agriculture sector 

as outlined in the country’s Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) and National Adaptation 

Programme of Action (NAPA), which include promoting climate smart agricultural (CSA) technologies 

and enhancing agricultural productivity through development of infrastructure and improved crop and 

livestock varieties. 

 

1.1.2 Moreover, AMVAT is aligned to the Bank’s South Sudan Interim Country Strategy Paper (I-

CSP) 2012-2018) extended to December 2021 by supporting the single pillar of State Building through 

Capacity Building and Infrastructure Development and specifically by developing market and 

aggregation infrastructure. The project is included in the I-CSP pipeline. The Project is aligned with the 

Bank’s Ten-Year Strategy on aspects of infrastructure development, skills and technology, agriculture 

and food security and gender. It is also aligned to the Bank’s Feed Africa Strategy, in particular the 

flagships of Technologies for African Agricultural Transformation (TAAT) whose objective is to 

increase agricultural productivity and value addition as well as the Special Agro-industrial Processing 

Zones (SAPZ) whose objective is to increase investment for enabling rural infrastructure for agro-

processing and value addition. It is also aligned to the High 5 on Improving the Quality of Life for the 

People of African by improving the health and nutrition of the communities through increased 

productivity of nutritious food crops. Furthermore, the project is aligned to the Bank’s Jobs for Youth in 

Africa Strategy (2016-2025) and in particular the Enable Youth flagship that emphasizes inclusive 

employment for youth in agribusiness. Furthermore, the project is aligned to the Bank’s Strategy for 

Addressing Fragility and Building Resilience in Africa (2014-2019).

1.2. Rationale for Bank’s involvement 
  

1.2.1. South Sudan’s vast agricultural potential is largely unrealised. Over 95% of the total area 
(658,842 km2) is considered suitable for agriculture, 50% of which is prime agricultural land 

where soil and climatic conditions are conducive for production of a variety of crops and 

livestock. A large part of the country, particularly the southern part, has high rainfall for 8-9 

months a year, ranging from 500-600 mm/year to more than 1,500 mm/year. However, the 

periodic armed conflicts in South Sudan have had a serious negative effect on food production 

and security and this has resulted in a huge food import bill (43% of total imports in 2017), 

despite being well well-endowed with natural resources that are good for agriculture to prosper. 

According to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification issued in June 2019, 6.35 million 

people (just over 50% of the population) were facing a food insecurity crisis (IPC Phase 3 and 

above). Despite the huge agricultural potential, agricultural and food products rarely find their 

way into markets and thus are not traded on a significant scale and have not been able to generate 

much needed foreign exchange for the country. In addition, South Sudan has high levels of 

malnutrition: 33 percent of boys and 29 percent of girls are stunted. Similarly, 30 percent of boys 

and 24.5 percent of girls are underweight. The Government’s agenda for diversification of South 

Sudan’s economy is anchored on the agriculture sector, which plays a vital role in economic 

activities. The agriculture sector contributes about ten percent (10%) of GDP but employs 

seventy-eight percent (78%) of the population. Most agricultural products that are exported are 

in the form of primary products and are later imported as value-added products. This situation 

leads to losses in foreign currency, employment opportunities and opportunities for customized 

value-added products. 

 

1.2.2. Both agricultural input and product markets in South Sudan are not well developed. No effective 
investment can be made in scaling up production without first strengthening markets. The present 

system of fresh supplies to retail markets in urban areas is dominated by imports – in the case of 

Juba by supplies from Uganda. Three types of food markets currently exist in South Sudan: rural 

primary markets located in villages and small towns and often held on a periodic basis; rural 

assembly markets located in agricultural surplus areas; and urban retail markets serving 

consumers in main towns and cities. Terminal wholesale markets within or near major cities have 

yet to evolve. As a result of the underdeveloped marketing arrangements, post-harvest losses at 

the farm level and within markets are very high, as are food prices.  

 

1.2.3 The AMVAT activities are informed by several studies that support the development of 
agricultural economic infrastructure and trade development. The 2020 report “Conflict, Mobility 

and Markets - Changing food systems in South Sudan” notes that the post-independence conflict 

has made South Sudan’s markets volatile. This has increased risks and liabilities for bigger 

traders, but also offers opportunities for smaller ones.  

 

1.2.4 The World Bank’s 2019 diagnostic study “South Sudan: Linking the Agriculture and Food Sector 
to the Job Creation Agenda” is emphatic that with the implementation of the peace deal, South 

Sudan could start a trajectory of recovery and growth, which ushers in an opportunity for 

investments in the food sector by applying a value chain lens that does only address food security 

needs, but also, generates income and lays the foundation for livelihoods and job creation. 

Among other important enablers to begin to facilitate agribusiness transformation, the flagship 

study refers to rural assembly markets located in agricultural surplus areas, as well as urban retail 

markets serving consumers in main town and cities as being vital for beginning to strengthen the 

distribution and marketing channels.

1.2.5 A 2019 study “Moving towards markets: cash, commodificaton and conflict in South Sudan” 
notes that while food insecurity is linked to South Sudan’s conflicts, a less visible factor is the 

move towards markets. Producing food for markets rather than for home consumption, turning 

food into a commodity and turning farmers into wage workers – all these shifts appear to be 

implicated in the country’s hunger crisis. On a positive note the report claims that South Sudanese 

food producers and consumers are moving towards markets. 

  

1.2.6 UNDP’s 2012 study “Investing in Agriculture for Food Security and Economic Transformation” 
cautioned that short, medium and long term actions focusing on rural sector activities including 

ensuring adequate supplies from agriculture and efficient functioning markets, storage and 

transportation are important to stabilize and improve the food security situation in South Sudan. 

 

1.2.7 Other studies that form an anchor for this project vis a vis developing agricultural market 
infrastructure include the Bank’s South Sudan: An Infrastructure Action Plan (2011); the 

Government’s Comprehensive Agricultural Development Master Plan (CAMP, 2015-2020); and 

the Bank’s South Sudan: A Study on Competitiveness and Cross Border Trade with 

Neighbouring Countries (2013). 

 

1.2.8 Why the Bank should Intervene:  Imported agricultural commodities play a dominant role in 
many large marketplaces in South Sudan. However, there remains high potential for domestic 

agricultural commodities to take a larger share of the overall market, and as domestic production 

remains an important component given the rapid expansion of the urban population which has 

created large consumer markets. Agricultural commodity markets are critical drivers to 

agricultural development and the achievement of food security in the country, especially if 

complemented by actions that reduce macroeconomic distortions, lower high market transaction 

costs and increase value addition through an agricultural value chain approach. Markets open 

opportunities for increased intra-urban and cross-border trade between rural and urban areas, 

while serving as wholesale centres and hubs for commodities trade, especially for agricultural 

commodities. This improves the supply and availability of basic goods, improved agricultural 

inputs, as well as contributes to stabilizing commodity prices, thus positively impacting 

households’ ability to access basic food and non-food items to support their livelihoods. 

Operationalizing the markets and aggregation centres will thus benefit smallholder farmers by 

making improved agricultural inputs available to vulnerable households, improving price 

margins, and eventually increasing rural incomes. The Juba market will also improve the 

hygienic environment, help reduce post-harvest losses and install facilities to meet demand, for 

example cold storage units for fish storage. Furthermore, an improved information management 

system for market intelligence and data collection and distribution will help farmers access the 

most updated information on commodity prices and help decision makers widen the evidence 

base and develop a deeper understanding of the complex market dynamics in South Sudan. 

Markets also are key sites of public spaces for social interaction, connection, social inclusion, the 

mingling of different cultures and the building of a sense of local community and social cohesion, 

which are key for sustainable peacebuilding and post conflict reconstruction efforts. 

 

1.2.9 The AMVAT project provides the opportunity to address some of the fundamental constraints to 
agricultural growth in South Sudan, listed above. As such, it has the potential to be truly 

transformational in its scope. The rationale for bank involvement in the proposed project is 

underpinned by: (a) the Bank’s own strong experience and expertise in increased agricultural 



 

4 

 

productivity; (b) a strong commitment and ownership of the South Sudan authorities of the 

project; and (c) the specific request for this project from the Government for Bank support. 

 

 

 

1.3. Donor coordination 

1.3.1 Development partners working in the agriculture sector are guided by the Comprehensive 

Agricultural Development Master Plan (CAMP) 2015-20 and work within the Agriculture and 

Livelihoods Development Working Group (ALDWG) of which the Bank is a member, as well as the 

Partnership for Recovery and Resilience (PfRR) Framework. Apart from the Bank, the other key 

development partners (DPs) active in the sector include DFID, FAO, WFP, EU, Netherlands, Canada, 

JICA, BMZ, SDC, USAID and the World Bank. The DP’s agriculture sector interventions focus on the 

following broad areas: (i) Improved management and equitable access to water sources for livelihood 

activities; (ii) Food production and improved income generation for women and youth; (iii) Livelihood 

diversification (e.g., animal production groups, cereal marketing groups); (iv) Construction of feeder 

roads; and (v) Peace building and conflict resolution. In addition, the Bank is also a member of the donor 

Public Finance Management (PFM) group.  the Heads of Development Cooperation (HoC) group and 

the United Nations Country Team (UNCT).   

1.3.2 During project design, the Bank held discussions with various development partners in the 

agriculture sector on possible collaboration. The HoC was also informed of the AMVAT. The Bank 

agreed to collaborate with JICA on joint support for capacity development to the Ministry of Agriculture 

and Food Security. In addition, the Bank held discussions with IFAD, to collaborate with its project, the 

South Sudan Livelihoods and Resilience Project (SSLRP), which is being prepared. The two institutions 

agreed to implement activities in common states and counties and to design activities that are 

complementary – effectively resulting in parallel co-financing in an amount of approximately USD 3 

million. This demonstrates the strengthening of synergies, bolstering aid coordination and deepening 

value added for the Bank and IFAD. Several development partners are also providing infrastructure such 

as rural roads (the Netherlands) which will complement the proposed market infrastructure of AMVAT 

by making needed farm gate linkages.

II – PROJECT DESCRIPTION  

2.1. Project Goal 

 
2.1.1 The development goal of AMVAT is to contribute to reduced food insecurity, poverty reduction 

and building of community and household resilience. Specific objectives include to: (i) increase 



 

5 

 

agricultural productivity, (ii) increase agro-processing, aggregation and marketing of agricultural 

produce, and (iii) increase trade in agricultural products.  

 

 

 

 

Project Description 
 

2.1.2 AMVAT takes an Agricultural Value Chain Approach including supporting the development of 

producer associations. The project will support and complement the entire value chain by supporting 

farmer households engaged in the identified value chains of maize, sorghum, groundnuts and sesame. 

The Aggregation Business Centres will serve as growth hubs in the local areas and will include post-

harvest agro-processing facilities to support and provide value addition to agricultural produce and 

provide extension services to the surrounding areas. These activities will widen the livelihood options 

and income sources of farmers as well as increasing their resilience to climate change impacts through 

improved varieties and reduced post-harvest losses. Vendors and farmers will be organized into producer 

and trader associations to enhance protection and leverage collective bargaining positions and lower 

purchasing and marketing costs through service sharing. Considering the COVID threat, safety measures 

for social distancing will be incorporated within the project to ensure safety during project 

implementation.

Table 2.2: Project Alternatives Considered and Reasons for Rejection 

Alternative  Brief description Reasons for rejection 

Establishment of a 

seed certification 

body 

 Setting up minimum 

standards for genetic purity 

and recommend minimum 

standards for the classes of 

certified seed, and standardize 

seed certification regulations 

and procedures 

The Government of South Sudan is not currently ready to set 

up the body. Instead of setting up a certification body, the 

project is proposing: i) to develop a seed policy framework 

which will guide the overall seed system in the country until 

the seed policy is adopted, and ii) strengthening the existing 

seed system by expanding the number of seed producers and 

enhance capacities of both seed producers and inspectors.  

 Support research 
institutions to 

release new 

varieties including 

hybrids and 

biofortified seeds 

To ensure that new resistant 

and high yield varieties are 

released to farmers to increase 

their productivity 

Due to project budget constraints and the cost of new variety 

release requirements, it was not possible to pursue this idea 

under the AMVAT. The project will therefore support the 

Seed Enterprise Groups to produce Quality Declared Seed 

(QDS), which is the quality of seed being produced and 

marketed by the seed companies in South Sudan. These are 

improved seeds but not up to the quality of foundation seed.   

Establish large 

rural market 

infrastructure  

Establishing large markets in 

the rural areas where 

production takes place.  

Due to poor road infrastructure one cannot establish large 

markets in the rural areas. The project will therefore support 

the establishment of aggregation centres in the rural areas and 

a modern market in Juba.  

 

2.3. Project type  
The Agricultural Markets, Value Addition and Trade Development Project (AMVAT) is supported under 

the ADF-15 and TSF Pillar-I of the Bank as a standalone investment project.

2.4. Project cost and financing arrangements  
2.4.1 The cost for the project activities, excluding taxes and duties, is estimated at UA 10.79 million 

including physical and price contingencies. The costs are composed of UA 4.78 million (44%) in foreign 

currency and UA 6.01 million (56%) in local currency costs. The combined physical and price 

contingencies have been estimated at 14% of the total baseline costs. The tables below provide the 

summary of the Project costs which are based on analysis of unit prices obtained from the ministries of 

Agriculture and Food Security, other ministries  and other local institutions and traders.

2.4.2  The project will be financed by an ADF-15 Grant of UA 5.53 million, TSF-I grant of UA 4.47 

million, FAO grant of UA 0.20 million and the Government will contribute UA 0.59 million (5.6% of 

project cost) as in-kind counterpart contribution for the land of the market in Juba. South Sudan’s 

economy is still confronted with a high fiscal deficit (6.4% of GDP in 2019), lack of competitiveness, 

limited foreign reserves and high public debt. These macroeconomic imbalances have been exacerbated 

by the Government’s shift from spending on social services to military expenditure as well as the adverse 

impact of COVID-19 pandemic. Due to high dependence on oil (accounts for 90% of total revenue and 

95% of export earnings), falling oil prices and reduced global demand have negatively impacted budget 

execution due to revenue loses. In this context, the Bank’s Country Financing Parametres recommends 

100% financing by the Bank Group, however the Government will contribute in-kind.

2.5. Project’s target area and population  
2.5.1 The Project will support 20,000 farming households (about 120,000 individuals) in the three 

states of Central Equatoria, Eastern Equatoria and Jonglei. The project will target households that have 

been receiving food aid over the past several years (many of them IDP returnees) but are now ready to 

graduate into agricultural development activities to produce crops for food and marketing for increased 

incomes. About fifty percent of these households are women headed households. The baseline study will 

identify the households that will be assisted to form the Business Producer Associations (BPAs) through 

which they will receive support. The project will establish 20 Aggregation Business Centres (ABCs) in 

the three states, 100 Business Producer Associations (BPAs) – each ABC will serve 5 BPAs, and 10 

Seed Enterprise Groups (SEGs) to provide improved seeds to the BPAs and external markets. If one 

considers the impact of the market in the Juba urban area, total population that will be impacted by this 

project will be about 500,000 people. The project will also provide food safety training for laboratory 

technicians and other stakeholders in the food chain market system which will provide safer and more 

healthy food for over 500,000 people. The hub of development will be the ABCs which will serve as 

growth hubs to serve the BPAs and SEGs. The project will identify existing aggregation centres and 

build on those rather than develop completely new ones – there are many aggregation centres already 

run by UN agencies such as FAO and WFP and some private ones. The project will enter into agreements 

with these aggregation centres for the provision of required services.      

 

2.5.2 The selection of the states was informed by the following criteria: (i) key states for food security 

crops and potential for commercial crops; (ii) key states for high value crops with prospects for value 

addition and external trade; (iii) states with policies and support for the proposed project interventions 

including private sector participation; (iv) high percentage of the population likely to directly benefit

from investment of the project; (v) states where potential development partners are currently located or 

planning to work on upcoming projects to provide complementarity to AMVAT project, e.g IFAD’s 

SSLRP project; (vi) development stage of the population in the state as well as peace and security.  The 

Project will focus on five counties in total so as not to be spread too thinly. In Central Equatoria State, 

the project will focus on Juba and Terekeka counties, in Eastern Equatoria State it will focus on Magwi 

and Torit counties and in Jonglei it will focus on Bor county. These counties were selected because they 

already have several existing aggregation centres and will also allow this project to synergize with the 

upcoming IFAD SSLRP project that will operate in these counties.  

 

2.6. Participatory process for project identification, design and implementation  
2.6.1 The project appraisal was conducted virtually, however the Bank managed to get a lot of the 

required information. The Bank undertook in-depth consultations with relevant government ministries, 

as well as development partners, Civil Society Organisations and farmer groups (e.g. Seed Trade 

Association of South Sudan, South Sudan Agricultural Producers’ Association, Chamber of Commerce, 

etc.) during project identification, preparation and appraisal. The consultations were held with key 

ministries, including Finance and Planning, Agriculture and Food Security, Trade and Industry, 

Livestock, Physical Infrastructure in order to identify and review priorities and areas where Bank 

resources would add value. In addition, consultative meetings were held with key stakeholders involved 

in the agricultural and rural development. These included JICA, USAID, the World Bank, FAO, the 

Netherlands, European Union, etc. The Bank made a presentation of the project to the Agriculture and 

Livelihoods Development Working Group (ALDWG) in the country. The Bank also held meetings with 

the South Sudan Agricultural Producers Union and the South Sudan Seed Trade Association among 

others. 

2.6.2 The consultations significantly informed the project design, especially the project components 

and implementation arrangements. For instance, consultations during project preparation indicated that 

it is still advisable to use a third-party implementation agency due to the low government capacity in the 

ministries to implements such projects. During implementation, there will be further engagement with 

key stakeholders in the agriculture sector through the multi-stakeholders’ project National Advisory 

Committee (NAC) and National Technical Committee (NTC) and the ALDWG. 

2.7. Bank Group experience, lessons reflected in project design 

Portfolio Performance and Lessons Learnt: As at 30th September 2020, the Bank’s active portfolio for 

South Sudan comprised eleven (11) sovereign operations, financed mainly using ADF grants and loans, 

with commitments amounting to UA 84.7 million. In terms of sectoral distribution, the power sector has 

the largest allocation (33%), followed by water supply and sanitation (27%), social sector (16%), multi-

sector/governance (15%), finance (6%) and health (3%). The operations are consistent with the sole 

Pillar of the National Development Plan, South Sudan’s CSP and the Bank’s strategic priorities, 

underpinned by the High 5’s vision for Africa’s economic transformation. The country’s portfolio 

performance is satisfactory, with an overall score of 3.8 on a scale of 1 to 4.  The total cumulative 

disbursement rate was 46.8% by 30th September 2020, while the average portfolio age stood at 3.4 years. 

However, critical issues of fragility, particularly insecurity and violence, still affect portfolio 

performance, as well as government’s low absorption capacity stemming from institutional and human 

capital weaknesses. The Bank has adopted the use of third-party implementation arrangements for all 

projects with high fiduciary risks, low capacity and implemented outside Juba. This is to mitigate the 

risks associated with weak institutional capacity (systems and human capital), insecurity outside Juba, 

limited knowledge of Bank rules, procedures and procurement regulations by the Project Implementation 

Unit officials, delays in the implementation of procurement plans and submission of audit reports. The 



 

11 

 

use of a third party such as the FAO mitigates all of these risks as the Bank has already assessed the 

organization and signed a Fiduciary Principles Agreement (FPA) with it to implement Bank projects.   
 

2.8. Key performance indicators 
 2.8.1 The results-based logical framework outlines key project performance indicators. The 

development outcomes envisaged under the project are: (i) the increased average yield (t/ha) and 

household income per ha for target crops,  (ii) 30% increase in farm produce marketed through formal 

markets,  (iv) increase in volume of food products tested and certified in laboratories in the project areas 

from 0.5 t/year to 100 t/year. All of these will lead to increased agricultural productivity and income of 

households. The main indicators defined for monitoring the project outputs are: (i) number of ToTs and 

farmers trained on selected topics; (ii) number of ABCs and SEGs established; (iii) number of youth and 

women in both ABC and SEG management; (iv) number of hectares planted with improve seeds; (v) 

number of modern markets constructed; (vi) annual value of commodities marketed through markets; 

(vii) number of CODEX trading standards and guidelines established and disseminated for cereals and 

oil seeds; (viii) number of new laboratories set up and operating, and (ix) number of technicians and staff 

trained on selected themes. The FAO team in collaboration with the ministry of agriculture will carry 

out internal project monitoring and evaluation in collaboration with the national technical committee to 

monitor the performance of the project. Regular implementation progress will be measured through 

Quarterly Progress Reports and annual technical and financial audits. Disaggregated data will be 

captured at every level and where applicable.  The overall effectiveness of the project at implementation 

will be monitored through the Bank’s bi-annual supervision missions (field and desk). The Mid-Term 

Review will be undertaken in year three, while the Project Completion Report will be prepared during 

the last six months of the project. 

 

III – PROJECT FEASIBILITY 

3.1. Economic and financial performance 

 

FIRR (base case) 21% 

EIRR (base case) 25% 

 

NPV, USD 13.60 million at 12% 

 

3.1.1 The project is financially and economically viable, as evidenced by the Project’s Financial 

Internal Rate of Return (FIRR) of 21% and Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) of 25%. At the 

enterprise level, a typical 1.5 Ha farm model shows that as a result of the project, annual net margin is 

expected to increase by 60%, from USD 422 per farm to USD 673 per farm at full development. This 

demonstrates that at the enterprise level, the project is financially feasible.  

 

3.1.2 The analysis has considered the following assumptions for the market: (i) project life period of 

25 years; (ii) infrastructure operating cost of 2% per year of capex during the project life and 7% capex 

infrastructure investment at year 10; and (iii) implementation schedule of investment built from the 

expenditure schedule of activities. The assumptions for crop production were an increase in productivity 

of the four selected crops ranging from 18% to 100%. The key costs that are considered for the analysis 

include the capital investment costs for the market infrastructure, incremental operational and 

maintenance costs and the increased input costs for the crops. 

 



 

12 

 

3.1.3 The initial focus crops include maize, sorghum, groundnuts and sesame due to the fact that: (i) 

these are food security crops with high nutritive value; (ii) have great commercial potential through agro-

processing and value addition into various products; (iii) they perform very well in these states; and (iv) 

the population in these states is already familiar with the crops. However, other crops and commodities 

will also be considered should they be requested by the communities.   
 

3.1.4 The benefits considered in the analysis are those derived from increased productivity of crops 

due to improved seeds, farmer training, use of modern technologies and the ability to aggregate, store 

and market crops. This increase in productivity and marketing of crops translates directly into increased 

incomes at the household level. The project includes other benefits which have not been factored in the 

EIRR analysis above such as increase in off-farm activities due to better training and enhanced nutrition. 

In addition, the project will include benefits such as innovation, safeguards, policy advice, knowledge 

work, capacity building for government, etc. If all of these benefits are incorporated in the analysis, the 

EIRR would be even higher.    

 

3.1.5  Sensitivity analysis was conducted on the EIRR for various scenarios and as presented in the 

table below, it demonstrates that the project is quite robust and would remain viable under a range of 

alternatives.  

 

Results of the Sensitivity Analysis on the EIRR 

Scenario EIRR NPV (USD million, 12%) 

20% decrease in income from crops 21% 8.44 million 

20% increase in investment costs  22% 11.21 million 

 

3.2. Environmental and Social Impacts 
3.2.1 Environmental and Social: Based on the proposed project scope and structure, the 

environmental and social (E&S) classification for this project is Category 2 in accordance with the 

African Development Bank’s Integrated Safeguards System/Environmental and Social Assessment 

Procedures (ESAP). Taking into account that the project will finance multiple sub-projects (construction 

of several markets and development of agro-processing facilities) whose locations will be in a number 

of counties in the three states of Central Equatoria, Eastern Equatoria and Jonglei that have not been 

pinpointed, the implementation of the project will be guided by an Environmental and Social 

Management Framework (ESMF). The ESMF was prepared by the Government of the Republic of South 

Sudan, approved by the Ministry of Environment and the Bank. As required by the Bank, the ESMF 

summary was disclosed on the Bank website on 12th October 2020. The EMSF clearly mandates the 

Project Implementation Unit to prepare Environmental and Social Management Plans (ESMPs) once the 

specific project locations have been identified. During the preparation of the ESMF, the capacity of the 

implementing agency to implement the ESMF framework was assessed and found to be satisfactory. The 

PIU will include an E&S Expert as a member of the core team of the project. A provisional sum of USD 

100,000 has been included in the project budget to cater for E&S related activities.   
 

3.2.2 Climate Change and Green Growth: The project has been screened for climate risks and 

evaluated as category 2, meaning that it is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Foreseen climate 

risks include droughts, increased temperatures and outbreak of crop and livestock pests and diseases that 

may affect crop production and reduce supply of produce to the envisaged Aggregation Business Centres 

and produce markets. However, the project components will contribute to addressing these climate 

impacts in several ways. First, development and marketing of improved seeds will enhance farmers’ 



 

13 

 

access to and adoption of crop varieties that are resistant to droughts and pests. Training of farmers on 

good and climate smart agricultural practices will also enable them to implement improved farm 

management practices that will enhance their resilience to the impacts of climate change. Second, 

provision of market centres in the three states will provide an avenue for farmers to market their produce. 

This will ensure that they have markets during periods of bumper harvest and hence build resilience against 
post-harvest loses that are normally experienced during such periods. Cold storage rooms will also enable the 

prolonged preservation of produce as increased temperatures tend to cause accelerated food deterioration and 

contamination. Third, development and marketing of new crops varieties will ensure availability of drought- and 

pest-resistant varieties. Moreover, the project will implement green measures including providing renewable 

energy (solar) to light the market, installing water harvesting systems, and facilities for managing waste. 

 

3.2.3 Gender: Significant challenges to the attainment of gender equality exist in South Sudan. 

Cultural norms discourage female education, support early marriage and early childbearing. High levels 

of gender-based violence have been witnessed during the transition period particularly in areas affected 

by conflict. Indicators related to these outputs are sex-disaggregated or gender-relevant. The project’s 

preliminary environmental and social assessment has identified numerous socio-economic benefits to 

women that will arise from the implementation of the project and being in leadership positions of the 

ABCs and BPAs. Details of the benefits will be elaborated in the ESMF report. Project design has 

proposed involvement of women and the youth from the launch of the project hence eliminating 

possibilities of exclusion of the two groups in the implementation of the project and its accruing socio-

economic benefits. The initial assessment also estimates that close to 500,000 people (50% women) are 

likely to benefit from the project hence the project is likely to have significant socio-economic impact 

overall. 

3.2.4  The Project is categorized as GEN II according to the Bank’s Gender Marker System where the 

gender assessment identified four key entry points to improve socio-economic benefits to women 

brought about by the Project through: (i) providing adequate training in good agricultural practices; (ii) 

ensuring equitable access to leadership positions of the ABCs and SMCs; (iii) improving market place 

economic and social infrastructure with inclusion of gender sensitive social amenities such as child care 

and adequate WASH; (iv) and strengthening the capacity of key stakeholders to address the gender 

concerns of the Project. 

3.2.5 These activities are designed to address the gender inequalities and accelerate opportunities for 

women in the agricultural sector. Evidence shows that women in South Sudan lack opportunities for 

economic growth and development, particularly in the agricultural sector. Most of them are involved in 

the informal sector, which is underdeveloped and uncoordinated, and in subsistence farming. Women’s 

involvement in the formal sector is limited due to high levels of illiteracy, lack of access to productive 

and economic assets such as land, finance, credit facilities, agricultural inputs, extension services, and 

low business skills and management capacity. Women represent close to 80% of farm labour, 50% of 

the farmers in the irrigated sector and 57% in the rainfed traditional sector in South Sudan. Although 

women play a crucial role in agriculture, contributing to both the GDP and to household food security, 

their contribution to agriculture and the overall economic development process continues to be 

undervalued. Women carry out a major portion of agricultural activities and bear almost the entire burden 

of household work, including water and fuelwood collection and food processing and preparation. As 

one of the key driving factors of the economy in South Sudan, agriculture and food security greatly 

influence the gender factors especially those that affect women. Farmers, especially women, are faced 

with several challenges including, limited access to fertile land and seeds, lack of modern tools, limited 

access to markets and storage facilities.

3.3 Fragility and resilience  

3.3.1 Context. According to the United Nations Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs 

(OCHA), in December 2019, there were 7.5 million South Sudanese in need of assistance. The challenge 

compounds just as several states of South Sudan experienced one of the worst floods in recent years. In 

addition, the agricultural sector that is so critical for food security and poverty reduction was also 

negatively impacted by the floods. Preliminary forecasts showed that 75,000 hectares of cultivated land 

have been damaged due to flooding in affected areas, with an estimated loss of 73,000 metric tons of 

cereals. This represents approximately 15 percent loss in production in the affected areas. Consequently, 

about 7,000 metric tons of food commodities were distributed to some 700,000 flood-affected people 

across the country as of November 2019, with distributions continuing into other priority locations. 

 

3.3.2 Fragility in the agriculture sector. The agricultural sector in South Sudan is affected by a 

combination of various complex factors summarized in table 3.1 below. Agricultural output (i.e. crop 

and vegetables) in South Sudan is low due, inter alia, to emigration and displacement; conflict and 

insecurity; limited availability and access to quality seeds; heavy reliance on (erratic) rains and 

vulnerability to drought, which all lead to food insecurity. Demand for agricultural commodities on the 

other hand, has been constrained by frequent economic shocks and insecurity. Limited clarity of the land 

laws, limits the participation of women, displaced and returnee people in certain community as well as 

long term and large-scale investments. Weak institutional capacity coupled with competition for land 

among powerful foreign powers (i.e. countries from the Middle East) and insecurity, exacerbate the 

power-relations among the main stakeholders in the sector. Moreover, limited penetration of social and 

economic infrastructure (i.e. roads, electricity)  and availability of working tools for farmers, as well as 

low quality, quantity and adherence to strict phytosanitary measures limits the distribution and export 

potential for farmers which could represent a potential source of revenue and income. Limited funding 

of the agricultural sector also limits the outreach and capacity of extension services; organization of 

farmers and the sector in general.

 Insecurity; 
 Climate change 
 Poor infrastructure 

 

3.3.3 The AMVAT project and fragility in South Sudan. The Agricultural Markets, Value-Chains 

and Trade Development (AMVAT) project seeks to address challenges related to (i) agricultural 

productivity and production; (ii) infrastructure and (iii) farmer organization. As indicated in the table 

below, this focus of the project is consistent with addressing some drivers of fragility in the country as 

well as at the agriculture sector level.

The focus and components of the AMVAT project greatly contribute to addressing key drivers of 

fragility in the agriculture sector as well as at the country level as described above. However, the project 

still leaves room to addressing key issues such as the land access and ownership by women, the land 

regulatory framework and climate change. Therefore, it is recommended that the project seeks to mainstream 
those issues in its design. Furthermore, the project needs to pay attention to political economy considerations 

among the main stakeholders to avoid unwanted negative effects between them that could harm the successful 

implementation of the project. 

 

IV – IMPLEMENTATION 

 

4.1. Implementation arrangements 
 

4.1.1 The Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security and the Ministry of Trade and Industry shall be 

the executing agencies for the Project. Due to the low capacity of the Ministries to implement such 

projects, the Bank will engage a third-party implementing agency (TPIA) for the project. The 

Government requested that the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) implement the 

project on its behalf. The Bank has already signed a Fiduciary Principles Agreement (FPA) with the 

FAO that describes the procurement and financial management arrangements and will receive an 

administrative fee of seven percent (7%) of the project costs for implementation. The Government will 

assign counterpart focal officers to coordinate implementation with the TPIA.  

4.1.2 The governance of the project will comprise the National Advisory Committee (NAC) which 

will be chaired by the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security. The NAC will 

also include the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Trade and Industry and of Finance and Planning, as 

well as high-level leaders from the 3 states of CES, EES and Jonglei and the TPIA. The NAC meets 

quarterly to review the project performance, provide oversight and guidance on policy issues and identify 

potential linkages to enhance synergy and increase impact.  

4.1.3 The governance of the project also includes the National Technical Committee (NTC) which 

provides technical advice and recommendations to the NAC on all technical aspects related to project 

implementation. The NTC is chaired by the Director General in the Ministry of Agriculture and Food 

Security and includes relevant directors from the ministries Trade and Industry and Finance and 

Planning, the TPIA, representatives of the SSAPU, STASS, NBSS and representatives from the 3 states 

and other stakeholders that will be identified. The AMVAT project coordinator will serve as the NTC 

Secretary and the NTC will meet quarterly.  

4.1.4 FAO South Sudan will oversee overall coordination and implementation of project activities 

under the respective components through its field staff and subcontracts with local implementation 

partners (NGOs) through its Letter of Agreement (LoA) collaboration instrument. FAO South Sudan, 

under the leadership of the FAO Representative in South Sudan, will provide oversight and quality 

assurance to ensure successful implementation of the project, including all fiduciary aspects, safeguards, 

monitoring, and reporting of the project’s progress. Under the TPIA arrangements, the FAO will use its 

existing FM, procurement and administrative staff to implement the project. In addition, the FAO will 



 

16 

 

recruit a project coordinator, M&E officer, civil engineer, seed expert, value chain expert and 3 extension 

agents (1 per project state) to be part of the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) within the FAO. 

4.1.5 This project will be implemented in close collaboration with the MAFS at the national level and 

the relevant government institutions at the State and County levels. MAFS has a strong technical team 

at the national level that has contributed to design of the project and approved the technical aspects of 

the project. The project is designed to engage with stakeholders, transfer knowledge, and build capacity 

at State and County levels to ensure sustainability. 

 

 

Procurement and financial management 
 

Procurement 

4.16 Procurement of goods (including non-consultancy services), works and acquisition of consulting 

services, financed by the Bank will be carried out in accordance with the “Procurement Policy for Bank 

Group Funded Operations”, dated October 2015 and following the provisions stated in the Financing 

Agreement.  

4.1.7 The assessment of procurement risks at the Country, Sector, and Project levels has informed the 

decisions on the procurement regimes applicable for specific transactions or groups of similar 

transactions under the project. Accordingly, considering the substantial procurement risks involved 

coupled with the limited capacity of the Government, the project will be implemented through Third 

Party Implementation arrangements with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United 

Nations acting as Implementing Agency.  

4.1.8 In March 2018, the Bank and FAO signed a Fiduciary Principles Agreement (FPA) that sets out 

the framework of cooperation between these institutions. This agreement will form the basis for 

implementation of the project in accordance with paragraph 5.3(e) of the Bank’s Procurement Policy. 

Under this arrangement, as part of implementation of this operation, FAO will provide fiduciary 

oversight of the implementation of the entire project, including those relating to the procurement policies 

and procedures.  

4.1.9 For the purpose of implementation of the Project, following the approval of the financing of the 

project by the Bank’s Board of Directors, a Tripartite Funding and Implementation Agreement (TFIA) 

will be signed between the Bank, the Government, and the FAO to put in place a framework that aims 

to deliver the full scope of the project with FAO playing a central role in the execution of the related 

components. The Procurement Technical Annex B5 provides details on the project’s proposed 

procurement arrangements.  

Financial Management 

4.1.10 The Financial management capacity of the Executing Agency, the Ministry of Agriculture and 

Food Security (MAFS) was not assessed during appraisal since the Government wrote an official letter 

to the Bank expressing preference that the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (UN-FAO) to 

implements the project as Third-Party Implementing Agency (TPIA). The FAO will work in close 

cooperation with the MAFS for the smooth implement of the project. The financial management capacity 

of Third-Party Implementing Agency (TPIA), FAO South Sudan was assessed virtually. The FAO 

already has an FPA with the Bank that will govern the Tripartite Agreement to be signed by the Host 



 

17 

 

government, FAO and the Bank. The selected TPIA will maintain sound financial management systems 

and arrangements to ensure that funds are used for the purposes intended.  The FAO will use its systems 

and procedures to ensure sound control of the use of project resources with due considerations to the 

economy, efficiency and value for money. The TPIA will also maintain a project account for the project 

financed activities in accordance with sound international accounting practices. In addition, FAO will 

ensure reliability of financial information by monitoring project implementation, resources and 

expenditures by project component and activities. The Project will be subject to six- monthly Unaudited 

Interim Financial reports and annual financial reporting on project performance and status in conformity 

with FAO’s procedures. 

4.1.11 Financial Reports: The Bank requires FAO to prepare and submit to the Bank a Six-monthly 

and annual interim financial reports certified by an authorized signatory delegated by FAO.  

4.1.12 Disbursement: Disbursements will be done in accordance with the Disbursement Rules and 

Procedures of the Bank, as set out in the Bank’s Disbursement Handbook; and on the basis of the 

Tripartite Project Implementation Agreement(TPIA) to be signed by government, the Fund and FAO.  

The Special Account method will be used, as the disbursements in tranches will be made to FAO 

depending on the nature of the activities and the annual approved work plans. For purpose of the project 

and in line with the annual work plan, the TPIA will provide a Foreign Currency Account to receive 

funds designated for financing project implementation activities. The size of the initial tranche and 

subsequent tranches to FAO shall be based on annual work plans as per the Bank’s disbursement rules. 

The disbursement will be in four (4) tranches (30% for the first three tranches and 10% for the last 

tranche).  

The Bank will issue a Disbursement Letter stipulating key disbursement procedures and practices for the 

project. The Bank will have the right, as reflected in the General Conditions, to suspend disbursement 

of the funds, if reporting requirements and other financing agreements are not complied with. 

4.1.13 Audit: The project audit will not be undertaken separately. The Bank requires annual financial 

audit reports of FAO at the end of each financial year (31st December) in the years the fund was utilized, 

to be submitted to the Fund and to the government within 30 days after the audit report is submitted to 

the General Assembly of the FAO by the Independent Auditors of the FAO. The audit procedures will 

follow the agreement reached in the FPA and TPIA signed by the three parties: government, the Fund 

and the FAO.  

4.2. Monitoring 
 

4.2.1 The AMVAT project will be monitored using KPIs at input, output and outcome levels reflected 

in the RBLF and in the project monitoring matrix presented in annex V. Overall responsibility for M&E 

will rest with the implementation agency, who will put in place an adequate M&E system and monitor 

all the activities and prepare periodic reports, highlighting implementation progress, fiduciary and 

procurement status, stakeholder participation with major focus to the Ministry of Agriculture and Food 

Security, beneficiaries involvement, and risks and mitigation measures. The Project Implementation Unit 

(PIU) within the FAO will prepare semi-annual progress reports which include Unaudited Interim 

Financial Reports (IFRs) certified by an authorized officer of the FAO. The six-month period starts from 

the date of receipt of the first disbursement by FAO. The monitoring will ensure data is disaggregated 

by gender and age at every level where possible. The project will make use of national data sets (e.g. 

National Statistics Office, Youth employment statistics, Household surveys) and Project reports 

whenever possible.  The Bank through its East Africa Regional Development and Business Delivery 

Office and the South Sudan country office will closely monitor day-to-day implementation of the project 



 

18 

 

and carry out at least two (2) supervision missions (in country or virtually) annually, including FM and 

procurement assessments reviews. In addition, the Bank will carry out a mid-term review of the project 

and a project completion report will be prepared at the end of the project.

4.3. Governance 

4.3.1 South Sudan’s independence is 9 years old, but since 2013 the country has experienced civil war 
leading to weakened administrative and financial management structures. Increasing conflict in 

the country for 6 years before the peace deal signed in August 2018 meant that accountability in 

government funds degenerated to such a level that substantial amount of government funding 

could easily be allocated for military expenditures or other unprogrammed use without due regard 

to approved budget commitments. The expenditure on security for example was 21% of the total 

budget in 2017/2018, a decline from 26.9% in 2016/2017, compared to less than 10% for 

agriculture. Development partners have therefore been concerned about weaknesses in 

governance including: (i) risk and costs associated with conflict escalation; (ii) limited 

implementing capacity of the public service; (iii) social and economic marginalization of mainly 

rural populations that threaten the stability of the country; and (iv) weak institutional capacity.   

 

4.3.2 The risk of poor governance on this project is mainly fiduciary in nature, in addition to the 
capacity to effectively implement the project outside Juba, due to security challenges. This risk 

will be mitigated by engaging FAO as the third-party project implementing agency. FAO South 

Sudan continues to have strong operational, procurement and logistics capacities, enabling the 

effective management and monitoring of large and complex programmes in an insecure context. 

FAO is active in all states of South Sudan, with a main office in Juba and extensive field presence 

through a network of field offices with over 320 staff and engages with over 90 Non-

governmental Organizations (NGO’s), Co-operatives and Community Based Organizations 

(CBO) to secure and deliver its mandate. FAO has a track record of implementing development 

activities right through the insurgency periods which is also strengthened by their strong field 

presence where they have staff in their monitoring offices. Although the project will use third 

party implementation arrangements, the government will support and monitor the actions of the 

implementing agency through joint supervision missions. This will ensure that clear governance 

structures are maintained throughout the project. In addition, the Bank will monitor the project 

through regular desk reviews of project reports provided by FAO and field supervision missions 



 

19 

 

to keep track of the utilization of project funds for approved activities in addition to day-to-day 

contact with the FAO leadership in Juba by the Bank’s Country Manager. 

4.4. Sustainability 

4.4.1 Previous experiences and success stories revealed that strong community-based institutions at all 
levels are the backbone of all activities to ensure sustainable and reliable production and 

marketing. As the AMVAT Project will focus on farmer groups as an entry point and train them 

with specific skills, the Project will actively be involved in organizing communities and 

strengthening grassroots institutions to instil their ownership for effective production, 

aggregation, marketing and trade.   
 

 
4.4.2 The AMVAT project’s focus is on establishing an Aggregation Business Centre model. The ABC 

is designed as a growth-hub for the local area and provides the required facilities and capacity 

building to enhance both the quality and quantity of agricultural produce of targeted crops during 

and long after the Project. Farmers groups as the project foundation will be equipped with 

improved seeds, skills and knowledge, facilities and post-harvest handling equipment to expand 

their production and marketing knowledge and thus, increase their incomes. On the other hand, 

with the establishment of laboratories for food testing and CODEX standards for the cereals and 

oil seeds, and capacity building of relevant staff, it is anticipated that food quality and standards 

will be enhanced and maintained during and after the project. The training and coaching 

instruments will continue to capacitate farmers in the long-term. In addition, the experience of 

the FAO as in implementation agency in planning, delivery, and monitoring of agriculture 

programs will provide the necessary knowledge, experience, and ownership to the MAFS and 

beneficiaries to successfully manage key project activities beyond the Project lifespan. Another 

key area of the Project is the focus on knowledge generation and policy development support. 

The Project will also develop a seed policy framework to help the seed system to thrive further.  
 

4.4.3 Stakeholder consultations undertaken during the identification, preparation and appraisal 
confirmed the commitment of the GoSS and the farmer organizations. The ownership of the 

project shall be maintained through the multi-sectoral Project Steering Committee (PSC) 

consisting of key stakeholders who are committed to seeing agriculture development thrive in 

the long run in South Sudan and to contribute to the country’s inclusive growth. 
 

4.4.4 The Municipal Councils will ultimately own the market facilities and take overall responsibility 
for the management of the market. However, they will recruit a private management company 

competitively for the day today management of the market.  

 

4.4.5 The vendors who occupy these facilities will be selected on a competitive basis. The project will 
facilitate the establishment of vendors association and assist the association to be legally 

established following the country’s registration system. The association will be represented in all 

the decisions regarding the management of the market. The project will also provide the resources 

for capacity building for the owner of the market and the vendors association related to the 

management of the market. Accordingly, a training needs assessment will be carried out.

4.6. Knowledge building 

The ability for farmers to enhance productivity and trade depends on access and knowledge to 

technologies, markets and services whereby their linkage with other actors in the value chains remains 

essential and requires project support. The Project will therefore generate critical knowledge for 

supporting farmers to move from subsistence to commercial agriculture in the selected states, which will 

build up lessons for the design and management of similar interventions, to be scaled in other states, as 

well as in other RMCs. Series of training and coaching to different categories has been embedded in this 

project to ensure ownership and sustainability of planned activities. In line with Knowledge Management 

Strategy (2015-2020), the knowledge obtained will be captured through regular supervision, progress 

reporting and mid-term review, and as part of program completion report (PCR) preparation process, 

documented and shared within the Bank and with other DPs and RMCs. Given that the program covers 

four selected crops in three different states with varying opportunities and challenges, there is potential 

to generate useful lessons.
