I. Project Summary 
1.1. The Agriculture Value Chain and Youth Empowerment Project (AVACYEP) is an integrated 
project to strengthen the capacity of rural communities to address the inter-linked challenges of food 
production, rural poverty, food insecurity and access to markets through the provision of horticulture 
and livestock related infrastructure, and improving food production and marketing activities, as well as 
capacity building for the affected communities. The total project cost is 12.241 Units of Account (17.294 
million dollars) over 5 years (2018-2023) and will be implemented in the four districts of Moamba, 
Namaacha, Chókwé and Chonguene with estimated total direct beneficiaries of 20,000 and additional 
20,000 indirect beneficiaries. This project consists of three approaches for scaling up agriculture water 
infrastructure development through: (i) increased horticultural crop production through value chain 
improvement, (ii) contribute to the introduction of best practice agricultural technologies to improve 
productivity of the red meat (i.e. cattle and goats) value chains, (iii) establishment of incubation centers 
for youth and women in order to promote entrepreneurship and agribusiness in order to create an 
appropriate and conducive environment for business development through advisor services and transfer 
of technologies to the beneficiaries of the program; (iv) through the aforementioned activities enhance 
the resilience to climate change and climate variability and risk.   

1.2. Needs Assessment: The AVACYEP emerged from the need to promote a competitive and inclusive 
agribusiness in the Maputo and Gaza provinces through increasing agricultural productivity and animal 
production; providing rural infrastructure to support production (i.e. irrigation, storage facilities); use of 
improved agricultural inputs (i.e. certified seeds and fertilizers); practical and lower-cost breeding 
programs, such as Community-Based Breeding programs (CBBPs); vaccinations; agro-processing; 
access to market; and, promotion of value chain development. The project also emerged in order to 
tackle the Bank’s and Government investment made at the Massingir Dam to promote irrigation 
development for the production of food crops and livestock with the aim of improving food security, 
thereby contributing to the diversification of the agricultural economy in the region, and ensuring wealth 
creation for the rural population, including women and youth. It is expected that the private sector will 
fully participate in supporting the smallholders and the emerging farmers throughout-grower or contract 
farming approaches, supply of agricultural inputs, agro-processing, marketing the agricultural produce, 
and financing agricultural activities.   
 
1.3 Bank’s Added Value: The Project is also in line with the Bank’s High 5 Action Plan the Bank’s 
Ten Year Strategy (2013-2022), Agricultural Transformation in Africa Strategy (2016-2025) under the 
Bank’s High 52 including the Technologies for Africa Agricultural Transformation (TAAT) and Enable 
Youth Programs in order to transform the agriculture sector to enhance the country competitiveness and 
develop domestic clusters of agri-business and integrated value chains that can increase domestic value 
addition, generate jobs and attract FDI and know-how. The AVACYEP will also contribute to the second 
pillar of the new Country Strategy Paper 2018-2022, under preparation, through the envisaged increased 
agriculture productivity as a result of the improved water and land management activities and 
introduction of science based, proven and high impact technologies. The new CSP 2016-2021, currently 
under preparation, focuses on two strategic pillars that have been approved by CODE: Pillar I infrastructure 
development; and Pillar II Agriculture. 

                                                 
2 High 5 refers to the five priority areas that the Bank will be focus on in the next 10 years.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE MANAGEMENT TO THE 
BOARD OF DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED GRANT/ TO MOZAMBIQUE FOR 

THE AGRICULTURE VALUE CHAIN AND YOUTH EMPOWERMENT 
PROJECT (AVACYEP) 

 
Management submits the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed grant of UA 11.00 million 
from the ADF and UA 0.73 million from the Republic of  Mozambique for the financing requirement of 
the Agriculture Value Chain and Youth Empowerment Project (AVACYEP) in Mozambique. 

I. – Strategic Thrust & Rationale  
 

1.1.  PRSP and CSP priorities, Key Development Issue(s) project  
 
1.1 The Mozambican Government has been making efforts to transform the agriculture sector which 
culminated in the preparation of the National Investment Plan for the Agrarian Sector (PNISA -2014 to 
2018, currently under review to extend it up to 2022). Through PNISA, the Government identified 6 
Agricultural Growth Corridors to promote agricultural development, namely: (i) Pemba-Lichinga corridor 
that is suitable for the production of potatoes, wheat, beans, maize, soybeans, cotton, tobacco and poultry; 
(ii) Nacala corridor with potential to grow cassava, maize, cotton, fruits, poultry and peanuts; (iii) Zambezi 
Valley corridor that can produce rice, maize, potatoes, livestock, poultry and cotton; (iv) Beira corridor for 
maize, wheat, vegetables, soybeans, rice, livestock and poultry; (v) Limpopo corridor for rice, vegetables, 
livestock and poultry; and (vi) Maputo corridor that would focus on rice, vegetables, livestock (red meat) 
and poultry. While these corridors are not necessarily aligned to the transport corridors, some have achieved 
a degree of development in terms of infrastructure, institutions and agricultural development, while others 
have not commenced any form of development. 
 
1.2 Under the effort of contributing to the Bank’s Feed Africa Strategy and also supporting the 
implementation of the Government’s 5-Year-Investment Plan, the Maputo and Limpopo corridors have 
been selected for the implementation of this project considering their high potential for unlocking the 
development of approximately 450,000 ha of arable land, out of which 110,000 ha are suitable for irrigation 
development. The target staple commodities include horticulture and livestock (red meat), and are 
considered as priority commodities in both the Maputo and Limpopo Development Corridors, especially in 
the large irrigation schemes of Baixo Limpopo and Chókwé (Gaza Province) and the Sabié-Incomati 
(Maputo Province). The main constraints the horticulture value chain faces are related to the availability of 
appropriate seeds, pest control and processing; while for livestock the challenges are related to health 
(disease control), nutrition (feed stock production) and markets (value addition and processing).  If these 
limiting factors are addressed, both value chains can contribute to the improvement of the quality of life, 
nutrition and income of the local people, in particular youth and women, through the creation of business 
opportunities and decent employment for both groups along the priority agricultural value chains.  
 
1.3 The investments will also complement previous Bank financed projects such as the Massingir Dam 
Agriculture Rehabilitation and Emergency Projects, Baixo Limpopo and climate Resilience project 
(BLICRP), Sustainable Land and Water Management Project (SLWMP) and Drought Recovery and 
Agriculture Resilient Project (DRARP), all of which have invested in irrigation and livestock infrastructures 
and processing facilities for horticulture. The project also incorporates the Technologies for African 



 

2 
 

Agricultural Transformation (TAAT), an initiative to help African countries significantly increase 
agricultural and livestock productivity and production rapidly and at scale by adopting existing 
technologies, including high yielding and climate resilient seed varieties. The project is also well in line 
with the Government’s poverty reduction efforts looking to support increased agricultural production and 
employment promotion (on a national scale) with particular attention given to youth and women. The 
project is furthermore aligned with the Bank’s Ten Year Strategy (2013-22), particularly in its operational 
focus areas (private sector infrastructure) and areas of special emphasis (agriculture and food security). The 
project also aligns with the Banks Climate Change Plan (CCAP 2, 2016-2020) which promotes the 
implementation of climate smart agriculture. Furthermore, the project is therefore expected to provide an 
enabling economic environment for private sector development and participation. 

1.2.  Rationale for Bank’s involvement  
 
1.2.1 The project will be implemented in two provinces of Maputo and Gaza, which have potential for 
horticulture and livestock (red meat) production. These provinces are covered by three of the largest 
irrigation schemes in the country, namely Chókwé, Baixo Limpopo and Sabie, and also accounts for the 
largest number of livestock heads in Mozambique. The interventions under the High 5 are aligned with the 
Government 5-year Plan of promoting agriculture production and productivity, that will increase 
employment as well as improving competitiveness of the national economy. The AVACYEP is in line with 
the Bank’s Ten Year Strategy (2013-2022), Agricultural Transformation in Africa Strategy (2016-2025) 
under the Bank’s High 5, including TAAT and Enable Youth Action Plans in order to transform the 
agriculture sector to enhance the country competitiveness and develop domestic clusters of agri-business 
and integrated value chains that can increase domestic value addition, generate jobs and attract FDI and 
know-how. The AVACYEP will also contribute to the second pillar of the new Country Strategy Paper 
2018-2022, under preparation, through the envisaged increased agriculture productivity as a result of the 
improved water and land management activities. The new CSP 2018-2022, currently under preparation, 
focuses on two strategic pillars that have been approved by CODE: Pillar I infrastructure development; and 
Pillar II Agriculture.

Alternative name Brief description Reasons for rejection 

Focus on cattle value 
chain 

There is a long-standing history of 
research on cattle while small 
ruminants have been relatively 
neglected by international and local 
research  

� There is growing demand for small ruminant meat 
production, especially goats. Meat consumption in 
Mozambique, as in many other parts of Africa, are met by 
imports. The urban population can benefit from local small 
ruminant production, whilst increasing incomes of various 
actors across the meat value chain. Hence this project’s 
focus on small ruminants. 

 A non-integrated 
value chain solution 
for enhancing 
productivity for the 
small ruminants 
sector.   

The challenges of smallholder 
livestock producers in Mozambique 
spans across the spectrum, from 
health, breeding and production, 
feed and forage to value addition 
and marketing 

� Focusing on only one segment of the value chain will be 
insufficient to increase productivity and production 
volumes.  In order to increase productivity, it is key to 
address both supply and demand constraints of the small 
ruminants’ value chain.

� Bank guarantees are the limiting factor for women and 
youth access to financial services. 

� The Banks do not offer any capacity building on financial 
managements services  

2.3.  Project Type   
 
2.3.1  The project is a stand-alone investment operation with a source of funding mainly coming from 
the African Development Fund blended with Government financing. The Project is one of the three 
selected interventions planned for 2018 under the new CSP for Mozambique 2017-2022.  

2.4.  Project Cost and Financing Arrangements  
 
2.4.1  Project Cost and Financing Arrangement  
 
The Project cost, including physical and price contingencies, is UA 12.24 million, which will be financed 
by (i) ADF Grant of UA 11.0 million (89.6%%) covering all major Project activities, and also taxes and 
duties; (ii) the Government contribution of UA 0.73 million (6.0%) through in-kind (monetary value) for 
existing Government staff salaries participating in Project activities, office space, and office utilities;(iii) 
beneficiaries in-kind contribution of UA 0.24 million (2.0%) through specific labour during installation of 
the irrigation systems, agricultural production activities and also valuable time for attending training 
sessions; and (iv) AfDB TAAT contribution (Grant) of UA 0.3 million (2.4%). The price contingencies 
were based on projected local and foreign inflation rates of 5% and 2% per annum, respectively. The 
physical contingencies ranged from 0% to 8% (works) based on (i) common technical practices, and (ii) 
available Engineer’s cost estimates. Taxes and duties cover the total amount of UA 740.500,00 
corresponding to 6% of the total project costs. This is motivated by the need to ensure seamless project 
implementation in an environment of tight budgetary space for the Government, a full case for the ADF to 
cover duty and taxes, in line with the Policy on Expenditure Eligible for Bank Financing is formulated in 
Appendix IV. Summary of the Project costs by components, sources of financing, expenditure categories 
and schedule by component are presented in Tables 2.3 to 2.6 and the details are in PAR Volume II 
Technical Annex B.2.

2.5.  Project’s Target area and population  
 
2.5.1  The activities of the project will be undertaken in two provinces, Gaza and Maputo. In each of the 
provinces two districts are selected to participate in the project. In Maputo, the project will be implemented 
in the districts of Moamba and Namaacha, while in Gaza the selected districts are Chókwè and Chonguene. 
The selected communities are those that are cultivating horticulture and livestock owners. They will be the 
direct beneficiaries of the activities under the project. The total direct beneficiaries of the project will be 
circa 20,000 individuals, of which about 60% will be women. The project will target 4000 households to 
increase the production of an additional 20,000 small ruminants in four districts in two provinces - Moamba 
and Namaacha districts (Maputo Province), and Chonguene, Massingir and Chókwè districts (Gaza 
Province). The indirect beneficiaries will be in the range of 20,000 people. With an average of 5 persons 
per household this would result in improved livelihoods for approximately 100,000 rural dwellers.   
 
2.5.2 Public institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security (MASA), the Provincial and 
District directorates of Agriculture and Food Security, Veterinary Services, IIAM, the Agriculture 
Development Fund (FDA), the National Institute for Small and Medium Enterprises (IPEME) and the 
Office for Supporting Economic Production (GAPI) will benefit from the project interventions in terms of 
capacity building. Other indirect beneficiaries are agro processors, traders, entrepreneur, various service 
providers, NGOs, etc. In addition to infrastructure and improved agricultural practices, innovative 
techniques needed for quality maintenance of infrastructure, and conservation and processing of food 
products, will be developed.  

2.6.  Participatory Process for Project Identification, Design and Implementation  

2.6.1   Project Identification  
 
The investment in integrated agricultural development in the Lower Limpopo and Sábiè-Incomati regions 
within the Limpopo and Maputo Corridors, will respectively have a component for leveraging the existing 
infrastructure to increase agricultural productivity and producers’ access to markets. Increasing agricultural 
productivity, strengthening its resilience to climate shocks and building agriculture value chains, are all 
areas where the Government of Mozambique is looking forward to working with the AfDB.

The Value Chains and Youth Empowerment Project emerged from the need to promote a more competitive 
and inclusive agribusiness in the Maputo and Gaza provinces through increasing agricultural productivity 
and animal production, by providing rural infrastructure to support production (irrigation, storage facilities), 
use of improved agricultural inputs (certified seeds and fertilizers), practical and lower-cost breeding 
programs, such as Community-Based Breeding programs (CBBPs), vaccinations, agro-processing, access 
to market and promotion of the value chain development. The project also emerged in order to tackle the 
investment made at the Massingir Dam to promote irrigation development for the production of food crops 
with the aim of improving food security, contributing to the diversification of the agricultural economy in 
the region, and wealth creation for the rural population including women and youth. It is expected that the 
private sector will fully participate in supporting the smallholders and the emerging farmers throughout-
grower or contract farming approaches, supply of agricultural inputs, agro-processing, marketing the 
agricultural produce, and financing agricultural activities.   

2.6.2   Project Preparation and Appraisal  
The project design was prepared following constant consultations with beneficiaries, government 
authorities, NGOs and development partners in Maputo and Gaza provinces.  While in the field, numerous 
interactions/consultations were conducted at the provincial and district levels; site visits to the selected 
districts and mini-workshops were held; and consultations with government, non -government and 
private organizations as well as community representatives near and within  some of the targeted 
communities were carried out to modify and fine-tune the project proposal. The Bank also deployed 
designed resources to fine-tune into AVACYEP, existing designs from the most recently implemented 
projects, i.e. Sustainable Land and Water Management Project and Baixo Limpopo Irrigation and Climate 
Resilience Project, in order to adjust proposed infrastructures to the implementation sites. The consultation 
also involved the provision of agricultural inputs to match farmers’ needs and their financial limitations to 
ensure sustainability of activities and meet the outcomes. Consultations were also carried out with a number 
of Government authorities and other development partners that participate in different development donor 
programmes.   

2.6.3    Project Implementation  
 
2.6.3.1  The proposed AVACYEP is based o n  a  fully participatory approach involving capacity training 
of members of the community and substantial training through demonstrative processes. The Project 
Implementation Unit (PIU) at the project headquarters and the provincial technical staff will be responsible 
for the monitoring of project results including output and outcome indicators on a participatory fashion. 
Data collection and evaluation tasks would be performed by all the institutions involved in the project or in 
partnership with other relevant institutions under close supervision of the Monitoring and Evaluation expert 
of the project.  The community members will thus develop the capacity to maintain the community 
infrastructure, to be installed with support from the Agriculture Departments. 

2.7.  Bank Group Experience, Lessons Reflected in Project Design  

The overall performance assessment of the Bank’s portfolio in Mozambique conducted in 2017 is 3.30 on 
a scale of 1-4. The portfolio is comprised of 19 projects (17 public projects, 2 private sector projects and 1 
multinational project). There are no projects at risk. Learning from recent Project Completion Reports 
(PCR’s) and the ongoing Bank Projects in Mozambique which have informed the design features of the 
AVACYEP include the need to: a) improve the project design process with consideration to existing 
capacity within the country so as to ensure timely implementation; b) project readiness and quality at entry 
for both regional and national operations; c) Rationalize the number of conditions necessary to declare the 



 

9 
 

Grant effective in order to reduce implementation delays; d) increase capacity of implementing agencies 
especially in the project management); e) enhance the supervision of projects, particularly monitoring and 
evaluation to minimize delays in completion; and, f) delays in provision of counterpart funds, partly owing 
to late approval and release of funds by Government. For the closed Projects in the last 5 years, the PCRs 
are up to date with all the reports prepared and posted on the Bank website.  

2.8. Key Performance Indicators  
The key performance indicators for the project have been outlined in the Result Based Logical Framework.  
Special emphasis in order to assess the changes in the livelihood and nutrition levels within the household 
will be placed on the targeting indicators that should be monitored and those related specifically to women 
as they carry the majority of agriculture activities in the project area. Regular implementation progress will 
be measured through bi-annual Bank supervision missions led by Mozambique Country Office, Quarterly 
Progress Reports, and annual technical and financial audits.  The M&E of the PIU will collect and analyze 
project data to monitor performance. The main performance indicators disaggregated by gender will be 
monitored from the baseline scenario of the log frame include among others: (i) Area developed with 
irrigation kits; (ii) N° of farmers and livestock owners adopting new production technologies (including 
climate compatible technologies); (iii) N° of processing facilities and marketing service providers; (iv) N° 
of surface and subsurface reservoirs, water troughs, multifunctional boreholes slaughter-houses, disease 
control centers, processing facilities and feed stock sites; (v) N° of business plans and proposals approved 
for financing (50% of which owned by females) within the incubation program, including access to financial 
mechanisms; and (vi) number of women & men trained with basic agriculture and livestock skills. All 
indicators selected for the project will help to enhance agricultural performance in the Maputo and Gaza 
Provinces in particular, and in Mozambique in general. The Bank’s various supervision missions and 
periodic activity reports will reflect the level of achievement of the indicators.  

III – PROJECT FEASIBILITY  

3.1 .  Economic and Financial Analysis  
 
The DCF analysis carried out on the net cash-flow gave an Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) of 
28% and the Economic Net Present Value is estimated at USD 220 million at an opportunity cost of 10%. 
The economic values for the production inputs and equipment were developed using a standard conversion 
factor of 0.95, taking into account the taxes in the country. The economic prices used for the horticultural 
and red meat products were the prevailing market prices in the country.  
 
Sensitivity analysis using economic prices showed that a 5% decrease in capital costs marginally increased 
the ENPV to USD 222 million while maintaining the EIRR at 28%. On the other hand, a fall in the product 
prices by 3% reduced the ENPV to USD 93 million and EIRR to 16%.  Refer to Annex 3 on details on 
sensitivity analysis.  
 

FIRR, FNPV (base case) 24.81 % : USD 141 million  
EIRR, ENPV (base case) 28 % : USD 220 million  

 

Note: detailed calculations are available in Appendix in the Volume II, Technical Annex ….. 
 

The financial analysis has been carried out at the farm household level as well as the entire project level. 
This has been done by comparing the benefits accruing to the individual beneficiaries, and aggregated for 
the project as a whole, on a with – and - without project basis. The analysis was carried out for on the 



 

10 
 

horticulture value chains focusing on five priority horticultural crops namely tomatoes, cabbages, 
cucumber, onion and pepper and red meat value chains, the latter focusing on beef and goat meat. The 
analysis is based on the assumption that the participating households will be producing horticultural crops 
under irrigation system and rearing of beef animals and goats under improved management systems. The 
project is expected to increase agricultural productivity through the provision of inputs and irrigation 
facilities, multipurpose boreholes, agro-processing and packaging equipment, livestock equipment and 
infrastructures for disease control and improved sanitation, extension services and institutional 
strengthening and capacity building. The analysis takes into account the current and incremental production 
under the improved management and assumes full production levels from year 3. The analysis shows that 
an average net income (gross margin) per farming household participating in the project will increase from 
USD 22.182 under the existing situation (without project) to USD 31,966 under project situation. The 
discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis carried out on the net cash-flow gave a Financial Internal Rate of 
Return (FIRR) of 24.81%, and a Financial Net Present Value (NPV) of USD 141 million at an opportunity 
costs of 12%.  
 
Sensitivity analysis was conducted on the price changes on for the horticultural and red meat products and 
capital investments in the project. The results showed that a decrease in the prices of produce by 3% resulted 
into a reduction of the FIRR to 14.17% with FNPV of USD 28.30 million. This shows that the revenue is 
very sensitive to changes in the prices. It was also noted that a decrease in the capital cost by 5% resulted 
into an increase in the FIRR to 25.02% and FNPV increased to USD 142.50 million.  

3.2.  Environmental and Social Impacts  
 
3.2.1  Based on the proposed project scope the environmental and social (E&S) classification was 
validated as a Category 2 according to the African Development Bank’s Environmental and Social 
Assessment Procedures (ESAP). Hence an Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) was 
prepared and disclosed on the Bank’s website before 20th of June 2018.  This classification and attendant 
requirement is commensurate with the project classification stipulated by the country’s Regulamento Sobre 
Processo de Avaliação do Impacto Ambiental – Decreto No.54/2015. The principal objectives of conducting 
this environmental and social assessment and planning was to ensure that the project integrates mechanisms 
to reduce environmental impacts along the entire value chain, from production, marketing to product value 
addition/manufacture, usage and disposal. 

3.2.2  Environmental and Social Assessments indicate that although the project will have some site 
specific negative impacts, it is also posed to have numerous positive impacts among them: (i) improved 
production and competitiveness of selected agriculture commodities that will contribute to increased 
income opportunities for value chain actors, and support the local economy of the Gaza and Maputo 
Province; (ii) improved access to irrigation kits that will foster water management and reduce the 
vulnerability of farmers to precarious weather conditions, ensuring all year round agricultural activities; 
(iii) improved agronomic practices and technologies for selected crops and improved varieties that are 
adapted to different climatic conditions; and (iv) improved agricultural production, productivity and market 
linkages that will foster job creation along the value chains. 
 
3.2.3 The negative impacts will stem from a number of activities in the infrastructure development and 
value chain components of the project. The potential negative impacts of the project include those 
associated with the construction of the infrastructure development, and agriculture production and value 
chain activities. Construction activities may result in (i) losses of vegetation cover due to site clearing, soil 
erosion, landscape degradation; (ii) noise, vibration and emissions from operation of machinery that may 
impair air quality and induce health implications: (iii) generation of wastes (including construction wastes); 



 

11 
 

(iv) disruption of water flows and hydrologic cycle which may impact activities of other water users. During 
operation phase, agriculture activities of value chain actors may lead to (i) increased use of agrochemicals 
including pesticides and fertilizers, which may contribute to soil and water (surface and groundwater) 
contamination, and increase health-risks of people exposed to pesticides, and (ii) waste and effluents from 
processing and marketing facilities.  These impacts are site specific and can be readily managed with the 
application of well-defined measures elaborated in the ESMP. Some of the mitigation measures to be 
implemented include (i) refilling the exposed or excavated soil soon after completion of works and avoiding 
or minimizing compaction of soils, (ii) establishing sustainable water management systems, and (iii) 
capacity building of value chain actors to promote good agriculture practices, improved agriculture 
technologies such as integrated soil fertility management (ISFM), integrated pest management (IPM), 
Waste-to-Energy techniques, and other sustainable land and water management practices.  

3.3.  Climate Change  
 
3.3.1  Agriculture production in Mozambique is vulnerable to the impacts of climate variability and 
change.  Drought, floods and storms are increasing in frequency and intensity, while average temperatures 
during the growing season are rising. Crop failure, loss of livestock, reduction in productivity of pastures 
and outbreaks of pest and diseases are exacerbated by extreme climatic events.  Furthermore, severe floods 
and storms damage infrastructure (road, market and storage infrastructure) that support agriculture value 
chain development).  
 
Cognizant of the national commitment to combat climate change, the projects is being prepared taking into 
consideration the various National Strategies, Plans and Institutions relevant to Climate Change among 
them; (i) the Nationally Determined Contribution (2015)   which articulate the actions to be undertaken to 
adapt  to the inevitable impacts of climate change and to contribute to the global mitigation agenda . (ii) the 
National Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation strategy 2013-2030 (2012)  which identifies adaptation 
and climate risk reduction  and low carbon development as national priorities (iii) National Adaptation 
Programme of Action (NAPA) (2007) and the Strategic Program for Climate Resilience (SPCR), aim to 
coordinate the elaboration and implementation of an action plan for adaptation to climate change for various 
economic and social development sectors, with an emphasis on disaster risk reduction, early warning 
systems, agriculture, fisheries, energy, water  resources, ecosystems, and coastal zones.  
 
In relation to the climate risk screening the project is category 2, it is potentially vulnerable to the impacts 
of climate change and requires the identification and integration of practical climate risk management 
measures in project design. In this regards, the proposed AVACYEP will address critical climate adaptation 
needs of the smallholder farmers and other value chain actors in the project area. Some of the priority areas 
of action include (i) increase access to seeds adapted to local conditions (ii) promote good agriculture 
practices such as sustainable land management for increased agricultural yields; (iii) facilitate climate 
proofing of infrastructure, (iv) build capacity for agricultural planning and extension services to facilitate 
dissemination of climate information to farmers, and (iv) promote livelihood diversification.  Overall, the 
project will facilitate climate resilience along the selected value chains by promoting climate smart 
agriculture and improved agriculture technologies.

3.4.  Gender  
 
3.4.1 Agriculture is the most important economic sector for the wellbeing of rural households in 
Mozambique. As such, agriculture is linked to the income and consumption levels of rural households, and 
influences their food security, poverty, and malnutrition status, among other characteristics. Smallholders 
continue to dominate the agrarian sector, with 3.86 million households engaged in small-scale agriculture, 
out of a total of 4.268.585 farms, predominantly farmed by women. Gender mainstreaming in agriculture 
is guided by the Agriculture Gender Strategy. The strategy seeks to guarantee access and control of the 
resources, benefits, rights and equal opportunities, between women and men, and to increase food security 
and household revenue of men and women, with the ultimate goal of contributing to reduction of poverty 
and sustainable development.    

3.4.2 Key gender equality challenges in rural agriculture include i) Access to land- The Mozambican Land 
Law (Lei de Terra) provides for equal access to land for men and women but majority of women still do 
not have security of tenure for the land they work on.  Many are unaware of the registration process and 
access to land is still based on gender structures where women’s claims are usually socially embedded in 
their relations to their male relatives the project will therefore support land registration for women. ii) 
Access to affordable financial solutions- whilst women are the main household financial managers, they 
are often an overlooked target client for financial services providers. Although un- and underserved by 
formal financial institutions, women in Mozambique save using informal methods such as xitique (group 
savings) making them viable customers for local financial services. The project will therefore support 
business coaching, incubation and linkages to financial services for youth and female agripreneurs. Building 
on existing savings groups the project will support the strengthening of community based financial schemes 
to promote financial inclusion in rural areas. iii) Limited production capacity and value addition- both 
women and men in Mozambique are involved in the horticulture and red meat value chains, albeit with 
different patterns between male- and female-headed households. While women generally participate at all 
levels of the chains they face production related challenges and are minimally involved in value addition. 
The project will therefore support increased productivity for women and youth through the provision of 
starter kits for horticulture and red meat value chains including training and coaching in agribusiness, 
animal health, and training of community based extension services workers and creating linkages to formal 
extension services. 

3.5. Involuntary Resettlement 
 
3.5.1  The project is not expected to trigger any form of involuntary resettlement. 

IV – IMPLEMENTATION  

4.1.  Implementation arrangements  
 
4.1.1   The Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security (MASA) will be the Executing Agency (EA) for the 
Project which will be implemented in Gaza and Maputo Provinces, through MASA’s Directorate of 
Planning and International Cooperation (DPCI). A Project Coordination Unit (PCU) will be set up at the 
MASA, for the day to day effective implementation of the Project activities over a period of five (5) years. 
The MASA institutions such as the National Irrigation Institute (Instituto Nacional de Irrigação/INIR), the 
National Directorate of Agriculture and Silviculture (Direccão Nacional de Agricultura e 
Silvicultura/DINAS), Fund for Agriculture Development (Fundo de Desenvolvimento Agrário/FDA), and 
National Directorate for Agricultural Extension (Direcção Nacional de Extensão Agraria/DNEA), National 



 

13 
 

Directorate of Veterinary (Direccão Nacional de Veterinária / DINAV) and National Institute for 
Agricultural Research of Mozambique (Instituto Nacional de Investigação Agrária de Moçambique / IIAM) 
will be responsible for technical implementation in the areas linked with their mandates. Some of the 
components, i.e. Youth and Women Empowerment will be outsourced. The PCU will be constituted of a 
Project Coordinator (PC), Project Accountant, Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Specialist, Procurement 
Specialist and support staff. For effective implementation, the agriculture offices in Gaza and Maputo 
Provinces will be provided with logistical support. The PCU will also be responsible for the overall 
monitoring and supervision of ESMF/ESMP implementation. The Project activities will be supported by 
MASA Technical Council that will compose the Project Steering Committee (PSC) which will be set-up, 
by the Government, to provide oversight responsibility and oversee Project compliance with sector policies 
and strategies. The PSC will comprise MASA Permanent Secretary and senior officials from DPCI, FDA, 
DNEA, DNP, INIR, DNE, IPEME (Institute for Promotion of Small and Medium Enterprises), and GAPI 
(Small Scale Investment Support Office), DNS and IIAM. The PC will be secretary to the PSC. 
 
4.1.2  Financial Management, Disbursement and Auditing Arrangement: 
 
4.1.2.1  Financial Management: The overall conclusion of the FM Assessment is that MASA’s (through 
the Department of National Planning and Cooperation, DNPC) capacity to handle the FM aspects of the 
project satisfies the Bank’s minimum requirements as per the Bank FM guidelines. The Ministry has 
handled donor-funded (APSA- World Bank, PROSUL- FIDA, PASF- Austria, PSP- IFAD and PADR- 
Italy) projects. The DNPC is generally adequately staffed. The Ministry utilizes a functional computerized 
accounting system (e-SISTAFE) to record and process transactions, complemented by use of spread sheets 
for financial reporting purposes for projects. The control environment from budget preparation, execution, 
monitoring and reporting were found to be adequate. There is a functional internal audit unit which will 
further strengthen the internal controls within the ministry including the project. In that regard, the Bank 
will make use of the existing systems within MASA (while closely monitoring and providing assistance as 
required) under the overall responsibility of the Director, Department of Finance and Administration, to 
handle the project’s FM including accounting for the project resources and submitting the required financial 
reports to the Bank. In accordance with the Bank’s financial reporting and auditing requirements, the project 
will be required to prepare and submit to the Bank Interim Quarterly Progress Report (IQPR) no later than 
45 days after the end of each quarter. In addition, the project will be required to prepare separate project 
annual financial statements which will form the entry point for external audit due diligence. The overall FM 
residual risk for the project is assessed as Moderate. (The detailed FM assessment is attached as Annex B4).  
 
4.1.2.2  Auditing arrangement: The MASA has been audited by the Tribunal Administrativo (TA) bi-
annually. The TA is constitutionally mandated to audit all public institutions in Mozambique, however 
given the capacity constraints, some of the audits especially in Bank funded projects have been audited by 
private audit firms competitively recruited with the involvement of the TA. Specific for the project, a 
separate audit report will be prepared for the project annually with the audit carried out by an independent 
external auditor recruited in accordance with the Bank’s requirements. The audit will be conducted in 
accordance with a Bank approved audit Terms of Reference with the costs of the audit financed from the 
grant. The annual audited financial statements including the auditor’s opinion and management letter will 
be submitted to the Bank not later than six months after the end of each fiscal year. 
 
4.1.2.3 Disbursement Arrangements: Flow of funds to finance the institution follows the national treasury 
and appropriation procedures with controls over the use of funds generally adequate. The entity operates 3 
bank accounts with adequate controls over access to the funds and up to date recording of transactions. The 
review noted that donor-funded projects funds have been managed generally satisfactory. However, the 
institution lacks practical experience in managing Bank funds flow. Specific to this project, payments will 



 

14 
 

be primarily by direct payment method where the Bank will pay contractors/consultants and suppliers 
directly based on satisfactory performance in accordance with the Bank’s Disbursement Handbook. 
Disbursements would be made upon preparation and submission of all relevant documentations by DPCI 
to the Bank’s Disbursement Division, through the Bank’s Country Office in Mozambique. In addition, a 
Special Account denominated in USD and its associated MZN denominated project operating account shall 
be opened at the Central Bank, and will be limited for use in paying for the small operating project expenses 
that are recurring in nature. A Disbursement Letter will be issued by the Bank. 
 
4.1.3 Procurement Arrangements:  
 
4.1.3.1 Borrower Procurement System (BPS):  
 
Procurement of goods (including non-consultancy services), works and the acquisition of consulting 
services, financed by the Bank for the project, will be carried out in accordance with the “Procurement 
Policy and Methodology for Bank Group Funded Operations” (BPM), dated October 2015, and following 
the provisions stated in the Financing Agreement. Specifically, Procurement would be carried out 
following: 
 

x Borrower Procurement System (BPS): Specific Procurement Methods and Procedures (PMPs) 
under BPS comprising its Laws and Regulations, namely, Decreto 5/2016 de 8 de Março – 
Regulamento de Contratação de Empreitadas de Obras Públicas, Fornecimento de Bens, e Prestação 
de Serviços ao Estado (Regulations for Contracting of Public Works, Supply of Goods and 
Consultancy & Non-Consultancy Services to the State), using the national Standard Solicitation 
Documents (SSDs) as amended to be in consistent with the new law, using the national Standard 
Bidding Documents (SBDs) or other Solicitation Documents agreed during project negotiations” 
for various group of transactions to be entailed under the project. 

x Bank Procurement Methods and Procedures (PMPs): Bank standard PMPs, using the relevant 
Bank Standard Solicitation Documents SDDs, for contracts that are indicated in Annex B5, Para. B 
5.5, or (ii) in case BPS is not relied upon for a specific transaction or group of transactions; and (iii) 
in case BPM have been found to be the best fit for purpose for a specific transaction or group of 
transactions. 

Procurement Risks and Capacity Development: the assessment of procurement risks at the Country, 
Sector, and Project levels and of procurement capacity at the Executing Agency (EA), were undertaken3 
for the project and the output has informed the decisions on the procurement regimes (BPS, Bank or Third 
party) being used for specific transactions or groups of similar transactions under the project. The 
appropriate risks mitigation measures have been included in the procurement PRCA action plan proposed 
in Annex B5, Para. 5.2. 
 
4.1.3.2 Procurement Risks and Capacity Development:  
 
Procurement Risk Assessments were undertaken for this project by conducting an exhaustive assessment 
covering the risks associated with the country, sector and project environments as well as the Executing 
Agency responsible for the implementation of the Project’s procurement activities.  
  
Most of the issues/ risks associated with the procurement activities for implementation of the project have been 
identified and mitigated. The mitigation measures have been discussed and agreed with the Executing Agency

4.2.  Governance  
 
GoM has been implementing a number of reforms to enhance governance, transparency and accountability. 
There have been major structural and functional reforms with emphasis on policy and institutional actions 
including public financial management system, decentralization and capacity building all in an effort to 
ensure accountability and transparency in Government operations. The Project will be utilizing qualified 
staff to ensure economy and efficiency of project procurement and financial management process. 
Furthermore, the governance structure of the project provides for a statutory body like the MASA Conselho 
Consultivo and Conselho Tecnico (Consultative Council and Technical Council) as the steering committee, 
which gives oversight policy direction for the implementation of the project. The Bank will follow up on 
governance through regular field supervision missions, audit reports, Annual WorkPlan and Budget 
(AWPB), progress reports and procurement plans. The Bank is effectively on the ground with the Country 
Office (COMZ) in Maputo and thus close interaction and follow up will be undertaken at the Country level to 
ensure that implementation of Project activities are on course. The COMZ Sector Experts and from RDGS 2 
will give a quarterly schedule of implementation progress to the Country Manager and the Manager of RDGS 2 
.

4.3.  Monitoring  
  
4.3.1 The monitoring and evaluation specialist will be responsible for the internal monitoring and 
evaluation of project activities and logical framework indicators, working in liaison with the technical 
experts on the project implementation team. The Project Implementation Unit at the project headquarters 
and the province levels will be responsible for the monitoring of project results including output and 
outcome indicators. Data collection and evaluation tasks will be performed by all the institutions involved 
in the project or in partnership with other relevant institutions.   

4.3.2 The PIU will work closely with relevant Ministries Directorates and Agencies of government and 
research institutes for the purposes of data collection, and monitoring and evaluation of the project. The 
PIU will be recruited and staffed with a qualified M&E Specialist, who will benefit from tailored capacity 
building programs to acquaint him/her very well with the scope and nature of the project, and the 
methodology to be followed. The project will support the deployment of an M&E and Management 
Information System (MIS) that will facilitate performance monitoring and impact evaluation against the 
specified indicators, including gender tracker and environmental safeguards related indicators. While the 
performance monitoring process facilitates informed decision-making, the outcome assessment will provide 
information on whether the project has achieved its development objectives.

4.4.  Sustainability  
  
Use of simple technologies that are appropriate for the rural farmers ensures that adoption and replicability 
is assured. The project design is based on feasibility studies as well as stakeholders consultations to ensure 
ownership and sustainability. Community participation and capacity building will further bolster the 
abilities of the various groups to continue project activities even after completion. The market activities 
offer additional sources of income and therefore greater capacity for the horticulture farmers and livestock 
owners to continue with the activities after conclusion of the project. The project will establish 
communities’ led-committees for overseeing infrastructure operation and maintenance as well as for 
enhancing community participation and ownership. The committees will be technically supported by the 
National water and agriculture agencies. The infrastructure to be installed for irrigation and water harvesting 
was selected based on the national plans from both MASA and Ministry of Public Works, Housing and 
Water Resources (MOPHRH). Therefore, the infrastructure will be owned both by the communities and the 
relevant Government agencies and token amounts paid for their day to day operations. 

4.5.  Risk management  
The Project assumes (i) that the Government will continue with its commitment to social and political 
consensus and macroeconomic stability; (ii) Mozambique will have no restriction on water extraction for 



 

17 
 

irrigation; (iii) no restriction on private sector/NGO participation in water harvesting infrastructures and 
setting up of livestock. The current risks include the following:

4.6.  Knowledge building  

The AVACYEP will allocate resources to systematically document and publicize new lessons, especially 
on the adoption technologies for small ruminants and Youth Empowerment components that are less 
documented. The outcome of this project will be carefully monitored and documented. Furthermore, the 
Project will be financing number of studies in particular related to build a knowledge implementation of 
FEAST for monitoring inventory and uptake of feed resources; promotion of forage production and support 
to IIAM for conducting research on effective seed distribution system for forage seeds; introduction of hay 
bale making and ration formulation to young entrepreneurs; construction of multipurpose boreholes for 
water provision. All project related studies and research would be made readily available on the AfDB 
websites for wider dissemination. Finally, the third approach is to bring agro-processing to the farm level 
by farmer and women/youth groups, all of which will also be documented. Contracted service providers

sorting, drying, cutting and packing produced vegetable. The successes of these practices will also be 
documented.

APPENDIX IV: JUSTIFICATION FOR 100% PROJECTS’ COST FINANCING, 
INCLUDING VAT AND DUTIES 

 
The Government of Mozambique has submitted a request to the Bank Group to finance 100% 
of the projects’ costs, including VAT and duties, for projects approved in 2017 and 2018. This 
would bring the practice of the Bank in line with other development partners such as the World 
Bank and address some emerging project implementation issues.  
 
The Policy on expenditure eligible for Bank financing5 (2008) allows the Bank Group to waive 
the principle that its projects are exempt from duties and taxes on a case-by-case basis,  in cases 
where (para 4.2.1 of the mentioned policy): 
 
(i) The country’s tax system has a reasonable level of tax and duty rates; and (ii) the 
taxes and duties do not constitute a significant proportion of project costs or are not 
specifically directed at Bank-financed projects, activities or expenses 
 
This annex considers the justification to accede to this request on grounds of improved project 
implementation during a period of tight fiscal space and shrinking departmental budgets.  
 
The fiscal context. Mozambique is facing a difficult fiscal outlook, with the suspension of 
direct budget support by the donor group G-14 and the IMF financing programme going-off 
track in April, 2016. The suspension of these financing programmes were partly a consequence 
of the discovery of previously undisclosed commercial debt obligations, putting public debt on 
an unsustainable path and requiring fiscal consolidation of the public budget, as well as 
contributing to a weakening of the exchange rate.  
 
In January 2017 the country defaulted on part of its commercial debt service, which led to a 
downgrade of Mozambique’s credit rating to “selective default”, in turn affecting investment 
flows into the country. The default was on its commercial severing guaranteed loss, and the 
Government of Mozambique remains committed to honoring its financial obligations with 
DFIs.  
 
Moreover, delays in start-up of the natural-resources based mega-projects in Mozambique 
mean that expected revenues and signature bonuses are moved further out in the future. As seen 
in Table 1 below, income tax and VAT collection have steadily fallen between 2014 and 2016 
as a percentage of GDP.  
 
Policy response and implications. The Government undertook a gradual fiscal consolidation 
in 2016 and 2017, expected to continue into 2018, implementing expenditure cuts on targeted 
areas.  The investment budget fell by 7 percentage points of the GDP between2014 and 2016. 
Budget reductions means that there will be continued uncertainty over the quarterly budget 
transfers to sector ministries, including for compensating for foregone taxes and duties for 
projects funded by development partners. It is estimated that in August 2017 total public arrears 
to the private sector has surpassed USD 500 million. 
 

                                                 
5 BD/WP/2007/106/Rev.2 



 

VII 
 

Table IV-1: Mozambique’s budget position (figures in % of GDP). 

 
 
Bank-funded projects in Mozambique have already experiencing challenges relating to co-
financing of VAT and other expenses as well as with VAT reimbursement to private operators. 
At least 14 active Bank projects have reported arrears in payment of VAT from Government, 
causing significant delays in project implementation.  
 
Compliance with Bank policy requirements. The request for the Bank to cover tax end duties 
on project activities is consistent with the conditions laid out in the policy: 
 
1) Tax and duty rates in Mozambique are broadly in line with continental average. VAT rates, 

at 17% are slightly above the SADC average but broadly in line with similar economies in 
the continent (see table 2 below). 

Table IV-2: Comparative VAT rates 
Mozambique  17%  Tanzania 18% 
Ghana  17.5%  Kenya 16% 
Cote d’Ivoire 18.%  RSA 14% 
Zambia 16%  Namibia 15% 

 
Charging of taxes and duties are not specifically directed at Bank projects; in fact, the World 
Bank already covers these expenditures under its projects in Mozambique. The goal of the 
VACYEP is to contribute to rural poverty reduction by ensuring food, income and nutrition 
security in a sustainable manner, as well as capacity building for the affected communities. 
However, by nature it is not expected to generate short to medium term revenue gains for the 
Government. Therefore, it makes sense to ease its implementation by allowing it to cover VAT 
and duty costs over 2017 and 2018. The requested exception should be considered as a 
temporary measure to be applied only in 2017 and 2018, strictly on a case by case basis, to 
reflect the current macroeconomic and fiscal conjuncture and to support the Government in its 
re-engagement with International Financial Institutions and with creditors, while ensuring 
smooth project implementation.

APPENDIX VI: Justification for Youth Empowerment and TAAT 

1. Youth Empowerment  
 
The Youth Empowerment sub-component objects to contribute to job creation, food security, 
income generation and improved livelihoods for youth in both urban and rural areas.  The 
project intends to create business opportunities and decent employment for young women and 
men along priority agricultural value chains. The program also objects to establish incubation 
centers to promote entrepreneurship and agribusiness in order to create an appropriate and 
conducive environment for business development through advisor services and transfer of 
technologies to the beneficiaries of the program.  The project will: (i) rehabilitate and equip 
(including expert and staff selecting and training) of 2 incubator centers, (2) establish the 
incubator blueprint & business Plan (3) develop the incubator training program.  The project 
will also create a platform for establishing a risk-Sharing and Financing Mechanism”, (4)

that provides services and connect successful youth agripreneurs under this project.  

2. Transformative Technologies (TAAT) 
 
This project aims to increase the productivity and profitability of the small ruminants’ value 
chain in Mozambique, through the promotion and dissemination of proven technologies that 
can improve small livestock genetics, feed, health, production systems and marketing. 
Leveraging on the Bank’s network of partners, specifically ILRI and IIAM the project will 
identify existing scalable technologies for increased production and value addition of small 
ruminants.  

Small ruminants play important roles in arid and semi-arid areas of Africa. In the drier areas, 
extensive grazing of livestock herds/flocks including sheep and goats are the main source of 
livelihoods; in less dry areas where mixed crop-livestock farming is possible, they are an 
important source of cash income and high-quality nutrients for the household. Using the TAAT 
framework, this project will promote technologies for small ruminants which include: 
supporting the establishment of local production and effective use of thermostable vaccines; 
promotion and use of a suite of improved forage and feed options to improve the quantity, 
quality and year-round availability of forage and feed; establishment of community-based 
breeding programs for higher productivity of the resulting offspring, and; a private-sector 
driven approach to promote the uptake of sheep and goat fattening as a business whereby better 
feeding and management and improved market linkages enable higher offtake and greater 
profitability.
