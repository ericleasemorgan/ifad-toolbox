B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 

1. Liberia is a fragile and conflict-affected country with a high vulnerability to external shocks. Two civil wars 
between 1989 and 2003 destroyed the country’s economy, basic infrastructure, and institutional framework 
resulting in poor living conditions for most of the population. Following over twenty-five years of economic 
contraction, Liberia’s economy began to recover in 2004 with the 
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growing rate at an average annual 
rate of 7.4 percent from 2004-2013. However, the outbreak of the 
Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in 2014 and a sharp decline in global prices 
for two of the country’s main export commodities (iron ore and 
rubber) disrupted Liberia’s economic recovery, resulting in a 
stagnant real GDP growth in 2015. An incipient recovery began 
around 2017/18 but was short-lived and the GDP contracted again 
by 2.3 percent in 2019.  

2. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exerted increased pressure on 
the economy. Real GDP is expected to contract again by 2.9 percent 
in 2020. During the first half of 2020, output declined in multiple sectors of the economy, including cement 
(45 percent), gold (33 percent), rubber (19 percent), and services (12 percent), reflecting the restriction 
measures implemented to slow the progression of COVID-19 and the weak global environment. A general 
lockdown aimed at containing the spread of the virus was imposed on April 10, 2020 and lifted on July 22, 
2020. Inflationary pressures moderated to 13 percent in June 2020, compared to 29.9 percent in June 2019, 
due to lower fuel prices and tight macroeconomic policy. The depreciation of the Liberian dollar slowed to 
1.5 percent in June 2020 compared to 30.2 percent in June 2019, reflecting an improvement by US$21.1 
million in the trade deficit in Jan-June 2020 period. According to the Central Bank of Liberia (CBL), export 
receipts declined by 4.8 percent in January-June 2020 while the value of imports decreased by 7.4 percent. 
Fiscal policy was also tightened despite the COVID-19 pandemic with the fiscal deficit expected to be 
reduced to 3.7 percent in 2020, down from 6.1 percent in 2019. Nevertheless, the level of the public debt is 
expected to increase in 2020, reflecting mainly the economic contraction and the continued negative trade 
balance. 

3. Poverty remains widespread in Liberia. With a Gross National Income (GNI) per capita of just US$600 in 
2018, Liberia is among the ten poorest countries in the world. It also has high income inequality levels with 
an estimated Gini coefficient of 35.5 in 2016. From 2007 to 2014, Liberia’s per capita GDP growth rate

averaged 3.3 percent per year, which helped reduce the poverty rate1 from 68.6 percent in 2007 to 38.6 
percent in 2014. However, from 2014 through 2019 per capita GDP contracted causing the poverty rate to 
rise again to 43.4 percent by 2019. In addition, there are acute rural-urban and gender disparities (urban 
population constitutes around 54 percent), driven by unequal access to land and productive assets, 
infrastructure and public services, and markets for both goods and labor. Liberia ranks 176th out of 189 
countries in the 2019 United Nations Development Program (UNDP) Human Development Index. In the 2020 
Doing Business report, Liberia ranked 175th out of 190 economies on the overall ease of doing business2. In 
terms of gender equality, Liberia ranks 97th out 153 countries in the World Economic Forum’s gender 
equality index and 17th out of 34 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. 

4. Liberia’s development and poverty reduction programs are severely constrained by lack of road access. 
With only 750 km of paved roads, Liberia is below SSA average road density. The 2018 World Bank Logistics 
Performance Index ranked the country 143rd out of 160 countries.  Nearly 60 percent of rural Liberians lack 
access to an all-weather road, limiting their ability to participate in economic activities and access vital 
services such as health and education.  Regional trade accounts for only one percent of the total 
merchandise trade, in part because of the poor condition of the key regional corridor in Liberia’s, Trans-
African Highway Seven (TAH7).  Therefore, improving road access is imperative to promote national 
integration and economic growth.  Despite abundant arable land and a hospitable climate for agriculture, 
Liberia faces chronic food insecurity in part because lack of road access and underdeveloped agro-logistic 
services hinder agricultural productivity and depress farm incomes. 

 
Sectoral and Institutional Context 

 

5. Agriculture is the foundation of Liberia’s economy and the key to food security and poverty reduction. 
Agricultural production constitutes the most important livelihood for the average Liberian, involving more 
than 70 percent of the population. The sector accounted for 27.3 percent of real GDP in 2019 (a decline from 
38.8 percent in 2010) and 43.3 percent of total employment (down from 57.4 percent in 1995). Majority of 
farmers grow cereals/staples, including rice (64 percent) and cassava (60 percent), followed by a variety of 
vegetables, such as a peppers (50 percent), bitter balls (44 percent), okra and green leaves (30 percent). 
Most of these famers cultivate an average of 0.7 hectares under rain-fed conditions generating small 
marketable surpluses. Tree crops, especially rubber, oil palm, cocoa and coffee, make an important cash 
crops to smallholder farmers and contribute significantly to the economy. Rubber is the most important cash 
crop in Liberia and accounts for almost 65 percent of total export earnings3. But Liberia imports 50-60 
percent of its staple food requirements, making it vulnerable to global food price volatility.  
 

6. The Government of Liberia (GoL) considers agricultural growth to be critical for reducing poverty. The GoL 
has developed a five-year National Development Plan referred to as the Pro-Poor Agenda for Prosperity and 
Development (PAPD). As stated in the PAPD, the government recognizes the need for inclusive and 
sustainable economic diversification to achieve structural transformation and growth, the urgency of

(PPP) terms.

facilitating private sector participation in the economy, and the importance of the agri-food sector as an 
important engine of growth. It has also prioritized the agriculture sector in their commitment to diversify 
the economy and has identified eight priority value chains requiring support under the PAPD 2018–23. These 
include rice, oil palm, horticulture, cocoa, rubber, cassava, poultry, and pig husbandry. 
 

7. Liberia’s agriculture is characterized by a diversified structure of agriculture production. Forest-based and 
tree crop farming systems cover the largest proportion of the land area in Liberia. They include tree crop-
based systems in which vegetables and other food crops are produced on a minor scale, mostly in the central 
belt of the country; root crop-based systems (with cereals) concentrated in the northern region; and fishing 
and land-based mixed cropping enterprises along the coastal belt. The three main structures of production 
are: (i) large plantations that produce major export crops such as rubber, oil palm, and to a lesser, degree 
coffee and cocoa; (ii) domestically owned, medium-sized commercial farms that cultivate industrial crops 
for export and livestock for the local market; and (iii) small household farms that use traditional production 
techniques and limited improved inputs with relatively low levels of productivity and limited access to 
markets. 
 

8. Liberia’s agriculture is characterized by low productivity. The long-lasting conflicts in Liberia have destroyed 
agricultural capital and disrupted food production, further compounding structural impediments and past 
policy failures. Since the end of hostilities, food production has increased, but smallholder yields remain low; 
e.g., in lowland rice production systems, estimated average farm paddy yield is 1.7 tons per hectare, while 
on-farm research produces up to 5 tons per hectare using improved variety and good production practices4. 
Globally, average rice yields in recent years have been at 4.2 kg/ha for paddy rice. Food value chains are also 
undeveloped, and institutions that provide advisory and support services are weak. Despite Liberia’s large 
arable land, it has been estimated that at least 15 percent of the population was severely food insecure. 

 
9. Significant challenges are limiting increased agriculture productivity and value chains development in 

Liberia. These include: (i) limited access to improved inputs and modern practices;  (ii) limited extension 
services; apart from agricultural extension provided by non-governmental organization, government 
agricultural extension services are practically non-existent5; (iii) impaired market access due to limited 
network of roads and lack of compliance with evolving market demands; (iv) weak integration of value chains 
due to insufficient aggregation of agriculture production, and lack of storage, processing, and marketing 
channels; (v) non-existent sanitary and quality controls for agricultural products; and (vi) high levels of post-
harvest losses. In addition, extremely high cost of electricity impedes the development of functioning and 
cost-efficient cold chains, which constraints competitiveness of Liberian fresh exports. Liberia will require 
critical facilities for managing sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) requirements and support to private sector 
players to improve quality management through the adoption of (and certification in) good agricultural and 
agro-industrial practices Data collected for the Enabling Business in Agriculture 2019 Report (EBA) has 
identified significant weaknesses in all areas covered by the report, and Liberia’s performance is found to be 
below the regional average in most areas, most notably in use of quality seeds, application of fertilizers, 
secure use of water, using adequate machinery, application of plant protection measures, sustainable 


livestock management, and access to finance.  
 

10. Liberia’s Agricultural Sector Investment Plan (LASIP II).  According to LASIP II, covering the period 2018-
2022, the current strategic long-term vision for the agricultural sector is generally to promote an inclusive 
and sustainable agricultural transformation through catalytic investment in agricultural value chains and 
industrialization and resilience to ensure food and nutrition security, environmental health, job and wealth 
creation and inclusive growth. The challenges to this agricultural transformation are:  (i) weak private sector 
and entrepreneurial skill;  (ii) inefficient production systems;  (iii) weak policy and business environment;  
(iv)  significant human resource challenges;  (v) inadequate infrastructure; (vi) insufficient agricultural 
funding;  (vii) low productivity subsistence farming;  (viii) inadequate natural resource management; and 
(ix) very limited agricultural research and development programs constraining adoption of modern practices 
and resulting in stagnant productivity. 
 

11. Poor road infrastructure has significantly hindered the growth of the agricultural sector. Farmers’ ability 
to access valuable markets and improved inputs to increase production is limited by the poor quality of the 
country’s network of roads. During the May–September rainy season, movement from rural areas is 
significantly restrained due to heavy rainfall, especially in lowland swamp areas. As a result, smallholders 
tend to sell produce in local markets where prices are relatively lower. Despite the government’s current 
initiative to rehabilitate main roadways and some key feeder roads in productive areas, more work is needed 
to improve road and bridge infrastructure in remote rural areas. In recent years the GoL promoted a 
comprehensive road network to increase country’s competitiveness including road in southeastern Liberia 
and the development of a coastal road link joining the capital, Monrovia, with Harper, capital city of 
Maryland County.  
 

12. Small and medium-size farmers trying to establish linkages with buyers have limited ability to deliver the 
required quantity and quality of produce in a timely and consistent schedule. International experience 
shows that, even in the segment of emerging commercially-oriented farmers, it has been challenging for 
them to meet the demands and requirements of buyers, including supplying consistent quantities and 
quality of goods complying with sanitary and phytosanitary standards and delivered them on time. These 
small and medium-sized farmers are less capitalized than the larger individual commercial farmers or 
producing firms/corporations, have low technology adoption and limited access to information. They are 
also lacking the equipment, infrastructure, and farm management skills to diversify into new products and 
to become reliable suppliers to buyers and industry, in a modern market with increasing demands.  Also, the 
limited size and weaknesses of their organizations creates uncertainties for the prospective buyers and 
constraints the flow of information, thus reducing possibilities for gaining access to remunerative markets.  
 

13. Access to adequate financial services, necessary for supporting investments and increasing farm 
productivity and agribusiness competitiveness, are quite limited. The small number of financial institutions 
provide a limited array of products and services to the agri-food sector (credit extended to agricultural sector 
is estimated at 5.4 percent of total lending in the economy).  Financing for agriculture is mainly limited to 
export crops such as rubber and cocoa, for which foreign investors provide finance for plantation 
development and donor-supported projects channel small amounts of financing through financial 


institutions.  The main obstacles for small and medium size farmers, are:  (i) unsecure land tenure and limited 
availability of collateral due to absence of other forms of capital accepted as collateral (ii) low levels of 
financial literacy and credit background; (iii) common perception in the financial sector that agricultural is 
too risky and returns are uncertain; (iv) small farm size and low level of organization do not ensure adequate 
volume of supply with consistent quality; (v) limited experience by financial agencies in lending to the sector; 
(vi) financial intermediaries normally lend at short-term and are reluctant to lend for medium- and long-
term investments. 
 

14. Women are major players in the agriculture sector, although facing substantial gender inequalities. They 
comprise approximately 60 percent of the rural agricultural labor force and carry out 80 percent of 
agricultural activities throughout the planting season, including land clearing, planting, harvesting, and 
marketing. Although they play a dominant role in agricultural production, few women are able to own land, 
access loans, or control the income they earn from their labor. Moreover, women have less access to 
productive inputs than men, including skills training, basic tools, and technology. Women’s workloads are 
also increased during less productive periods, when many men migrate to seek work in mines, plantations, 
and urban areas, leaving women to care for their families and farms.  
 

15. Climate change and shifting cultivation are the most significant environmental threats in Liberia. Liberia’s 
susceptibility to negative climate impacts has significantly increased due to a combination of low agriculture 
productivity, climate vulnerability risks, population pressure and unsustainable natural resource 
management. According to data of the climate change vulnerability index, Liberia is among the top 20 most 
vulnerable countries in Africa. Major climate related changes including an average temperature rise (1-2 
degrees Celsius), modified rainfall patterns, and more frequent extreme weather events (such as flooding 
and drought) are predicted to occur over the next decades. These changes may result in heat stress, 
reduction of food crops and fodder crop production both in quality and quantity, and higher susceptibility 
to pests and diseases. Given the climate sensitivities of multiple engines of growth, agriculture, natural 
capital, and infrastructure, the urgency for Liberia to ramp up climate-smart development at scale and across 
the growth spectrum is an imperative. Moreover, due to the availability of land and forests, farmers tend to 
shift cultivation to new plots annually to increase production rather than implementing improved 
agricultural management techniques, which contributes to deforestation.  Low income populations struggle 
more than others to cope with and adapt to climate change and natural hazards, increasing their risk to fall 
deeper into poverty. 
 

16. GoL recognizes that transformation is required in the food and agriculture sector to maximize its 
contribution to economic growth and poverty reduction. Within the framework of its Pro-Poor Agenda for 
Prosperity and Development, the GoL is focusing on three fundamental issues: (i) improved national food 
and nutrition security with the objective to increase food availability and production in order to spur local 
economic development and food security; (ii) enhanced agricultural productivity, competitiveness, and 
linkages to markets; focusing on strengthening efficiency, promoting innovation, fostering sustainability, 
and leveraging opportunities in national and external markets; broadening and strengthen private sector 
participation; increasing public investments (mainly in rural infrastructure); and creating an enabling 
macroeconomic environment; and (iii) strengthened human and institutional capacities with the thrust to 


establish effective and efficient public sector frameworks in agricultural planning and coordination; reduce 
risks and improve coping mechanisms; mainstream gender and youth in agriculture and rural development 
and ensure sustainable use of natural resources. 
 

17. The proposed Rural Economic Transformation Project (RETRAP) supports the GoL Pro-Poor Agenda for 
Prosperity and Development and the MoA three-year strategy plan for the Agriculture sector with a focus 
on: (i) institutional development and the promotion of inclusive and competitive value chains (cassava, 
rubber, poultry, and piggery). It also supports the GoL achieve its commitments under the Comprehensive 
African Agricultural Development Program (CAADP), which commits the country’s government to investing 
more in the agriculture sector. 

 
Relationship to CPF 

 

18. Country Partnership Framework (CPF) Pillars.  The proposed Project is in consonant with the three pillars 
of the CPF (FY19-FY24) for Liberia, including (i) strengthening institutions and creating an enabling 
environment for inclusive and sustainable growth; (ii) building human capital to seize new economic 
opportunities; and (iii) narrowing the infrastructure gap to foster more equitable nationwide development. 
It is also contributing to achieving the country’s UN Sustainable Development Goals, in particular Goal 1 (End 
poverty in all its forms everywhere), Goal 2 (End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and 
promote sustainable agriculture); Goal 9 (Develop quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure, 
including regional and trans-border infrastructure, to support economic development and human well-
being, with a focus on affordable and equitable access for all); and Goal 13 (Take urgent action to combat 
climate change and its impact: by enhancing productivity that implies the efficient use of inputs, including 
water and land; enhancing awareness and promoting climate smart agriculture measures).  
 

19. The proposed project supports IDA19 policy priorities (Gender, Climate, Governance, Jobs, FCV). The 
project will support the following key agendas: (i) Economic transformation and job creation: by supporting 
sustained increases in agricultural productivity and a shift to commercial enterprises, the strengthening of 
efficient value chains and the development of a thriving rural economy which will in turn create quality 
employment in upstream and downstream activities servicing agriculture; (ii) resilience building and food 
security: by enhancing resilience of domestic agricultural production systems through the promotion of 
climate smart technologies6; and (iv) Gender inclusion: by helping removing the constraints in access and 
ownership of productive resources faced by women as well as support their access to information, financial 
services and technologies (for production, processing and marketing).  

 
 
C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  

 
The project development objective (PDO) is to improve agriculture productivity and access to markets for selected  
value chains in the Project targeted areas. 

 
6 The project will also contribute to the WBG’s Africa Climate Change Business Plan and to reaching CIV’s climate change mitigation and adaptation targets articulated 
in the Intended National Determined Contribution (INDC).

D. Concept Description 

 

21. The project addresses important challenges to developing agri-food value chains in Liberia. 
These include:  (i) weak capacity of support institutions for delivery of agribusiness services; (ii) poor 
organization of smallholder farmers; (ii) low agriculture productivity due to limited access to 
improved technologies, modern inputs, and advisory services; (iii) weak access to markets due to 
inadequate post-harvest, transport, and marketing infrastructure; and (iv) limited private sector 
investment in production, processing capacity and value-added activities.  To address these 
challenges, the project will contribute to creating long-term economic opportunities for value chain 
actors by applying a three-fold approach: (i) strengthen critical institutions overseeing the 
development of the sector; (ii) intervene at various level of the supply chain via capacity building 
and investment subprojects focused on improving agriculture productivity and resilience of the food 
system to climate change, thus enhancing market access; and (iii) improvement of rural access and 
agricultural marketing through the upgrading of roads, construction of short-span critical cross-
drainage structures, and improvement of agro-logistics centers.  
 

22. Targeted priority value chains. Cassava, rubber, poultry, piggery and vegetable value chains where 
selected for Project support.  These value chains will complement the value chains which are already 
supported under the World Bank-funded Smallholder Agriculture Transformation and Agribusiness 
Revitalization Project (STAR-P – P160945): rice, oil palm, and horticulture. The selection was based on two 
sector scans7, 8  which assessed a range of development impact criteria; including: (i) evidence-based 
market demand for selected commodities; (ii) high growth potential, demonstrated by positive 
growth trends of the value chains, scope for expanding production and increasing sales, and scope 
for value addition through processing; (iii) potential for poverty reduction9; and (iv) project-related 
aspects, including existing infrastructure and complementarities with other projects in the country.

9 Potential for poverty reduction is based on locally available raw materials and skills, new job opportunities created, low entry barriers for small-scale 

entrepreneurs, and prospects for women and youth. 



Vegetables production (home gardens) will also be supported because of its importance in 
generating incomes for women and for nutrition diversification at the household level (See Annex 1 for 
further details). 
 

23. Geographical focus and phased approach. The Project is expected to operate in 10 out of the 15 Counties 
of Liberia (see Annex 2): (i) Group 1: covering the Bong, Lofa, Nimba, Grand Bassa, Bomi, Grand Cape Mount, 
Grand Gedeh and Maryland counties, which offer comparative advantage for the production of cassava; (ii) 
Group 2: covering the Counties of Montserrado, Nimba, Bong, Margibi, Bomi, Sinoe and Maryland counties, 
with advantages for rubber production;  (iii) Group 3:  covering the Regions of Grand Cape Mount, Bomi, 
Montserrado, Bong and Margibi for poultry/piggery production.  The Project would give priority to counties 
where farmers organizations already exist, and where there are market opportunities (processing factories, 
close to urban areas, border-outlets, etc.), before moving to counties without any existing farmers 
organizations. The final selection of the project’s intervention location for the selected value chains will be 
determined during project preparation in consultation with key value chain stakeholders.  
 

24. The project builds on the design features of the Smallholder Agriculture Transformation and Agribusiness 
Revitalization Project (STAR-P, P160945). The proposed project builds on the experience gained under the 
STAR-P Project, expanding the “Productive Alliance” approach to promote new selected value chains. This 
approach support producer organizations by bringing together: (i) a group of  farmers producing a particular 
product; (ii) one or more (potential) buyers for that product; and (iii) other partners involved along the value 
chain providing services or undertaking some processing required by the final buyer/s (e.g., aggregation, 
handling, storage, processing). These entities, or participating members of the “alliance” are connected 
through a business proposition, or “business plan”, which assesses the capital and service needs of the 
producer association, and proposes improvements that would allow them to upgrade their production 
capacities and skills to strengthen their linkage with the markets.  The public sector is normally engaged in 
providing an enabling environment and, in many occasions, supporting the participating member preparing 
investment proposals, as well as providing adequate financing for implementing the proposal. Global 
experience has shown that the approach help solving multiple constraints by providing integrated solutions 
adapted to local conditions and explores the existence of significant motivations perceived by partners in 
the alliance and significantly contributes to increasing stability in prices, assured sales, as well as 
improvements in product quality and, hence, have resulted in increased revenues.   
 

25. In addressing identified value chain constraints and in partnership with IFC, the Project will include a 
spectrum of actions for Maximizing Finance for Development (MFD). These actions, to be further 
developed during preparation, may include: (i) increasing the space for private sector activity; (ii) improving 
the policy and regulatory environment; for instance through establishing partnerships between operators 
within the value chains, and improving farmers – buyers contractual arrangements; (ii) facilitating access to 
finance for agribusiness development (provision of matching grants) and supporting agri-entrepreneurs to 
develop “bankable” and viable business plans;  (iii) supporting essential public goods and services such as 
strengthening human capital, agricultural research/extension services, and public infrastructure (roads and 
market information) contributing to enhance market access; and (iv) technical assistance to financial 
institutions to strengthen their capacity for diversifying their financial products and expanding their 
outreach, as well as to address the lack of financial literacy in the group of potential beneficiaries.  

 
26. Scaling-up and disseminate innovative agricultural technologies:  Farmers’ access to localized, relevant and 

timely information on crop management and market intelligence is critical to achieve project objective. In 
this context, mobile-based rural advisory services (RAS), has potential to drive greater productivity gains 
than traditional methods of extension and reduce information asymmetry on market prices etc. The project 
will identify and assess existing examples10 of relevant modern and innovative solutions implemented in the 
country and provide financial support to customize such products for the project-supported producer 
organizations.  

 
27. The Project will also focus on other cross-cutting priorities.  These are; especially: (i) taking gender issues 

and empowerment of vulnerable groups (women and youth) into account in the context of broad  social 
safeguards measures (ii) promoting mitigation and adaptation to climate change and adherence to 
environmental sound actions as well as giving priority to climate smart technologies enhancing resilience; 
and (iii) promoting inclusion of products for improving nutrition at household level; and (iv) giving priority 
to adoption of technologies reducing GHG emissions. The project will set targets for participation by women 
and youth and will prioritize subprojects that have the potential to generate full-time rural employment 
opportunities. When selecting subprojects for investment, the project will mainstream resilient and low 
carbon activities to help address agricultural vulnerability and reduce agricultural emissions of greenhouse 
gases (GHGs). The project will also promote climate-smart agriculture (CSA) approaches as well as best 
practices and technologies for water resource management to improve climate resilience. With regards to 
nutrition, the project will promote home gardening and simultaneously support the dissemination of 
information on sound nutritional practices among beneficiaries, particularly for women and children.  

 
 

1. Description 
 
Project Components 

 

28. Component 1: Improving the enabling environment, enhancing support services for agribusiness 
development and strengthening producer organizations (IDA US$3.5 million). The objective of Component 
1 is to improve the enabling policy and regulatory environment necessary for private businesses to increase 
investment and commercial activities and enhancing delivery of quality support services that can foster an 
inclusive and competitive development of this sector. The project will invest in development and 
maintenance of an Integrated Agriculture Business Information and Intelligence Information System (IABIIS) 
to improve service delivery capabilities of MoA.  At the same time, the project will be supporting farmers in 
the formation of producer organizations (in areas where they are not present and assessed as feasible), as 
well as in developing their skills in technical, administrative/managerial and marketing activities. The

and non-consulting services, and operational expenses, as detailed below.  
 

30. Subcomponent 1.1: Improving public agribusiness services. This intervention aims at enhancing the 
capacity of selected public services that are critical for enabling agribusiness; principally, Ministry of 
Agriculture (MoA), Cooperative Development Agency (CDA), Central Agricultural Research Institute (CARI), 
Soil and Crop laboratory, and the National Standard Laboratory (NSL, with national responsibility for testing 
food quality). The project will undertake a functional review of these entities and recommend solutions for 
improving the quality of their services. The focus will be on strategies and solutions for enhanced growth 
and entrepreneurship in the agribusiness sector; formulating interactive and demand driven knowledge, 
innovation and extension system with a focus on climate-smart technologies; promotion of investments in 
the sector (encouraging women and youth entrepreneurship); enhanced governance and partnerships 
across the value chains, and management of agribusiness development programs/projects. In principle, it 
will also support MoA to operationalize the sector’s approved acts on seeds, food safety, pesticide, fertilizer 
and the national rice development strategy, updating and enforcement of standards in the agriculture 
sector; this will include the provision of technical assistance, training, and equipment; and (ii) establishing 
an agriculture database to support monitoring, research, policy-making and allocation of resources by 
counties. The system shall ensure that farmers, allied institutions of MoA (such as CARI, NSL) and private 
sector partners have a shared platform for data access, knowledge sharing and to avail advisory/financial 
benefits. The component will finance system design and maintenance, purchase of IT infrastructure, on-
boarding of competent human resources and requisite IT service providers.  
 

31. Subcomponent 1.2: Enhancing value chain coordination and public-private dialogue-(PPD). The Project 
will: (i) conduct a stakeholder mapping exercise as the basis to put in place a representative and inclusive 
Private Public Dialogue (PPD) mechanism; (ii) support the establishment and operation of this mechanism, 
including training of main stakeholders on its effective use to improve the performance of targeted value 
chains; and (iii) support increased consultations among the value chain stakeholders (especially women), 
through  regular forums to discuss the various constraints of the sector, review and update the government 
sector strategy, develop a shared vision and harmonized approach to minimize potential conflict, 
mainstream climate change in the programs, devise mechanisms for coordinating donor assistance and 
creating an enabling environment for private and public investments. It will also support establishing an 
Agribusiness Growth Delivery Unit (AGDU) as an agribusiness strategy incubator and strategic advisory arm 
of MoA.  
 

32. Subcomponent 1.3:  Strengthening Producer Organizations.  This subcomponent will address the need to 
enhance capacities of targeted Farmers-Based Organizations (FBOs) to be able to address critical limiting 
factors to facilitate effective access to markets and sustainable integration with formal and lucrative value 
chains and providing support for taking advantage of investment opportunities. It will comprise financing of 
technical assistance, training and capacity building of beneficiaries and their organizations, as well as 
services for facilitating complementary services (financial, specialized technical assistance, inputs, 
certification services, etc.).  Assistance will cover assistance to establish new organizations in areas where 
they are absent (but it is feasible and there are clear competitive advantages) and legal assistance to their 
formal registration. 
 

33. Component 2: Enhancing Competitiveness and Market Access through Productive Alliances (IDA US$15 
million). The objective of this component is to promote the development of organizations of small and 
medium-sized agricultural producers participating in “productive alliances” with selected partners with the 
aim to be able to operate competitively in selected value chains, with strengthened and more reliable 
linkages with buyers and markets and increased capacity to manage climate risks. The basic approach is to 
promote investments and collective actions, with the aim of gaining economies of scale, enhancing 
bargaining power, facilitating knowledge sharing, and reducing costs of production and service delivery.  The 
activities included in these subprojects could comprise eligible works, goods, and services required by 
different partners participating in the subproject to achieve measurable targets in terms of product/service 
specifications (such as quality, quantity, and delivery conditions) agreed with their respective prospective 
buyer or customers, within the framework of a joint business plan. 
 

34. Subcomponent 2.1:  Pre-Investment Activities.  This subcomponent will support pre-investment activities 
to: (i) promote the project concept and increase outreach to potential FBO beneficiaries, commercial 
partners, and private financing entities, as well as identify productive alliances among FBOs and commercial 
partners; (ii) identify potential business opportunities on the part of the productive alliance; (iii) prepare 
business plans and proposals for Investment Subprojects reflecting the identified opportunity; (iv) build 
capacity among technical service providers to enhance the quality of the services provided to the productive 
alliances;  (v) support project-related studies to promote specific, prioritized value chains and evaluate the 
potential for business plan investments to contribute to climate change mitigation and resilience and to the 
economic inclusion of otherwise marginalized groups.  These investment initiatives (Subproject proposals) 
will be demand-driven and with clearly demonstrated benefits.  Facilitators and Community Development 
Officers (CDOs) will be engaged for a maximum of 2 years of the project period to facilitate the preparation 
of Subproject proposals for farmers’ groups and their participating partners. Capacity building will be 
provided for Facilitators, Services Providers, Farmers Groups and other Producer Associations. 
 

35. Subcomponent 2.2:  Investment Subprojects Supporting Productive Alliances.  This subcomponent will 
provide technical and financial support (matching grants) for the implementation of technically feasible, 
financially viable, economically profitable, socially responsible, climate resilient and environmentally 
sustainable investment Subprojects, which will help producing a consistent and timely supply of quality 
produce to buyers, while helping to provide a reliable income to allied producers organizations and their 
partners participating in the “alliance”. The implementation of these investment subprojects will make 
possible sustainable increases in productivity and improvements in quality of the products offered in 
accordance to market demands.  The Subprojects will be prepared in a participatory fashion with support 
by the Project together with the potential beneficiaries (farmer organizations and their allied partners, such 
as aggregators, processors, technical service providers, lenders, etc.).  Sub-projects with a clear impact on 
agricultural production resilience, using climate-smart technologies e.g. zero tillage, the use of soil and water 
conservation techniques such as tied-ridging, and of integrated soil fertility management options such as 
composting, and efficient use of mineral fertilizers would be particularly targeted and prioritized. 


 
36. Eligible expenditure under these Subprojects include: (i) civil works (for example, lowland rehabilitation; 

clearing of bushland; construction of post-harvest, storage, and processing facilities; and small-scale, 
efficient irrigation systems); (ii) goods, such as productive equipment (for example, farm machinery, 
processing equipment, storage units, and transport vehicles); (iii) incremental working capital (for example, 
for improved inputs); (iv) technical assistance and business advisory services supporting the implementation 
of the subprojects and enhancing organizations’ administrative and managerial capacities.  Investment 
proposals by farmers’ organizations and agribusinesses that integrate climate-smart approaches throughout 
the value chain, such as intercropping and conservation agriculture (which will increase crop diversification); 
use of climate-resilient seeds and varieties; methods to retain soil nutrients and prevent soil erosion; 
improved water management for extreme warm weather; flood-resilient design of production; and efficient 
pest and disease management; alternative sources of energy;  water and wastage re-use systems, saving 
energy of implementing mitigating approaches reduce GHG emissions, will receive priority and may qualify 
for additional bonus financing. 

 
37. These Investment Subprojects will qualify for receiving matching grant through three dedicated windows to 

support the development of value chains in selected commodities and supporting different types of 
beneficiaries, but all integrated into a single Subproject.  The matching grant from the Project will cover a 
part of the overall cost of implementing the Subproject, making necessary for the beneficiaries to come up 
with their counterpart contribution (in cash).  The level of required counterpart financing will depend on the 
type of beneficiary and the amount of the investment to be undertaken (ranges will be fully determined 
during preparation and included in detail in the Project Operational Manual).  These windows are: 

 
(a)  Window A, which will support to smallholder farmers organizations, targeting organized smallholder 

farmers organizations that are eligible to receive matching grant funds as co-financing.  In areas where 
the targeted beneficiaries are not organized, jointly with the Ministry of Agriculture, other government 
agencies and NGOs active in project areas, the project will support the formation of producer and agro-
based organizations.  The main beneficiaries of this window are small producers and other organized 
vulnerable groups, such as women entrepreneurs and women-led producer organizations and youth, 
who will be encouraged to participate through a targeted information campaign. 

(b) Window B, supporting commercially oriented farmers that are also service providers.  This window will 
contribute directly to boost agricultural production that will ensure there is a reliable supply of produce 
along the supply chain.  Priority will be given to those commercially oriented farmers that (a) work with 
smallholder farmers by transferring new technologies and provision of technical assistance; (b) adapt 
technologies that address binding constraints and risks in agriculture, such as climate change; (c) create 
formal partnership with value chains to ensure access to markets and research organizations to ensure 
the transfer of new technologies; (d) create jobs; and (e) contribute to food security.   In cases where it 
is not possible to work with organized farmers, these larger commercially-oriented farmer or service 
providers may be the vehicle to channel funding for investments to be made at the producing level, as 
well as to channel the technical assistance and the improved inputs. 

(c) Window C, supporting all other partners or participating members of an alliance (integrated in a single 
Subproject), such as private business and enterprises providing any aggregation, processing or service 
that is essential to the success of the Subproject according to the demands of the buyer/s and, at the 
same time, requiring a new investment to adapt its operations in order to comply with the buyer/s 
demands. 
 

38. Component 3: Agro-logistics and Infrastructure Investments (IDA US$31.5 million). The objective of this 
component is to improve access to markets through the rehabilitation of existing roads, construction of 
short-span critical cross-drainage structures, and improvement of agro-logistics centers. Expected outcomes 
from such investments are improved quality of products and reduced post-harvest losses, reduced 
marketing costs and better connection between producers and buyers, and improved competitiveness of 
the domestic production in supplying of food products to major consumption centers and export points. 

 
39. Subcomponent 3.1: Roads.  Complementing the planned road works works financed as part of  the South 

Eastern Corridor Road Asset Management Project (SECRAMP; P149279) under which a total of 100km length 
of road between Ganta and Tappita is to be rehabilitated, the Project will support the rehabilitation of 40 
km section of the 112 km long Tappita - Zwedru road11. The project will use Output- and Performance-Based 
Road Contracts (OPRC) under Design, Build and Transfer (DBT) methodology and will also finance the 
associated consultant services.  According to a conceptual design carried out, the proposed design includes 
a full construction of the road to a two-lane carriageway with bituminous surfacing along the existing right-
of-way, with a 20-year design life.  The conceptual design study anticipates reduced vehicle operating costs 
and reliable year-round access resulting in significant increases in additional traffic generated. As part of the 
road design, the project will also incentivize contractors to choose materials and implement processes that 
generate less emissions, adopt engineering and structural measures and bioengineering involving the use of 
vegetation either alone or in conjunction with other civil engineering structures. Once rehabilitated, it is 
expected that the road will play a key role in improving market access for farmers, businesses, traders and 
agro-processors and transport service companies and unlocking the agricultural potential of the entire 
south-eastern region. 
 

40. Subcomponent 3.2: Agro-logistics.  With regards agro-logistics interventions, the project will facilitate the 
preparation of a national agro-logistics program to outline the policy framework and identify the main 
infrastructure networks required to enable proper transport and distribution of agricultural/agro-industrial 
products. It will also finance investments including: (i) construction of a number of open market sheds and 
small storage facilities; (ii) construction of selected infrastructure that require specialized handling agri-
produce; and (iii) construction of market internal path-ways, drainage infrastructure, toilets and clean water 
facilities. The infrastructure to be rehabilitated or established under the Project would incorporate design 
standards ensuring their resilience to the main local risk factors (geophysical conditions and climate change) 
and their potential for climate co-benefits (e.g. improved energy efficiency, use of renewable energy, etc.). 
Detailed locations of these infrastructures and their operation and management would be identified and 
discussed during project preparation. 

 

 
11 Currently, the Ganta -Tappita stretch, almost halfway to Zwedru, is under financing from from GoL, World Bank and Liberia Reconstruction Trust 
Fund (LRTF) sources (Ganta-Saglepie, 39km financed by GOL, and Saglepie-Tappita, 61km financed by WB/LRTF) under the South Eastern Corridor 
Road Asset Management Project (SECRAMP).  The AfDB is also financing the paving of the stretch from Zwedru to the Ivorian Border in the South. A 
gap of about 85km is still under discussion for financing by donors in the next round of allocations. 

41. Component 4: Project coordination and Management (IDA US$5 million). The aim of this component is 
twofold: (i) ensuring that GoL is better equipped to respond to crises and emergencies; and (ii) establishing 
appropriate coordination, Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E), and communication regarding Project 
implementation. The Project will finance the creation and operation of a National Coordination Office (NCO) 
within MoA, through provision of appropriate staffing and operating resources. The NCO will be responsible 
for: (i) ensuring effective planning, implementation and monitoring of the Project activities; (ii) fiduciary 
management and environmental and social safeguard compliance; (iii) effective coordination with 
participating stakeholders and partners; (iii) evaluating the Project’s final results, outcomes, and impacts on 
value chain actors; and (iv) ensuring efficient knowledge management and effective communication on 
project activities. 
 

42. Component 5: Contingency Emergency Response Component – CERC (IDA: US$0.0 million). The objective 
of this component is to provide immediate response to an Eligible Crisis or Emergency, as may be presented 
in the future. The CERC is one of the Bank’s contingent financing mechanisms available to Borrowers to gain 
rapid access to Bank financing to respond to a crisis or emergency. It is included as a Project component that 
is designed to provide swift response in the event of an eligible crisis or emergency, defined as “an event 
that has caused, or is likely to imminently cause, a major adverse economic and/or social impact associated 
with natural or man-made crises or disasters.” The mechanism for the triggering of the CERC will be included 
in the Credit Agreement, which will require (inter-alia), the preparation of a CERC Manual detailing the 
applicable fiduciary, environmental and social, monitoring, reporting, and any other implementation 
arrangements necessary.  Provided the World Bank Group agrees with the emergency assessment, this 
component would allow the government to request the World Bank to reallocate uncommitted resources 
from other project components to this component in order to cover emergency response and recovery costs 
or, eventually, to channel additional financing that may become available because of the emergency.

Summary of Screening of Environmental and Social Risks and Impacts 
.  
 
 
 

Environmental Risk Rating 
 
The environmental risk rating for the proposed project is substantial. The classification is based on the potential 
environmental risks and impacts, the sensitivity of the recipient environment and the capacity of the implementing 
agencies to manage the risks. The project’s adverse environmental risks and impacts will mainly emanate from 
interventions under Components 2 and 3. The Matching Grant (MG) scheme under Component 2 might trigger 
agricultural commercialization, expansion of farmlands, expansion and/or renovation of agricultural infrastructure such 


as warehouses, processing facilities, electricity connectivity etc. Land clearing associated with farming and provision of 
infrastructure could contribute to deforestation, forest degradation, destruction of natural habitats, soil erosion and 
depletion of biodiversity. Agricultural intensification could trigger extensive use of pesticides with adverse repercussions 
on human health and biodiversity. The proposed support to poultry and piggery industry will produce animal waste 
(manure) which could contaminate ground and surface water as well as contribute to green-house gas emissions if 
poorly managed. Similarly, effluents from processing facilities e.g. cassava processing under the MG scheme could 
contribute to water contamination, eutrophication and unsightly scenes in communities. The risks associated with 
surface water contamination from pesticides and effluents from processing facilities could transcend communities and 
may have far reaching consequences, if not properly managed. These potential risks will be further assessed along with 
appropriate mitigation measures in the Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) to be prepared for 
the project prior to appraisal. The proposed road improvement of 40 km under Component 3 might result in 
environmental, occupational, and community health and safety risks. The risks and impacts will generally range from 
minor to substantial but mainly localized. The Ministry of Agriculture will implement the project in collaboration with 
other ministries. Environmental safeguard capacity varies among ministries with no experience in the implementation of 
the ESS.  
 
Social Risk Rating 
 
The social risk rating for the proposed project is substantial. The classification is based on the potential project social risks 
and impacts, the country context social sensitivity issues and the capacity of the implementing agencies to manage the 
risks. The project social risks include risk of conflicts within communities, agribusiness service providers and project if 
selection of beneficiaries is not transparent. Risk of exclusion of poor households and vulnerable groups and elite capture 
of project benefits (e.g. the Matching Grants, provision of farm inputs, access to information on crop management and 
market intelligence), poses substantial risk. Similarly, risks and impacts associated with temporary and permanent land 
acquisition for rural agribusiness infrastructure (e.g. warehousing, processing facilities etc.) and road rehabilitation are 
anticipated. In particular, economic or physical displacement is anticipated under the proposed rehabilitation of a 40km 
section of the 112km long Tappita - Zwedru Road. Other social risks include potential legacy issues related to impacts of 
previous road construction activities on Project Affected People (PAP) and communities along the proposed road corridor 
to be rehabilitated. While use of local labor is anticipated, use of migrant workers and risk of use of child labor and/ or 
forced labor cannot be ignored. The risk of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse and Sexual Harassments (SEA/SH) is possible 
given the country context and social sensitivity issues and focus of project interventions in rural areas with possibility of 
men and women working in unsupervised conditions. Risks of spread of communicable diseases including spread of 
COVID-19 are anticipated given the project interventions will be implemented in counties where potential for spread of 
infectious diseases cannot be ignored.

B. Introduction and Context 

 
Country Context 

 
1. Violent conflict, now in its seventh year, has crippled Yemen’s economy and created an 
unprecedented humanitarian crisis. Oil exports, the main source of government revenue and foreign 
exchange, came to a virtual halt in 2015 due to repeated sabotage of vital infrastructure and increased 
insecurity. The resulting wide-scale suspension of basic public services and civil service salary payments, 
rapid currency depreciation, and shortages of imported goods weakened the non-hydrocarbon sector and 
left many Yemenis without a regular income. More than 50 percent of Yemenis between the ages of 18 
and 24 were unemployed in 2017 (United Nations Development Program 2017). A liquidity crisis hit the 
country in mid- to late-2018 with the local currency depreciating significantly and food prices rising, 
making food virtually unaffordable to many households. External assistance financed imports of food and 
other necessities and helped stabilize the economy in 2019 but was largely depleted by early 2020 and 
foreign reserves were not replenished. Some respite was provided through IMF financing in late spring 
and summer of 2020.  
 
2. The macroeconomic policy environment differs spatially due to the bifurcation of 
administration between areas of control. In the areas controlled by the internationally recognized

government (IRG), significant revenue underperformance and continued monetization of the fiscal deficit 
have undermined macroeconomic stability. Oil prices remain low, eroding the government’s hydrocarbon 
revenue. Non-oil economic activity has suffered significantly from COVID-19 related trade slowdown, 
desert locust outbreaks and exceptionally heavy rainfalls, which have caused intense flooding, 
infrastructure damage and human casualties in 2020. The severe revenue shortfall has led to expenditure 
compression. Since early 2020, salary payments to public sector workers have seen frequent delays. 
Payables to suppliers (mostly to energy suppliers) have continued building up, disrupting fuel imports and 
electricity supply. The complete ban on using new banknotes since December 2019[1] has resulted in two 
exchange rates, complicating trade and financial flows across Yemen. The DFA’s fiscal policy operates 
under a cash-constrained budget. The collection of corporate profit and sales taxes and customs revenue, 
the three largest revenue sources, was affected negatively by COVID-19 related trade slowdown and 
movement restrictions, and administrative disruption caused by flooding. In 2020, the DFA disbursed half-
month salaries to public sector workers under its controlled areas every other month 1. 
 
3. Over 24 million people (or 83 percent of the total estimated population) are food insecure2, 
including a staggering 16.2 million people in IPC Phase 3+ requiring urgent emergency assistance. Food 
insecurity in Yemen is driven by constrained food production, supply and distribution and households’ 
diminishing purchasing power. An estimated 4.3 million people have fled their homes since the start of 
the conflict, and 3.3 million remain internally displaced. Hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition are 
among the most pressing and overwhelming challenges Yemen now faces, at a scale that is not being fully 
met by national authorities and the international development and humanitarian communities. Low food 
access has resulted from a combination a high household dependence on food imports, high food prices 
and significantly reduced household income. It is estimated that Yemen imported 8 percent less wheat 
per month between January and May 2020 than during the same period in 2019 due to limited funds, 
which is an insufficient imported amount of wheat to meet the 2020 consumption requirement.  
 
4. Socio-economic conditions deteriorated further in 2020, significantly worsening poverty. 
Distortions created by the fragmented institutional capacity and the divergent policy decisions between 
the areas of control have compounded the economic and humanitarian crisis. This dramatic deterioration 
of conditions in Yemen means that an estimated 80 percent of the population (around 24 million) were 
living below the poverty line even before COVID-19 pandemic crisis (World Bank 2019). The likely result 
based on anecdotal evidence is a contraction of the economy from an already low base in 2020. In addition 
to monetary poverty, it is estimated that up to 80 percent of households experience overlapping monetary 
and non-monetary deprivations (World Food Program 2020). 
 
5. Multiple indices point towards a significant gender gap, with Yemeni women having a lower 
standard of living than men, and less access to education, health, productive employment and food 
security than men (World Bank 2014). The Gender Inequality Index (GII) measures Yemen’s GII value as 
0.8343 vs. the world’s average at 0.439.  Yemen ranks 153 out of 153 countries, meaning Yemen has the 
most massive gender gap in the world, in the 2020 Global Gender Gap Report4 by the World Economic

Forum. International Labor Organization (ILO)- modeled estimates5 suggest that 46 percent of women 
work in agriculture (versus only 27 percent of men). Yet far fewer women participate in the labor market 
and in productive employment, with only 6 percent of women participating in the labor force compared 
to 72 percent of men. One out of four women in the labor market are unemployed (24 percent) compared 
to 12 percent of men. Vulnerable employment is high for all but especially for women; 68 percent of 
women fall in this category compared to 44 percent of men. Income inequality is stark: for every dollar a 
man makes in Yemen, a woman is estimated to make only thirty cents6. In 2011, the adult literacy rate 
was 80 percent for men and 45 percent for women, but among youth aged 15-24, these rates were 96 
and 72, respectively7 8. Finally, while men face a higher direct burden of war through fighting and battle 
deaths, women are disproportionately affected by the indirect and often lasting effects of conflict (World 
Development Report 2011, Buvinic et al. 2012, Justino 2018) that exacerbate existing gender-based 
deprivations and development shortfalls. 
 
6. Economic and social prospects for 2021 and beyond are highly uncertain. With the ongoing 
difficult political and security situation, socio-economic conditions will remain difficult. Urgent progress 
to address the current restrictions of access to supplies and fuel imports would improve public service 
provision and the operational environment for humanitarian operations. Ceasing hostilities and eventual 
political reconciliation, including the return of unitary macroeconomic policy implementation, are 
prerequisites for reconstructing the economy and rebuilding social fabric. 

 
Sectoral and Institutional Context 

 
7. Yemen’s agriculture supplies around 15 – 20 percent of its food needs due to limited agricultural 
land and water resources and poor agricultural practices. However, agriculture—including fisheries and 
livestock—is the backbone of Yemeni livelihoods and the most important non-oil sector of the economy, 
even as its contribution to gross domestic product (GDP) has decreased during this period of severe 
economic disruption. Agriculture’s share of GDP contracted from 10.3 percent in 2010 to 4.03 percent in 
20189. Agricultural land is less than three percent (3 percent) of Yemen’s land area (FAOSTAT) and supplies 
around 15 - 20 percent of its needs for food. The principal agricultural systems are in the rainfed highlands 
characterized by terraced agriculture for coffee, fruits, grains and qat10 and extensive livestock (meat) 
production. Horticulture and field crops predominate in the plains, using groundwater for irrigation. 
Groundwater resources are very limited, fossil and non-renewable, and agriculture accounts for up to 90 
percent of groundwater use. The current annual renewable freshwater resources in Yemen are estimated 
at 80 m3 per capita versus an 8,900 m3 per capita global average. Yemen therefore falls well below the 
absolute scarcity threshold of 500 m3 per capita11. Up to 85 percent of food consumed is imported, mostly 
staples, such as wheat, rice, oil, sugar and milk. Yemen has self-sufficiency in some cereals (sorghum, 
millet, and barley), while 90 percent of wheat is imported. The agricultural sector accounts for a large 
portion of non-oil domestic exports and supports livelihoods through agricultural and livestock 
production. Over three thirds of Yemenis depend on agriculture for their livelihoods.

8. Agriculture is very important for job creation and food security, especially for women, yet 
women have less access to agricultural assets and higher food insecurity. Women have a major role in 
agricultural production; up to 87 percent of rural women are involved in agriculture sector activities (FAO), 
yet women rarely have land ownership rights and they commonly relinquish inherited land rights to male 
family members. It is estimated that only 13 percent of women are agricultural landholders (UNDP). 
Women working in agriculture face many constraints, such as limited access to land ownership, finance, 
markets, livelihood activities, and information, aside from legal and cultural restrictions on economic 
independence. It is estimated that only 2 percent of women have access to a formal bank account or 
mobile financial provider compared to 11 percent of men (which is also low). According to UNOCHA, 
female-headed households are more at risk of food insecurity due to scarce work opportunities for them. 
Women are generally excluded from economic transactions in the local markets. When food is scarce, 
women are the first family members to eat less as a coping mechanism, even though they continue to do 
hard work, including in the fields. Lack of official papers are an obstacle for women, boys and girls when 
registering for humanitarian assistance distribution. Restrictions in mobility (for security and cultural 
reasons) are often an obstacle for women and girls to go to humanitarian distribution points. Given the 
agriculture sector’s importance in producing food for consumption and commercialization, and 
generating incomes, it will continue playing an important role in households’ coping strategies and is 
expected to play a leading role in post-conflict recovery and reconstruction12. 
 
9. Vulnerability to climate change and pest outbreaks are exacerbating Yemen’s dire food 
insecurity, creating a crisis within a crisis. Yemen is highly vulnerable to climate change, further 
threatening food security and intensifying the development of locust swarms. By 2060, mean annual 
temperature is expected to increase by 1.2oC to 3.3oC, and the rate of warming is projected to be more 
rapid in interior regions than in coastal areas. Sea level rise will result in increased coastal flooding and 
possible damages to infrastructure and ecosystems, leading to sea-water intrusion affecting the country’s 
already fragile freshwater balance. Climate change has already triggered the strongest alterations in water 
temperature in the Indian Ocean in 60 years. Warmer seas also create more extreme rainfall as well as 
stronger and more frequent cyclones, providing ideal conditions for desert locusts to hatch, breed, and 
disperse widely. Fall Armyworm breeding areas are also increasing in Yemen as a result of ecologically 
favorable conditions, including extensive rains, with several governorates affected. 
 
10. Despite the agricultural sector’s importance, agricultural productivity remains low and the 
conflict has severely disrupted access to markets, transportation and distribution. Yemeni farmers 
operate around 1.18 million farms, with an average land holding of 1.36 ha (FAO). About 75 percent of 
agricultural production comes from the highlands, home to 60 percent of the population. While 
productivity has always been low, conflict has worsened production conditions, resulting in a shortage of 
inputs such as seeds, fertilizer and fuel, damage to agricultural machinery, irrigation systems and storage 
facilities along with a deterioration of water, sanitation and electricity services, and a breakdown of 
logistical chains. These disruptions, coupled with the relatively small and fragmented land holdings, have 
been preventing the sector from making a larger contribution to rural incomes and addressing food trade 
imbalances. The insufficient availability of inputs and post-harvest losses have been exacerbated by 

 

inadequate marketing systems, low human resource capacity, and lack of infrastructure and access to 
markets. 
 
11. Acute malnutrition is among the world’s highest, and both underlying acute and chronic 
malnutrition will adversely impact the country’s human capital outcomes in the long term. Prior to the 
2015 escalation of conflict, Yemen already had one of the world’s highest malnutrition levels. In 2021, 
over 2.25 million children under the age of five in Yemen are threatened with acute malnutrition. Of those 
children, 395,000 are expected to suffer from severe acute malnutrition and could die if without 
treatment. The projected figures in the IPC nutrition analysis13 mark a 16 percent increase in acute 
malnutrition and a 22 percent increase in severe acute malnutrition among children under five compared 
to last year’s estimate. This is the highest number on record in Yemen. An additional concern are the more 
than one million pregnant and lactating women who are projected to suffer from acute malnutrition 
during 2021 in Yemen. Acute severe malnutrition14 has immediate effects, including greater susceptibility 
to diseases like cholera, wasting and a whole range of other poor physical and mental health outcomes. 
Malnutrition impacts on children is particularly severe, as it results in long term declines in cognitive 
development, along with poorer health outcomes in both short and longer terms. This looms as a longer-
term societal issue. According to UNICEF, a shocking 46 percent of all children in Yemen are stunted. At 
this rate, malnutrition will create a lost generation. Undernutrition is particularly prevalent in rural areas, 
related to lean seasons or food security crises, and in areas remote from food aid. This suggests that 
enhanced, rural household-focused nutritional awareness, combined with improved local production can 
improve nutritional outcomes. 
 
12. Several aggravating factors that emerged in the spring and summer 2020 have been driving a 
worsening of the food security situation. Those factors include:  
 

(a) Widespread floods. In most of the governorates, the 2020 agriculture season started in March with 
strong rains, which lasted into August and led to heavy floods across the country. The floods resulted 
in substantial damage to cultivated lands and infrastructure and affected agricultural activities such 
as horticulture and livestock. Floods coincided both with harvesting and planting, resulting in damages 
to the standing crops and delayed planting activities. Destruction of water infrastructure alone (not 
including impacts on crops and livestock) is estimated at US$50 million (FAO). The estimated recovery 
and reconstruction needs for the short- and medium-term are between US$763 million and US$932 
million15. 
 

(b) Desert locust invasion. Yemen is one of the main breeding grounds of desert locust swarms, with 
swarms developing across the entire year and in multiple locations. The rains created favorable 
conditions for desert locusts to reproduce, resulting in extensive damage to cultivated crops. 
Residents and farmers in selected governorates reported a huge number of locusts invading farms, 
cities and villages, devouring important seasonal crops such as dates and causing heavy losses. The 
World Bank’s estimates put the damages and losses for the 2020 agricultural season at US$ 222 
million.  

 
13 Yemen: High levels of food insecurity persist | IPC Global Platform (ipcinfo.org)  
14 Severe acute malnutrition is defined by a very low weight for height (below -3z scores of the median WHO growth standards), 
by visible severe wasting, or by the presence of nutritional oedema (WHO). 
15 Yemen Dynamic Needs Assessment (DNA): Updated 2020 (World Bank). 

 

(c) Livestock disease incidences and prevalence in 2020. The above normal and intense rains created 
conducive environments for disease vectors to multiply and easier disease transmission of livestock 
diseases, resulting in increased outbreaks. In livestock, suspected outbreaks of Foot and Mouth 
Disease (FMD), Peste des petits ruminants (PPR), sheep and goat pox (SGP) in areas of low/absence of 
vaccination coverage, Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD) and other disease conditions have devastated 
livestock population, increasing vulnerability of livestock dependent population to food security 
shocks. 
 

(d) Well below-average cereal harvest in 2020. The total cereal production in 2020 was estimated at 
365,000 tons, almost 25 percent below the five-year average. Rural food crop production is expected 
to continue declining unless action is taken. With reduced food imports, higher food prices and for 
most households significantly reduced income earnings, the result will be lower food access. 
 

(e) The COVID-19 pandemic continues its spread across Yemen, negatively impacting food supply chains 
and food trade and contributing to sharp food price increases. By early March 2021, Yemen had 
reported 2,436 COVID-19 cases with 660 deaths, although it is likely COVID-19 cases are significantly 
under-reported. Market functionality and logistics in many areas have been hampered due to curfews 
and other COVID-19 pandemic prevention measures, greatly affecting farmers’ access to markets. 
Although farmgate prices did not change, poor market access has resulted in high post-harvest losses 
of horticulture products with only a few farmers finding alternate marketing channels to sell their 
produce, resulting in lower incomes. Movement restrictions and high input costs could further affect 
the next planting season. Negative coping strategies observed amongst pastoralists, such as selling 
herds, could continue without assistance to secure the upcoming planting season and to preserve 
productive assets in rural areas. In the coming months, localized and temporary increases in COVID-
19 control measures are expected in areas where higher numbers of cases are suspected, with further 
disruptions to trade and access to food and income. 
 

(f) Food price increases have continued through a combination of rapid currency deterioration, COVID-19 
pandemic impacts on the agri-food sector and lower food imports. Food represents a large share of 
poor households’ consumption expenditures, estimated between 60 to 70 percent. The disruptions 
to supply chains of locally produced foods are resulting in postharvest losses, and informal food flows 
across land borders are expected to continue at reduced levels relative to the pre-conflict period. 
Trade across land borders will likely remain difficult as continuing insecurity is now compounded by 
border closures due to COVID-19. As a result, the cost of the minimum food basket (MFB) increased 
by more than 20 percent during February 2020 – January 202116. For instance, wheat flour price 
gradually increased throughout 2020 and in November 2020 was 27 percent higher than at the same 
time previous year17. At the same time, incomes in the informal sector have dropped dramatically, 
remittances are also down sharply, and from December 2019 to June 2020, the local currency (Yemeni 
riyal) lost an average of 19 percent of its value against the US dollar18.  

13. The ability of Yemen’s physical food markets  to operate varies across the country. Yemen’s food 
market landscape is  fragmented and market ability to operate depends on the security situation.  In many 
areas, markets are operating reasonably well and are reasonably well stocked, however, in many food 
insecure areas poorly operating markets and dis-functional logistics are among the reasons contributing 
to the food insecurity.  The Yemen Joint Market Monitoring Initiative19 regularly monitors market 
operations in 56 districts in 16 governorates. They report that price inflation is the most commonly 
reported constraint faced by the assessed vendors when obtaining fuel, Water, Sanitation and Hygiene 
(WASH) items, food items, and water trucking services. Among the vendors interviewed, results showed 
86.2 percent saw price increases as the key constraint. Other constraints listed by respondents were 
insecurity (17.7 percent), demand shortages due to the population’s low purchasing power (14.9 percent), 
transportation difficulties (12.8 percent), with supply shortages only mentioned by 2.4 percent of 
respondents. Yet farmers report worsening access to markets due to the COVID-19 restrictions. 
Horticulture farmers, mainly women, are selling a highly perishable commodity and rely on this income to 
sustain their families. Poor market access has both, kept the farmgate prices steady, but also resulted in 
high post-harvest losses of horticulture products with only a few farmers finding alternate marketing 
channels to sell their produce, resulting in lower incomes. Another significant factor that negatively 
impacts overall private sector operations is fuel scarcity and its trading in the black market at double the 
price, which have disrupted the production process, service delivery, decreased working hours, and 
increased costs of production, transportation, storage and marketing20. 
 
14. Climate change is already worsening the existing challenges and negatively impacting all four 
dimensions of food security: availability, access, stability, and utilization of food. Food availability is 
compromised by projected yield declines due to temperature and precipitation patterns change. Climate 
change also compromises food access by affecting consumers' purchasing power through price increases 
as a result of climate change. Climate change affects food utilization primarily by reducing food safety 
through a higher incidence of food-borne diseases and the spread of novel pests and diseases. Regarding 
food stability, the risks to food and nutrition security are exacerbated by the expected increase in the 
frequency and intensity of climate-related events. Furthermore, according to the World Bank's 
Groundswell report21, climate change will scale up internal climate migration. The poorest people in rural 
areas will be forced to move due to slow-onset climate change impacts, including decreasing crop 
productivity, shortage and deterioration of water’s quantity and quality, and rising sea levels. Therefore, 
actions geared towards building improved and climate-smart agri-food systems will contribute to 
increased food security, climate change adaptation and mitigation. 
 
15. Food security situation forecasts for the first half of 2021 predict that food insecurity across the 
country will intensify due to the continued, combined effects of the aggravating factors described in 
paragraph 12 above, a warning uniformly sounded across the UN agencies working in Yemen, including 
the FAO, UNICEF and the World Food Programme (WFP)22. This includes large areas of the country 
previously in IPC Phase 2 (Stressed) moving to IPC Phase 3 (Crisis), with the share of the population in IPC 
Phases 3 and 4 significantly increasing by June 2021. The number of people likely to experience high levels 
of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above) is estimated to be nearly 16.2 million (54 percent of the 


total population). Food insecurity is more severe both in areas with active fighting and bordering areas 
with limited access. It is particularly affecting Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) and marginalized groups 
such as the landless laborers and the Mohamasheen23. Food insecurity is also severe in areas where 
people survive on low and irregular sources of income and low access to public services. The population 
in Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5) are found in five districts of Al Jawf, Hajjah and Amran. The governorates 
with the highest proportion of IPC Phase 4 districts (>75%) are located in Al Dhale’e, Al Jawf, Hajjah, Marib 
and Rayma Governorates. Each of the governorates of Al Hudaydah, Dhamar, Hajjah, Ibb, Sana’a City and 
Taizz have more than one million people in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) or above. The upcoming “lean” season, 
between March and June 2021 is expected to aggravate this situation.

D. Project Description  
 

 
18. Component 1: Improving household incomes through CFW for agricultural production 
infrastructure (US$20.0 million, including US$5.0 million from GAFSP and US$15.0 million from IDA). 
UNDP will implement this component through the Social Fund for Development (SFD) and the Public 
Works Project (PWP). The  SFD will  take the lead in implementing the CFW program, which will provide 
employment opportunities directly to beneficiary laborers from the communities in the project area. The 
PWP will implement small-scale infrastructure-related works through selected locally sourced contractors 
which are also expected to create employment opportunities for the communities. Both organizations 
have extensive experience implementing their respective responsibilities under a number of other 
interventions, including under several Bank-financed projects.  It is expected that 85 percent of the 
component financing will be allocated for CFW activities, which the remaining 15 percent would be 
channeled through the PWP. Component 1 activities will be implemented in close collaboration with the 
FAO to ensure that they are closely coordinated with the productive investments made under Component 
2. Component 1 would ensure immediate access to food for an estimated 26,500 food-insecure 
households by creating temporary employment opportunities through a Cash-for-Work (CFW) program, 
focusing on restoring damaged public and collective productive assets, including those affected by the 
recent floods. The project would target youth (18 – 32 years of age) through the community outreach 
programs and encourage them to participate in the CFW program. The Component will also seek to 
support employment generation activities targeting women. 
 

19.  Component 1 activities would directly contribute to climate change adaptation and mitigate 
greenhouse gas emissions. Implementing climate-resilient irrigation and water conservation and 
management practices will restore degraded lands (including terracing) and affected water infrastructure 
for subsequent productive, climate-smart technology use in agricultural production and allow 
beneficiaries to earn much needed income from their repair and maintenance through cash-for-work. An 
estimated 15,700 farmers will have improved access to water infrastructure, irrigation networks and 
rehabilitated lands. These actions also contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation by 
increasing carbon sequestration and improving water management. The Component will finance 
beneficiary compensation, estimated as US$660 per household per six month period, and the operating 
costs of SFD and PWP. The detailed criteria for beneficiary selection will be included in the Project 
Operations Manual (POM), and care will be taken to ensure that the beneficiaries of this Component are 
not engaged in parallel Bank-financed projects24. 
 

20. Component 2: Increasing production and sale of nutritious crop, livestock and fish products 
(US$33.0 million, including US$10.0 million from GAFSP and US$23.0 million from IDA). This Component 
will be implemented by FAO. The Component would allocate resources to provide key support for 
smallholder farmers and producers to invest in productive assets and help improve their capacity to better 
commercialize their products and enter new markets. The Component would support: (1) restoring 
climate-smart local food production to increase household access to food and food availability in local 
markets, and (2) improving farmer’s access to markets for staple and high value cash crops (such as 
horticultural crops and coffee), by strengthening value chains’ vertical and horizontal linkages, to increase 
incomes for beneficiary households. Component 2 would collaborate with IFC in developing selected high 

value agricultural value chains, building value chains between the project-supported farmers/agricultural 
producers and IFC’s advisory services and investment clients25. This component is therefore expected to 
restore climate-smart agricultural production while also stimulating the local economy and promoting the 
production of nutrient-dense foods (e.g., horticulture, pulses, meat (chicken and livestock), dairy and fish). 
This component would finance two types of support packages. Detailed criteria for beneficiary selection 
and implementation arrangements will be included in the POM. 
 

21. Sub-component 2.1: Restoring climate-smart agricultural production (US$15.0 million, including 
US$ 5.0 million from GAFSP and US$10.0 million from IDA). The Input Package for agricultural producers 
will promote climate-smart agricultural production focusing on smallholder’s re-engagement in 
horticulture, crop and livestock farming, bee-keeping and fish production. Producers would receive 
support to restart or expand production, including input starter packages for crops, animal feed, improved 
forage seeds, equipment and inputs to start fish farming, bee-keeping kits, farm equipment such as fodder 
choppers and small dairy equipment, energy efficient post-harvest handling and storage facilities. The 
Input Packages will be supported by complementary climate-smart practices supporting diversified 
production and climate resilience—for instance, by introducing improved varieties and plantings and ways 
to preserve and manage grasslands. The Sub-component will also provide extension support to producers, 
including training and advisory services through Farmer Field Schools (FFS) on good agricultural practices, 
enhanced animal husbandry and feeding practices  and climate-smart technologies. SFD, which has 
extensive prior experience in implementing the types of activities supported under this Component, will 
work alongside FAO to restoring and enhancing access to  some agriculture inputs. It would also 
strengthen access to supporting services to ensure maximum benefits from those assets, including 
extension services to be supported under Component 4, veterinary services (including vaccinations for 
animals) thought Community Animal Health Workers (CAHWS) and General Directorate for Animal Health 
and Quarantine (GDAHWQ), and mechanical services support.  
 

22. Sub-component 2.2: Promoting value addition and sale of nutritious food products (US$20.0 
million, including US$5.0 million from GAFSP and US$15.0 million from IDA). The second package of 
interventions (Value Addition Package) will provide in-kind grants to support enterprising producers, 
processors and traders to scale up, add value to their products, improve product quality and aggregation, 
consolidate production, and access local and regional markets with their products. The sub-component 
will work with the value chain participants to structure the value chain, providing both training and 
advisory support in technical aspects (aggregation, development of linkages with farmers, product quality 
and others), business skill capacity building, and provide beneficiaries with key assets (equipment, 
machinery and working capital), enabling them to increase the quality and commercialization of food 
products. In areas with high caseloads of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), the project will build 
capacities of farmers with agriculture techniques, value chain development and maintenance of local 
infrastructure, to improve mutual trust, understanding and collaboration between displaced and host 
populations. SFD, which has extensive prior experience in implementing the types of activities supported 
under this Sub-component, will work alongside FAO to increase the farm-gate value and nutritional 
content of some agricultural products through provision of improved technologies and practices for key 
horticulture crops. The equipment and machinery provided under the sub-component will be climate-
smart and more environmentally friendly than conventional technologies. Most of the equipment and 
machinery is expected to be procured, imported and distributed to the value chain/value addition 

 
25 One such opportunity for a black sesame value chain has already been identified. 




beneficiaries by FAO. Some of the value chain activities may also cover the beneficiaries who received 
support under the SAPREP and ECRP.  
 

23. Sub-component 2.2 will support key value chains mostly focused on the local market, including 
beans and cereals, vegetables, dairy, livestock and fish value chains. To increase production, improve 
product quality, extend shelf-life, reduce food loss, and improve energy efficiency, the component will 
complement the Input Packages by providing in-kind grants for value chain development, post-harvest 
enhancement and value addition activities. The size of in-kind grants will depend on the type of 
beneficiary financed – a group or individual, as well as on the nature of the activity. Larger-scale 
investments, such as seedling centers, post-harvest centers, hydroponics, dairy processing facilities, etc., 
will be implemented though groups of beneficiaries. For group beneficiaries, the upper value of the in-
kind grants should not exceed a maximum of US$70,000 per group. The only exception to this maximum 
size limit may be groups engaged in milk collection and dairy processing where construction of 
infrastructure is necessary. Given the high start-up costs, the maximum value of such in-kind grants should 
not exceed a maximum of US$120,000 per group. Individual beneficiaries who will receive support for 
activities such as beekeeping, poultry production, horticulture production and processing, food 
preservation, agro-logistics services and other income-generating value-addition activities, the grant shall 
not exceed US$2,000 per individual beneficiary. All in-kind grant financed by the project should be 
supported by a business idea description, description of the market, value chain arrangements and 
financial viability. The length of the business idea description should be commensurate with the size of 
the in-kind grant. Detailed description of the in-kind grants is in Annex 3. 
 

24. The component will also support investments and technical assistance in selected high-value, 
high-growth value chains (such as coffee, fruits and nuts, and poultry and eggs26), some of them in 
collaboration with IFC and aiming to generate IFC and/or private sector investments. This should generate 
higher employment and household incomes, improve access to food, and allow for higher diversification 
of household diets. To ensure that the products are delivered to the market, and to create additional jobs, 
selected small-scale agro-logistics service providers may also be supported. The component will prioritize 
the adoption of climate-smart crop and livestock practices to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and 
enhance resilience to climate change. SMEPS will be working alongside FAO and IFC to ensure knowledge 
transfer on value chain development and support to build SMEPS’s capacity to engage in similar activities 
in the future. To further review and strengthen opportunities for development of value chains, the Sub-
component will also finance studies in two areas: (1) A fisheries and coastal 
aquaculture needs assessment and a fisheries and coastal aquaculture stock assessment; and (2) agro-
logistics constraints and solutions for selected value chains. The sub-component will also support limited 
small-scale laboratory equipment for selected Universities to support the value chain development 
activities. 
 
25. Component 3: Improving the nutritional status of vulnerable rural households (US$49.3 million, 
all IDA). Sub-component 3.1 will be implemented by FAO and Sub-component 3.2 and 3.3 will be 
implemented by WFP. This component would aims at improving the nutritional security of very vulnerable 
(Sub-components 3.1 and 3.3) and moderately vulnerable (Sub-component 3.2) households through a 
variety of instruments, including: (1) targeted nutrition-sensitive agriculture activities and facilitating 

 
26 Based on the results of application of the Agricultural Investment for Development Analyzer (AIDA) model by the 
International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI).  

Uptake by poor households of appropriate dietary and nutrition practices, in particular improving nutrient 
intakes of pregnant mothers and children under two, (2) promoting women’s entrepreneurship activities 
and improving the diets of the female-led households, and (3) improving nutrition in vulnerable 
households with malnourished women and children. Component 3 beneficiaries may also include the 
Cash-for-Nutrition beneficiaries under the ECRP, to ensure that they receive support allowing them to 
start their own production of food or improve nutritious diets on a more sustainable basis.  
 
26. Sub-component 3.1: Promoting kitchen gardens and backyard production for improved diets 
(US$10.0 million, all IDA). FAO will implement this Sub-component which will target beneficiary 
households that have received malnutrition treatment and prevention services referred to under Sub-
component 3.3, former beneficiaries of the Cash-for-Nutrition programs under the ECRP, households with 
pregnant mothers and children under two, and other eligible households with a similar vulnerability level. 
The Sub-component will provide inputs (vegetable seeds, chicken, etc.) for households to establish kitchen 
gardens and backyard production of nutritious food items (vegetables, eggs, and meat). It is estimated 
that the sub-component will reach 20,000 beneficiary households. Beneficiaries would also receive two 
types of training. For improving backyard production, they will receive training on best and climate-smart 
agricultural production practices. The Sub-component will prioritize the adoption of climate-smart crop 
and livestock practices to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance resilience to climate change. To 
maximize the nutritional value of available food, training sessions will be offered to beneficiaries of this 
sub-component on how to maximize the nutritional value of foods when preparing family meals. Also, the 
project will use different communication channels to spread nutrition messages to trigger behavioral 
change in target populations. Since women are the main family caretakers, mostly women beneficiaries 
are expected to partake in these activities, however, the training will be open to both women and men. 
 
27. Sub-component 3.2: Promoting women’s rural entrepreneurship for improved nutrition and 
food security (US$14.3 million, all IDA). The Sub-component will be implemented by WFP and will focus 
on promoting women’s entrepreneurship to generate higher income and improve nutritious diets and 
food security at the household level. WFP’s resilience and livelihoods interventions will mainly target 
moderately food-insecure people to prevent them from slipping into further food insecurity. WFP will 
work with national NGO partners and provide Food for Training to food-insecure women, especially 
targeting those who are heading their households in rural communities. The training will develop their 
skills, aimed at restoring or establishing their livelihoods, and starting their own businesses. The support 
in most cases will range from six to nine months (at the monthly payment of US$105), giving participants 
access to various trainings, such as skill development, business development and management, digital skills, 
entrepreneurship, improved nutrition and life-skills (e.g. health practices) while they are supported by a 
monthly allowance. Once trainings are completed and a business plan submitted, the women would 
receive a start-up grant to start diversified income generating activities (both agricultural and non-
agricultural). The grant amount per individual will not exceed US$800. Increasing the productive capacity 
and livelihoods potential of rural women, especially in agriculture and food production, will help sustain 
their food and nutritional security when the assistance period ends. Similar to 3.1, for agricultural 
activities, the Sub-component will prioritize the adoption of climate-smart crop and livestock practices to 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance resilience to climate change. WFP’s comprehensive 
approach also includes training and support related to gender-based violence, awareness on preventing 
infectious disease spread, and child-care, nutrition and health practices. Participants will be encouraged 
to work together in joint business ventures with an estimated 3 participants per business, although the 
number may vary based on participant preferences and conditions for joint ventures in the targeted areas. 



It is expected that around 7,910 women will participate in the training, establishing an estimated 2,637 
businesses.  
 
28. Sub-component 3.3: Providing nutrition assistance to treat and prevent malnutrition (US$25.0 
million, all IDA) for pregnant and lactating women and girls (PLWG) and children under 5 years old. This 
Sub-component will be implemented by WFP and constitutes an integrated malnutrition prevention and 
treatment response. WFP will provide blanket supplementary feeding with specialized nutrition products 
to children aged 6–23 months and PLWG to prevent acute and chronic malnutrition in the project area 
districts prioritized for integrated famine response. Elsewhere, WFP will provide targeted supplementary 
feeding to malnourished children aged 6–59 months and PLWG girls to treat moderate and acute 
malnutrition across the country. Beneficiaries of targeted supplementary feeding will be screened in local 
health centers, through community health volunteers and screening campaigns organized by the Ministry 
of Public Health and Population (MOPHP), using mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) and weight-for-
height measurements. This is accompanied by social behavior change communication (SBCC), designed to 
reduce barriers to adequate infant and young children feeding practices and healthy eating and hygiene 
habits. The SBCC campaign will target PLWG, health workers and caregivers, and also other decision 
makers and influencers within the community such as parents-in-law, husbands and local leaders. 
Messaging will focus on ensuring that responsibility for the care of children is shared within the household 
and not only limited to women. During the project period, around 195,000 beneficiaries are expected to 
be reached through the  Treatment Program, including 150,000 acutely malnourished children under the 
age of five and 45,000 acutely malnourished pregnant and lactating women and girls, as well as around 
277,000 beneficiaries through the Prevention Program, including 150,000 children under the age of two 
and 127,000 pregnant and lactating women and girls. 
 
29. Component 4: Capacity building for food security management (US$6.0 million, all IDA). FAO 
will lead implementation of this component in cooperation with other partner organizations as described 
below. This component includes a set of activities that are expected to significantly strengthen the 
capacity of both the private (households) and public sectors for food security crisis planning and response: 

 

(a) Developing an evidence-based Food Security Preparedness Plan (FSPP). The FSPP development 
will be co-led by the World Bank (financed under a separate budget) and the FAO, and will be 
carried out in a highly participatory manner, consulting with the main line ministries and 
Institutions involved in the agricultural sector, multilateral and bilateral organizations, the private 
sector; and civil society including international and local NGOs. This FSPP will be prepared within 
six months of project effectiveness and it will be reviewed by the World Bank’s Technical Expert 
Group on Food Security. The FSPP implementation will be monitored on a regular basis 
throughout the project period.  
 

(b) Establishing a satellite-based Earth Observation (EO) crop and pasture monitoring and early 
warning system for detecting climate-induced hazards. This tool would support monitoring 
agricultural production, providing information to the GOY for decision-making regarding food 
imports planning. The data generated by the EO Tool will also feed into the FSPP implementation. 
The EO tool will initially be housed by FAO and arrangements to transfer to the appropriate agency 
will be identified during the project Mid-Term Review (MTR). The project will be designed in a 
manner to ensure its use for the intended (civilian) purpose only.  



(c) Strengthening agriculture extension services by financing capacity building of the existing 
extension services, including current extension services staff, Community Animal Health Workers 
(CAHWs) and other extension service agents working in the communities. A significant number of 
women, enrolled on the basis of selection criteria which will be reflected in the POM, will be 
trained as extension workers, agricultural technicians, and CAHWs under this activity and 
recruited to be part of FFS.  
 

(d) Piloting alternative agricultural production technologies will introduce alternative, climate smart 
land- and water-efficient agricultural production technologies for producing nutritious crops (soil-
less technologies, such as hydroponics and aquaponics) by financing technology pilots and 
demonstrations in areas where previously, production would not have been possible, due to 
limited land resources. 

 
30. Component 5: Project Management and Knowledge Management (US$16.7 million, including 
US$3.2 million from GAFSP and US$13.5 million from IDA). This component would cover the costs 
associated with project management for all three Implementing Agencies (FAO, UNDP and WFP), 
recognizing the particularly challenging operating conditions in Yemen. Covered implementation costs 
include financial management, procurement, monitoring the project’s environmental and social 
safeguards, communication and stakeholder engagement, and overall monitoring and evaluation (M&E). 
Additionally, M&E is expected to be strengthened by using the Geo-Enabling initiative for Monitoring and 
Supervision (GEMS) and by carrying out an additional impact assessment (in collaboration with IFPRI), to 
assess the suitability and impact of project interventions. This component would also finance a third-party 
monitoring (TPM) mechanism and establishing and maintaining a grievance redress mechanism (GRM). 
 
31. For real-time data collection and analysis, the project will implement the Geo-Enabling method 
for Monitoring and Supervision (GEMS). The GEMS method enables project teams to use open-source 
tools for in-field collection of structured digital data that automatically feeds into a centralized M&E 
system and Management Information System (MIS). The integrated data can include any kind of 
indicators, based on tailor-made forms; photos, audio, videos; time and date stamps; and GPS coordinates 
that allow for automated geo-mapping of the information. Using these tools systematically allows the 
project to enhance the transparency and accuracy of project planning as well as M&E and third-party 
monitoring throughout the project cycle. Moreover, GEMS allows for establishing a digital platform for 
remote supervision, real-time safeguards monitoring, and portfolio mapping for coordination across 
project components as well as with other operations in the region.  
 
32. Integration of COVID-19 response. The project will use its resources (such as field consultants) to 
integrate COVID-19 awareness and preventive measures in the training events and awareness campaigns 
planned for beneficiaries. Awareness raising and training events will follow precautionary measures 
described in workshop/training protocols, as well as enforce and maintain adequate distancing during 
control, distribution, training, payment, and other project activities. These will also be held in locations 
and during times that are convenient for women. The project will work with local communities, female 
and male consultants, and beneficiaries to reach households with awareness and hygiene materials (such 
as masks, hand sanitizers and other relevant consumables) that will be developed to resonate with women 
and men’s different roles and behaviors at home and in society. The decision on which hygiene materials 

to procure will be made in coordination with the Bank-financed COVID-19 health emergency project in 
Yemen.  .

Summary of Assessment of Environmental and Social Risks and Impacts 
. 

 
Environmental Risk Rating 
 

33. The environmental risk is considered Substantial given that the project will support several 
interventions that might be associated with environmental risks and impacts and the implementation 
agencies' ESF capacity remains limited. Environmental risks and impacts are expected to be site-specific, 
reversible, and generally of low magnitude that can be mitigated following appropriate measures; 
nonetheless, based on the implementation experience of ongoing projects, particularly those involving 
labor-intensive interventions, and the identification of significant Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) 
gaps, there is a significant risk for fatal incidents or serious injuries to occur under the project, particularly 
under the interventions of component 1 (Alleviating immediate food security needs by improving 
household incomes) since the activities under this component will provide temporary work opportunities 
to a large number of local community members, with little or no knowledge or experience in applying OHS 
measures. 
 
34. Furthermore, there is a risk of COVID-19 transmission among community workers if worksites are 
not managed appropriately and injuries due to the potential explosion of a remnant of war (ERW). 
Component 1 will also support the rehabilitation of small-scale rural land and water infrastructure and 
access roads to isolated villages/communities, therefore improper management of materials that will be 
used for the rehabilitation activities might lead to the generation of waste and open dumping in the 
environment. In addition, the project might support some interventions such as rehabilitation of terraces 
and construction of hydroponics which might increase the use of pesticides (the project will not finance 
procurement of pesticides) and fertilizers which should be applied and disposed of adequately and in a 
controlled manner.  

 

35. It is mentionable that the project will have several positive impacts including through supporting 
the hydroponics and aquaponics which will enhance the economically - environmentally friendly and 
sustainable development solution for the beneficiaries and will pilot interventions which are of high 
productivity and save land and water consumption for irrigation. This may encourage other farmers to 
replicate this intervention at a larger scale and spreading scientific knowledge to other farmers 
countrywide. 
 

Social Risk Rating 
 

36. The proposed project is expected to bring significant social benefits to the targeted communities. 
It will contribute to the alleviation of food security and improvement of household income through the 
Cash for Work program, support restoration of local food production and increase the sales of crops and 
livestock and promote diversified nutrient crops.  Particular attention and efforts would be given to the 
promotion of youth and women participation and maximizing their benefits through dedicated 
subcomponents under the project.   
 
37. The project could face possible adverse social impacts and risks. The proposed interventions in 
farmland and irrigation works are of rehabilitation and maintenance nature.  They are planned to take 
place within their existing footprints and are expected to be quite small in scale. Therefore, land 
acquisition or resettlement needs are not anticipated under the project.  A negative exclusion list will be 
developed for the project. However, these activities could have potentials for labor-related impacts and 
risks, such as possible child labor, forced labor, discriminatory practices in recruitment, occupational 
health and safety issues, and GBV/SEA risks, and even possible conflicts within potential beneficiary 
communities.  The project faces a potential risk of elites or better-connected individuals or groups 
capturing project benefits, affecting poor and vulnerable groups receiving their due share of project 
benefits.  These could include the elderly, poor farmers, women, and individuals displaced by the ongoing 
conflict. The overall country security situation poses another challenge for the project and is a key risk for 
the project implementation. In addition to the general conflict and security situation the country faces, 
the project may face possible conflicts among local communities, interested groups, and factions over 
project benefits distribution. Given the above, the project's social risks are considered Substantial. 

 
E. Implementation 

 
Institutional and Implementation Arrangements 

 
38. The project would be implemented by three UN Agencies, FAO, UNDP and WFP, ensuring project 
activities reach throughout both the South and the North of Yemen. Each Agency will implement part of 
the project based on their mandate and relevant experience: 
 

(i) FAO is the specialized UN agency responsible for and well positioned to respond to 
emergencies in agriculture and food security, including crop and food supply monitoring and 
needs assessments, evaluations of agricultural relief requirements, and mobilizing assistance 
and resources to restore agricultural activity. The FAO has prior experience in supporting the 
implementation of Bank-financed projects on the ground in Yemen (since 2017 it has led the 
implementation of SAPREP toward satisfactory achievement of results and more recently it 
became the Implementing Agency for the Desert Locust Response Project; P174170). SAPREP, 
implemented in collaboration with SFD,  supported a set of similar activities, including the 
CFW instrument implementation, support to agricultural production by providing input kits 
and ensuring access to associated services (such as animal health services). The project’s 
implementation performance rating is Satisfactory. Given their prior experience in 
implementing SAPREP, FAO is fully aware of the Bank’s fiduciary and safeguards 
requirements. FAO has put in place enhanced M&E mechanisms to supervise local 
implementation partners and has also been using TPM. 


(ii) UNDP is the UN’s development agency and it is committed to supporting the peacebuilding 
initiative in Yemen, political stability and enhanced local governance. UNDP has built a 
successful partnership with the World Bank in implementing the CFW activities of the ECRP. 
The project works in 317 districts out of 330 districts of Yemen. UNDP is partnering with the 
SFD and PWP and their community networks to deliver services. Given their prior experience 
in implementing the ECRP, the UNDP is fully aware of the Bank’s fiduciary and safeguards 
requirements. UNDP established an M&E system to ensure proper project management, 
assuring stakeholders and providing accountability and is also using a TPM mechanism to 
monitor project implementation. UNDP communicates with the World Bank team monthly on 
project implementation and to address  emerging challenges. UNDP had a good collaboration 
with FAO on water resource management, aimed at enhancing access to water in agriculture 
and improving the effective use and management of scarce water resources in Yemen.  

(iii) WFP is the food-assistance branch of the United Nations and is the world's largest 
humanitarian organization, the largest one focused on hunger and food security, and the 
largest provider of school meals. In Yemen, in addition to food and nutrition interventions, 
such as school feeding programs, WFP is also engaged in livelihoods development activities 
through a range of instruments, including Food-for-Assets and Food-for-Training in close 
cooperation with FAO. WFP’s vulnerability, mapping and assessment (VAM) expertise 
conducts joint nation-wide food security and livelihood assessments which inform the 
Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) for Yemen, as well as regular food security 
and price monitoring and analysis. WFP is an existing Implementing Agency under the World 
Bank-financed Restoring Education and Learning Project (P175036), engaged in school 
feeding activities, and it has therefore some exposure to the Bank’s fiduciary and safeguards 
requirements.  
 

39. The Country Representation Offices of the three UN Agencies will be responsible for the overall 
implementation of their respective activities and coordinating all relevant activities at the sub-national 
level, supported by the regional office staff who will monitor the activities in different governorates. 
The FAO will be the lead agency for the implementation of the project and will be a recipient of both IDA 
and GAFSP financing. Both UNDP and WFP will receive IDA financing. Each UN Agency will be responsible 
for the technical implementation of the relevant components and sub-components (as indicated in the 
PAD), as well as all fiduciary, environmental, and social aspects, monitoring and reporting. The UN 
Agencies will help ensure financial and technical accountability of the implementing partner organizations 
(such as SFD, SMEPS and PWP) and ensure appropriate training and capacity building of the staff of the 
implementing partner organizations. The FAO would have a Project Coordination Unit (PCU) based in 
Sana’a, and technical staff deployed in its Aden sub-office and other decentralized hubs to ensure day-to-
day project management, including all fiduciary, environmental, and social aspects, and monitoring and 
reporting. UNDP and WFP will assign dedicated staff to support project implementation and ensure timely 
and relevant contributions to the PCU work. This proposed structure would build on the experience with 
previous grants implemented by FAO in the country. Moreover, the FAO team in Sana’a is backstopped 
by a dedicated team of technical experts at Regional (Cairo) and Headquarters (Rome) level in line with 
the Level 3 fast-track procedures established due to the emergency situation in Yemen. 
 
40. Coordination. The three selected organizations are currently working in Yemen and exchanging 
information as part of their participation in partner meetings. The three UN Agencies will set up a formal 
project Coordination Committee for increased efficiency and efficacy, including to coordinate activities 


with and among the Implementing Partners. This committee will hold meetings on a regular basis 
(suggested monthly) to best coordinate their activities, evaluate progress, address bottlenecks and 
consolidate annual work plans. Frequency of meetings, attendance, communication tools, etc. will be 
developed in the POM. Collecting and reporting on indicators (including methodology, tools, devices, etc.) 
to inform the results framework and progress on implementation will be discussed and agreed among 
implementing partners with the support of the Bank. A mechanism will also be established to brief the 
authorities at various levels on regular basis on the project results and challenges of implementation.  
 
41. Local partners with prior extensive experience in implementing similar projects will have key 
implementation roles. The PWP and SFD would play a key role as the local implementing partners for 
Component 1, SFD and SMEPS would support implementation of small-scale value chain activities, 
provision of technologies and practices for some horticulture crops and restoration of agriculture inputs 
under Component 2, alongside FAO. The SFD and PWP are the key local partners in implementing the 
ongoing ECRP, SAPREP and DLRP, and they would lead the implementation of Component 1. SMEPS would 
contribute to the value chain development under Component 2. Selecting national institutions for these 
roles would contribute to building national capacity for community-based interventions. For activities that 
would be implemented by SFD, SMEPS and PWP, UNDP and FAO would provide technical guidance and 
backstopping as required. Under the CFW program of Component 1, SFD will be in charge of working with 
beneficiaries on the CFW program, while the PWP will implement the activities related to restoration of 
small-scale agricultural infrastructure in the cases it requires involvement of professional contractors, to 
ensure communities have access to good quality assets. SMEPS will ensure technical assistance to the 
value chain development activities. Additional personnel will be recruited to cover any skills or human 
capacity gaps as assessed during the project preparation. All staff are required to have satisfactory 
expertise, experience, and qualifications. All three national institutions have capacity and experience 
spanning over 20 years in undertaking participatory and community-based development activities 
involving women and men from local communities. 
 
42. Project Operational Manual (POM). A detailed POM and a separate CfW Transfer Manual will be 
prepared for all project components by effectiveness. The POM and the CfW Transfer Manual will be 
subject to the World Bank’s no objection.  
 
43. Financial Management and Procurement arrangements. The project’s financial management 
(FM) arrangements will be governed by the Financial Management Framework Agreement (FMFA) 
between the World Bank and the UN Agencies, which provides for the use of the UN’s Financial 
Regulations. For procurement, FAO will follow its own procurement procedures as Alternative 
Procurement Arrangements, as provided under the World Bank New Procurement Framework Policy 
Section III. F. This implementation arrangement is sound, since the procurement procedures of FAO were 
assessed and found acceptable to the World Bank under agreements with UN agencies. 
 
44. Implementing partners will prepare budgeted Annual Work Plans of implementation and a 
detailed procurement plan (in agreement with the World Bank). This budgeted Annual Work Plan will be 
prepared no later than four months after project effectiveness. It will highlight the activities to be 
implemented for the subsequent 12 months by component and sub-component with intended results, 
timeline, budgets and planned procurement activities. It will also identify issues / implementation 
bottlenecks and relevant remedial actions and outline key responsibilities. In the context of COVID-19 and 
virtual missions (video/audio), the budgeted Annual Work Plan will be the common communication 

interface between implementing partners and the World Bank to regularly monitor activities of each 
component, evaluate progress and discuss corrective actions or changes as needed.

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 

 
1. The Republic of Ghana, with a population of about 30.4 million, is classified as lower-middle-income with a per 

capita income of US$5,413 (in 2017 PPP dollars) in 2019. Ghana achieved its current income status through strong, 

sustained economic growth. The country’s per capita income grew by an average of 1.5 percent per year between 1990 

and 1999, by 2.8 percent per year between 2000 and 2009, and by 4.3 percent between 2010 and 2019 (peaking at 11.3 

percent in 2011). Ghana’s economic growth performance during the 2000s is mainly attributed to the sharp increase in 

prices for its main commodity exports, cocoa and gold, and the start of commercial oil and gas production in 2011. 

 
2. The country’s favorable economic growth performance has been accompanied by a substantial reduction in the 

prevalence of poverty. Based on the national food poverty line, the extreme poverty rate fell from 36 percent in 1991/92 

to 16.5 percent in 2005/06 to 8.4 percent in 2012/13, allowing Ghana to meet the United Nations Millennium 

Development Goal of halving poverty by 2015.  

 
3. In 2016/17, measured using the international poverty line of $1.90 per day per person in 2011 PPP dollars, Ghana’s 

poverty rate was 13.6 percent. This level of poverty is substantially lower than the average level for Sub-Saharan Africa. It 

is also lower than the average for lower-middle income countries.1 Measured using the country’s official poverty lines, 

Ghana’s overall poverty rate in 2016/17 was 23.4 percent, whereas its extreme poverty rate was 8.2 percent.   

 
4. Poverty levels appear to differ markedly across areas within Ghana. Poverty levels are substantially higher in rural 

areas than in urban areas. In 2016/17, the overall poverty rate in rural areas was 39.5 percent, five times higher than the 

corresponding rate in urban areas, at 7.8 percent. The extreme poverty was 15.6 percent in rural areas, while it was just 

1 percent in urban areas. Overall and extreme poverty rates in 2016/17 are also markedly higher in the administrative 

regions of Volta, Upper East, Northern, and Upper West than in other parts of the country. These high-poverty regions are 

situated in the northern and eastern parts of Ghana.  

 
5. Spatial patterns in where infrastructure, services, and markets are lacking show strong overlap with the spatial 

pattern in where poverty levels are high, suggesting that these factors may be constraining households from achieving 


sufficiently high incomes to escape poverty.2 High-poverty regions also face adverse ecological conditions, which are 

considered to play an important role in constraining growth, development, and poverty reduction.3     

 
6. In recent years, the pace of poverty reduction has slowed, and the association between economic growth and 

poverty reduction has weakened. The COVID-19 pandemic and accompanying global economic crisis also serve as a major 

setback to Ghana’s prospects for further reductions in poverty.  

 
7. In October 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) projected that Ghana’s real GDP for 2020 will grow by 

0.9 percent.4 In contrast, in October 2019 (before the pandemic), the IMF had forecast real GDP growth of 5.6 percent for 

Ghana in 2020.5 Micro-simulations suggest the pandemic and the Government of Ghana’s measures to control the spread 

of infection (mainly the partial lockdown of Ghana’s largest cities of Accra and Kumasi in April 2020) have contributed to 

large increases in poverty.6 They show that Accra, Kumasi, and other urban areas were hardest hit. They also show losses 

across the population, with larger losses (in percentage terms) for richer than poorer households, and the accrual of large 

losses by farm and nonfarm households in areas that were not locked down, due to interlinkages among markets. 

 
8. A telephone-based national survey of sample households conducted in June 2020 confirms that Ghanaians have 

suffered widespread and acute economic distress amid the pandemic.7 A majority of respondents said they had 

experienced a loss in income since mid-March 2020 when the Government began to introduce restrictions to control the 

local spread of infection. Those who received self-employment income were more likely to report a loss in income than 

those who received wage earnings. Those who received remittance income or other private transfers were more likely to 

report a loss in income than those who received cash or in-kind assistance from the government or nongovernmental 

organizations.  

 
9. In terms of how households were affected by the pandemic, 75–77 percent reported that they were severely 

affected by the suspension of schooling or by an increase in food prices, while 37–44 percent said they were severely 

affected by an increase in the price of nonfood goods and services or by a fall in the price of outputs. In addition, 23–25 

percent reported that they were severely affected by business failure or loss of employment.8,9 Only 1–5 percent of 

households had received any formal assistance, such as from government, NGOs, employers, or insurance.  

 
Sectoral and Institutional Context 

 
10. Over the 2000s, the Government of Ghana, with development partner assistance, has progressively introduced, 

expanded, and strengthened social protection programs targeted at the poor and vulnerable. Ghana’s main social 

protection programs as defined by the National Social Protection Policy (2015) comprise (i) the Livelihood Empowerment 


Against Poverty (LEAP) cash transfer program, (ii) the Labor-Intensive Public Works (LIPW) program, (iii) the Ghana School 

Feeding Program (GSFP), (iv) the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS), and (v) the Education Capitation Grant.  

 
11. The Government has progressively invested in strengthening the design and delivery of its flagship safety net 

programs. Specifically, the LEAP Cash Transfer program was initiated in 2008 to provide unconditional cash transfers to 

needy households in impoverished areas of the country. The program originally used geographic and categorical targeting 

to identify needy beneficiary households. In recent years, these forms of targeting have been supplemented by proxy 

means test (PMT)-based targeting, applied after categorical targeting. Benefits are distributed every two months, through 

payment points in or near LEAP communities; benefits can also be collected from local branches of partnering financial 

institutions or through ATMs. The program currently reaches 332,000 needy households across the country. The estimated 

program coverage rate ranges from 1.5 to 5 percent of the population based on alternative sources of data (national 

household survey data, government administrative information). The program is highly pro-poor: 74 percent of 

beneficiaries are either extreme or moderate poor. Benefits are currently a function of eligible members in the household. 

Although the Government of Ghana (GoG) has revised the benefits up two times since program inception, benefits remain 

unindexed to price inflation. As such, the average benefit level as a proportion of total consumption of beneficiary 

households was 12.8 percent in 2016/17, lower than the proportions typically observed in cash transfer programs in other 

countries that have been documented to have had sizeable positive impacts on welfare.10 

 
12. In addition, the Labor Intensive Public Works program was initiated in 2011 and offers temporary labor earnings 

opportunities during the agricultural off-season to needy households. In so doing, it also supports the creation, 

rehabilitation, and maintenance of public or community infrastructure. Typical public works activities relate to rural feeder 

and access roads, basic water infrastructure (small earth dams and dugouts), and environmental degradation and climate 

change mitigation activities (reforestation and afforestation, catchment and watershed protection, and biodiversity 

conservation), collectively determined by local officials and communities and consistent with their medium-term 

development plans. Overall responsibility for administering LIPW lies with MLGRD. LIPW is currently targeted at districts 

and communities with the highest poverty levels. Within selected communities, individuals (one per household) self-select 

into the program. At least 60 percent of participants are expected to be women, achieved through community 

sensitization, outreach, conductive work activities, working conditions and hours, and amenities. Participants can work a 

maximum 90 days per year during the agriculture off-season, for up to two consecutive seasons. LIPW wages are pegged 

at the national daily minimum wage, which is adjusted yearly. Private contractors are contracted to manage the works. In 

the current fiscal year, the program has supported 32,300 households in 80 districts, mainly in northern Ghana. Ninety 

percent of LIPW works sites have been in rural communities. 

 
13. More recently, the GoG also piloted a Productive Inclusion (PI) program to enhance the income-generating 

potential of the poor and vulnerable in northern Ghana. It provided training in life, general business management, and 

specific enterprise/livelihood development skills. It also provided business capital grants amounting to the cedi equivalent 

of US$200 (provided in tranches after beneficiaries completed the full set of training). The pilot PI program reached 7,200 

beneficiaries, compared to an original target of 3,150 beneficiaries; 80 percent of beneficiaries were women, compared 

to an original target of 50 percent. Important lessons learned from the pilot included the need for a well-designed and -

implemented digital program MIS, greater information and facilitation for beneficiaries to access productive inputs and 


output markets, and further capacity building of actors at the district and community levels engaged in implementation. 

A tracer study of PI program beneficiaries under GSOP is currently underway.   

 
14. The GoG’s commitment to Social Protection is further evidenced in the establishment of the Ministry of Gender, 

Children, and Social Protection (MoGCSP) in 2013, with the mandate to coordinate social protection programming. In 

2015, a National Social Protection Policy was approved by the Government, which sets the vision and guides efforts in the 

sector, including increased financing and harmonization of programs and increased coordination across key ministries 

involved in the social protection sector, namely MOGCSP, the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development 

(MLGRD), Ministry of Education, and the National Health Insurance Authority (NHIA) and across different government 

administrative levels (national, regional, and district). 

 

15. The Government has also introduced several system-level reforms and innovations to strengthen program 

delivery performance. Central among them is the continued rollout of the Ghana National Household Registry (GNHR), a 

national social registry; use of digital benefit payment systems; the use of digital program management information 

systems (MIS’s) covering the full program delivery chain; and the rollout of an integrated unified citizen engagement and 

grievance redress system, called the Single Window Citizen Engagement Service (SWCES). These reforms and innovations 

have improved program implementation performance, including transparency and integrity.  

 
16. These program and system-level improvements have been supported by various World Bank projects. Specifically, 

the $139 million Ghana Social Opportunities Project or GSOP (P115247), which was implemented between 2010–18, 

supported the Government in administering and strengthening LEAP, LIPW, and the pilot Productive Inclusion program. 

GSOP was rated by the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) as either satisfactory or substantial across all dimensions 

examined.11 The Ghana Productive Safety Net Project (GPSNP - P164603), which is currently under implementation by the 

Government, is a $60 million IPF operation that builds on GSOP. GPSNP became effective in July 2019 and supports the 

Government to strengthen its social safety net system toward improving the welfare and productivity of the poor. GPSNP 

is also supported by the United Kingdom Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office (UK FCDO) through a 

Recipient- and Bank-Executed Trust Fund of £21 million.12 The project’s support has been coordinated with that of other 

development partners, including the European Union (EU), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), and the United 

States Agency for International Development (USAID). The project comprises of five main components: (i) Productive 

Inclusion, (ii) LEAP Cash Transfers, (iii) LIPW program, (iv) SP Systems Strengthening, and (v) Project Management.  

 
17. These IDA-financed projects have contributed to strengthening the design and implementation of the LEAP 

program and its underlying system, including the capacity of the MoGCSP, the MLGRD, and other government and private 

actors involved in implementation. Recent such initiatives have included the development and implementation of a digital 

LEAP MIS, PMT formula and PMT-based targeting, and digital payments.13 Under LIPW, improvements have included a 

digital program MIS; digital wage payments; capacity development of district officials, private contractors, and community 

facilitators; and information, communication, and engagement (ICE) activities, including grievance redressal. The projects 

have covered the full program costs of works contracts and beneficiary wages.  

 


18. In addition, the PI program is currently being scaled up in northern Ghana under the GPSNP, incorporating 

measures to improve program implementation based on lessons learned from GSOP. The program targets some of the 

poorest districts and rural communities. Within these communities, LEAP and LIPW households receive preferential 

treatment for PI participation. Under GPSNP, the PI program aims to reach a total of 18,000 beneficiaries; at present, 

8,000 beneficiaries are receiving training and are expected to receive the first tranches of their capital grants shortly. As 

under the pilot, most beneficiaries are women, driven by a combination of endogenous household decision-making 

regarding which members work where and conducive program rules and procedures.  The PI program supports both farm 

and nonfarm income-generating activities; the former is supported through links to the World Bank’s Ghana Commercial 

Agriculture Project (P162525). Behavioral interventions to support improved financial decision-making of PI beneficiaries 

and their households are also being tested with the assistance of ideas42, an international nonprofit consulting firm 

focused on behavioral program design. The welfare effects of the PI intervention are being evaluated by the World Bank 

based on a randomized phase-in design.  

 

19. Systems Strengthening was also supported through these projects. Specifically, the GNHR was established to 

improve targeting for social protection programs and other poverty alleviation initiatives in Ghana. Launched in 2015 

under GSOP, GNHR completed data collection for two out of the three targeted regions. Under GSOP, GNHR completed 

data collection for the Upper East and Upper West Regions, the poorest regions in Ghana. Subsequently, through GPSNP, 

GNHR completed data collection for 400,000 households in October 2020 in three Northern Regions,14 and currently 

preparing to begin data collection in two additional regions – Volta and Central. GSOP and GPSNP were both instrumental 

in developing a fully functional management information system to track enumeration activities, including the use of 

geographical information systems. The GNHR system was also used to collect emergency data during the COVID-19 

pandemic when data was required to identify poor and vulnerable people within the lockdown areas who needed support. 

 
20. The Government initiated the SWCES in 2017 to streamline grievance redress mechanisms for social protection 

beneficiaries, but also to address other vulnerabilities handled by the MoGCSP. The SWCES includes (i) a toll-free hotline 

which receives calls from across the country, with agents responding between 8am and 5pm on weekdays, and a voice 

mail system after hours and on weekends; and (ii) a digitized referral directory, which is continuously updated. During the 

COVID-19 pandemic in Ghana, the call center was instrumental in receiving grievances from vulnerable individuals who 

required food aid during the lock down period.  A total of 1,315 out of 1,978 cases were from individuals who required 

aid. 

 
21. GPSNP has also supported the Government in developing and implementing an information, communication, and 

engagement strategy in relation to the pandemic for social safety net beneficiaries and communities and implementing 

health protective measures in the program delivery chain to protect personnel, beneficiaries, and communities from 

COVID-19 infection, including measures to comply with infection mitigation directives by the Government. 

 
22. GPSNP was restructured in August 2020 to intensify the Government’s social safety net response to the pandemic. 

Specifically, funds have been reallocated within the project to allow for previous and planned emergency cash transfers 

to existing LEAP program beneficiaries and to new beneficiary groups. The reallocation also allowed for, among other 

things, accelerated, intensive efforts under GNHR and SWCES. To date, the project has disbursed $40 million, and expects 

to exhaust its financing by March 2022.  

 
14 Ghana’s administrative system had 10 regions during GSOP implementation but expanded to 16 at the onset of GPSNP. As such GNHR will have 

to reach all 16 regions of Ghana, instead of the previous 10. 


23. The Government has requested GPSNP 2 toward the following ends: 

 

• Scale up PI, LIPW, and LEAP to cover more households that are poor, vulnerable, or hard-hit by the COVID-induced 
economic crisis in both rural and urban areas; 

• Strengthen the social protection program delivery infrastructure, including the completion of GNHR; 

• Continue the further integration of ICT solutions into the program delivery chain, including monitoring; and 

• Integrate structures and processes that improve the shock-resilience and -responsiveness of the social protection 
system. 

24. These directions consistent with the priorities and directions of the Government’s overall COVID response. They 

are also consistent with the aims and directions in the World Bank’s Board documents WBG COVID-19 Crisis Response 

Approach Paper – Saving Lives, Scaling-up Impact and Getting Back on Track and Protecting the Poor and Vulnerable: 

Social Response Framework for COVID19.  

 
Relationship to CPF 

 
25. The World Bank’s Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) for Ghana, published in 2018, identifies four pathways 

toward the achievement of the World Bank’s twin goals of eliminating extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity in 

Ghana. These pathways comprise (i) addressing inequality and vulnerability, (ii) improving macroeconomic management 

and economic diversification, (iii) increasing better-quality jobs and opportunities, and (iv) strengthening governance and 

government effectiveness.15 Consistent with this SCD, the World Bank’s Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for Ghana, 

currently under preparation, identifies three focus areas: (i) improving equitable access to services for improved human 

capital development, (ii) enhancing conditions for diversified growth and job creation, and (iii) promoting resilient 

development. Under these focus areas, specific objectives have been formulated.  

 
26. The proposed efforts under GPSNP 2 to strengthen and expand cash transfers, productive inclusion (cash grants; 

business and life skill training; savings support; access to inputs, services, and markets), labor-intensive public works 

(involving rehabilitation of water resources infrastructure, forestation, and conservation), and health insurance to needy 

households are consistent with the objectives of all three CPF focus areas. Specifically, the project’s proposed efforts are 

in accordance with the following CPF objectives: (i) improved utilization of health services for the poor and vulnerable 

(objective 1.2), (ii) improved connectivity for access to markets and productive opportunities (objective 2.1), (iii) increased 

financial inclusion and access to financial services (objective 2.3), (iv) enhanced market relevant skills and income 

opportunities (objective 2.4), (v) improved adoption of sustainable natural resource management (objective 3.2), and (vi) 

improved household preparedness for shocks (objective 3.3).  

 
 
C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  

 
To support the Government to expand and enhance social safety nets that improve the incomes and productivity of 
the poor 

 

 

Key Results (From PCN) 
 

1. Number of households that receive the full set of support through the Productive Inclusion (PI) program and start 
a new, or enhance an existing, income-generating activity  

2. Number of households that participate in the Labor-Intensive Public Works (LIPW) program 
3. Number of households that receive cash benefits from the Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP) 

program 
4. Number of social protection programs that use data from the Ghana National Household Registry (GNHR) to 

target benefits and services to intended beneficiaries 
 
 
D. Concept Description 

 
27. The proposed GPSNP 2 will be an IPF of $100 million, spanning four years. It is composed of six components (with 

tentative allocations) as follows:  

• Component 1: Productive Inclusion program (US$15 million) 

• Component 2: Labor-Intensive Public Works program (US$25 million) 

• Component 3: Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty program (US$25 million) 

• Component 4: Social Protection System Strengthening (US$28 million) 

• Component 5: Project Management, Coordination, and Capacity Building (US$7 million) 

• Component 6: Contingency Emergency Response (US$0 million) 

 
28. Components 1-3 represent the main interventions supported by GPSNP 2. Components 4 and 5 underpin the main 

interventions by supporting social protection system functioning and improvement. Important initiatives such as GNHR, 

SEWES, and the extension of health insurance coverage are reflected under the system-related components, as are, more 

generally, monitoring and evaluation; information, communication, engagement, and grievance redressal; capacity 

development across implementing ministries and administrative levels (national, region, district, and community); and 

reforms to the system to enhance shock resilience and responsiveness. Component 6 offers built-in flexibility to the project 

to rapidly reallocate financing to support needed relief and recovery initiatives for the poor and vulnerable in the event 

of a future disaster or crisis that affects the country.         

Project Beneficiaries 
29. The interventions under GPSNP 2 aim to protect and raise the welfare of poor and vulnerable households across 

Ghana. Reaching the poor and vulnerable will follow, in part, from targeting interventions to the poorest communities, in 

both rural and urban areas. Direct beneficiaries of some of the programs (for example, LIPW and PI) will be at the individual 

level. The digital MIS’s for the various programs, GNHR, and sample-based field surveys by contracted third parties will 

provide beneficiary information at both the household and individual levels, allowing for breakdowns of beneficiary 

numbers by different socioeconomic and demographic characteristics (for example, location, gender, age, disability status, 

welfare status).  

 
30. Over the project implementation period, GPSNP 2 will support the Government to reach the following cumulative 

beneficiary numbers: (i) 45,000 households under PI, (ii) 45,000 households under LIPW, and (iii) 400,000 households 

under LEAP. GPSNP 2 will also support the extension of NHIS coverage and facilitation services to access and use health 

services to PI, LIPW, and LEAP beneficiary populations.

Summary of Screening of Environmental and Social Risks and Impacts 
.  

 
The Environmental Risk Rating is moderate. The environmental risks and impacts expected from the LIPW subprojects, such 
as rehabilitation and maintenance of small earth dams, dugouts, and rural feeder and access roads; cultivation of fruit trees 
and tree crops as part of the climatic change initiatives and provision of water, household toilets and community solid waste 
collection services will present low to moderate environment risks. The potential risks and impacts are, however, specific 
and may include erosion, siltation, flooding, dust generation, road safety hazards, waterborne diseases, generation and 
disposal of spoils and waste, and health and safety issues. Cultivation of fruit trees and crops may require the use agro-
chemicals. These expected risks and impacts are envisaged to be low to medium in magnitude, temporary, site-specific and 
largely reversible.  
 
The Social Risk Rating is moderate. This classification is based on the potential social risks and impacts and the capacity of 
the implementing agencies to manage the risks and impacts. The project builds on experiences and lessons from the 
ongoing GPSNP (P164603) and successor project GSOP (P115247) and seeks to improve productivity, social inclusion, 
expanding income earning opportunities to poor households, and providing relief to extremely poor households due to the 
COVID-19 pandemic.  
 
While the project activities are expected to have positive impacts, some social risks and impacts are envisaged. The 
proposed project activities are small-scale; however, the activities that may generate social risks include the proposed 
rehabilitation and maintenance of rural feeder and access roads and small earth dams and dugouts; construction of of 
WASH facilities and provision of cash grants and cash transfers to extremely poor households. Other social risks and impacts 
envisaged include project ability to manage local labour issues and localized economic displacement arising from land use; 
addressing community health and safety issues, ensuring social inclusion and preventing elite capture of project 
interventions; and putting in place robust framework for Stakeholder engagement and addressing grievances and SEA/SH 
prevention.
