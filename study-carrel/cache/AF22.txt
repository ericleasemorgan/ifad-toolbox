Executive Summary 

Project Overview: In Guinea, agriculture remains at the core of development policies and the main source of 
income for 631%  of people living in rural areas, and generates 80% of the country's jobs. It contributes about 
25% to GDP and employs nearly 80% of the Guinean population. Rice is the dominant food crop, accounting for 
67% of the area cultivated, 65% of the country's cereal requirements, 37% of the workforce, 80% of farmers, 
23% of primary GDP and 6% of national GDP. On average, rice represents 20% of the population's consumption 
budget. To compensate for the food deficit, around 600 000 tonnes of rice are imported yearly. The Support 
Project for the Transformation of Guinean Agriculture and Youth Agricultural Entrepreneurship (PATAG EAJ) 
was designed as part of a participatory and inclusive approach involving all stakeholders – farmers’ organisations, 
local communities and devolved technical services. The discussions and studies conducted with the PATAG EAJ 
Project Preparation Facility (PPF) in 2018 led to a thorough assessment of the situation and to identify not only 
the investments needed for the transformation of Guinea’s agriculture through promotion of the rice and market 
gardening value chains, but also the implementation modalities most appropriate for the Boké and Boffa 
Prefectures. In formulating PATAG EAJ, account was also taken of the country’s fragile context, lessons from 
Bank projects and those of other partners in Guinea, and the need to develop synergies and complementarities. 
In view of the Bank’s strategic orientations for the country, the project was designed with special emphasis on 
the following: (i) irrigation and market access infrastructure; (ii) value chain development; (iii) decent youth 
employment, empowerment of women and promotion of women’s leadership; and (iv) improvement of resilience 
and adaptation to the impacts of climate change. 

The specific goal of the proposed project, which is expected to cost UA 8.987 million and span a four-
year implementation period, is to ensure the development of climate-smart agricultural value chains and the 
promotion of youth entrepreneurship through the sustainable revival of rice production and market gardening 
value chains in the Boké and Boffa Prefectures. In addition to the basic transformative infrastructure that will 
result from the project (development of 237 ha of lowlands comprising 25 ha for off-season market gardening 
based on the use of shallow wells, 50 ha for seed production, 15 ha for women's gardening activities and 31 ha 
for youth-run modern market gardening activities; 65.5 km of access roads, 1 weekly market/consolidation centre, 
2 markets (stalls), and 6 stores and 2 input shops.), the project will support 20 agricultural processing units and 
contribute to the dissemination of 25 innovative techniques for increasing productivity (TAAT), improving 
storage and promoting food processing. These activities will be accompanied by local and organisational capacity 
building, and special attention will be paid to the creation of value added, youth employment and 
entrepreneurship, and to women's empowerment. PATAG EAJ will target at least 1 000 young people and 
women, 5 000 producers, 200 seed companies, 100 groups and 20 women’s and youth unions. It will affect a 
total 39 252 direct beneficiaries and 247 287 indirect beneficiaries through its various activities. The project will 
eventually increase rice production by about 1 030 tonnes, including 210 tonnes of certified seeds, and market 
gardening production by about 2 000 tonnes, generating a 19% boost in income. It will create 3 526 direct decent 
jobs, including 147 jobs generated by agricultural development works, 2 780 jobs by strengthening 
entrepreneurship and SMEs, and 600 temporary jobs. 

Needs Assessment: The project area covers two prefectures - Boké and Boffa - located in agricultural 
development hubs A and D, whose hydro-agricultural and socioeconomic potential requires the establishment of 
a rehabilitation and upgrading mechanism, in light of several factors: (i) the existence of high development 
potential (rice farming and market gardening); (ii) the proximity of consumption areas (Boké, Kamsar, Sangarédi, 
Fria Kindia, Boffa, Dubréka, Conakry, etc.); and (iii) current and future Bank interventions (the Forécariah road, 
the Boké-Quebo road and the future Boké agricultural hub). The project is based on the geographic concentration 
of operations at sector, village and priority site level, designed to maximise impact on target groups and to 
guarantee the sustainability and visibility of activities. 

In line with the country's strategic orientations, PATAG EAJ will contribute to the improvement of productivity 
and production in priority sectors by transforming Guinean agriculture and improving food and nutritional 
security through rice production and market gardening. The country has an annual rice deficit of more than 600 
000 tonnes. The project will also develop market gardening, whose current production covers only 53% of needs. 
This activity will help to improve the nutritional status of the beneficiaries, contribute to women’s empowerment 
and develop youth entrepreneurship. Therefore, the project will serve as a catalyst for agricultural expansion in 
the area by facilitating water control and the development of abundant quality natural resources (water, soil and 
solar energy), strengthening agricultural infrastructure, promoting sustainable, resilient and smart production,

packaging and processing technologies, and facilitating access to product markets by supporting the growth of 
the two strategic sectors, i.e. rice production and market gardening.  

Value-added for the African Development Bank: Agriculture remains at the core of development policies 
and the main source of employment. The Bank financed the Nerica Rice Development Project, the Upper Guinea 
Rural Development Support Project (PADER-HG) and the Beyla-Kérouané Agro-Pastoral Development Project 
(PRODABEK), etc. These operations made it possible to develop certain specific expertise and provide new 
insights into key areas (irrigation, seed production and control, processing, etc.). To consolidate these gains, the 
Bank will support the Government in financing the Support Project for the Transformation of Guinean 
Agriculture and Youth Agricultural Entrepreneurship (PATAG EAJ), in an effort to encourage the emergence of 
production hubs. By supporting the development of infrastructure in areas that are economically and socially 
disadvantaged, but endowed with huge irrigated agriculture potential, the Bank will contribute to reducing 
poverty, promoting decent employment for young people and women, strengthening adaptation to climate change 
and increasing the resilience of people vulnerable to food and nutrition insecurity. 

Knowledge Building: PATAG EAJ will help to train producers and consolidate their expertise. In an inclusive 
way, it will enable young people and women to develop technical and entrepreneurial capacity by accessing 
modern factors of farming, and will promote the emergence of leadership. In terms of resilience to climate change, 
it will develop and disseminate innovative technologies in the agricultural sector for the production, storage and 
processing of agricultural products, while enhancing local knowledge. PATAG EAJ will support the development 
of expertise in drip irrigation and solar pumping techniques, as well as in new processing technologies. In 
addition, support for quality improvement and labelling/certification will help to ensure compliance with norms 
and standards that promote access to new markets. Knowledge building will also be carried out through 
mechanisms for the communication and capitalisation of project results and best practice, and generation of 
endogenous value for the benefit of vulnerable groups via value chain development. Therefore, this project will 
contribute greatly to improving the attractiveness of the agricultural sector for private enterprise and youth 
employability.

GUINEA: SUPPORT PROJECT FOR THE TRANSFORMATION OF GUINEAN 
AGRICULTURE AND YOUTH AGRICULTURAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP (PATAG EAJ) 

 
Management hereby submits this report and recommendations concerning a proposal to extend a UA 
4.63 million loan and award a UA 3.24 million grant from the Transition Support Facility (TSF) to 
the Republic of Guinea to finance the Support Project for the Transformation of Guinean Agriculture 
and Youth Agricultural Entrepreneurship (PATAG EAJ). 

I- Strategic Thrust and Rationale 

1.1. Linkages with Country Strategy and Objectives 

1.1.1 In Guinea, agriculture remains at the core of development policies and the main source of income 
for 57% of people living in rural areas, and creates 80% of the country's jobs. It contributes about 23% to 
GDP and employs nearly 80% of the Guinean workforce. In the medium term, it will remain the engine of 
growth and the source of jobs, and an indispensable sector for achieving the objectives of poverty reduction 
and food security in Guinea. Rice is the dominant food crop, accounting for 67% of the area cultivated, 
65% of the country's cereal requirements, 37% of the workforce, 80% of farmers, 23% of primary GDP 
and 6% of national GDP. On average, rice represents 20% of the population's consumption budget. To 
compensate for the food deficit, around 600 000 tonnes of rice are imported yearly, representing about 15% 
of requirements. The rate of coverage of market gardening was 53% in 2015. 

1.1.2 In addition to occupying the 12th place among the most fragile countries, Guinea ranked 183rd out 
of 188 countries in the 2017 Human Development Report. The level of poverty has remained high, with 
the incidence of poverty rising from 41.9% in 2002 to 55.2% in 2012. About 80% of Guineans live in rural 
areas, where poverty is exacerbated by the lack of production infrastructure, basic social services and access 
to markets. The sector's contribution to economic growth was only 0.99% in 2015. The agricultural 
subsector is the driver of growth in the primary sector, but its contribution to the growth of the rural sector 
remains considerable, and stood at 4.1% in 2015.  The sector’s performance has been weak in terms of: (i) 
the cereal balance sheet; (ii) the productivity and processing level; and (iii) entrepreneurial capacity. The 
lack of infrastructure for improved access, production with poor water management and processing stifles 
the development of value chains, product competitiveness and improvement of the living conditions of 
Guineans. The principal challenge is to strengthen institutional, economic and social resilience while 
building the capacity of actors and reducing disparities between men and women, and to support the 
country's structural transformation by setting up key infrastructure for inclusive and green growth. The 
transformation of agriculture through the development of value chains, the promotion of youth employment 
and agricultural entrepreneurship, gender mainstreaming and increased involvement of non-State actors 
(including civil society and the private sector), will help to strengthen the resilience and mitigate the 
economic, socio-demographic and environmental dimensions of the country's fragility.  

1.1.3 In pursuing its objective to develop agricultural value chains, PATAG EAJ will help in increasing 
the sector’s contribution to GDP and in creating jobs and business opportunities by promoting the rice and 
market gardening sectors in targeted areas. It is an essential response for supporting production and 
processing activities, and contributing to the improvement of the people's living conditions by promoting 
value chains and creating entrepreneurship opportunities for young people and women. Therefore, it will 
contribute to the operationalisation of the National Economic and Social Development Plan (PNDES) 
2016-2020, which is in line with the 2040 forward-looking vision for a prosperous and emerging Guinea 
reliant on the agricultural sector to ensure that: (i) the productivity of the primary sector is doubled between 
2014 and 2020; (ii) food security is assured (reducing the incidence of food poverty from 18.2% in 2012 
to 9.1% in 2020); and (iii) sustainable agriculture is promoted. PATAG EAJ aligns squarely with the four 
PNDES pillars: (i) promotion of good governance for sustainable development; (ii) sustainable and 
inclusive economic transformation; (iii) inclusive human capital development; and (iv) sustainable natural 
capital management. This project is also in synergy with the various existing strategies, including the 
revised National Agricultural Development Policy (PNDA 2016-2025), the overall objective of which will 



 

2 

be to increase the contribution of the agricultural sector to food security, nutrition and reduction of poverty 
among Guineans by boosting growth and agricultural trade through: (a) increased productivity; (b) 
improved access to promising markets; and (c) improved governance of the agricultural sector. PATAG 
EAJ also concords seamlessly with: (1) the National Agricultural Investment and Food and Nutrition 
Security Plan (PNIASAN); (2) the Accelerated Programme of Food and Nutrition Security and Sustainable 
Agricultural Development (PASANDAD), the precursor to the implementation of PNIASAN through four 
components: (i) promotion of a favourable environment for sector development (promotion of 
transformative investments and the institutional framework); (ii) strengthening agricultural chains 
(structuring of actors and improving the performance of agricultural chains); (iii) promoting nutrition and 
gender; and (iv) sustainable natural resource management. 

1.2. Rationale for Bank Intervention 

1.2.1 Despite having many assets (fertile soils, water resources, fishery resources, etc.), Guinea still 
faces poverty (72% below the poverty line) and food insecurity (around 18%). The low unemployment 
rate (5.2% in 2014) in fact masks the scope of underemployment, unstable jobs and disparities. The 
unemployment rates of graduates of vocational schools and higher education institutions stand at 27.7% 
and 34.7%, respectively. Poverty is essentially rural, with a rate of about 80%, although these areas have 
proven hydro-agricultural potential. Rice is the staple food and the food deficit is filled annually by 
imports of about 600,000 tonnes. The main constraints facing the sector include: inaccessibility to 
production areas, poor water management, degradation of production systems, especially the mangroves 
owing to salinity and acidity, poor access to inputs, and low processing capacity. The aim of various 
strategies put in place is to reverse that trend, in particular by boosting investments in the agricultural 
sector and in production, marketing and processing infrastructure, and by promoting youth 
entrepreneurship and private sector involvement. It is vital to develop potential water resources and 
optimise the soil resource management, and to add value to products by reducing post-harvest losses 
through storage and quality processing that will open access to various markets. PATAG EAJ will fulfil 
that mission by modernising systems and factors of production, improving access to production areas, 
restructuring actors and improving conservation, processing and marketing conditions, with increased 
attention to value chains, youth/women's employment, and learning. PATAG EAJ is also a tool for 
implementing the CSP (2018-2022), which is built on two pillars: improving access to energy (Pillar 
1); and developing agricultural and industrial value chains (Pillar 2). Since it supports the 
transformation of the Guinean agricultural sector, this project is founded on Pillar 2. Through the 
development of agricultural value chains, agribusiness and agricultural entrepreneurship, it will 
contribute to inclusive and green growth, and to the improvement of people's living conditions. The 
project is in synergy with current and future operations, including those related to the construction of 
the Boké-Québo road and the Agricultural Processing Area Project. The area of intervention was also 
chosen based on the presence of an agricultural economic hub with identified potential in the rice and 
market gardening sectors. Hence, this project will seek to build on ongoing activities in targeted 
intervention areas and ensure complementarity to create greater impact. 

1.2.2 The objectives of PATAG EAJ are consistent with the Bank’s "High 5s", which aim to feed 
Africa by 2025 and improve the people’s living conditions through the development of agricultural 
value chains, build the capacity of stakeholders, create jobs and generate income. The project is aligned 
on the Bank's Ten-Year Strategy (TYS) 2013-2022 and its two guiding objectives of inclusive growth 
and transition to green growth, as well as three areas of special interest: gender, agriculture and food 
and nutrition security. It plugs into the Bank's Strategy for Addressing Fragility and Building Resilience 
in Africa, and will help in achieving the objectives of the Enable Youth Initiative and the Jobs for Youth 
in Africa Strategy by creating opportunities for young people. It is consistent with the Bank's 
Technologies for African Agricultural Transformation (TAAT) programme, which focuses on the 
adoption of new production and processing technologies in agricultural value chains. Specifically, it is 
in harmony with climate change adaptation initiatives by promoting renewable energies, water-saving 
techniques and resilient systems.

1.3. Aid Coordination  

Development aid is coordinated by the Government of Guinea through the Coordination and Consultation 
Framework (CCC) of the Permanent Secretariat in the Prime Minister’s Office. In addition to the CCC, a 
strategic mechanism for coordination between the Government and technical and financial partners (TFPs), 
a technical monitoring committee (TMC) to strengthen inter-sector coordination, and thematic dialogue 
groups (TDGs) bringing together TFP and Government representatives have been set up at the sector level. 
The "rural development, food security and environment" thematic group is chaired by the World Bank for 
TFPs, and the Ministry of Agriculture for the Government. Through its Country Office in Guinea (COGN), 
the Bank is an active member of the CCC and some TDGs. The key ongoing projects with an agricultural 
value chains and youth agricultural entrepreneurship support component backed by TFPs, and with which 
PATAG EAJ will need to develop synergies, are highlighted in Volume 2. The project will also establish 
synergies with Bank projects: the Boké-Quebo Road Construction Project with a rural roads component 
for the supply of agricultural products (ongoing) and the Boké Agropole Agricultural Processing Area 
Project (2019). In the wider rural sector (agriculture, livestock, fisheries, and environment), the intervention 
of the different partners is presented in Annex A4 of Volume 2, and is summarised as follows:

II- Project Description  

2.1. Project Objectives and Components  

2.1.1 PATAG EAJ’s sector goal is to help foster strong and inclusive economic growth. The specific 
objectives are to contribute to the development of climate-smart agricultural and agribusiness value 
chains, and to promote youth agricultural entrepreneurship in the Boké and Boffa Prefectures. It will: 
(i) help to boost production and productivity, and improve access to production and processing factors 
and markets; (ii) contribute to the development of climate-smart agricultural value chains that can 
employ a high number of young people and women; (iii) help to improve access to basic socioeconomic 
services for economic development; and (iv) build the capacity of the stakeholders involved in 
implementing PNIASAN/PASANDAD to achieve the objectives of PNDES in general, and of the 
PNDA in particular, and for better sector governance. 

2.1.2 PATAG EAJ was designed in light of results and lessons from the Bank's experience in the 
country and in the sub-region, acquired from efficient operating procedures, targeting of high-impact 
priority activities, and strong stakeholder involvement. The activities will take place in the two hubs – 



 

4 

A (Boffa) and D (Boké) – and will target poor, highly inaccessible areas with huge agricultural potential. 
Beyond the development of production, processing and marketing infrastructure in the areas concerned, 
the project will support: (i) the strengthening of the organisational and technical capacity of actors, 
particularly young people and women; (ii) the promotion of processing and marketing through the 
dissemination of new technologies (TAAT) and support for product labelling; (iii) the promotion of 
youth entrepreneurship and women’s empowerment; and (iv) the improvement of governance in the 
sector through the organisation of beneficiaries and capacity building. The selection and involvement 
of committed farmers, the choice of proven techniques and transformative actions will aim to ensure 
the sustainability of interventions and infrastructure. PATAG EAJ will support 5 000 farmers, 1 000 
young people and women, 100 seed growers, 100 groups and 20 unions, and will impact 39 252 direct 
beneficiaries and 247 287 indirect beneficiaries through its different activities. It will be implemented 
over a four-year period (January 2019 - December 2022) and will include three components, 
summarised below.

2.2. Technical Solutions Adopted and Alternatives Explored  

2.2.1 The technical solutions used in PATAG EAJ are based on field data and lessons learned from 
similar projects, and based on design methods adapted to the specific context of the intervention area. 
It involves development of medium-sized sites of lowlands with access to new technologies and solar 
energy for the dewatering. 



 

5 

 

2.2.2 The technical options selected took into consideration the ease of work management and 
equipment, the willingness of the beneficiaries to adhere and adopt these choices. The main arguments 
are: (i) to maximize the intensification level in these areas where two campaigns can be made, (ii) to 
achieve better water efficiency and control; (iii) to introduce solar energy, clean and renewable resource 
and appropriate mechanization; (iv) to promote new irrigation technologies through the introduction of 
drip systems, (v) mastering management and maintenance aspects to ensure sustainability. 

Table 2.2: Alternatives Explored and Reasons for Rejection 

Alternative Short Description Reason for Rejection 

Development of one large 
area, with total water 
control where the project 
would be concentrated 

Build a large pumping station, 
coated water transport channels 
with large civil engineering 
structures for water collection, 
supply and delivery for the 
various blocks and 
neighbourhoods 

This alternative is not technically feasible and does not 
ensure the availability of labour, in terms of both quantity 
and quality, for the development of the facilities and the 
investments to be made. It is highly likely that the area 
will not be fully exploited, since available labour on 
several sites close to small villages or large towns can be 
used to better exploit irrigated areas and develop the 
facilities. 

Development of market 
gardening areas with 
improved wells without 
any means of dewatering 

Build large-diameter wells at a 
rate of one well per hectare where 
irrigation water is manually 
drawn and carried by farmers to 
the parcels 

The challenge for the development of market gardening 
production is the manual removal of water from wells. 
This takes up a considerable amount of work time in 
return for mediocre efficiency and makes the task, which 
is performed mostly by women, very tedious and limits 
the production capacity of women involved in market 
gardening, consequently leading to a loss of interest. This 
method is also only feasible on small gardens not 
exceeding a few dozen square metres, especially during 
the dry season, when the demand for water is high. 

Development of 
intermediate animal-
draught cultivation 
instead of motorized 
ploughing 

Animal-draught cultivation in the 
project regions is adapted to light 
soils and a limited amount of 
moisture for high productivity. 
Its effectiveness depends highly 
on the physical state of the area to 
be ploughed 

The large areas of arable land in the region, the short 
period conducive to land preparation and the reduction of 
the rainy season impede animal-draught cultivation and 
militate in favour of mechanised ploughing. 
Consolidation of the network of agricultural 
mechanisation service providers in the project area will 
contribute to the achievement of this objective. 

2.3. Project Type  

PATAG EAJ is an investment operation financed from TSF resources. The Government of Guinea has 
not yet committed to implementing programmes using the sector approach, given a number of 
institutional constraints and fragility context. The project approach is the most appropriate, to ensure 
the achievement of results and the efficient and effective use of the resources allocated to the project. 

2.4. Project Cost and Financing Arrangements  

2.4.1 The cost of the project is estimated at UA 8.987 million or GNF 113 274 million. The foreign 
exchange portion is UA 3.845 million and constitutes 43% of the total cost. Customs duty and taxes are 
the responsibility of the State, which must take the necessary measures to ensure the enforcement of 
this provision. The provision for physical contingencies is expressed as a percentage of the base cost 
(5%) and applied for civil engineering works, mainly in the form of construction/rehabilitation of 
irrigation facilities, roads, markets, stores, shops and storage centres. The provision for price escalation, 
commonly referred to as "financial contingencies", is calculated based on the inflation level. The 
inflation rate used was 8%. The breakdown of project cost is presented in the tables below, by 
component and expenditure category. An expenditure schedule by component is also provided. The

2.4.2 The project will be financed through a grant of UA 3.24 million and a loan of UA 4.63 million 
from the TSF, representing 87.6% of the project cost, net of taxes and customs duty. The Government's 
financial participation, estimated at UA 0.898 million, will be limited to covering the costs of taxes and 
customs duty, and the establishment of a revolving fund for the procurement of inputs (fertilisers and 
seeds). The contribution of beneficiaries will be limited to their participation in routine maintenance 
and upkeep, which can easily be carried out, and their 10% participation in the financing of young 
entrepreneurship projects, estimated at UA 0.220 million. The breakdown by source of financing is

2.5. Project Beneficiaries and Target Area  

2.5.1 The project area, consisting of the Boffa and Boké Prefectures (A and D hubs), is part of the 
Boké region, located in the North-West of the Republic of Guinea. The Boké region covers an area of 
35 234 km² and has 5 prefectures (Boké, Boffa, Fria, Gaoual and Koundara), 32 rural municipal councils 
(“communes”) and 5 urban municipal councils. The region’s climate is conducive to agriculture, with 
abundant rainfall in coastal areas (2 500-3 000 mm/year) that decreases gradually towards the north to 
800 mm and 1 000 mm in Gaoual and Koundara. Estimated at 1 190 724 inhabitants (INS/Demographic 
Prospects, General Population and Housing Census (RGPH3), 2017 projection), the Boké region 
population is highly cosmopolitan and is primarily engaged in agro-pastoral activities. The average 
population density is 32 inhabitants/km². 

2.5.2 The Boké region is one of the most important bauxite areas in Guinea. Currently, 14 mining 
companies are active in the region, attracting a large number of people to the area (accelerated 
population growth), with growing demand for food and nutrition. Young people, who account for more 
than 60% of the region's population and the bulk of its agricultural workforce, are abandoning 
agriculture and opting for work in the mining sector. They are involved in the social unrest that the area 
has been experiencing because of its status as the bauxite basin par excellence. 

2.5.3 The intervention sites were selected based on an analysis comprising multiple criteria: (i) 
accessibility; (ii) existence of a participatory and community/local operating set-up; (iii) absence of 
latent land conflict; and (iv) overall consistency with project objectives (availability of labour, level of 
organisation and spirit of initiative of future beneficiaries, expertise and participation of women and 
young people). Various types of sites have been pre-identified: (i) development of lowlands: with partial 
control of irrigation water (sites in rice-cultivation lowlands), and with total control of irrigation water 
(Koba sites for rice seed growers and mixed rice cultivation and market gardening areas in the Boké 
area); (ii) mixed areas of rice cultivation and market gardening alternating over the agricultural year 
with total water control; (ii) market gardening areas (wells, solar pumping equipment, loading tank and 
drip irrigation). 



 

8 

2.5.4  The population of the area is mainly engaged in agriculture (rice, maize, cassava, groundnuts, 
sorghum/millet, cowpeas, market garden produce, cashew nuts, etc.), livestock farming and trade. 
Traditional and family-type agriculture faces various challenges, including lack of or dilapidated state 
of facilities, difficulty of accessing factors of production (certified seeds, quality inputs, ploughing and 
post-harvest equipment, etc.) and markets. Women are involved in all rural agricultural activities and 
participate mainly in work on rice fields and market gardens, as well as in produce processing and 
marketing. The project is aimed at small farmers, particularly women and young people, who constitute 
the bulk of the vulnerable segments of the population in terms of food and nutrition insecurity and 
poverty. The project will reach 1 000 young people and women, 5 000 farmers, 200 seed growers, 100 
groups and 20 unions. Other direct targets are artisans, processors, traders, young entrepreneurs, 
students in pilot school canteens, various service providers and NGOs, etc. Through its activities, 
PATAG EAJ will reach 39 252 direct beneficiaries and 247 287 indirect beneficiaries. 

2.6. Participatory Approach for Project Identification, Design and Implementation  

2.6.1 The project design is the result of a participatory process that involved all stakeholders: 
government departments, farmers’ organisations, women's groups, civil society, private sector, TFPs, 
projects, etc. Initiated as part of implementation of PATAG EAJ PPF activities, these broad 
consultations continued during the project preparation and appraisal mission. Consultation meetings 
organised in each of the two prefectures with all the parties (decentralised technical services, NGOs and 
support and advisory associations, local authorities, beneficiary representatives, including women) led 
to a consensual identification of the challenges and needs of the intervention area, and for the two sectors 
concerned. Focused discussions with local institutional and civil society partners and visits to various 
potential sites, followed by working sessions with beneficiaries, including women and young people, 
made it possible to draw up an exhaustive inventory of development needs in the area and to identify 
the support needs for the two sectors and the most appropriate methods of implementation, as well as 
the appropriate measures for the effective action. The sites and activities were chosen following several 
investigations and fruitful discussions with the beneficiaries and other stakeholders. 

2.6.2 This participatory process revealed strong enthusiasm for the project and a broad consensus on 
its design and implementation methods. For instance, farmers reaffirmed the need to fully exploit the 
high potential of the intervention area (land, natural watercourses, mangroves, lowlands, etc.). Women 
emphasised their interest in market gardening, farm produce processing and marketing with 
modernisation of production and processing tools, and improved market access. During visits to various 
sites, stock was taken of existing facilities and infrastructure, and technological options to be adopted 
for their construction/rehabilitation proposed. Developing a good communication plan around PATAG 
EAJ and maintaining the participatory approach during its implementation will ensure that local actors 
take ownership of the project during its execution.  

2.7. Consideration of Bank Group Experience and Lessons Learned in the Project Design  

2.7.1 PATAG EAJ design drew largely from lessons learned from projects executed by the Bank in 
Guinea and the sub-region, with every effort made to reflect the context of the country's fragility and to 
address some of the weaknesses identified during project implementation and highlighted in portfolio 
reviews and completion reports. At the last review conducted in July 2018, the portfolio performance 
was deemed satisfactory, but efforts will have to be made with regard to: (i) the effectiveness timeframes 
(11 months instead of the 6 months recommended by the Bank); (ii) the timely appointment of project 
management teams, including the coordinator and financial management and procurement officers; (iii) 
the lengthy procurement timeframe; (iv) delays in the release of counterpart funding, which impedes 
smooth project execution; (v) the systematic introduction of performance contracts and objective-based 
annual evaluation; (vi) the timely preparation of the baseline situation and deployment of monitoring 
and evaluation systems; and (vii) the availability of studies to improve the quality-at-entry of operations. 

  



 

9 

2.7.2 The Portfolio Performance Improvement Plan (PPIP 2018) also advocates the implementation 
of specific measures to accelerate project execution and the implementation pace. These lessons were 
taken into account in this project, as reflected in: (i) continuous dialogue and close monitoring by the 
Country Office to gradually reduce the long delays and fulfil the conditions for effectiveness; (ii) 
improvement in project quality by supporting the formulation and preparation of the detailed 
designs/competitive bidding documents (APD/BDs) and management and monitoring/evaluation tools 
prior to project start up (with PPF resources); and (iii) building of the procurement and financial 
management capacity of project management teams. It should be noted that the current portfolio has 
become significantly younger in recent years, the average age of operations having dropped from 5.5 
years in 2011 to 2.7 years in 2017. Moreover, the portfolio had no problematic projects (PP) or 
potentially problematic projects (PPPs) in 2017. 

2.7.3 PATAG EAJ was designed to take the following into account: (i) the need to enhance the 
quality-at-entry of the project by making feasibility studies available and by preparing the initial 
competitive bidding documents; (ii) the need to pay special attention to the involvement of local actors, 
notably farmers directly concerned, through an inclusive participatory approach; (iii) the intervention 
of other partners (World Bank, World Food Programme, etc.) to ensure coherence, complementarity 
and synergies in the activities selected; (iv) the need to pay attention to the procurement process and 
methods; and (v) the primordial importance of building the capacity of the different actors. In light of 
the above-mentioned strategic thrusts, special emphasis was also placed on certain thematic areas in 
formulating the project: (a) food and nutrition security; (b) value-chain approach; (c) decent youth 
employment and women's empowerment; and (d) resilience to climate change. All these provisions will 
make it possible to satisfy the design and execution criteria contained in Presidential Directive No. 
002/2015. 

2.8. Key Performance Indicators 

The monitoring and evaluation system of the project's logical framework indicators is part of the 
Ministry of Agriculture’s monitoring and evaluation system. The system will come under the 
supervision of the monitoring and evaluation officer, with the support of Project Management Unit 
experts (rural engineer, value chain expert, etc.), the Prefectural Directorate of Agriculture (DPA) and 
the Rural Engineering Technical Office (BTGR). Particular emphasis will be placed on targeting 
parameters that may be tracked and collected internally, and those relating specifically to women and 
young people (disaggregated data for women and young people). The main performance indicators that 
will be monitored from the baseline scenario include: (i) surface area of lowlands developed for rice 
farming with partial water control; (ii) surface area developed for rice farming with total water control; 
(iii) surface area developed for market gardening; (iv) infrastructure built (number of hectares with drip 
irrigation, number of garden farming hectares protected with grill fences, number of markets 
commissioned, number of kilometres of farm roads, number of product storage warehouses, number of 
input shops, etc.); (v) level of additional production (tonnes) and crop yields (tonnes/hectare); (vi) 
number of farmers (including women) by type of development; (vii) number of demonstration units 
(DUs) and TAATs distributed; (viii) number of farmers’ organisations structured and management 
committees established; (ix) level of increase in farmers' income, including those of women and young 
people; (x) number of jobs for young people and women created through entrepreneurial initiatives and 
number of young entrepreneurs established; (xi) number of farmers, processors and merchants trained 
and organised; (xii) level of involvement of women in decision-making bodies (leadership), and 
women’s rate of access to land following the development; (xiii) number of processing units established 
and allocated (including to women); and (xiv) number of nutrition activities and school canteens 
supported, and level of impact on food and nutrition security. The indicators selected for the project will 
be aligned on those selected under PNIASAN and will be used to assess the impact of the project on 
fragility, resilience and inclusion. The Bank’s various supervision missions and periodic progress 
reports will reflect the level of achievement of the indicators.

III- Project Feasibility  

3.1. Financial and Economic Performance 

Table 3:  Key Economic and Financial Data 

NPV (baseline scenario) GNF 20 370 million  
IRR (baseline scenario) 12.7% 
ERR (baseline scenario) 18.8% 

 

3.1.1 The project’s financial and economic analysis was conducted based on the cost/benefit of the 
additional cash flow from the production models of the two priority sectors (rice and market gardening). 
The following assumptions were used: (i) the period for evaluating the impact of PATAG EAJ is 25 
years; (ii) the average basic prices, yields and production costs of the 2016/2017 crop year were selected 
for the baseline scenario and realistic projections were made covering up to full project development, 
taking into account the existing potential and the absorptive capacity of beneficiaries; (iii) additional 
income was determined by calculating the difference between the baseline scenario and the “with-
project” scenario, based on gross proceeds minus production costs; (iv) an equal inflation rate was 
selected for jobs and resources on the cash flow table; (v) for the calculation of the economic rate of 
return, a cost correction coefficient was added for factors related to distortions inherent in customs 
duties. The detailed assumptions of the financial and economic analysis, the tables of the operating 
models (baseline scenario and “with-project” scenario) and financial and economic flows are presented 
in Annex B7 of Volume 2. The results of the financial and economic analysis show that PATAG EAJ 
is financially and economically sustainable.  

3.1.2 Financial performance: The hydro-agricultural improvements and land exploitation will 
generate additional production of approximately 1 030 tonnes of paddy rice, 210 tonnes of certified 
seeds and about 2 000 tonnes of market gardening products, in addition to creating 3 500 permanent 
jobs. The additional income resulting from the various development and farming models selected are 
the following: (i) lowlands with partial water control (rice): GNF 3 205 641 per ha; (ii) lowlands with 
total water control (double cropping for rice seeds): GNF 10 309 850 per ha; (iv) lowlands with total 
water control (double cropping for rice and one cropping for market gardening): GNF 12 325 695 per 
ha; and (v) irrigated market gardening: GNF 24 326 025 per ha. The overall additional income generated 
will help to increase the value added brought about by the project, thus increasing the project's 
contribution to agricultural GDP. The financial internal rate of return (IRR) is estimated at 12.7% for a 
NPV of GNF 20 370 million. 

3.1.3 Economic Performance: The basic economic rate of return (ERR) stands at 18.8%, for a net 
present value (NPV) of GNF 71 691 million and a cost-benefit ratio (CBR) is 1.81. This result is 
significant, especially since some benefits could not be included in the calculations due to the lack of 
data to permit their evaluation, notably improvements in living conditions and food security brought 
about by increased income and food availability, the effects of watershed and environmental protection 
measures, capacity building in other types of economic activities carried out by the beneficiaries and 
the multiplier effects on sector actors (suppliers of inputs, equipment, services, etc.). Sensitivity tests 
were performed based on the assumption of a possible escalation in costs (10%), a decline in agricultural 
production with the risk of non-adoption of farming techniques by farmers (10%), and a reduction in 
the benefits generated by the rehabilitation of agricultural products and  agricultural infrastructure, and 
the availability of processing and storage units for agricultural products (10%). Based on the results 
summarised in Annex B7 of Volume 2, the EIRR seems insensitive to any decreases in the benefits 
generated by rice and market gardening productions (-10%) (for an IRR of 16.6%), in storage, 
processing and rural roads infrastructure (-10%) (for an IRR of 18.5%). Similarly, a possible escalation 
(+10%) in investment and maintenance costs reduces the IRR to 16.8%. 



 

11 

3.1.4 The project’s other economic impacts may be summarised as follows: (i) upstream effects of 
additional income on service providers (NGOs, businesses, suppliers, consulting firms); (ii) downstream 
effects of the generation of additional income on producers, traders and processors who are essentially 
women; (iii) decrease in foreign exchange costs owing to the sharp drop of rice import costs in the trade 
balance; and (iv) impact on wealth creation in the country due to the increase in GDP resulting from the 
generation of additional value added. For households, project benefits will translate into, among other 
things, better nutrition for vulnerable groups (children, women of childbearing age and the elderly); 
lower medical bills and reduction of the difficulty of farm work, especially for women, decline in the 
incidence of monetary and non-monetary poverty; strengthening of livelihoods and the resilience of 
PATAG EAJ targets in relation to food insecurity and the effects of climate change.  

3.2. Environmental and Social Impact 

3.2.1 Environment: The project is classified in Category 2 under the Bank's Environmental and 
Social Safeguards Policies. It was subjected to an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment, the 
summary of which was posted on the Bank's Website on 12 September 2018. PATAG EAJ activities 
will be carried out in 18 areas located in the Boffa and Boké Prefectures. The project’s environmental 
impacts will be minimal given the relatively modest size of the infrastructure/development and their 
distribution across several locations. Moreover, the impact assessment reveals that the project 
implementation will be really beneficial for the socioeconomic development of the Boké and Boffa 
Prefectures since it will enable: (i) better management of soil and water resources, thanks to technical 
supervision of the irrigation methods and the rational distribution of the water to the plots, which will 
limit their over-exploitation and degradation; (ii) proper water control through adapted and appropriate 
(environmentally friendly) facilities, and the use of renewable energy; (iii) the reduction of agricultural 
land degradation, water and soil conservation, the development of vegetation cover, through the 
installation of erosion-control structures; and (iv) the development/promotion of new technologies and 
resilient/smart practices. In short, the project’s physical activities will cause no major environmental 
and social impacts. The impacts, if any, will be very short-lived on the receiving environments and on 
the environmental components as a whole. The summary of the Environmental and Social Management 
Plan (ESMP) was posted on the Bank's Website on 15 October 2018. 

3.2.2 Climate change: The project complies with the Bank's climate protection policies since the 
climate risks have been identified. The programme’s climate sensitivity has been analysed in accordance 
with the Climate Screening and Adaptation Review and Evaluation Procedures Booklet and the Climate 
Safeguards System (CSS). Based on the preliminary analysis of project activities, some operations will 
be more sensitive than others. The roads and facilities will be more climate-sensitive than other 
infrastructure. The design of the roads that will be built will incorporate engineering structures to ensure 
the normal flow of waterways crossed by the roads. In addition, the longitudinal and transverse profiles 
of feeder roads will be so designed as to facilitate the evacuation of water that falls or flows onto the 
road surface and to avoid water stagnation along the right-of-way. The building materials that will be 
used should promote a good compaction level that can strengthen the adhesion of different primary 
particles to reduce their crumbling with the falling of exceptional showers. In building supporting 
infrastructure for the agricultural sector other than the roads, account will be taken of their likely 
exposure to hazards (high winds, rising temperatures, exceptional rainfall, etc.). In addition, the project 
will favour the use of solar energy for dewatering in irrigated areas and for operating the equipment that 
will be installed. This alternative will make project activities cleaner and greener. 

3.2.3 Involuntary Resettlement: PATAG EAJ activities will not lead to any people resettlement or 
restriction of access to goods and livelihoods. 

3.2.4 Gender: Women play a major role in the agricultural economy, and are found throughout the 
value chain from production, processing to marketing. However, they face major constraints in gaining 
access to resources and factors of production, including land, inputs, fertilisers, financing, new 
technologies and extension services. As a result, they work under less favourable conditions compared 



 

12 

to men, which considerably undermines their performance. In rural areas, the income gap between men 
and women in the agricultural sector may be as high as 50%. To address the gender disparities described 
in the above gender analysis, PATAG EAJ pays specific attention to women's strategic interests and 
aims to improve their socioeconomic status in the two regions covered by the project. 

3.2.5 Based on consultations and exchanges with individual women and women's groups, as well as 
with other partners involved in the agricultural value chain and entrepreneurship, the project will 
implement the following activities: (i) Build capacity in  agricultural production, entailing the 
development of 237 ha of lowlands for rice cultivation that will enable women to have at least two rice 
seasons and one market gardening season per year;  development of 46 ha strictly for market gardening, 
of which 15 ha will be for women's market gardening activities, and 50 ha for the production of rice 
seeds. In addition, 30% of the rice schemes to be developed will be reserved for women's groups. 
Despite the strong involvement of women in the rice-farming sector, the management of rice farms 
remains a male preserve (only 9% of rice areas are managed by women). To address this situation, the 
project will train all women and men directly affected by the project (5000 producers), on issues 
pertaining to land tenure security and women's right to acquire land. An awareness campaign on the 
respect of the community's right of use and conflict prevention and management mechanisms will be 
organised to facilitate support for rice producer groups to acquire land and title deeds in newly 
developed areas. The project also includes a package of integrated services for women and young 
people, aimed at improving their access to socioeconomic infrastructure and innovative production 
technologies. Through the rehabilitation of rural roads, the project will help to open up the Boké and 
Boffa areas and facilitate the evacuation of agricultural products to the markets. Socioeconomic 
infrastructure (rural markets, processing units, market gardens and storage warehouses) will be provided 
primarily for the benefit of women and young people, with a view to improving their working 
conditions, easing their tasks, strengthening their economic empowerment, and improving food and 
nutrition security. The project will apply affirmative action in favour of women and vulnerable groups, 
wherever local traditions tend to exclude them from decision-making bodies or from certain benefits. 
Generally, the project will ensure that women are included when it comes to access to factors of 
production (managed land, agricultural inputs, equipment and production equipment), organisation and 
management of the new infrastructure (shops, markets, etc.), and training. Therefore, the project will 
help to strengthen women's economic autonomy and decision-making power; (ii) Enhance skills in 
agricultural production and processing, management, marketing and market access, which entails 
developing the skills of women and young people through the dissemination of Technologies for 
African Agricultural Transformation (TAAT), with focus on production and processing. Skills will also 
be developed in management, packaging, marketing and networking for market access, procurement 
and inventory management, leadership and entrepreneurship. In this regard, study tours will be 
organised for women engaged in processing to enable them to draw on the experience of neighbouring 
countries such as Burkina Faso; and (iii) Entrepreneurship, job creation and leadership and market 
access for women and young people: Increasing production and improving processing conditions will 
rekindle young people's interest in the agricultural sector, which will reduce youth unemployment rates. 
Women and young people will be trained in business plan development and given the support needed 
to set up their own businesses. In addition, women in the processing sector will be put in touch with 
private economic operators that have been identified as well as with WFP to ensure the direct purchase 
of their products. The project is classified in Category 2, according to the Gender Marker System. The 
budget allocated to specific gender promotion and economic empowerment activities stands at 
approximately UA 2.7 million. Details on the gender analysis are provided in the Technical Annex on 
gender. 

3.2.6 Nutrition: The project will develop initiatives to improve the hygiene and nutritional quality 
of food consumed by the people, especially by women and children, and will collaborate with the World 
Food Programme (WFP) to supply school canteens with food products from the area. The additional 
production of rice (1 000 tonnes) and horticultural products (2 000 tonnes) will help to improve feeding 
and nutrition, and hence the people’s health. Incorporating direct nutrition events into project activities 



 

13 

is essential to impacting the people’s nutritional status. Furthermore, activities aimed at supporting 
product quality, labelling and certification will help to improve the nutritional intake. Activities to 
prevent the resurgence of waterborne diseases and rice urticating caterpillars will also contribute to 
improving the health and nutrition of the local population.  

3.2.7 Social: The different activities implemented under the project (improved access to factors of 
production, technical routes for production, processing and marketing) will considerably help to 
enhance food and nutrition security and improve income levels, thereby significantly reducing the 
incidence of poverty. The project will further strengthen the connectivity between producers and the 
market through partnerships that will be beneficial to all stakeholders of the rice and horticulture value 
chains. Enhancing food security through the developments, coupled with awareness raising concerning 
dietary best practice, will help  to improve the people’s nutritional status, particularly that of  vulnerable 
groups such as women of childbearing age and children below the age of five. The rehabilitation of 
roads, construction of the storage/conservation warehouses, rehabilitation of the markets and the support 
of the processing units, will contribute to reducing post-harvest losses (expected to decline by at least 
30%), as well as facilitate product marketing. As a result, the income of households will increase, putting 
them in a better position to bear food, health and education expenses. By making it easier for 
beneficiaries to participate in decision-making processes and to secure land (management of community 
infrastructure, management of conflicts between farmers and herders, maintenance of access roads, 
etc.), the project will also bolster the local development process and promote good governance. Project 
activities will lead to: (i) a 19% increase in the people’s income; (ii) the creation of 3 526 direct decent 
jobs, including 147 in agricultural development works, 2780 in entrepreneurship and SME 
strengthening activities, and 600 temporary jobs; (iii) the creation of self-promotion capacity among 
project beneficiaries in terms of rural development operations in agricultural value chains; (iv) increased 
accountability and the development of human resources, leading to better organisation of rural 
communities; and (v) promotion of small operators (workmen, craftsmen, agricultural workers, micro-
enterprises), following the experience acquired by associations from participating in works 
implementation. The number of direct and indirect project beneficiaries is estimated at 39 252 and 247 
287, respectively. The increase in income will benefit the most vulnerable rural households, as they will 
henceforth be in a better position to bear the food, health and education expenses. Overall, by improving 
living conditions, the project will help to reduce rural poverty and exodus by retaining the people, 
especially the youths, in the localities. 

3.2.8 The promotion of rural entrepreneurship among young people and women (nearly 100 persons 
targeted) will help to develop the entrepreneurial culture among project initiators with a view to 
increasing income, creating decent jobs and promoting leadership among young people and women. 
The development of agricultural entrepreneurship will improve the attractiveness of the rural 
environment and create several production hubs in the area. This will produce concrete results and 
ensure the sustainability of the activities. The project will also facilitate the access of young promoters 
to critical materials, equipment and inputs (basic kits), depending on their business plans and areas of 
specialisation. The training will provide basic concepts and will include specialisation modules. There 
will also be tailor-made training designed to address the specific needs identified. 

IV- Implementation 

4.1. Implementation Arrangements 

4.1.1 Implementation modalities: Project implementation will be overseen by an autonomous 
Project Management Unit (PMU), comprising a small team based in Boké and placed under the 
supervisory authority of the Ministry of Agriculture (MA). The Ministry shall exercise its authority 
through the National Directorate of Agriculture (DNA), which shall be responsible for the technical 
supervision. The team will be recruited through a call for candidature and will include: (i) a project 
coordinator; (ii) a responsible for monitoring and evaluation; (iii) a rural engineering specialist, 
responsible for monitoring the implementation of agricultural infrastructure works; (iv) a value chain 



 

14 

expert, specialised in farmers' organisations and gender issues; (v) an administrative and financial 
officer; (vi) a procurement specialist; and (vii) an accountant. All experts will sign a performance 
contract that will be evaluated annually. 

4.1.2 The Technical Directorates of the Ministry of Agriculture will monitor the implementation of 
operations in consultation with decentralised services. Partnership agreements will be signed with 
DNGR (infrastructure monitoring), ANPROCA (advisory support and PO), IRAG (research 
development), AGUIPE (youth employment and entrepreneurship), etc. The Strategy and Development 
Bureau (BSD) will be responsible for project external monitoring. These entities will receive capacity-
building support and will adjust their operational mechanisms, if need be, to allow close monitoring on 
the ground. An agreement will also be established with BGEEE for project environmental monitoring. 
The project will also ensure the close involvement of Prefectural Directorates of Agriculture and the 
Rural Engineering Technical Office (BTGR) of Boké and Boffa. Private service providers (enterprises, 
consulting firms, NGOs, individual consultants, etc.) will be responsible for the delivery of certain 
works, goods and services, in accordance with the procurement methods defined in the financing 
agreements. The local population will take part in some labour-intensive works (ring dike, hedgerows 
and routine maintenance), under the supervision of specialised NGOs and with the support of the 
Directorate General of Forests and Wildlife. 

4.1.4 Supervision of activities: A Steering Committee will be set up, chaired by the Minister of 
Agriculture or a designated representative. The Committee’s secretarial services will be provided by the 
Project Coordinator. In addition to the relevant technical directorates of the Ministry of Agriculture, the 
Steering Committee will comprise (indicative only) designated representatives of MPDE, MEF, 
MASPFE, ME, MPAEM, MEEF, METFPET, MC, MIPSP, and representatives of the Chamber of 
Agriculture and CNOP-G, the private sector and civil society. Its function will include: (i) monitoring 
the project implementation; (ii) ensuring coherence and planning of eligible activities; (iii) conducting 
the annual review of the progress report, and approving the annual technical programme and budget; 
(iv) evaluating the project impact; (v) identifying constraints to and opportunities for improving the 
project impact; and (vi) ensuring technical and methodological compliance with project objectives, 
PNDES objectives and relevant sector policies, including the PNIASAN and the rice development 
strategy. The Steering Committee will meet twice a year to review project outcomes, validate financial 
statements, discuss programmes and approve the related budgets.  

4.1.5 Procurement. Goods, works and consultancy services financed by the Bank will be procured 
in accordance with the Procurement Policy for Bank Group-Financed Operations (AfDB Procurement 
Policy), October 2015 edition, and the provisions set out in the Financing Agreement. In line with this 
policy and following various evaluations conducted, it was agreed that procurement of goods, works 
and services under the project be made using the Bank's procurement system (AfDB System). 

4.1.6 Procurement Risk and Capacity Assessment (PRCA): In order to take project specificities 
into account, the Bank assessed: (i) risks at country, sector and project levels; and (ii) the capacity of 
the executing agencies. The outcomes of these assessments pointed to the existence of a substantial level 
of procurement risk. Therefore, the Bank's procurement methods and procedures will be used for project 
implementation, with the understanding that the capacity development action plan proposed in 
paragraph B.5.9 of Annex B5, Volume 2, will be discussed with the Guinean authorities so that the latter 
may carry out the reforms identified as necessary to expedite the use of the national procurement system. 

4.1.7 Financial management: Given that the public management system in force at the Ministry of 
Agricultural was deemed unsatisfactory upon assessment, a parallel accounting system based on the 
SYSCOHADA accrual accounting method will be set up and managed by the PMU responsible for 
project administrative, financial and accounting management. In addition to the other experts, the PMU 
in charge of PATAG EAJ will comprise an administrative and financial officer (AFO) who will have at 
his/her disposal the management tools that were procured under the PATAG EAJ PPF. These tools, 
comprising the administrative, financial and accounting procedures manual, and the accounting 



 

15 

management software, will be developed and staff trained in their use. The AFO will produce quarterly 
financial monitoring reports providing details on the implementation of project activities and the use of 
financial resources, and an annual financial statements consisting of the balance sheet, the consolidated 
financial statements, the status of the capital assets and notes to the financial statements to which the 
reconciliation statement of the special account will be appended. Training on Bank financial 
management requirements will be provided by Bank experts at the project launch.  

4.1.8 Disbursements: Project financial implementation will mainly involve the reimbursement, 
special account and direct payment methods. An account will be opened with a commercial bank 
acceptable to the Bank to receive part of the TSF loan resources and will be used to finance operating 
expenses. This special account will be used for an initial advance whose amount will be determined 
based on the estimated budget for six months of project activities. The special account will be 
replenished on the same basis after the Borrower must have justified the use of at least 50% of the 
amount of the previous advance. The direct payment method will be used for disbursements relating to 
goods, services and works contracts. Training in Bank disbursement rules and procedures will be 
provided at the project launch  

4.1.9 Audit: In accordance with the general conditions applicable to African Development Fund 
financing agreements, the country shall account for the use of the resources allocated. Therefore, an 
independent and competent external audit firm will verify once a year the reliability of the consolidated 
annual financial statements prepared by the project management team, and will assess the functioning 
of the internal oversight system of the entire project. The audit firm will be recruited according Bank 
terms of reference and following a competitive bidding procedure prescribed by the Bank. The terms of 
reference shall be subject to the Bank’s prior approval. The continuation of audit services during the 
last two years will be contingent on the Bank's validation of the audit report for the first year. The audit 
expenses will be financed with ADF resources. Audit reports will be forwarded to the Bank yearly latest 
six months following the close of the audited fiscal year.  

4.2. Monitoring  

4.2.1 Monitoring mechanisms: The project’s monitoring and evaluation mechanism will be 
integrated into the PNIASAN monitoring mechanism of the Ministry of Agriculture. It will be designed 
taking into account the common target indicators adopted in the project logical framework to enable the 
production of homogeneous and regular information (on a half-yearly basis) on the operations. The 
baseline situation will be consolidated through the Project Preparation Facility (PPF), with gender-
disaggregated data. This system will be participatory and will provide regular information on 
performance and impact indicators, as well as on the implementation of activities planned. The project 
partners will be systematically involved in the data collection and monitoring effort. A baseline situation 
will be established, based on the final hydro-agricultural sites selected. The monitoring and evaluation 
framework will systematically include gender-disaggregated data to highlight the impacts on women, 
young people and the most vulnerable groups. Targeted surveys will also be conducted to better 
understand issues relating to income, food security, nutrition, job creation, gender mainstreaming,  
vulnerability, and resilience. The information collected will be fed into the computerized monitoring 
and evaluation system to capture actual values and gauge project impacts and outcomes. This 
information will be recorded in periodic progress reports, highlighting the level of project progress and 
the achievement of outcomes. External monitoring and evaluation missions involving the relevant sector 
departments and the Strategy and Development Bureau (BSD) will also be organised regularly by the 
Government, in addition to the two annual supervision missions fielded by the African Development 
Bank with support from its Conakry Office. The ESMP will be monitored by the Guinean 
Environmental Studies and Evaluation Bureau (BGEEE).

4.3. Governance 

4.3.1 Indicators of political, economic and social governance remain mixed in Guinea, despite the 
strides made in recent years. The country’s weak performance in terms of governance and combatting 
corruption generally translates into a higher frequency of political and institutional hazards. The trend 
of the corruption perception index indicates that despite the slight improvements witnessed over the 
past five years (2012-2017), the situation remains virtually unchanged. Guinea is ranked 148th out of 
180 countries with an average score of 25, compared with a regional average of 34. 

4.3.2 As part of PATAG EAJ implementation, and with a view to mitigating the risks inherent in the 
weaknesses highlighted, capacity building for actors and institutional support are envisaged as a means 
of contributing to sector good governance. Furthermore, it was decided that financial management and 
monitoring/evaluation tools would be developed and the PMU team recruited through a call for 
candidature prior to project start up. In addition, although progress has been made in aligning the 
procurement system on WAEMU guidelines, the sluggishness of the procurement system is one of the 
major weaknesses encountered during the implementation of development projects. With regard to 
procurement, operational arrangements were adopted to address the weaknesses observed.  

4.4. Sustainability  

The sustainability of project investments mainly relates to the beneficiaries' ability to regularly and 
sustainably maintain and manage the infrastructure. In this regard, the project will pay special attention 
to the quality and sustainability of the facilities that will be put in place. Transformative works will be 
carried out based on detailed technical studies and using qualified companies or specialised jobbers. 
Other activities that will contribute to the sustainability of structures relate to the security of tenure over 
the land needed for the structures, support for the organisation of beneficiaries, provision of 
management tools to ensure better maintenance, support of recurrent costs of infrastructure (hydro-
agricultural development, markets, shops, farm road, etc.), and strengthening the structuring of 
producers both men and women. The management committees will be offered technical skills, for the 
introduction of an annual fee that allows the management of facilities and building maintenance fund. 
The managerial, accounting and logistical capacity of these entities will be built to enable them, upon 
project completion and in the long term, to become autonomous enterprises capable of initiating income-
generating activities in such areas as maintenance of structures, mechanics, transportation, agricultural 
product processing, etc. Moreover, the developments will enhance the people's adaptation and resilience 
capacity in the face of recurrent climate risks, as well as reduce the economic vulnerability of the 



 

17 

beneficiaries. The strong motivation observed among the beneficiaries during field missions is a factor 
that guarantees the sustainability of the facilities and the participation of beneficiaries in all activities 
and maintenance works. Other project activities that will contribute to its sustainability include land 
security for the facilities, support for the organisation of beneficiaries and the availability of 
management tools to ensure better maintenance, support of the recurrent costs of infrastructure (hydro-
agricultural development, markets, shops, farm roads, etc.), and strengthening of producer 
organisations. In addition, the activities included in the rural entrepreneurship promotion, 
transformation and market access components will generate value added and wealth, which are factors 
that would foster the ownership of project developments by the direct beneficiaries. 

4.5. Risk Management  

Besides the risk posed to this project and to other operations of the portfolio (i.e. the risk of political 
instability coupled with a difficult economic situation), several other risks were identified, for which 
mitigation measures are proposed. 

Risk Mitigation Measure Level 
Political instability, coupled with a 
difficult economic situation  

Contribution to improving socioeconomic and environmental 
resilience for greater stability. High 

Low mobilisation of counterpart resources   Counterpart resources limited to providing premises and paying the salaries of project employees. Low 

Inadequate commitment on the part of 
technical services of the relevant 
Ministries and weak capacity of the 
Project Coordination Unit (PCU) 

Prior involvement of technical services in PPF preparation from the 
project preparation phase; provision of support and capacity 
building services; recruitment of PCU staff on a competitive basis 
and establishment of performance contracts. 

Low 

Procurement and works implementation 
delays  

Enhancement of quality-at-entry through the use of the PPF 
mechanism; use of the delegated contracting management method 
(this will be confirmed at the end of the evaluation mission); and 
use of the community labour system. 

Moderate 

Inadequate ownership by the beneficiaries 

Involvement of beneficiaries in the selection of sites, clarification 
of land tenancy through an inclusive social assessment process, 
structuring and training of Management and Maintenance 
Committees 

Moderate 

Risks of conflicts between farmers and 
transhumant herders 

Involvement of municipalities in the management of cattle 
corridors, development of reception areas for transhumant herders 
and protection of facilities. 

Moderate 

Weaknesses in financial management and 
monitoring/evaluation 

Prior preparation of the procedures manual and establishment of the 
monitoring and evaluation mechanism as part of the PPF. Moderate  

4.6. Knowledge Building  

PATAG EAJ operations that will lead to better knowledge management and building may be 
summarised as follows: (i) strengthening of local expertise in local community resilience and 
adaptability to the recurrent impacts of climate change, through hydro-agricultural works and better 
water resource management; (ii) dissemination of new production and processing technologies: 
dissemination of improved seeds and resilient farming techniques, development of drip irrigation and 
solar pumping techniques, dissemination of new technologies for processing agricultural products,  and 
promotion of mechanisation; (iii) the establishment of demonstration units and the dissemination of best 
practice will help to protect and preserve resources, and mitigate the vulnerability of soil resources; (iv) 
support for quality improvement and labelling/certification will help to ensure compliance with norms 
and standards that promote access to new markets; (v) organisation of workshops and exchange of visits, 
as tools for interaction between researchers, support staff and producers for the purpose of adapting 
technologies to the local context;  (vi) conduct of awareness and information campaigns through various 
communication channels (community radios, media programmes, websites, films, etc.); and (vi) 
promotion of innovative youth and women's employability actions.
