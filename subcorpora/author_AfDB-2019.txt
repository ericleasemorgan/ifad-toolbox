Executive Summary 

Project Overview: The cashew nut sector stands out as one of the highest value-added flagship 

sectors featuring in the Government's Action Programme (GAP, 2016-2021), given its: (i) high 

potential to contribute to employment and income generation; (ii) contribution to food and 

nutritional security; and (iii) great export potential. Cashew nut is the country's second-largest 

agricultural export product after cotton, and accounts for 3% of the gross national product (GNP) 

and 25% of the income from agricultural exports. The project area alone generates more than 87% 

of national production. However, it is among the areas with the highest poverty rates, with an 

incidence of poverty rising from 36.2% in 2011 to 40.1% in 2015, well above the national average 

of 30.2%. With the strategic orientations of both Benin and the Bank in mind, the project design 

places particular emphasis on: (i) food and nutritional security; (ii) development of the sector's 

value chain, including local processing of raw cashew nuts (RCN); (iii) employment of youth and 

women; (iv) climate change (CC), strengthening population resilience and improving endogenous 

production systems. The project’s sector objective is to contribute to poverty reduction and improve 

food and nutritional security; its specific objective is to support a sustainable increase in stakeholder 

income and sector productivity. The project's total cost is UA 14.59 million and will take 5 years 

to execute. The main expected outputs include: (i) re-profiling 145 km of access roads; (ii) building 

and equipping 5 RCN storage warehouses each with a capacity of one thousand tonnes; (iii) 

rehabilitating 15,000 ha of old cashew nut plantations and supporting the creation of a modern 

cashew orchard of 3,000 ha for an expected improved yield of 700 kg per hectare; (iv) supporting 

job creation, identified in the various links of the sector, for 10,000 youths and women; (v) 

supporting the construction and equipment of 20 satellite RCN shelling units for the benefit mainly 

of women and 20 walnut and cashew apple processing units; (vi) installing 5 mini-power plants of 

10Kwc and 30 improved village water systems for communities and industrial processing units; 

and (vii) providing assistance to stakeholders in the sector to access bank credit through a 

facilitation fund hosted by the National Agricultural Development Fund (FNDA). In total, the 

project will directly reach more than 75,000 stakeholders in the sector, 30% of whom are women. 

Needs Assessment. RCN production in 2017 was estimated at 100,000 tonnes on 213,000 ha by 

200,000 small-scale producers. The sector's main constraints to development include: (i) the low 

yield of plantations (350 kg/ha compared to a world average of more than 900 kg/ha); (ii) the 

inadequacy and/or poor quality of agricultural infrastructure (storage warehouses, access roads); 

(iii) the low capacity of processing units (10% of national production); (iv) the non-existence or 

limited availability of bank credit; and (v) the organisational weakness of sector stakeholders. 

Value-added for the Bank. The project area has significant agricultural potential that has not been 

fully developed but is also one of the regions with the highest rates of poverty in the country. The 

project will contribute to the sustainable alleviation of food and nutrition insecurity and persistent 

poverty by focusing on women, youths, smallholders and private RCN processing initiatives, 

thereby contributing to attaining the Bank's High 5 strategic objectives, including "Feed Africa," 

"Industrialise Africa" and "Improve the quality of life for the people of Africa." 

Knowledge Management. The project will promote cropping systems that combine cashew nuts 

with food crops to meet food and nutritional security needs, while raising the RCN production and 

processing level for the market (increasing stakeholder income). The project will serve as a test 

model for sustainable management of tree plantations, based on the capacity of cashew tree 

plantations to sequestrate carbon, combat land degradation (climate change mitigation and 

adaptation), diversify and strengthen the livelihood of local communities, thus contributing to 

poverty reduction in the project area.

MANAGEMENT REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 

CONCERNING A LOAN AND GRANT PROPOSAL TO THE REPUBLIC OF BENIN TO 

FINANCE THE CASHEW NUTS SECTOR AND AGRICULTURAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP 

DEVELOPMENT SUPPORT PROJECT (PADEFA-ENA) 
 

Management hereby submits this report and recommendations concerning a proposal to extend an ADF loan 

of UA 7.12 million and award an ADF grant of UA 5.91 million to the Republic of Benin to finance PADEFA-

ENA. 

I. STRATEGIC THRUST AND RATIONALE  

1.1. Project Linkages with Country Strategy and Objectives  

1.1.1 The Government launched its Action Programme in December 2016 (PAG, 2016-2021), entitled 

"Benin Revealed"1 (PEA 2017), as the sole reference framework for Government action. The agricultural 

strategy, as outlined in the PAG, aims to make agriculture the main driver of wealth and job creation. The 

strategy comprises 7 agricultural development clusters (PDAs) and the promotion of 6 key agro-food sectors, 

including cashew nuts. The agricultural component of the PAG is based on the National Plan for Agricultural 

Investment and Food and Nutritional Security (PNIASAN, 2017-2021), which operationalises the Strategic 

Plan for the Development of the Agricultural Sector (PSDSA, 2017-2025). The key outcomes targeted through 

the Investment Plan include: (i) an annual increase in agricultural production of at least 6% between 2017 and 

2021; (ii) increased yields and reduced post-production loss rates in the agricultural, livestock and fisheries 

sectors; (iii) improved local processing rates for agricultural products; and (iv) increased employment created 

in priority value chains (for at least 30% of women).  

1.1.2. Youth employment remains a major and priority concern for the government (PAG, 2016-2021). 

Innovations in cashew value chains offer important employment opportunities for young people, including 

women. The project offers agricultural SMEs the opportunity to: (i) optimise access to finance and markets; 

(ii) promote best practice and innovative business models; and (iii) create employment opportunities. 

PADEFA-ENA will support young innovators to create effective business strategies and improve the 

productivity of the cashew nut value chain in Benin. 

1.1.3. The proposed project is fully in line with the main thrusts of Benin's national cashew nut sector 

strategy (SNFAB, 2016 - 2020), the implementation of which it aims to facilitate. The national cashew nut 

sector strategy is based on the following strategic thrusts: (i) improved orchard productivity; (ii) improved 

local capacity to process cashew nut products; (iii) organisation of the cashew nut marketing chain; (iv) cashew 

nut sector research; (v) cashew nut sector stakeholder organisation; (vi) cashew nut sector financing; (vii) 

regulation and legal framework for cashew nut sector development; and (viii) cross-cutting issues (gender, 

environment, climate change, public private partnerships, etc.). 

1.2. Rationale for the Bank’s Involvement 

1.2.1 Aimed at contributing more to the reduction of poverty and regional inequalities in the country, the 

Bank's interventions (CSP, 2017-2021) focus primarily on economically and socially disadvantaged areas with 

significant agricultural potential, including the support measures targeting the cashew nut and livestock 

sectors, and the development of infrastructure to bolster production, processing and access to basic services. 

The proposed project is of particular interest in the cashew tree-prolific area. Cashew nut is the second most 

important export product after cotton; it provides 3% of the country's GNP and 7% of its agricultural GNP; 

8% of the export revenue and 25% of export agricultural receipts. The project impact area (Alibori, Atacora, 

South Borgou, Donga and Collines) alone represents more than 87% of the national production provided by 

nearly 200,000 small-scale farmers. These regions are among the areas with the highest poverty rates, with 

the income poverty rate increasing from 36.2% in 2011 to 40.1% in 2015, above the national average of 30.2%. 

Furthermore, the cashew tree has the dual advantage of generating income in rural areas and sequestering 

carbon in increasingly soil degraded areas, such as the project region. The potential of the cashew nut sector 

includes the high carbon capture capacity, the existence of a local but also a sub-regional market for the sale 

                                                 
1  The choice of this name reflects the ambition of the highest authorities to further reveal the country’s economic potential to the world, thus strengthening 

Benin’s attraction.

of white and roasted almonds, the potential of the rapidly expanding organic fair trade market in Europe, and 

job creation opportunities for youths and women. The major constraints for the sustainable development of 

the cashew nut sector include the absence of coherent and specific policies and actions to promote the sector, 

the low quality of the main final products, such as cashew nuts and kernels, the low productivity of the varieties 

used, inappropriate post-harvest processing of nuts by farmers and wholesale traders, lack of mastery of 

efficient RCN processing techniques by processors, difficulties in accessing bank financing, difficult access 

to efficient inputs and equipment, low level of stakeholder organisation and poor stakeholder management 

capacity.  

The Bank's strategy for the period 2017-2021 aims to support the Government in implementing GAP (2016-

2021) for the structural transformation of the economy and poverty reduction. As a reminder, the CSP (2017-

2021) is structured along two main thrusts: Pillar 1 - develop agricultural and agro-industrial value chains; 

and Pillar 2 - strengthen infrastructure to support competitiveness and regional integration. The Bank's 

interventions under the first pillar support the development of agricultural value chains and agribusiness, 

including assistance for transformative investments; improving the agricultural sector's business environment 

to foster greater private sector involvement; skills development and entrepreneurship, particularly for youths 

and women; access to financing through risk-sharing mechanisms; and rural economic development through 

increased income and improved access to basic social services. Moreover, the proposed project is in line with 

the Bank's Ten-Year Strategy (2013-2022), particularly three of the “High 5s” to transform Africa socially 

and economically: “Feed Africa”, “Industrialise Africa” and “Improve the quality of life for the people of 

Africa.” The project is fully consistent with the Bank's objectives to contribute to the creation of 25 million 

jobs for the youths by 2025 as outlined in its Jobs for Youth in Africa Strategy. 

1.3. Aid Coordination 

1.3.1 The annual net flows of aid from development partners to the country represent nearly 30% of the 

state expenditure budget. Technical and financial partners (TFPs) are organised into joint thematic cooperation 

groups chaired by the Government, with a TFP as facilitator. The sector distribution of the Bank's active 

portfolio reflects the predominance of transport infrastructure (50%), followed by agriculture (33%) and 

energy (13%). This situation illustrates the portfolio's alignment with the Country Strategy (CSP, 2012-2016). 

The Bank is among the main stakeholders in the transport and agricultural sectors. The recent opening of its 

Country Office in Benin, with the effective presence of a Country Manager since January 2018, will contribute 

to strengthening the Bank's role and leadership in the thematic groups and TFP coordination.

II. PROJECT DESCRIPTION  

The sector objective of the project is to contribute to poverty reduction and improvement of food and 

nutritional security in Benin. The specific objective is to contribute sustainably to raise the income of 

stakeholders and the productivity of the cashew nut chain in Agricultural Growth Pole No. 4 (AGP 4).  

2.1. Project Components 

2.1.1 The project will be grounded on a sector value chain and integration approach to create an enabling 

environment for developing small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the cashew nut sector, for the 

employment of youths and women, and the creation of a sustainable impact on local development. 

2.1.2 Summary of Components: The project will be implemented over five years (2019-2024) through 

three components, the main achievements of which are described in detail in Annex C3 and summarised in 

the table below:

A1: Support for adaptation and carbon sequestration through sustainable management of old and new cashew 

tree plantations. Support for producing improved plant varieties to meet the rehabilitation needs of old 

plantations on 15,000 ha and creating a new 3,000 ha nursery by: (i) supporting agricultural research to 

increase existing mother trees (600 per 120,000 grafts per year), germs (5 per 200 higher tree clones); 4 

polyclonal nurseries of 5 hectares each and 30 irrigated woodlands of 5 hectares each; (ii) establishing 20 

demonstration plots and school grounds for disseminating innovations and new technologies: adapting 

farming and production system resilience to climate change and impact mitigation.  

A2: Supervising producers and creating pools of private service providers, supporting the training of 50 

agricultural advisers to train 25,000 farmers. Supervising 5,000 youths and women private service providers 

in 6 new trades identified for sustainable employment.  

A3: Socio-economic infrastructure rehabilitation/re-profiling of 145 km of feeder roads and building of 5 

cashew nut storage warehouses (1,000 tonnes each); drilling of 15 boreholes with manual power pumps and 

15 improved drinking water supply systems. Equipping 10 villages with a 10 KWp photovoltaic electricity 

system to supply villages and processing units. 

 

B1: Assistance for resilient land tenure security: (i) support for preparing the 20 Rural Land Plans (RLPs); (ii) 

support to Rural Municipalities for disseminating land transaction tools.  

B2: Organising, structuring and strengthening of stakeholders. The activities will be structured around the 

following thrusts: (i) support for structuring within the sector, in particular POs at village level; municipal and 

divisional associations; (ii) support for national professional federations in the various sector links; and (iii) 

institutional support at the grassroots level (IFA).  

B.3. Support for youths and women's entrepreneurship: Support for job creation for 10,000 youths (30% of 

whom are women) in the sector; Support for access to finance for stakeholders in the sector (30% of whom 

are women). Nutritional awareness of 1,500 people, 30% of whom are men. Identifying and strengthening 

existing incubator capacity to support young people in the sector.

2.2. Technical Solutions Adopted and Alternatives Explored 

PADEFA-ENA aims to support the entire cashew nut sector. Improving the quantity of RCNs produced and 

the quality of nut processing are the two key challenges for strengthening the competitiveness of the cashew 

nut sector in Benin, which faces stiff competition from its regional neighbours. It was decided to support the 

entire sector, including the thematic (Component A is intended to support the upstream part of the sector, and 

Component B the downstream) or geographical aspect (central and northern regions covered by the ATDA4, 

with 87% of the national cashew tree nurseries covered by the programme alone). PADEFA-ENA will 

contribute to improving the quality and quantity of cashew nuts and almonds produced, increasing 

employment and income in rural areas (farmers, stakeholders in new trades/private service providers (PSP), 

labourers employed by farmers or women workers in processing units, cashew nut collection and marketing 

agents). It will also help to raise the level of carbon sequestration in cashew plantations, while securing rural 

land rights (through support for the existing rural land plan) and enhancing food and nutritional security 

(through the promotion of appropriate food crop systems together with cashew plantations). 

Table II-2: Alternative Solutions Explored and Reasons for their Rejection  

Alternative Solutions Brief Description Reason for Rejection 

Building the project exclusively 

with the cashew nut industry inter-

professional group (IFA)) 

Supporting only members of the 

cashew nut sector inter-professional 

group (IFA) in Benin. 

The impact of the project on many 

stakeholders in the sector will be 

limited and can be equally 

frustrating for major stakeholders 

who are not members of the inter-

professional group. 

Financing activities through grants 
The project will finance the various 

stakeholders through grants. 

Financing processing and marketing 

activities will create disparities on 

the local market, and will penalise 

non-beneficiary private operators. 

The only activities to be subsidised 

are the rehabilitation of old cashew 

plantations and building the capacity 

of stakeholders. 

 

Establish new monoculture 

plantations. 

Plants grown on new plantations 

subsidised under the project are 

spaced in such a way that no other 

crops can be grown. 

Monoculture plantations will 

compete with food crops in the 

project area, implying the failure to 

achieve the project's objective of 

food and nutritional security. 

2.3. Project Type 

The PADEFA-ENA is an investment project financed by the ADF (loan and grant), the Government and 

project beneficiaries. 

2.4. Project Cost and Financing Arrangements 

2.4.1. The project's total cost, excluding taxes and customs duties, is estimated at CFAF 11.624 billion, or 

UA 14.594 billion (UA 1 equivalent to CFAF 796.489 in January 2019), of which UA 4.889 million in foreign 

exchange (33.50% of total project cost). The cost includes a 5% provision for physical contingencies and 3% 

for price escalation yearly. It should be noted that while contingencies for price escalation cover all capitalised 

activities during the five years of project implementation, the situation is different for physical contingencies, 

which do not cover items such as vehicles, operating costs (including staffing), etc. Thanks to this approach, 

project resources are better optimised. The project cost estimates are based on prevailing market prices in the 

country and in relation to the most recent achievements in the various areas of relevance to the project.

2.4.4. The project will be financed by a total ADF allocation of UA 13.03 million (CFAF 10.378 billion), 

comprising a loan and a grant of UA 7.12 million and UA 5.91 million, respectively. Therefore, the ADF is 

contributing 89.28% to the overall project funding, the Government CFAF 1.038 billion (10% of the ADF 

contribution and 8.93% of the total project cost) and the beneficiaries CFAF 207.565 million or 1.78% of the 

project cost. The following tables show the project's sources of financing by component and expenditure

2.5. Project Target Area and Beneficiaries 

The project zone is the area which comprises the agricultural growth pole N ° 4 (AGP 4) managed and 

administered by ATDA4, a public autonomous establishment. AGP 4 spans the entire Donga and Collines 

Divisions (“Départements”), and partly Borgou (South) and Zou Divisions (Djidja Municipal Council), with 

an estimated population of 2,150,000 of whom slightly over 50% are women. The project will cover the 

following fifteen municipal councils: Tchaourou, Parakou, N'Dali, Nikki, Pèrèrè located in the south of 

Borgou Division, Savalou, Bantè, Dassa-Zoumè, Glazoué, Savè, Ouessè municipal councils in Collines 

Division, Djougou, Ouaké, Bassila and Copargo municipal councils in Donga Division, and lastly Djidja 

municipal council in Zou Division. The direct beneficiaries are: (i) cashew nut farmers; (ii) cashew nut traders; 

(iii) raw cashew nut processors; (iv) exporters; and (v) the inter-professional cashew nut sector (IFA) and its 

regional and divisional constituents. The project will indirectly benefit the end consumers, as well as 

stakeholders involved or associated with the project at various levels, namely the Benin Cashew Development 

Authority, ATDA4, the DDAEPs of Borgou, Donga, Collines, Atacora, Zou, and Plateau Divisions, the 

Cashew Research Centre (CRA-Centre)/INRAB; the standardisation and quality support structures (ABSSA 

and ANM); DPV, DLROPEA, ANDF and DQIFE; the Faculties of Agricultural Sciences in Abomey Calavi 

(FSA/UAC), Ketou and Parakou, the National Fund for Agricultural Development (FNDA), and the 

Professional Association of Banks and Financial Institutions of Benin (APBEF). 

2.6. Participatory Approach to Project Identification, Design and Implementation 

Extensive consultations were held on the project at all stages of its preparation. The contacts established during 

the April 2017 identification mission were pursued during the preparation phase in January 2018, both in AGP 

4 and Cotonou. Meetings were held with administrative and local authorities, technical structures, professional 

agricultural organisations (OPAs), women's groups, private partners, as well as ongoing projects and TFPs 

involved in the cashew nut sector. This process will continue and will be relayed in the field by AGP 4 

DDAEPs, who are to serve as facilitators for all stakeholders. Moreover, implementing the project will require 

the establishment of mechanisms that will closely involve and empower the respective stakeholders, especially 

farmers and the private sector (agricultural SMEs). This approach will be pursued during project 

implementation and Bank supervision missions. The sustainability of interventions undertaken, particularly 

with regard to productive capital (ageing plantations and new cashew nurseries), requires full ownership by 

the stakeholders concerned, hence the option to prioritise the targeting of the most committed communities 

that must meet selection criteria (requests, land security, organisation method, contributions, commitments, 



 

7 

 

etc.). A presentation was made on project components and activities during the PADEFA-ENA appraisal 

mission, at a participatory workshop attended by all stakeholders. 

2.7. Consideration of Bank Group Experience and Lessons Learned in Project Design  

2.7.1 The 2017 portfolio review of Bank-financed projects in Benin identified project implementation 

weaknesses, including inadequate reporting or failure to address issues highlighted in audit reports, limited 

availability of quality staff for projects, and irregular physical and financial monitoring of projects. The 

institutional set-up envisaged under the project, namely delegated project management (MOD) and boosting 

of public-private partnership, addresses the underperformance of previous or ongoing projects. Project 

activities as concerns works, services and access to bank credit that fall within the ambit of the private sector 

will be pooled and entrusted, on a competitive basis, to specialise implementing agencies that will play the 

delegated project management role. The same review highlighted the need to: (i) facilitate access to bank 

financing for stakeholders in the sector by using reliable microfinance institutions; (ii) set up an effective 

monitoring and evaluation system; (iii) finance research and development activities; and (iv) provide priority 

support to beneficiaries through sustainable technical structures charged with exercising oversight functions 

on behalf of the State. All these issues were considered and incorporated in the project design during the 

formulation stages to avoid repeating the same mistakes. 

2.7.2. The project design took into account the exposure of the project impact area (PIA) to climate change. 

A study correlated the decrease in cashew nut yields with the increase in temperature and decrease in rainfall, 

predicting a reduction in rainfall amounts by up to 12% by 2050 in the area (Bello et al., 2016). The project 

will help to reduce carbon emissions and strengthen the adaptive capacity and resilience of the rural 

communities and endogenous agricultural production systems in the project area. 

2.8. Key Performance Indicators  

2.8.1 The key performance indicators are provided in the logical framework. Using the project's baseline 

situation, monitoring will mostly cover: (i) the rural poverty index within the project area; (ii) additional CO2 

sequestration; (iii) cashew tree productivity; (iv) average cashew tree and associated food crop production; (v) 

quantity of cashew nuts processed and certified; (vi) number of jobs created in the sector, of which 30% for 

women; (vii) the surface area of rehabilitated or newly created plantations; (viii) number of grafted plants 

produced; (ix) number of infrastructure built or rehabilitated (RCN storage warehouses, number of RCN 

satellite units for cashew shelling/processing, and production of cashew apple juice, etc.); (x) number of 

cooperatives created or structured with at least 30% of women on management committees; (xi) number of 

professional farmers' organisations (OPAs), youths and women trained in various segments of the value chain; 

(xii) number of managers and technical staff trained to supervise stakeholders (30% women); (xiii) additional 

production sold; (xiv) number of women and youths who received support from the project, including nutrition 

awareness; (xv) number of farmers and processors trained on best production or processing practice (30% 

women); (xvi) number of cooperatives and economic interest groups (EIGs) aligned on OHADA, including 

women's cooperatives; (xvii) number of organised and contracted supply networks, number of RCN satellite 

shelling units (100% women) created; and (xviii) number of stakeholders (30% women) trained in 

environmental management. 

2.8.2 Further gender-disaggregated indicators will be added when finalising the monitoring and evaluation 

system, and establishing the baseline situation, using the results-based management approach. These will 

include: (i) the proportion of women in each beneficiary group; (ii) the involvement of women and youths in 

producer and infrastructure management groups; and (iii) the area of cashew tree plantations operated by 

women and youths. Particular emphasis will be placed on monitoring socio-economic impacts (disaggregated 

data for women and youths, monitoring the performance of POs).  

2.8.3  As regards impact indicators, particular emphasis will be placed on targeting the parameters that can 

be monitored and collected internally, and on defining those that relate specifically to women and youths. The 

main indicators are: (i) the percentage of the rural population living on an annual income below the poverty 



 

8 

 

line; (ii) the percentage of the rural population living in food and nutrition insecurity; (iii) the production of 

additional cashew nuts; (iv) the volume and percentage of locally processed cashew nuts; (v) the degree of 

organisation of POs, including the performance of socio-professional organisations; (vi) the number of 

additional jobs created (including 30% for women's groups) in the sector (private service providers, PSP); and 

(vii) the number of additional agricultural businesses/SMEs created in the sector. 

2.8.4. The project’s internal monitoring and evaluation will be conducted by the monitoring and evaluation 

specialist of the Project Management Unit (PMU), in close liaison with all partners. Particular emphasis will 

be placed on targeting the relevant women-specific parameters (systematic disaggregation of data). Using the 

baseline situation, the monitoring will specifically cover: (i) the level of additional production (tonnes) and 

crop yields (t/ha); (ii) the increase in farmers' income, with particular reference to youths and women; (iii) the 

number of jobs created (support for the installation of young PSPs; development of new modern plantations, 

etc.); (iv) rate of infrastructure development (number of storage warehouses built, kilometres of feeder roads 

rehabilitated, etc.); (v) effective organisation of supervision and training (number of professional agricultural 

organisations and persons trained, including gender mainstreaming), (vi) women's involvement in decision-

making bodies and the rate of their access to land (at least 30% in new plantations); and (vii) the project's 

nutritional impact. All selected indicators under the project will be reconciled with those under the PNIASAN. 

MAEP’s DPP will conduct external monitoring jointly with CAA and DGFD. The various supervision 

missions and periodic activity reports will systematically report on progress towards achieving the indicators. 

III. PROJECT FEASIBILITY 

3.1. Economic and Financial Performance 

Table 3.1: Key Economic and Financial Data 

ERR = 29.84% 20% NPV = CFAF 9.319 billion 

The economic analysis was based on direct project costs and benefits. The project is based on the development 

of the cashew nut sector and includes several stages leading to the attainment of its set objectives. Thus, the 

economic analysis is based on the notion of operating cost centres and operating income net of taxes. 

Therefore, the following process steps were considered and analysed: 

i. Cashew nuts production and sales phase (field edge sale), both in terms of old plantations 

(15,000 ha), to be developed by farmers on bank credit financing through the Facilitation Fund 

with the FNDA, and new plantations (3,000 ha) that the project will support; 

ii. The raw material processing stage into cashew kernel and cashew apple juice, requiring both 

semi-industrial and industrial processing; 

iii.  The export sales stage of part of the raw walnut; 

iv. The sales stage of the finished products that constitute the almonds and juice from industrial 

processing, and involves two types of sales(local and export sales); 

v. Only agricultural production and production from semi-industrial and industrial processing 

from the “project” situation were considered. 

The economic analysis was conducted over the project’s 25-year lifespan, taking into account the “project” 

situation and the current level of cashew nut production yields under the project, which will increase from 350 

kg per hectare to 700 kg in the coming years for the plantations developed.  These yields per hectare will 

increase from 1,000 kg to 1,200 kg in the year of full production (full operation) for the new plantations 

established under the project, i.e. around 2027. It is also assumed that the project will start production one 

year after completion, in 2024/25. Furthermore, through the Facilitation Fund to be made available to farmers, 



 

9 

 

the project will only support investments during the implementation phase, in other words over the period 

2020-2024. The table below outlines the activities eligible for the Facilitation Fund hosted by FNDA. The 

Fund amounts to UA 3,608,700 (CFAF 2,874,286,000). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Finally, the unit prices and costs used are those applicable in the country and recorded during the field mission, 

at the level of producers, processors and authorised institutions in the sector. Details of the project economic 

analysis tables and other assumptions used to conduct the economic analysis are given in Appendix B7. 

 At the economic level. The project is economically viable and is relatively responsive to a 10% 
increase in economic expenditure, since the economic rate of return of 29.84%, although 

interesting, drops to 27.41% with an NPV of 6.562 billion, i.e. a decrease of CFAF 2.7 billion 

compared to a decrease of 2.43 points in profitability. Moreover, a 10% drop in income reduces 

economic profitability by nearly 4.30 points or approximately CFAF 4.910 billion.  The 

combination of both has a significant impact on the project's economic profitability: a 

simultaneous increase in operating costs of 10% and a 10% increase in income gives an ERR 

of 22.76% and an NPV of 20% (CFAF 2.126 billion), which indicates that the project remains 

relatively sensitive to these two factors occurring concurrently. Even under this scenario, the 

return on investment would be achieved after 2 to 3 years of project implementation (2027), 

i.e. three years after the project becomes operational – another proof that the project is 

economically viable. The project will also create thousands of jobs for both youths and women 

wishing to participate in the sector (see jobs under project Components A and B). 

 At the financial level. The financial analysis focused mainly on income generated along the 
supply chain by the various stakeholders: nursery growers, cashew nut farmers on old and new 

plantations, processors and raw nut exporters. 

 Nursery growers. The project will give them greater control over grafted plant production 
systems through the series of training sessions that they will undergo, improve their 

farming methods and increase the area under cultivation. Three pricing assumptions for 

the transfer of grafted plants studied on three types of farms will also boost nursery 

growers’ additional income per hectare compared to a no-project situation (see Annex 

B.7 for more details).  

Regarding the income derived by the other stakeholders, the financial gains for all stakeholders amount to 

CFAF 263.287 billion, i.e. an annual income of around CFAF 13.364 billion (see further details in Technical 

Annex B7).

3.2. Environmental, Social and Climate Impact 

3.2.1 Environmental and Social 

The Project has been classified under Category 1 according to the Bank's Environmental and Social Safeguards 

Instruments and in compliance with Benin's relevant regulations. Given the project’s specificity, an 

Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) was defined and validated at the national level. 

Overall, project activities will have major positive environmental impacts but will also entail some significant 

risks. Activities likely to have negative impacts include rehabilitating and extending cashew plantations, 

setting up socio-economic/community infrastructure, etc. 

Potential negative impacts. The project's negative environmental and socio-economic impacts include 

pressure on land resources and the risk of encroaching on the forest cover. There are very strong pressures on 

land due to the extension of the cultivated area following easy access to inputs and credit. Vegetation is 

destroyed and used to satisfy agricultural, livestock and people’s needs for forest products and derivatives. 

Declining soil fertility and low use of fertilisers for food crops cause the expansion of clearing and burning of 

savannahs and forests, at the expense of crops.  

Potential positive impacts. Therefore, project activities will have considerable positive impacts, among which 

development of production systems that would guarantee farmers significant and sustainable income, in 

addition to helping them to master innovative, value added-generating practices. Other positive outcomes 

include diversification of activities, improvement of the quality of life for youths and women, better access to 

social infrastructure and facilities, expansion of trade and income-generating activities, opening up of 

production areas, improvement of access to basic social services (health agencies, maternities, etc.), 

development of the production and distribution subsectors, etc. It is also worth mentioning the regeneration 

of degraded land, the improvement of the forest cover and the increased carbon sequestration capacity. 

Consultations with various project stakeholders showed high enthusiasm and total support for the project. 

According to them, the project will reduce emigration and foster local development. The project will also 

contribute to strengthening the resilience of people and ecosystems to climate change. 

Mitigation measures. The project provides for the construction of a number of socio-economic facilities and 

infrastructure to improve the population's access to them and open up certain production zones. Various other 

measures are also planned to improve the project's positive impacts, to which must be added the 

recommendations made during consultations. The risk of increasing pressure on land resources and 

encroaching on the forest cover figures among the major project environmental and socio-economic impacts. 

The following measures and recommendations were proposed: information and awareness-raising campaigns 

among all stakeholders; involvement of local authorities and communities, establishment of a consultation 

forum, building the capacity of the various stakeholders in the sector and setting up a programme to support 

the preservation and restoration of natural resources. The Environmental and Social Management Plan 



 

11 

 

(ESMP) has identified various measures, some of which particularly concern the construction of feeder roads 

and support infrastructure. These will be included in the bidding documents and service providers will be 

required to implement them during works. Moreover, in addition to the project, which incorporates the cost 

of certain activities, the ESMP provides for an additional CFAF 430,000,000 to cover environmental and 

social measures, among others. 

3.2.2 Climate Change: Spatial and temporal variations in rainfall are a real concern in undertaking 

agricultural activities in the project area as well as in all of the country's central and northern regions. The 

project would ensure the application of good agricultural practice by promoting the deployment of appropriate 

technical procedures. Where they exist, tools for establishing warning systems, such as collecting, processing 

and communicating climate data to stakeholders, are insufficient and/or obsolete. The project will contribute 

to improving these procedures by building capacity in terms of equipment, data collection and processing in 

the DDAEP areas, as well as ways of communicating with stakeholders. Training DDAEP officers in proper 

data collection is essential, as is the facilitation of a monthly meteorological sheet with trends observed. The 

project will support all activities already carried out in the region by INRAB to disseminate drought-resistant 

varieties of food crops produced on the sites. 

3.2.3 Gender mainstreaming and women's empowerment: the project will promote the inclusive 

approach with the strong involvement of youths, women, disadvantaged groups, local authorities and the 

private sector. 

3.2.3.1 Gender analysis of the cashew nut supply chain. Cashew nut cultivation involves men and women 

throughout the value chain, but with different roles and responsibilities. Given the perennial nature of cashew 

nuts, cultivation is mainly dominated by men because of women's limited access to land, which is a major 

constraint to their access to production. It is estimated that 90% of the plantations are owned by men. The 

presence of women in the sector as regards the production function is 10%, mostly comprising smallholders 

(less than 5 ha). Overall, women process, market and distribute the processed products since they have more 

expertise in conquering the market and the consumer. To overcome the gender inequalities observed, the 

project plans to carry out the following activities:  

3.2.3.2 Strengthen women's productive capacity. The project will provide training for all women directly 

involved in the project and traditional leaders on land security and women's rights to acquire land. An 

awareness-raising campaign on community user rights, conflict prevention and management mechanisms will 

be organised to facilitate support to women cashew nut cooperatives in acquiring land and land title in the new 

plantations. Out of a planned area of 3,000 ha of new cashew plantations, at least 30% will be allocated to 

women. To achieve this, the project will organise women producers into structured and operational groups to 

facilitate access to and use of the allocated plots. Farmers will be sensitised to cultivate some crops in 

association with cashew nut farming (maize, soya and groundnuts) to combat malnutrition and promote 

balanced nutrition. The project also includes a set of integrated services for women to improve their access to 

socio-economic infrastructure and innovative production technologies. The rehabilitation of rural roads, 

construction of storage warehouses, consolidation centres and installation of improved village water supply 

(HVA) will help to overcome the difficulties associated with the evacuation and preservation of cashew apples 

and nuts, and will facilitate access to drinking water in the villages around the sites to be developed. To take 

better account of women's needs in terms of access to factors of production, the project will help women to 

access processing materials and equipment through the Access Facilitation Fund under the FNDA. Women, 

individually or in cooperatives, will be able to benefit from the financing upon presentation of a bankable 

business plan. 

3.2.3.3 Building management, transformation and social life skills. As part of the plan to build technical 

capacity, all women directly involved in the project will receive literacy education, to reduce or eliminate the 

high rate of female illiteracy in the region. To build on the past record of women's leadership and strengthen 

their presence in governance structures in this very weak sector, the capacity of women in cashew apple and 

nut processing cooperatives and that of women farmers will be strengthened, particularly in simplified 

accounting, cooperative management, procurement and inventory management, leadership and 



 

12 

 

entrepreneurship, business plan development, capital mobilization, marketing and networking, to facilitate 

their access to finance. They will also benefit from capacity building in cashew nut and apple processing, as 

well as in equipment maintenance. The project's support for life skills development will focus on reproductive 

health, family planning, nutrition, social cohesion, culture of peace and conflict management. From a 

reproductive health perspective, modules on reproductive health, social cohesion and nutrition will be 

provided during the various training sessions envisaged under the project and dedicated to women. 

3.2.3.4. Improving gender knowledge. PADEFA-ENA will also contribute to strengthening the low level of 

gender responsiveness among stakeholders. To achieve this, a monitoring/evaluation system will be set up as 

part of project monitoring. The system will incorporate gender-disaggregated measurement indicators for 

knowledge enhancement on the different categories of beneficiaries, and for monitoring the impact of 

interventions by gender. Furthermore, a gender organisational audit of stakeholders will be conducted with 

the support of a consultant or a gender consulting firm. This audit will propose a gender-based technical 

capacity-building programme to address identified weaknesses. Support will also be provided for the 

introduction of gender training modules for agronomists and agricultural specialists at the Calavi, Ketou and 

Parakou Agronomic Science Faculties (ASFs) to ensure that gender equity is sufficiently reflected in 

agricultural operations. The feasibility of this curriculum consolidation will be discussed with the heads of the 

universities of Abomey-Calavi, Ketou and Parakou, and will depend on the medium-term training objectives 

of these institutions.  

3.2.3.5 Improvement of women's representation on decision-making bodies. The project will promote 

women’s integration and leadership in management committees and executive boards of professional 

organisations with the objective of attaining a 30% quota of women in decision-making positions. The project 

will also structure at least 50% of women's organisations active in the cashew nut sector. A gender specialist 

will be recruited into the project management unit to carry out and coordinate the proposed activities. 

3.2.3.6. Gender Marker System Categorization. The project is classified under Category 2 of the Gender 

Marker System. Details of comprehensive gender analysis and action plan are given in Technical Annex B.7. 

A CFAF 830 million budget (i.e. UA 1 million) has been set aside for gender promotion and women’s 

empowerment activities.   

3.2.4 Youth and Women's Employment and Inclusion: the project area has a high youth population 

(over 40% of the population). Relatively, more young men are employed (54%) than young women (59%). 

Moreover, young people aged 14-24 represent a significant share of the labour force in the informal sector 

compared to the overall population (91.1%), more so for young men (94.1%). The project will improve youth 

and women’s employment indicators. It will contribute to developing, structuring and financing new trades 

(private service providers, PSP) with a view to creating new jobs in rural areas, increasing cashew nut 

production (nurseries, maintenance specialists, grafters, plant health specialists, storage warehouse managers, 

input distribution kiosk managers, maintenance and care technicians, etc.) and processing (raw cashew nut 

shelling, cashew apple juice manufacturing, cashew shell processing). In this context, the project will finance 

training and contribute to the installation of 300 young PSP volunteers (30% of whom women). This material 

capacity building, combined with technical capacity building, will improve the productivity of young 

agricultural entrepreneurs and subsequently their income. Moreover, during the rehabilitation of old 

plantations and the establishment of new cashew orchards, youths trained by the project will be invited by 

SME promoters to provide remunerated service. The project will support ongoing initiatives in some 

municipal councils in the project area to train and set up young nursery operators. Therefore, an innovative 

financing mechanism will be carefully studied and put in place to facilitate the installation of the young people 

targeted. The technical expertise of the Faculty of Agricultural Sciences (FSA) of the National University of 

Abomey-Calavi will be leveraged in this regard. A consulting firm will also be hired to assist young 

entrepreneurs to prepare their feasibility studies and business plans. Girls must account for at least 30% of the 

young entrepreneurs supported by the project. Furthermore, the project's support for the establishment of 

private agro-industrial units will promote the employment of youths and women in particular. This will be the 

case with the planned establishment of 20 satellite cashew nut shelling units, mainly for women’s 

cooperatives, and the creation and/or modernisation/strengthening of 10 cashew apple juice production units 



 

13 

 

through the Facilitation Fund. The project will facilitate access to financing for these ongoing initiatives and 

encourage new operators to set up business in the various links of the sector. Overall, the project will help to 

generate 10,000 jobs for young people and women in the cashew nut value chain. The group of women 

involved in processing activities will be among the major target groups for nutrition awareness activities, 

linking them to processed products that provide nutritional benefits. 

3.2.5 Forced Resettlement: PADEFA-ENA's activities will not lead to any people displacement or 

resettlement. 

IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION 

4.1. Implementation Arrangements 

4.1.1 Procurement Arrangements. Procurement of goods (including services other than those of 

consultants), works and consultancy services financed by the Bank under the project will be in accordance 

with the Procurement Framework for Bank Group-financed Operations, October 2015 edition, and the 

provisions set forth in the Financing Agreement. More specifically, procurement will be carried out as 

follows: 

 The Borrower Procurement System (BPS): procurement methods and procedures (PMP) 
under Benin's procurement system, including its implementing legislation and decrees (Law 

No. 2017-04 of 19 October 2017 on the Public Procurement Code and its subsequent decrees 

and implementing regulations), using national standard bidding documents or other bidding 

documents as approved during project negotiations for low-complexity works and goods 

contracts provided for under the project and generally available in Benin, for which the 

fiduciary risk is considered relatively low.     

 The Bank's Procurement Methods and Procedures (BPM): the Bank's standard procurement 
methods and procedures, based on relevant standard bidding documents for larger and more 

complex works and goods contracts, as well as consultancy services, deemed most appropriate. 

4.1.2 Procurement Risk and Capacity Assessment (PRCA): country, sector and project risk assessment 

as well as assessment of the executing agency’s procurement capacity were conducted and the results used to 

guide the decision on the choice of the procurement system (Borrower or Bank) for specific activities or set 

of similar activities under the project. The project executing agency is the Territorial Agricultural 

Development Agency of Pole 4 (ATDA4) supervised by the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries 

(MAEP). ATDA4 is a financially autonomous social, cultural and scientific public institution/legal entity. 

ATDA4 is not fully operational because only members of the Board of Directors and some managers have 

been appointed. Consequently, the procurement risk is deemed high. The ATDA4 procurement bodies 

(Procurement Officer, Public Procurement Commission and Public Procurement Control Unit) do not exist, 

and staff of the Project Coordination Unit have not yet been appointed or recruited, including the procurement 

specialist to be dedicated to the project and who would have the necessary qualifications and experience. To 

reduce the risk to "moderate" or even "low", the Government has decided that ATDA4 will use the 

procurement organs of its parent ministry (MAEP) for procurement purposes. An assessment of MAEP’s 

capacity, expertise and experience have revealed that it is competent in this regard, given its experience in 

managing several projects financed by various donors, including the Bank. Moreover, ATDA4 shall recruit a 

procurement specialist dedicated to the project, whose profile and qualifications shall be approved beforehand 

by the Bank. Furthermore, it shall set up its own procurement organs. The Borrower and the Bank shall agree 

on a procurement plan for the first 18 months of the project, which shall be updated annually or as required, 

to take into account actual project implementation needs. Any amendment to the plan shall be subject to the 

Bank's prior approval. Appropriate risk mitigation measures have been included in the PERCA action plan 

indicated in Paragraph B.5.9 of Annex B5. 



 

14 

 

4.1.3 Financial Management and Disbursement. ATDA4 was established on 27 February 2017. 

Appointed by the Council of Ministers on 13 June 2018, its Board of Directors comprises a Director General 

(DG), a Director of Administration and Finance (DAF) and technical staff. The PADEFA-ENA steering 

committee is presided by the Chairperson of the ATDA4 Board of Directors. However, it should be noted that 

ATDA4 still has no financial management system in place to guarantee transparency, traceability and 

accountability regarding the use of project funds. To get to that level, the Beninese Government shall first 

establish and operationalise ATDA4 by taking the following measures: (i) finalise the organisational chart in 

accordance with the principles of internal control, in particular the separation of incompatible functions, with 

the appointment/recruitment of managers, especially those in the Directorate of Administration and Finance 

(Heads of Administration and Maintenance, Accounting and Finance, Procurement) and staff assigned to them 

(Accountant, Cashier). It is worth mentioning that on 17 April 2018, the Government appointed an accountant 

to manage funds for ATDA4 operations. The accountant is under the supervision of the Inspectorate General 

of Finance and the Bureau in charge of analysis and investigation; (ii) prepare the Administrative, Financial 

and Accounting Procedures Manual covering expenditure management cycles (procedures for the 

procurement of goods and services), assets management (fixed assets, stocks), cash flow management (orders, 

disbursement, cash flow monitoring and control) and resource mobilization (capital call, direct payments), the 

accounting, financial and budgetary information cycle, the staff management cycle and the control and internal 

audit cycle; (iii) implement an integrated multi-project and multi-station management system for maintaining 

the project's budgetary, analytical and general accounts; the general accounting should be compatible with 

private commitment-type accounting, in line with SYSOHADA principles and norms; (iv) set up  internal 

audit mechanisms within the General Directorate, by recruiting an internal auditor to ensure that the project's 

internal control system is operational and effective; and (v) establish external audit mechanisms, including the 

recruitment of independent external auditors in accordance with the terms of reference agreed with the Bank 

and in line with the Bank's requirement to submit audit reports by 30 June of the year following the year 

audited. Pending the establishment of project management and operationalisation structures, the overall 

fiduciary risk, including the inherent risk and the risk of non-control, and resulting from the assessment of the 

ATDA4's financial management capacity, will remain high. Details are provided in the Technical Annexes of 

the Appraisal Report. With regard to the line of credit component and/or a guarantee fund to partner banks to 

finance targeted and/or dedicated investments in the cashew nut production, processing and marketing sector, 

an agreement will be signed with the National Agricultural Development Fund (FNDA). An assessment of the 

FNDA has shown that it is relatively new given its date of establishment; its structure is gradually being set 

up. Although not all key positions have yet been filled, there is a recruitment plan in place to address this 

weakness in the very short term. The Fund is supported by the Government of Benin and certain technical and 

financial partners, including the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, the Belgian Cooperation 

Agency and the European Union Delegation. Through various multifaceted support measures, the structure 

obtained all the management tools required for its operation as of end-2018, particularly the administrative, 

accounting and financial procedures manual, including an organisation chart and job descriptions, an 

operational procedures manual for various windows, and a monitoring/evaluation manual. Furthermore, the 

Fund also set up a computerised accounting and financial management system. However, these tools have not 

yet been put to the test since they were installed quite recently. Therefore, it is imperative that prior to 

allocating resources to FNDA: (i) the recruitment process for key staff must be finalised; (ii) staff must be 

trained on using the management tools and a copy of each manual must be given to every staff; (iii) the 

integrated accounting and financial management system must be configured to record expenditure by activity 

and resources by source of financing, since the FNDA is meant to receive funding from various sources.  

Disbursements: Fund resources will be disbursed in accordance with Bank rules and procedures, particularly 

as contained in the Disbursement Manual. The following three payment methods will be used: (i) direct 

payment for the procurement of works, goods and services; (ii) the special account method for operating 

expenses to be charged to the ADF grant. A special account will also be opened under the ADF loan to receive 

facilitation funds meant for the FNDA; and (iii) reimbursement for expenditures pre-financed by the 

Borrower/Donee, in agreement with the Bank. The FNDA will open a dedicated account only for facilitation 

funds transferred periodically from the dedicated loan account.  Two agreements will be signed in this regard: 

(i) an agreement between the Donee and FNDA specifying the terms and conditions for providing the funds, 



 

15 

 

including FNDA management fees and any interest during reimbursement to the Caisse Autonome 

d'Amortissement (CAA); (ii) an agreement between FNDA and the Caisse Autonome d'Amortissement (CAA) 

specifying the terms and conditions for reimbursing the funds to CAA upon project completion and where 

applicable, after a grace period. FNDA will be required to check the loan applications to be financed, in 

addition to closely monitoring the funds disbursed to financial service providers. Regular reports will be 

prepared and forwarded to both the project and the Bank. Facilitation funds will be disbursed based on a six-

monthly budget through approved applications. Regular periodic reports will be produced and forwarded to 

the project and the Bank. A counterpart account will be opened to receive counterpart funds. The fiduciary 

risk of cash management will remain high if the above provisions, which guarantee the permanent availability 

of counterpart funds, are not adopted. 

4.1.4 External Audit. Project audit shall be carried out by an audit firm acceptable to the Bank, recruited 

for a period of one year renewable, depending on the quality of services delivered and over a period not 

exceeding three financial years. The terms of reference shall require the Bank's approval and include yearly 

audit of funds made available to FNDA, at the same time as the project itself. The auditor shall give an opinion 

on the performance of the special account, its compliance with contractual clauses, the performance of 

agreements and dossiers submitted and financed. Upon project completion, this mission will be entrusted to 

FNDA's external auditor and a copy of the auditor’s reports shall be sent to the Bank. The ATDA4 shall 

forward the PADEFA-ENA audit reports to the Bank latest 30 June of the year following the end of the audited 

financial year. Audit fees will be paid from project resources, using the direct payment method. 

4.2. Monitoring  

4.2.1 The project will be implemented over five years, from the first quarter of 2019. The Bank will 

organise the launch mission when the team is in place and all necessary conditions have been met for a quick 

and efficient start of the project. 

4.4.2 Internal monitoring/evaluation will be provided by the project’s Internal Monitoring and Evaluation 

Department (SSEI), and will cover physical and financial monitoring, by component and expenditure 

category, in addition to assessing the project's impact on beneficiaries and the environment using relevant 

indicators established in a concerted manner. The SSEI will be supported in the beginning by a consultant to 

establish/confirm the baseline situation, and implement a monitoring and evaluation system incorporating 

verifiable indicators. The baseline study will include the gender profile in agriculture, to deepen the knowledge 

of beneficiary groups, especially on socio-economic aspects. This system must be operational latest six months 

after project take-off. In this regard, the project will produce quarterly and annual activity reports highlighting 

implementation status and outcomes of various components, in line with the performance indicators set out in 

the logical framework. 

4.2.3 The MAEP Directorate of Planning and Forecasts (PPD/MAEP) will be charged with external 

monitoring and evaluation, jointly with CAA and DGFD. The project will make resources required for this 

purpose available to the DPP, CAA and DGFD. Provision has been made for a mid-term review to ensure that 

the project is running smoothly and to propose any necessary adjustments. A joint final assessment is also 

scheduled towards the end of the project to draw lessons and build on project achievements. The AfDB 

Country Office in Benin will play an important role and participate in Bank supervision missions and 

monitoring meetings organised by the Government. In addition, the Bank will monitor the implementation of 

project activities through quarterly progress reports submitted by the PMU. Below is a summary of the project 

implementation schedule.

4.3. Governance. Progress has been made in economic and financial governance. Reforms have been 

implemented to strengthen public finance management and mitigate fiduciary risks. However, there is still 

need for improvements with regard to domestic resource mobilization, public resource programming and 

allocation. Although progress has been made in aligning the public procurement system with WAEMU 

guidelines, sluggish procurement persists as one of the main weaknesses that hamper the implementation of 

development programmes. 

4.4. Sustainability. The project aims to initiate real sustainable development, by placing sector 

stakeholders at the heart of decision-making while building their capacity to assume new responsibilities. An 

intervention process governed by eligibility criteria will be adopted to ensure the effective involvement of 

beneficiaries and avoid potential conflicts. The project will support communities to enhance their technical 

and organisational capacity, thereby fostering better expertise and ownership. Specifically, committees will 

be set up or revitalised at site for the proper management and regular maintenance of collective socio-

economic infrastructure. Private sector involvement in cashew nut processing and marketing activities is also 

a guarantee for sustaining the dynamics of the value chain. The sustainability issue, including the maintenance 

and management of infrastructure set up, was a central concern during project design. Therefore, measures 

will be taken for each type of infrastructure to ensure proper management and maintenance: maintenance of 

rehabilitated rural roads (comprehensive agreement signed with municipal councils); private sector 

involvement (through a PPP mechanism) in the management of storage warehouses; and the establishment of 

committees to manage improved village water supply systems. 

4.5. Risk Management. The foreseeable inherent project risks include: (i) risk related to land conflict. 

This could be mitigated by supporting the social assessment process for cashew plantations to be rehabilitated 

and new farms to be established. In this regard, the project provides support for land tenure security at the 

sites; (ii) transhumance risk, which could be mitigated by supporting municipal councils in developing 

endogenous conflict management mechanisms; and (iii) risk related to the low level of support from 

stakeholders in the sector, which will be mitigated through information/awareness campaigns and support for 

strengthening cooperatives and trading platforms at all levels of the value chain; (iv) as regards the risk of 

work execution delays, the mitigation measures would include having recourse to suitable procurement and 

parcelling methods, bidding documents for service roads and construction of storage warehouses prepared 

with the assistance of the delegated contracting authority. 

4.6. Knowledge Building. PADEFA-ENA will contribute to the training and knowledge consolidation 

of the various stakeholders, especially producers, through Component B "Develop value chains", especially 

thanks to the support and training provided by technical departments in terms of outreach, structuring and 

organisation. Using inclusive methods, it will also enable young people and women to develop technical and 

entrepreneurial skills, and to set themselves up on lands with infrastructure and modern farming equipment. 

Finally, the project will establish an integrated knowledge management and sharing system for project 



 

17 

 

activities through the regular dissemination of knowledge and experience on its website and that of ATDA4.

Project Summary 

1. The Integrated Agricultural Value Chains Development Project in Congo 
(PRODIVAC) will primarily focus on the corridors of the major commercial centres of 

Brazzaville and Pointe Noire, and the farming basins in the departments of Plateaux, Pool, 

Bouenza, Cuvette and, Niari. PRODIVAC is consistent with the National Development Plan 

(PND 2018-2022) drawn up by the Government of Congo and which targets agriculture as one 

of the main pillars of diversification, growth, competitiveness, sustainable job creation and 

poverty reduction, in response to the poor performance of the oil sector. The general objective 

of the project is to contribute to the improvement of food and nutrition security as well as 

diversification of the national economy. Its development objective is to promote competitive 

and resilient agriculture by developing agrifood value chains in Congo. Project activities will 

focus on four value chains (cassava, maize, poultry and fish) that have been prioritized by the 

direct stakeholders concerned, based on market demand, their contribution to the national 

economy (import substitution) and their potential impact on farming households, youth and 

women. 

2. PRODIVAC activities will benefit 355,000 persons, 40% being women and 40% 
being young people in various segments of targeted agricultural value chains. The project 

comprises the following components: (i) skills development and promotion of agricultural 

entrepreneurship; (ii) improvement of the productivity and resilience of agricultural production 

systems; (iii) institutional development and public-private dialogue; and (iv) project 

coordination and management. The total project cost over a six-year period is estimated at 

EUR 85.4 million (CFAF 56 billion), financed through a loan of EUR 73.2 million from the 

Bank and contributions of EUR 7.3 million from the Government of Congo and EUR 4.9 

million from beneficiaries.  

Needs Assessment.  

3. Development of the four agricultural value chains targeted by the project is plagued 
by several constraints. For cassava, these are: (i) low yields of approximately 8 tonnes per 

hectare (t/ha), relative to a potential of more than 25 t/ha; (ii) unregulated rudimentary and 

hygienic conditions for processing cassava into flour and "chikwangue"; and (iii) the lack of 

transport means, inaccessibility to farming areas and harassment on the highways. For the 

poultry (chickens and eggs) sector, the constraints are: (i) difficulties in the supply of day-old 

chicks, livestock feed (mainly maize as well as vitamin and trace element supplements); and 

(ii) weak veterinary advisory support services. For maize, which is the main raw material in 

the manufacture of animal feed, the constraints are: (i) the limited (technical and 

entrepreneurial) capacities of small producers; (ii) difficult access to quality seeds and other 

technologies; and (iii) insufficient infrastructure and equipment for production and marketing. 

Finally, for fish, the constraints are: (i) inaccessibility to production basins; (ii) insufficient 

advisory support; (iii) poor organisation of sector stakeholders; and (iv) supply difficulties for 

improved fish feed, good quality fry and other plant ingredients. These four value chains are 

equally hamstrung by significant financing constraints. 

4. Value-Added of the Bank: The Bank's added value comes from its experience gained 

through operations in the rural and agricultural sector. The project took into account the lessons 

learned from assessment of the report from the Bank's Independent Evaluation Department 

(IDEV) on AfDB support for AVC1 development, which includes recommendations on the 

following key principles: (i) analyse the entire value chain; (ii) develop a strategy to ensure

iii 

 

inclusiveness; (iii) maintain adaptability to market changes; (iv) think in terms of profitability 

with added value; and (v) develop plans to create a sustainable impact. PRODIVAC is 

consistent with the strategic objectives of inclusive and sustainable growth found in the Bank's 

2013-2022 Ten-Year Strategy, Pillar 1 on “Promoting agro-industrial value chains” of the 

2018-2022 Country Strategy Paper (CSP). Furthermore, this operation constitutes a major 

contribution2 to implementation of the National Agricultural Development Plan (PNDA) 2018-

2022, whose operational budget has been estimated at over CFAF 1000 billion, with a financing 

gap of over CFAF 959 billion, or nearly 84% of needs. PRODIVAC's conceptual approach took 

the guidelines of the "Feed Africa" strategy into consideration, including the flagship 

programmes on Technologies for African Agricultural Transformation (TAAT), youth 

entrepreneurship development in agriculture and agribusiness, risk-sharing mechanisms in 

agricultural finance, and the Africa Climate-Smart Agriculture (ACSA) flagship programme. 

The project's design is also consistent with the guidelines of the Subregional Forum on Boosting 

the Rural Economy in Central Africa, jointly organized by the Bank and the International 

Labour Office (ILO) in February 2019 in Brazzaville.  

5.  Knowledge Development: PRODIVAC will generate knowledge on themes related 

to improving the economic environment of the various crop sectors (inclusive sector policies, 

promotion of local products and development of standards, trade and tariff policy, development 

of appropriate financial products and trade ties, financing of innovations, incubation of 

agricultural enterprises and financing of innovations, etc.). The development of financing 

mechanisms in partnership with financial institutions will produce positive experiences as well 

as best practices and approaches that could be used in other value chains and countries to 

support the development of financial products tailored to youth enterprises and the financing 

needs of small, medium and large enterprises. As part of knowledge management, an electronic 

library containing all relevant documents from the agricultural sector, an inventory of best 

practices, local knowledge and innovations will be set up and made accessible to stakeholders 

and the public. This activity will be developed as part of institutional support to the Directorate 

for Studies and Planning (DEP) in the Ministry of Agriculture. The project's monitoring and 

evaluation system and a communication strategy will be developed to produce and disseminate 

the information developed. The knowledge generated by the Project will improve the 

interventions of ongoing projects, enhance the design of new projects and boost participation 

in policy dialogue. 

  

                                                 
2  The Bank's expected contribution to the agro-industrial sector during implementation of the CSP is estimated at UA 290 

 million, or about CFAF 232 billion, representing 24% of the financing gap.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF BANK GROUP MANAGEMENT TO THE 

BOARD OF DIRECTORS CONCERNING A PROPOSAL TO AWARD A LOAN TO THE 

REPUBLIC OF CONGO TO FINANCE THE INTEGRATED AGRICULTURAL VALUE 

CHAINS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IN CONGO (PRODIVAC) 
 

Management hereby submits this report and its recommendation concerning a proposal to award 

a loan of EUR 73,200,000 (seventy-three million two hundred thousand euros) to the 

Government of the Republic of Congo to finance the Integrated Agricultural Value Chains 

Development Project in Congo.  

 

I. STRATEGIC GUIDELINES AND OBJECTIVES 

1.1. Project Relation to Country Strategy and Objectives  

1.1.1  PRODIVAC is consistent with the National Development Plan (NDP 2018-2022) 

prepared by the Government of Congo whose two strategic priorities are: (i) reform of the 

education system as well as skills development and vocational training; and (ii) diversification of 

the economy with priority given to the agricultural, tourism and industrial sectors. The government 

holds the view that agricultural sector diversification would generate supplies for the processing 

industry, capitalize on attendant opportunities and synergies and reduce dependency on the outside 

world for food. This operation is a major contribution to implementation of the National 

Agricultural Development Plan (PNDA) 2018-2022, whose operational budget is estimated to 

exceed CFAF 1000 billion, with a financing gap of over CFAF 959 billion, or nearly 84% of needs. 

The project will contribute to the reduction of food imports estimated at approximately CFAF 600 

billion per year and mainly consisting of meat products, more than 50% of which is meat and eggs.  

1.1.2 PRODIVAC is consistent with the strategic objectives of inclusive and sustainable 

growth outlined in the Bank's Ten-year strategy 2013-2022, as well as the High-5 priorities. It is 

also consistent with the Bank's Country Strategy Paper (CSP) 2018-2022, which seeks to diversify 

and enhance the competitiveness of the Congolese economy, with a view to ensuring inclusive and 

sustainable growth, mainly through two pillars, namely: (i) promotion of agro-industrial value 

chains; and (ii) strengthening of human capital and governance. The Bank's expected contribution 

to the agro-industrial sector during implementation of the CSP is estimated at UA 290 million, or 

about CFAF 232 billion, representing 24% of the financing gap. The project design is consistent 

with the guidelines of the Bank's “Feeding Africa” Strategy, which focuses on the value chain 

approach, productivity improvement and resilience, with the adoption of technologies 

(Technologies for African Agricultural Transformation (TAAT); Africa Climate-Smart 

Agriculture (ACSA). The project is aligned with Job for Youth strategies, including the ENABLE 

YOUTH initiative. Lastly, the project will contribute to the strengthening of women's economic 

empowerment and the establishment of appropriate financing mechanisms for the agricultural 

sector. Its design is also consistent with the guidelines of the Subregional Forum on Boosting the 

Rural Economy in Central Africa, jointly organized by the Bank and the International Labour 

Office (ILO) in February 2019 in Brazzaville. The forum highlighted the need to develop youth 

skills and entrepreneurship, innovations and investments to improve the productivity and 

attractiveness of the agricultural and rural sectors, diversify income sources and ensure social 

inclusion.

1.2.  Rationale for Bank Intervention 

1.2.1  The Bank's intervention, which is a response to the request of Congolese authorities, is 

justified by the need to support the Congolese economy's diversification strategy by mobilizing 

major investments for the structural transformation of the agricultural sector. Indeed, the agro-

industrial sector presents many opportunities in terms of income generation for small producers, 

job creation, especially for youths and women, and improved food and nutritional security. 

Through the constraints identified, the Bank's various missions made it possible to propose priority 

intervention areas in four value chains namely: cassava, maize, poultry and fish. 

1.2.2 With regard to cassava, the main constraints identified are: (i) low yields of about 8 

tonnes per hectare (t/ha) in rural areas, relative to a potential that exceeds 25 t/ha; (ii) unregulated 

rudimentary and hygienic conditions for processing cassava into flour and chikwangue; (iii) lack 

of transport means, limited access to production areas and harassment on the highways. Regarding 

the poultry sector (chicken and eggs) the constraints are: (i) challenges in the supply of day-old 

chicks, livestock feed (mainly maize as well as vitamin and micro-nutrient supplements); and (ii) 

weak veterinary advisory and support services. With regard to maize, which is the main raw 

material in the production of animal feed, the constraints are: (i) the limited (technical and 

entrepreneurial) capacities of small producers; (ii) difficulties in accessing quality seeds and other 

technologies; and (iii) inadequate production and marketing infrastructure and equipment. Lastly, 

regarding fish, the constraints are: (i) inaccessibility to production basins; (ii) insufficient advisory 

support; (iii) no stakeholder organization within the sector; and (iv) challenges in supplying 

improved feed, good fry and other plant ingredients. 

1.2.3 In rural financing, the main constraints are: (i) the unsuitability of the products offered 

(high interest rate, recovery period not concurrent with production cycles, etc.); (ii) the existence 

of uncontrolled agricultural risks; and (iii) considerable shortage of medium- and long-term 

lendable resources. In addition, the financial inclusion rate of the rural population, estimated at 

6%, remains low. The main reasons for such a low bank penetration rate include high poverty 

which accounts for insufficient incomes and the sheer size of the informal sector within which 

most economic actors operate.  

1.2.4 The project will help to eliminate the above-mentioned constraints by promoting 

inclusive agricultural and rural entrepreneurship. PRODIVAC supports competitive market-driven 

agriculture with strong private sector involvement. In addition, the project will support women's 

economic empowerment, entrepreneurship and youth skills development and the establishment of 

an appropriate agricultural financing mechanism. Lastly, the project will sustainably improve 

agricultural productivity by facilitating access to factors of production (improved and resilient 

inputs, machinery, labour, capital, land), soil fertility management and the improvement of rural 

infrastructure. It will achieve this mainly by opening up access to production  areas. The project 

will focus its operations on a limited number of value chains, namely: (i) cassava (Chikwangue, 

flour and other products); (ii) poultry (broilers and eggs); (iii) maize (for animal feed, direct 

consumption and breweries); and (iv) aquaculture/fish farming (fresh and salted/smoked fish). The 

selection of these value chains is informed by certain economic, environmental, social and 

institutional considerations namely: (i) market demand; (ii) their contribution to the national 

economy (import substitution and export growth); (iii) their potential impact on agricultural 

households, the youth and women; (iv) their production and productivity growth potential; (v) their 

contribution to food security and improved nutrition; and (vi) the opportunity to build on and 

consolidate past project interventions with a view to maximizing the outcomes of the current 

project.

1.3.  Aid Coordination 

1.3.1 The Ministry in charge of Planning currently plays a significant role in the coordination 

of operations. However, aid coordination in the agricultural sector will be further improved over 

the next years through the establishment of a thematic working group on agriculture and rural 

development in January 2019. The main donors in Congo’s agricultural sector are the World Bank 

which is financing the Commercial Agricultural Development Project with USD 100 million and 

the International Fund for Agricultural Development which is financing the Congo Inland 

Fisheries and Aquaculture Development Project (PDPAC) with USD 7.7 million. 

1.3.2 PRODIVAC will develop synergies and complementarities with ongoing investment 

projects and will mobilize co-financing and establish partnerships with future initiatives and 

projects. The project will also develop complementarities with an ongoing integrated initiative that 

connects small producers with an industrial processing plant in Loudima, Bouenza. The plant will 

have an annual production capacity of 16,000 tonnes of flour (bio-fortified with micro-nutrients) 

supplied at a social rate (less than 30% of the price of non-fortified flour) to the World Food 

Programme (for school feeding programmes and refugees as a substitute for rice imports) and to 

the national market. This approach will be developed through a public-private partnership with the 

participation of the government and United Nations agencies (WFP, FAO, IFAD). In addition, a 

request for the mobilization of parallel co-financing of UA 20 million from the Green Climate 

Funds is being prepared for approval in 2020. Lastly, expected partnership with the next IFAD 

project currently being designed will maximize the project's expected impact. The following table

2.2.  Technical Solution Adopted and Alternatives Explored 

2.2.1 Inclusive value chains and targeting of potential production areas. The project will focus 

its operations on a limited number of value chains (cassava, maize, poultry and fish) prioritized by 

direct stakeholders based on market demand, their contribution to the national economy (import 

substitution) and their potential impact on agricultural households, youths and women. The project 

aims at improving the competiveness of agricultural products, optimizing processing and 

marketing operations and facilitating business partnerships between small producers and private 

operators. Its focus will be on improving downstream agricultural production activities 

(processing, enhancing value-added and marketing), which should serve as a lever for improving 

production and adopting resilient technical routes. 



5 

 

2.2.2 Promotion of public-private partnership and facilitation of business partnerships among 

stakeholders. Agricultural sector transformation requires the involvement of the private sector 

which is the engine of growth, while the State plays the key role of defining strategic guidelines 

and facilitating the control and monitoring of development policies and actions through incentives 

and improvement of the business environment. There are opportunities to establish business 

partnerships between producer groups and private operators such as the Congo Sugar Refining 

company (Société agricole de raffinage industriel du sucre (SARIS)), the agro-pastoral company 

(ATORA), the Congolese Food Development and Distribution Authority (CODDIPA), Eco-Oil, 

AgriCongo, supermarkets as well as institutional markets such as the World Food Programme and 

public institutions (schools, public services). There is also the gradual emergence of a new class 

of agricultural entrepreneurs capable of investing in private farms and developing business 

relationships with small producers. PRODIVAC's interventions will help to facilitate negotiations 

between stakeholders or groups of stakeholders in the drafting of contracts. The simple contract 

farming model will be promoted for group marketing, and to facilitate financing within the value 

chains.  

2.2.3 Risk hedging and sharing facility: Target sectors will be financed through a technical 

mechanism linked to financial institutions in order to ensure the promotion of rural financial 

services and the sustainability of supply within the various segments of targeted value chains. The 

financing mechanism will make it possible to develop suitable financial products, including 

"mobile banking". This will involve: (i) the establishment of a direct credit window. PRODIVAC 

will set up a fund to provide partner financial institutions with stable lendable resources to 

adequately meet the financing needs of supported MPMEAs. Partner financial institutions (PFIs) 

will receive loans at an access rate of 3% per year, but will contribute 30% of the amount required 

to finance MPMEAs. The interest rates applicable to end borrowers will not exceed 9% per year. 

Beneficiaries' access to the window will be subject to: (i) a cash contribution of about 10%; (ii) 

the establishment of a mechanism known as a Guarantee Fund to support loans to MPMEAs and 

large companies operating in the sectors of the various PRODIVAC chains. Indeed, this Guarantee 

Fund is a hedging and risk sharing facility (HRSF). The project will consent to the establishment 

of a partial guarantee fund that will cover 50% of the risks in the event of default. Beneficiaries 

will also participate by providing commercial contracts appended to business plans within the 

context of productive partnerships. The conditions for the use of the HRSF will be discussed and 

specified with the PFIs concerned before the partnership agreements are formalized. Interest rates 

will be based on market rates and promoters will contribute 10% of the loan amount requested; 

and (iii) the creation of a capacity-building programme for stakeholders in the various 

sectors. 

 

2.2.4 This mechanism will be managed by a Financial Operator (FO) who will be selected on 

the basis of an analysis conducted with the support of an individual consultant. Consideration will 

be given to the strengths and weaknesses of existing refinancing and guarantee institutions 

(Garantie de l’Association Pointe Noire Industrielle, Support Fund for the Socio-economic 

Reintegration of Disadvantaged Groups, Agriculture Support Fund, etc.). The FO will be 

responsible for reviewing funding requests submitted by MPMEAs through partner financial 

institutions. This activity will make it possible to support the operationalization of the functional 

financing mechanism, prepare management tools, build the capacities of bank loan officers, 

promote the development of new financial products and the financial education of beneficiaries. 

2.2.5.  Skills development and youth entrepreneurship: With regard to technical and vocational 

training, PRODIVAC will finance: (i) the upgrading of the equipment of the Education, Training 

and Apprenticeship Centres (CEFA) in Dolisie, Brazzaville and Pointe Noire, financed through a 

previous Bank project; (ii) the upgrading of the equipment of Lycée Technique Industriel and 

Lycée d'Enseignement Professionnel Agricole in Brazzaville; (iii) the development and/or 



6 

 

adaptation of existing curricula to promising economic niches to facilitate youth access to 

employment; and (iv) the establishment of a platform/mechanism for anticipating skills needs and 

those of related occupations by building the capacity of teachers, business advisors, chambers of 

agriculture and all stakeholders in the education sector. With regard to youth entrepreneurship, 

PRODIVAC will finance the following activities: (i) prospective studies to identify 

entrepreneurship opportunities for the youth, raise awareness on entrepreneurship among the youth 

and provide guidance on existing entrepreneurship opportunities. Such awareness-raising will be 

conducted through workshops, for and media programmes, focusing on the success stories of 

young people who have prospered in the field of agricultural entrepreneurship; (ii) support for the 

establishment and assistance of 300 micro-, small- and medium-sized agricultural businesses 

(MPMEA) for youths through an incubation process of close supervision, coaching and mentoring; 

(iii) support for incubation centres, including the two Songhai centres in Congo and other public 

or private structures specializing in the business incubation process; and (iv) facilitation of a 

platform for young entrepreneurs. This activity will be developed in collaboration with the 

Ministry of Small and Medium Enterprises and with the support of specialized (international and 

national) technical assistance.4 

2.2.6 Competitive fund for innovation and promotion of youth entrepreneurship and 
agricultural start-ups. The project will finance an innovation fund to support entrepreneurs, youths 
and producers’ organisations (POs) who present innovative ideas and initiatives for improving 

value chain quality and performance, including: (i) the development of new products or markets; 

(ii) equipment and process testing; (iii) the use of alternative energy; (iv) new technologies that 

are more environmentally-friendly; (v) expertise in food quality and safety; (vi) the use of new 

information and communication technologies to market and promote products, including fortified 

cassava flour etc.; and (vi) the certification and labelling of processed products. Annual 

competitions will be organized at the national level to identify ideas and initiatives with the 

potential for large-scale impact. This fund will be managed with Association Pointe Noire 

Industrielle (APNI), which is already implementing a small- and medium-sized enterprises 

development programme, in collaboration with the Pointe Noire Chamber of Commerce, Industry, 

Agriculture and Crafts (CCIAM). Individual technical assistance will be mobilized for the 

development of operational procedures based on similar successful experiences (Tony Elumelu 

Entrepreneurship Program, AgriPitch, the Ivorian Competitive Fund for Agricultural Innovation, 

etc.). CCIAM will encourage financial institutions and operators in the telecommunications and 

private sector to co-invest in this fund, including buying shares in youth start-ups. 

2.2.7.   Sustainability of rural infrastructure. Actions to improve access will mainly be 

rehabilitation activities carried out from time to time to maintain critical areas (muddy segments, 

steep-sided low-lying areas, watercourse crossing points, steep slopes, etc.) to enable a given 

stretch of a road to be used all year round. The structures will be built of durable materials and 

designed to ensure proper drainage. Drawing lessons from road maintenance governance, the 

project will support local authorities and value chain actors to initiate local management by 

involving and empowering them at all implementation stages. This principle will strengthen local 

governance and the project's sustainability by enabling local authorities to play their roles in 

territorial development planning and infrastructure management in an inclusive manner. To this 

end, all sub-projects to be carried out under the project will be selected through a participatory 

process that involves the local authorities, economic actors and producer organizations in the 

relevant production areas.

2.5.  Project Area and Beneficiaries 

2.5.1 The project will primarily cover the corridors of major marketing and consumption 

centres of Brazzaville and Pointe Noire and the production areas in the Plateaux, Pool, and 

Bouenza Departments. The departments of Cuvette and Niari, in which the Songhai centres are 

located, will also be covered by the project, in particular with regard to the youth entrepreneurship 

component. However, the project will be flexible enough to support private investments outside 

these zones as well as priority sectors depending on market trends. Some project activities (access 

to financing, youth innovation funds, policy dialogue, etc.) will be more relevant from a thematic 

(value chains) and geographic perspective given their cross-cutting nature. The three departments 

selected have enormous potential for the development of agriculture, poultry and fish farming, 

with huge swathes of fertile land that remain unexploited. Furthermore, the project’s intervention 

in these areas, especially in the Pool Province, will contribute to peacebuilding and social cohesion.   

2.5.2.  The population of the three departments in the project area (25% of the country’s 

surface area) is 746,024 inhabitants, representing about 15% of the national population. 



9 

 

Agriculture is largely unmechanised and is practiced on very small farms of about 1 to 2 ha 

which produce 90% of the food yield. In this context, 70% of agricultural workers are women. 

The sector is characterized by slash-and-burn farming as well as low labour and surface area 

productivity. The real agricultural land occupancy rate remains low and output is insufficient for 

all sectors selected. These departments are connected to Brazzaville by national roads RN1 and 

RN2 and the Brazzaville-Pointe-Noire railway, which should create opportunities for produce 

marketing and the supply of inputs. Proximity to major urban centres is certainly an asset in 

terms of marketing and supply, but also a constraint due to the rural exodus of young workers 

drawn by more attractive conditions and opportunities.  

2.5.3.  Beneficiaries: The project will impact 355,000 persons in the different segments of the 

selected agri-food value chains. It will primarily target youths, women and vulnerable groups, 

including indigenous peoples, by increasing employment and income-generating opportunities in 

production and processing activities. It will do so by enhancing the attractiveness and profitability 

of such activities, supporting the development of agricultural entrepreneurship, providing adequate 

advisory support and promoting production-related activities (services, transport, marketing). 

More specifically, the project will seek to: (i) increase their incomes and enhance their economic 

independence; (ii) strengthen their decision-making ability and representation; (iii) promote 

women’s rights and financial autonomy; and (iv) reduce their workload. Women and youths will 

be targeted through the application of quotas and specific actions (Sub-components 1.2 on Youth 

Entrepreneurship Development and 2.3 on Women's Empowerment) to ensure their economic 

empowerment. The indirect beneficiaries of the project will be the populations of the departments 

of Brazzaville, Pointe Noire, Pool, Plateaux, Bouenza, Cuvette and Niari, who will benefit from 

improved market access for targeted agricultural products and job creation for young people. 

2.6.  Participatory Approach to Project Identification, Design and 

 Implementation 

2.6.1 In addition to consultations with government authorities and technical services of the 

ministries6 concerned by the project and with technical and financial partners in the agricultural 

sector, extensive consultations were also held with all stakeholders in the agricultural value chains. 

The various project formulation missions carried out visits to markets and private companies and 

held group discussions with young entrepreneurs as well as civil society and private sector 

organizations in Brazzaville and Pointe Noire. The missions made field visits to the Pool, Plateaux 

and Bouenza Departments and held consultations with the relevant stakeholders (producer groups, 

women's cooperatives, youth groups, local authorities and decentralized technical services). They 

also held consultations with several financial institutions, including the Bank of Central African 

States, commercial banks (UBA, BCI, BGFI-Bank) and microfinance institutions (CAPPED, 

MUCODEC and Crédit du Congo). The mission also met with major private operators in the 

Congolese agri-food sector, including SARIS, ATORA, CODDIPA and the Federation of 

Congolese Entrepreneurs, UNICONGO. 

2.6.2 These consultations made it possible to determine, among other things: (i) the production 

areas and priority sectors; (ii) market trends and trade flows; (iii) business opportunities and 

potential value added in the value chains; (iv) the interventions of previous projects; (v) the 

regulatory business environment, constraints on effective and adequate private sector involvement 

and participation; (vi) innovations and technologies to improve production and processing; (vii) 

the position and aspirations of women and youths in value chains; (viii) experiences and 

                                                 
6  The Mission worked closely and with the wide involvement of the technical services of the following ministries: Agriculture, Livestock and 

Fisheries; Forestry; Planning, Equipment and Major works; Equipment and Road Maintenance; Small and Medium Enterprises, Craft s and 

Informal Sector, Technical and Vocational Education, Skills Training and Employment; Scientific Research and Technological Innovation; 

Women's Development and Gender Integration in Development; Youth and Civic Education; Trade, Supply and Consumer Affairs; etc.  

 



10 

 

constraints in accessing finance, especially for agricultural, agri-business and MSMEA 

development in the medium and long terms; (ix) lessons learned from previous projects; and (x) 

specific issues to be explored in different areas. These consultations revealed that all segments of 

the agricultural value chains were underdeveloped and fragmented, and faced several constraints. 

Processing and marketing, in particular, have remained weak links in the agricultural value chains. 

Consultations with stakeholders will continue during project implementation to ensure the 

effective implementation and sustainability of operations. 

2.7. Bank Group Experience and Lessons Reflected in Project Design 

2.7.1.  Since 1967, the Bank has contributed UA 356 million to financing development 

operations in the Republic of Congo. Apart from the agricultural sector study conducted in 2012, 

the Bank’s agricultural sector investments in Congo date back more than 20 years. Its portfolio 

performance in Congo is considered satisfactory overall. The experience gained from cooperation 

with Congo during implementation of the country strategy and projects highlights the importance 

of: (i) focusing on selectivity and flexibility in project design and implementation; (ii) paying 

special attention to both physical investments and governance; (iii) building partnerships with the 

private sector; (iv) focusing on large, core/transformative, integrated projects; and (v) ensuring 

better quality at entry and applying a more pragmatic and realistic approach when programming 

operations. These lessons are reflected in the new Country Strategy Paper (CSP 2018-2022) 

through which the Bank intends to play the role of catalyst in the agribusiness sector, which is 

crucial to diversification of the Congolese economy.  

2.7.2  The project integrated the lessons learned from the IDEV (currently BDEV) evaluation 

of the Bank's support for AVC7 development, whose recommendations focus on the following key 

principles: (i) analyse the entire value chain; (ii) develop a strategy to ensure inclusiveness; (iii) 

maintain the capacity to adapt to market trends; (iv) think in terms of profitability with added 

value; and (v) develop plans to create a sustainable impact.  

2.8.  Main Performance Indicators  

2.8.1.  PRODIVAC's impact indicators are (i) a reduction in the chronic malnutrition rate from 

21% to 18%; (ii) an increase in agricultural-sector growth from 7 to 11%; and (iii) a significant 

reduction in food imports. Over six years, the project's outputs will directly benefit approximately 

125,000 people (and indirectly benefit about 355,000 people, of whom 40% are women and 40% 

are young people) in various segments of the cassava, maize, poultry and fish value chains. The 

project is expected to produce the following results: (i) an increase of at least 40% in the marketed 

volumes of the targeted value chains; (ii) a significant reduction in post-harvest losses and animal 

mortality (at least 60% on average); (iii) at least 400 small- and medium-sized agricultural 

enterprises promoted through the refinancing and financing risk-hedging mechanism; (iv) an 

improvement in the Rural Women's Empowerment Index (1 = low and 5 = high) from 1 to 3.5; (v) 

an increase in the agricultural loan portfolio of at least 7.5 billion outstanding loans at the end of 

the project; (vi) an average increase of more than 70% in the yield and output of the targeted 

sectors; and (vii) improved food diversity via greater production and consumption of iron-rich 

foods.

III.  PROJECT FEASIBILITY 

3.1.  Economic and Financial Performance 

3.1.1.  Financial performance was assessed for ten (10) typical models of farms and enterprises 

engaged in the production, processing, quality improvement and marketing of cassava, maize, 

poultry and fish, which reflect the range of activities that the project will support.  The financial 

analysis shows that these investments will contribute to boosting the net profits of these 

operations/companies substantially, which is evidence that the activities supported by PRODIVAC 

will be profitable. These results (Table 3.1) show that project support will improve the financial 

performance of MSMAEs engaged in production, processing, conservation and marketing.  

3.1.2. The economic analysis results show that the project benefits are very positive. The 

project's basic economic rate of return is 20.1%. The net present value is estimated at EUR 104.4 

million. However, this amount should increase if project benefits pertaining to the reduction of 

micro-nutrient deficiencies and chronic malnutrition, access to safe drinking water and sanitation, 

and the economic empowerment of women are factored into the equation. Indeed, reduction of 

malnutrition and access to safe drinking water will help to improve the overall health status of 

households, and lead to, inter alia, increased labour productivity for household members and 

reduced spending. Supporting young people through business incubation will strengthen their 

managerial capacity and boost self-employment and employment for other young people. 

Table 3.1: Significant Economic and Financial Figures 
 

ERR (baseline scenario): 20.1%  NPV amount: 104.4 (EUR million) 

 

3.1.3.  The sensitivity analysis based on a 30% increase in costs, a 30% decrease in benefits and 

a three-year delay in generating benefits, a 20% increase in input prices and a 20% decrease in 

product prices confirms the project's robust positive economic effects and impacts with economic 

rates of return of 17.9%, 16.2%, 15.3%, 10.2% and 17.6% respectively.  

3.2.  Environmental and Social Impacts 

Environment 

3.2.1  The project is classified under Category 2 of the Bank's Integrated Safeguards System 

(ISS) and the Bank's Climate Safeguards System (CSS), equivalent to Category B at the national 

level, although many sites and activities have not yet been identified at this stage of project 

preparation. Activities included in Component 2 of the project are likely to generate negative 

environmental impacts, such as: (i) pollution and waste generation during infrastructure 

construction works; (ii) pollution and waste generation during product processing within the 

various value chains; (iii) risks of land and water pollution and of the endangerment of the health 

of users by agrochemical products; (iv) degradation of the flora and fauna during the operation of 

quarries and borrow pits for construction work; (v) risk of accidents on construction sites and at 

processing unit sites and; (vi) the risk of transmission of communicable diseases on the various 

sites.  

3.2.2 However, the expected negative impacts will be limited in time. Given that the location 

and environmental and social characteristics of all investments are not known, an Environmental 

and Social Management Framework (ESMF) has been prepared in accordance with the 

requirements of the Bank's Integrated Safeguards System. The ESMF indicates the mitigation and 

management procedures, and measures that will have to be implemented by the project once the 

sites and sub-projects are known. These measures are outlined in the Environmental and Social 

Management Framework (ESMF) Plan and include: sub-project analysis and screening 

procedures; consultation, communication and conflict management procedures; environmental 



12 

 

and social management plans (ESMPs) and environmental and social clauses to be included in 

bidding documents and sub-project implementation contracts; guidelines on forests and wetlands; 

and guidelines on pesticide and pest management. The project’s activities will yield many positive 

impacts for both local communities and the environment. Therefore, the participatory approach 

involving local communities in the rehabilitation of road infrastructure, the promotion of more 

sustainable and climate-smart agricultural practices and the reduction of post-harvest losses will 

boost the livelihood resilience of rural households, restore soil fertility and increase tree cover, 

thereby significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  

3.2.3  Functions pertaining to environmental protection measures will include (i) screening of 

sub-projects and identification of their category using environmental and social selection forms; 

(ii) recruitment of consultancy firms/consultants to prepare ESMPs after validation of the process 

by the Directorate-General for the Environment; (iii) inclusion of environmental clauses into the 

recruitment process for implementing companies; (iv) monitoring/evaluation of the 

implementation of sub-projects; and (vi) coordination of audits. As a whole, the environmental 

and social function needs to be strengthened within the institutions involved in project 

implementation. Moreover, institutional and technical support, training and awareness-raising 

measures will have to be adopted to build institutional and human capacities. Such measures will 

seek to: (i) operationalize PRODIVAC's environmental management strategy; (ii) foster the 

emergence of local expertise and professionals in environmental and social management; (iii) raise 

the professional awareness and level of responsibility of the staff in production companies; and 

(iv) protect the urban and rural environment, health and safety of beneficiary communities. 

3.2.4  The total cost of the project ESMF is CFAF 374 million with provisions of (i) 

CFAF 110 million for studies including ESMPs, the Pest and Pesticide Management Plan (PPMP) 

and the Environmental and Social Management Systems (ESMS) Manual for each value chain; 

(ii) CFAF 105 million for training and awareness-raising; (iii) CFAF 50 million for compensation 

for any asset damage and; (iv) CFAF 79 million for monitoring/evaluation.   

3.2.5  Consultations were conducted under the ESMF at different periods of project 

preparation. Participants’ comments were integrated into the ESMF that has been validated by the 

Bank and the summary was published on 26/08/20198. 

Climate Change 

3.2.6  The impacts of climate change are evident in Congo through, inter alia, rising 

temperatures and increasingly erratic rainfall that affect the national agricultural sector, thus 

increasing the vulnerability of local communities to this phenomenon. PRODIVAC is proposed 

for classification in Category 2 for Climate Change as it will integrate the appropriate adaptation 

measures for all the selected sectors. These measures will be simple, affordable, already validated 

and tested in the country or sub-region and accessible to smallholders. They will include the 

dissemination of short-cycle varieties and the planting of cover crops and leguminous shrubs 

(agroforestry) on farms. Co-financing is being sought under the Adaptation Window of the Green 

Climate Fund. The eligible activities are those that fall under Component 2, which seeks to 

strengthen the resilience of agriculture through : (i) the dissemination of improved seeds, farming 

best practices and climate-smart technologies; and (ii) the construction of backbone infrastructure 

to ensure the sustainable development of agricultural value chains.

Gender  

3.2.7.  The project is classified in Gender Category No. 2, according to the Bank's Gender 

Marker System (GMS)9, as it will help to reduce the gender gap in terms of access to production 

factors and income. Women, who represent about 50% of the population of Congo and 70% of the 

agricultural workforce and contribute 80% to traditional subsistence agriculture, 22% to 

commercial agriculture, and nearly 90% to the processing of agricultural products, are more 

vulnerable to poverty. The project's targeting strategy takes this reality into account and will ensure 

that women have at least 40% representation in project activities. In addition, the project is 

investing approximately EUR 5 million to finance specific activities for the economic 

empowerment of women to (i) process and sell cassava products; (ii) process and sell fish; (iii) 

promote improved village poultry farming; (iv) organize women's groups and cooperatives, and 

capacity building; and (v) promote basic actions in nutrition, hygiene and sanitation.  

3.2.8.  In addition to sex- and age-disaggregated data, gender-specific indicators are included in 

the results-based logical framework to measure the women's empowerment index in agriculture. 

This index measures women's increased capacity to make strategic life choices within their 

households and communities, focusing on five areas of agricultural empowerment, namely: (i) 

production (women's role in family decision-making on agricultural production); (ii) resources 

(women's access to productive capital, access to and decision-making power over loans); (iii) 

control over income use; (iv) women's individual leadership and influence in the community; and 

(v) time allocation for women. This index will be used as a diagnostic tool and a monitoring 

indicator to measure how the project affects women's empowerment.  

3.2.9.  Specific activities for young people have been developed in sub-component 1.2. These 

activities include: (i) the identification and promotion of agricultural entrepreneurship 

opportunities; (ii) the establishment and support of micro, small and medium-sized agricultural 

enterprises run by young people, via, inter alia, innovative business incubators and financing; (iii) 

the establishment of a platform to exchange information, experience and networking among 

entrepreneurs (competitions will be organized to find a tool developer); (iv) the establishment of 

a competitive fund to innovate and promote entrepreneurship and agricultural start-ups owned by 

young people; and (v) the promotion of incubators for young people, especially by boosting 

existing initiatives such as Songhaï Center and CEFAs financed by previous Bank projects.   

Social Aspects 

3.2.10.  PRODIVAC will have major positive impacts on the living conditions of rural 

communities by improving the production structure in various agricultural sub-sectors and 

increasing access to basic infrastructure, such as rural roads, markets, drinking water and sanitation 

facilities. Project activities will focus on skills development and youth employment in rural areas, 

gender inclusion, improvement of the living conditions of beneficiaries, cooperative 

entrepreneurship to improve the distribution of value throughout the various value chains. The 

project will generate cross-cutting benefits for small family farms, women, young people and small 

and medium-sized enterprises in terms of improved incomes, greater productivity, and better living 

conditions for agricultural families. Finally, through the local development participatory approach 

adopted, PRODIVAC will help strengthen the social inclusion of minority groups, particularly 

indigenous peoples, and the reduction of inequalities along the value chains. 

 

                                                 
9 According to the Bank's GMP, a project is classified under the Category 2 if it reduces gender 

inequalities and or, women's economic empowerment is one of the effects of the project, but not 

the main one. 

 



14 

 

Forced Resettlement 

 

3.2.11  PRODIVAC activities will not involve the acquisition of land, the forced resettlement of 

communities and/or restriction of their access to resources or livelihoods. Support for the 

development of specific value chains will essentially entail guiding cooperative groups and private 

companies that own land in their production, processing and marketing activities, using 

technological packages, capacity-building, and better access to finance and partners in the value 

chains. The improvement of seeds, cuttings, fry and chicks will be conducted by existing research 

institutions and private investors who will use their own land. Seed and cutting growers and private 

investors will conduct their activities on their land and in accordance with the applicable national 

land tenure policies and laws.  

3.2.12  With regard to core infrastructure, the project will adopt an active approach that favours 

the participation and empowerment of sector stakeholders and local authorities at all stages of 

implementation (from planning to works completion). Requests for support must come from the 

Departmental Council or the Rural Community. Infrastructure sites such as markets and other 

buildings will be owned by local communities or the Departmental Council, which will be 

responsible for their management and maintenance. Rural access roads will be rehabilitated on an 

as-needed basis, focusing on critical points (muddy segments, steep-sided low-lying areas, 

watercourse crossing points, steep slopes etc.) with as much local support as possible. The Project 

will set up local and departmental complaint management committees that will also be responsible 

for initiating and supervising the payment of any compensation arising from the destruction of an 

asset or restriction of access to a resource as a result of project activities. Financial provision for 

such compensation has been made in the ESMP, in particular for infrastructure construction or 

rehabilitation sub-projects.  

IV.  EXECUTION 

4.1.  Implementation Arrangements 

4.1.1 National Steering Committee (CNP): PRODIVAC will have a National Steering 

Committee chaired by the Minister who serves as AfDB Governor (or his or her representative) 

with the Minister of Agriculture (or his or her representative) acting as deputy chair. The members 

of the National Steering Committee will include: (i) representatives of the ministries concerned by 

the project, in particular the Ministries of Agriculture, Planning, Finance, Forest Economy, 

Technical Education and Employment, SMEs, Industry, Social Affairs, Health, and those handling 

youth and women’s affairs; (ii) a private-sector representative, UNICONGO; (iii) a representative 

of Congolese producer organisations, the National Confederation of Congolese Producer 

Organisations (CNOP) and; (iv) a representative of the local authorities in the project area. This 

arrangement was adopted due to the selection of PACIGOF/PADEC, under the supervision of the 

Ministry of Planning, to host the Coordination Unit and given that the project spans several sectors. 

The mandate of the National Steering Committee, which will meet at least twice a year, is to: (i) 

review and approve the annual work plans and budgets prepared by the project; (ii) review the 

semi-annual progress reports, annual reports, mid-term review reports and project completion 

reports; (iii) ensure that programme/project activities are consistent with the sector programmes 

and strategies of the Ministries concerned by the project; (iv) review progress made towards the 

achievement of project objectives; (v) facilitate the coordination of project activities between the 

various implementing entities; and (vi) analyse implementation risks and obstacles and provide 

the necessary guidance to ensure the attainment of expected results. 



15 

 

4.1.2 Project Coordination Unit (PCU): The PCU will be hosted within the 

PACIGOF/PADEC Coordination Unit,10 which has proven experience in the administrative and 

fiduciary management and coordination of Bank projects and those of other financial partners. In 

addition, it is already involved in improving the business climate and supporting small and 

medium-sized enterprises. Consequently, this arrangement will yield efficiency gains by pooling 

certain resources and functions, including procurement, financial management, communication 

and knowledge management, administration, and human resources management. The PCU is 

expected to: (i) facilitate inter-sector coordination; (ii) monitor implementation of the 

recommendations from the CNP's deliberations and those of audit reports, portfolio reviews, mid-

term reviews; (iii) ensure the fiduciary management of the project; and produce any other 

document that falls within its remit. PACIGOF/PADEC coordination will be strengthened through 

a Deputy Coordinator; assistants responsible for fiduciary management, internal and external 

monitoring and evaluation (monitoring of implementation, outcomes and impact in collaboration 

with the National Statistics Institution), value-chain development and financing; a private-sector 

development and entrepreneurship expert, an environmental and social protection expert and 

support staff. The technical departments of the Ministries involved in implementing the project 

will be responsible for the technical execution of the components under their purview. Each 

directorate will designate a focal point to monitor day-to-day activities.  

4.1.3 Departmental Offices: Three departmental offices of the Project will be established in 

the departments concerned. They will be located in Kinkala, Djambala and Madingou. Agricultural 

sector leaders will be the project's focal points at the district level. The two Songhai centres will 

be directly monitored by the National Coordination Unit. The departmental offices will be 

responsible for the following tasks: (i) project coordination at the departmental level and 

establishment of ties with local authorities; (ii) preparation and monitoring/evaluation of AWPB 

(Annual Work Programme and Budget) at the departmental level and drafting of progress reports; 

(iii) provision of technical support for implementation of the technical components of the Project; 

(v) regular and close monitoring/supervision of the project and service providers; (vi) assessment 

of the agreements and performance contracts of local service providers; (vii) stakeholder 

mobilization for the implementation of operations; and (viii) development of synergies and 

partnerships within their respective project areas. Departmental office staff will comprise: (i) the 

office manager, who is an institutional development and capacity-building expert or a specialist in 

a similar field of expertise; (ii) an agricultural engineering technician; (iii) an agro-pastoral 

production systems technician; (iv) an agro-business advisor (processing and marketing); (v) a 

monitoring/evaluation and knowledge management assistant; (vi) an administrative and financial 

assistant; and (vii) support staff (one assistant, two drivers and two watchmen). 

4.1.4  Technical Assistance and Launch Support: In view of PRODIVAC's specific focus on 

innovative approaches to integrated value-chain development, including the promotion of youth 

entrepreneurship and the development of financing mechanisms, it is suggested that targeted 

technical assistance be mobilized to launch the project quickly and implement it efficiently. It will 

focus on: (i) developing strategic programming and country programme management tools; (ii) 

building the capacity of implementation stakeholders and launching specific institutional support 

activities; (iii) refining targeting and implementation approaches; (iv) reconfiguring the 

monitoring/evaluation system; (v) developing the scale-up strategy; and (vi) launching financial 

services access activities. To that end, the FAO's technical assistance will be mobilized to develop 

the seed sector and promote climate-smart technologies. With regard to skills development through 

technical and vocational training and entrepreneurship, ILO technical assistance will be mobilized 

to support the relevant technical ministry. PRODIVAC will also support the development of 

partnerships between the Compacts of the Bank-funded Multinational Programme Technology for

Africa Agricultural Transformation in (TAAT) and national research programmes on cassava, 

maize, poultry and fish farming.  

4.1.5  Implementation Stakeholders: Implementation stakeholders comprise specialized 

private companies, consultancy firms, specialized public entities and any other specialized 

structures, depending on the most appropriate procurement method. Technical Assistance and 

Local Support: The experience and lessons learned from project implementation in Congo 

highlight three major limitations: (i) delays at project launch (ii) weak implementation teams and 

operators; and (iii) onerous procurement procedures. Accordingly, technical assistance in the form 

of short-term individual consultants will be mobilized to: (i) update the manual and configure the 

PACIGOF management system; (ii) prepare the implementation and monitoring/evaluation 

manuals; (iii) prepare the implementation and bidding documents for 300 km of rural roads, in 

addition to the two TA packages for the financing and innovation fund component. These expenses 

will be covered as soon as the project is approved by the PACIGOF project.  

4.1.6  Procurement Arrangements: All goods and works obtained through international 

competitive bidding and consultancy services financed by the Bank shall be procured in 

accordance with the Procurement Policy for Bank-Group Funded Operations (dated October 2015) 

and using the appropriate standard bidding documents of the Bank. Goods and works obtained 

through national competitive bidding shall be procured in accordance with national public 

procurement laws, using the country's standard bidding documents, and with the provisions set out 

in the financing agreement. A procurement plan for the first 18 months was prepared by the 

Government during the appraisal mission and will be regularly updated during the project 

implementation phase. The procurement arrangements are outlined in the technical annexes. 

Financial Management and Disbursement Arrangements 

4.1.7 The fiduciary risk for PRODIVAC's financial management is assessed as moderate. The 

financial management arrangements within the PADEC/PACIGOF Project Coordination Unit at 

the Ministry of Planning, meet the Bank's minimum requirements as defined in the policy on 

"Financial Management of Projects Financed by the African Development Bank" issued in 

February 2014. This Unit, which has already implemented the PADE (WB) and PACADEC 

(ADB) projects, has relevant experience in implementing projects financed jointly by the Bank 

and the World Bank. Lessons learned from the implementation of completed PADE/PACADEC 

projects were factored into the assessment of the executing agency's capacity and financial 

management risk. These lessons will help to improve PRODIVAC's financial management 

through the risk mitigation measures proposed in the financial management action plan presented 

in the annex. These measures will make it possible to maintain a moderate level of fiduciary risk 

and to provide, with reasonable certainty, reliable financial information that is consistent with the 

Bank's minimum requirements.    

4.1.8 The fiduciary team will carry out its tasks under the supervision of the current 

administrative and financial officer whose capacities were deemed to be acceptable by the 

appraisal mission. The team's capacities will be strengthened via a project-funded on-site training 

programme. PRODIVAC’s financial management will be based on the existing system used by 

the PACIGOF/PADEC Project Coordination Unit (premises, equipment, manual, software, 

support staff, etc.). The current Coordinator, as well as the Deputy Coordinator to be recruited, 

will be responsible, in accordance with their respective terms of reference, for the administration 

of project resources, and shall authorize, together with the project accountant (or administrative 

and financial assistant) the disbursement of funds allocated to the project. Financial monitoring 

reports will be prepared in a format to be determined during the negotiation phase, and submitted 

to the Bank 45 days after the end of each quarter.  



17 

 

4.1.9 The recruitment of the external auditor will be the responsibility of the unit, and may be 

carried out in consultation with the Court of Auditors and Budgetary Discipline as part of the 

recourse to national systems as decided during the mid-term review of the Congo Country Strategy 

Paper. The external auditor's TORs will be adapted to take project specificities into account, and 

validated during the negotiations for the recruitment of an independent firm with experience in 

auditing Bank-financed projects. Audits will be carried out in accordance with the ISA/ISSAI 

international standards. The financial statements audited by the independent firm will be sent (see 

table for frequency) to the Bank no later than six months after the end of the financial year 

concerned. Due to the institutional arrangements of each implementing entity, and the 

arrangements described above, the possibility of recruiting a single auditor for all projects executed 

by the Ministry of Planning has not been considered. However, to the extent that the capacities of 

the Court of Auditors and Budgetary Discipline so permit, the Court may include  the organization 

of audit missions to Bank-financed projects in its annual programmes. A provision from loan 

resources will be allocated to cover the expenses of missions to be conducted under PRODIVAC 

and other Bank projects. 

4.1.10 Disbursement Arrangements : Loan resources will be disbursed in accordance with the 

Bank's Disbursement Manual as soon as the loan agreement enters into force and the conditions 

precedent to the first disbursement have been fulfilled. In general, three methods are used to 

disburse funds, namely: (i) the direct payment method; (ii) the working capital or special account 

method; and (iii) the reimbursement method. A disbursement letter setting out the specific 

disbursement terms of the project will be the subject of negotiations between the Bank and the 

Borrower. Counterpart resources will be disbursed in accordance with national procedures that 

provide for the opening of an account for external financing. Two special accounts will be opened 

in Brazzaville to receive Loan resources intended to cover operating costs and community 

activities. Project sub-accounts will be opened in the antennas with the authorization of the 

Ministry of Finance. 

4.2.  Monitoring  

4.2.1.  Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) will be based on four main pillars, namely: (i) the 

results-based logical framework that defines the results indicators (impacts, outcomes and 

outputs); (ii) the Annual Work Programmes and Budgets (AWPBs) that define the programme 

implementation activities, outputs and priorities; (iii) the monitoring/evaluation manual to be 

developed at project commencement and that will define the approaches, methods and tools for 

collecting, analysing data and disseminating the results achieved in terms of outputs, outcomes 

and impacts; and (iv) an IT platform to develop a consolidated geo-referenced monitoring and 

evaluation system, integrating the key indicators of the NDP in relation to ongoing projects, 

private-sector investments and the monitoring and evaluation systems of the NDP.  PRODIVAC 

monitoring and evaluation will include: (i) (ex ante) quantitative and qualitative impact studies 

that will facilitate the design of impact matrices and change trajectories; (ii) continuous internal 

monitoring of activities using a simple and reliable (digital) data collection system; (iii) 

participatory self-assessments with the active involvement of direct actors and stakeholders; (iv) 

supervision missions and ad hoc external assessments as identified by the supervision missions 

and stakeholders; (v) a mid-term review carried out jointly by the Bank and the Government at the 

end of the third year; and (vi) a final appraisal and impact study at project completion to facilitate 

the preparation of the final project report and inform the completion mission.  

4.3.  Governance  

4.3.1.  In terms of global governance, Congo scores 42.8 out of 100 and is ranked 42nd out of 54 

African countries on the Ibrahim Index of African Governance (IIAG). Under the impetus of the 

IMF, the Government has undertaken to conduct, with international assistance, an in-depth study 

on the governance situation in Congo. The Bank and the World Bank are supporting the country 



18 

 

to improve public finances and the business climate through the PADEC and PACIGOF projects. 

Specifically, governance risks in project implementation will be related to procurement, financial 

management, and land management. In this context, the Bank conducted detailed risk assessments 

at Borrower, sector, and project level during project design and, significant measures complete 

with action plans were prepared. PRODIVAC will also support the digitisation of agricultural land, 

linked to a geographical information system, to provide the country with an adequate land 

management tool. In addition, the participatory approach to local development, participation by 

the private sector, non-governmental organisations and beneficiaries in the steering and 

implementation of activities will promote citizen control as a guarantee of good governance. 

4.4. Sustainability  

4.4.1.  The possibility of sustainability and scale-up of the Project's achievements over the long 

term is high. Economic and financial analysis sensitivity tests show that the project remains 

profitable despite a reduction in profits, an increase in input prices and a decrease in product prices. 

The sustainability of investments and expected benefits is based on participatory and 

entrepreneurial approaches to capacity building, including (i) the structuring and 

professionalization of value chain organisations and actors on the basis of expressed demand, (ii) 

partnership with financial institutions to ease access to finance; (iii) the business and 

entrepreneurial dimension and the development of youth skills; (iv) the choice of proven and 

locally manageable techniques and technologies; and the participation and empowerment of value 

chain and local government actors for management of the infrastructure built; and (v) women’s 

economic empowerment. The Project, in collaboration with local authorities, will support the 

establishment of a sustainable management and maintenance mechanism for each infrastructure 

project, based on the organisation of beneficiaries into user associations, establishment of a 

management committee and maintenance fund.  

4.5.  Risk Management  

4.5.1.  The main risks that the project could face: (i) vulnerability to climate change; (ii) low 

capacity of youth support systems and value chain actors; (iii) low interest of financial institutions 

in developing specific financial products; (iv) reluctance of smallholders to innovate; (v) low 

capacity of service providers and (vi) inadequacies in rural infrastructure sustainability 

mechanisms. To mitigate these risks, the following actions will be taken: (i) the dissemination of 

smart agricultural technologies (community agroforestry, short-cycle and attack-resistant seeds, 

etc.); (ii) strengthening of links between agricultural promoters and chambers of agriculture/trades 

whose capacities will be built; (iii) promotion of internal value chain financing mechanisms and 

financial education for beneficiaries; (iv) technical assistance to financial institutions including the 

training and involvement of credit officers in the agricultural entrepreneurship process; (v) the 

adoption of demonstration farms that promote peer training of farmers; and the involvement of 

beneficiaries and local actors in the monitoring of works, the mobilisation of specialised technical 

assistance and the signing of performance contracts with service providers and project 

implementation unit staff. Residual management risks will be minimised through the competitive 

recruitment of staff and partners; the development of annual performance contracts, renewable 

based on good performance; and capacity-building for project management teams at different 

levels. 

4.6.  Knowledge Management  

4.6.1.  As part of knowledge management, an electronic library will be established to store all 

relevant documents from the agricultural sector, an inventory of best practices and identified local 

knowledge and innovations. The library will be accessible to stakeholders and the public. This 

activity will be developed as part of institutional support to the Directorate of Studies and Planning 

(DEP) of the Ministry of Agriculture. The tools and means of communication will be shared with 



19 

 

other projects in the agricultural sector, in particular PADEC and PDAC. A flexible knowledge 

management system, incorporating data, studies and documentation on the agricultural sector held 

by TFPs will be developed to ensure: (i) continuous information to improve programme 

performance; identification, analysis, documentation and dissemination of best practices; (ii) 

interactive and inclusive communication with project managers and all stakeholders; and (iii) 

visibility for policy dialogue and advocacy. Mechanisms of communication with beneficiaries 

upstream, during and downstream of the interventions will be developed. Project-generated 

knowledge will thus help to improve the interventions of ongoing projects, inform the design of 

new projects and boost participation in policy dialogues on themes that may affect improvement 

of the economic environment of sectors (inclusive sector policies, promotion of local products and 

development of standards, trade and tariff policy, etc.). The development of financing mechanisms 

in partnership with financial institutions will generate experiences, best practices and approaches 

that could be used in other value chains and countries to support the development of financial 

products tailored to youth enterprises and the financing needs of small, medium and large 

enterprises.

Introduction 

 

1.  Owing to the heavy dependence of the Congolese economy on oil, the fall in the price of 

this commodity has led to a deterioration in the country's fiscal position, thus negatively affecting 

its ability to co-finance projects as required by the Bank's policies for ADB countries. The sharp 

decline in oil revenue, which accounted for more than 80% of government income until 2014, is 

reflected in Government's inability to contribute at least 50% of the cost of projects co-financed 

with the Bank as required by the policy on expenditures eligible for Bank Group financing. It has 

also led to significant delays in the disbursement of national counterpart funds. This situation is a 

generic problem common to all the portfolios of the key technical and financial partners (TFPs) 

present in Congo. 

 

2.  To address this situation in the short run, the Bank had to grant waivers on the national 

counterpart amount for its new projects in accordance with the relevant provisions of the 

abovementioned policies, and to cover part of the national counterpart contribution for ongoing 

projects following the Government's requests. Given that low oil prices seem to be enduring, the 

Bank could review the financing model for its projects in Congo to adequately address the 

counterpart issue that particularly affects portfolio performance. 

 

Current Context  

 

3.  Congo's counterpart contribution required to finance ongoing projects is CFAF 123 billion. 

As a simple average, this amount exceeds more than 33% of the total portfolio cost. For some 

projects, the Government's counterpart amount exceeds 50% or even 68% of the total cost.

4.  In its information note to the Boards on Counterpart Funding and Recurring Costs 

(ADF/BD/WP/2016/29), the Bank stresses that "ADF countries newly eligible for ADB financing 

are particularly negatively impacted by the abrupt increase in their cost share in ADB-financed 

public sector investment operations". This situation has been particularly true for countries such 



V 

 

as Cameroon. This country lacked tax space to finance 50% of the cost of ADB-financed projects, 

since it is not used to financing more than 10% of the project cost. For a country such as Cameroon, 

no counterpart funds have yet been paid for the year 2018. In 2017, USD 3 billion of counterpart 

funds were paid out of a current amount of USD 17 billion. For all operations approved after 

Cameroon's graduation in July 2014, Management systematically requested the Boards to reduce 

the CPF to 15%. 

 

5.  For Congo Brazzaville, as shown in the table above, out of 7 ongoing projects, half did not 

entail a CPF. Delays in the disbursement of government counterpart funds lead to slippages in 

project implementation and sometimes to the restructuring of ongoing limited-impact 

operations. 

 

6.  Clearly, the level of Government's contribution is below the minimum rate of 50% of the 

total project cost for ADB countries, required by the Policy on Expenditure Eligible for Bank Group 

Financing under paragraph 4.2.2. Thus, in accordance with Section 4.2.2 of the aforementioned 

Policy (revised version of 19 March 2008) and the FVP/COO Directive of December 2014 on 

application of the said Policy regarding counterpart funds, this note presents the analysis that 

justifies the request for a waiver on the national counterpart amount, based on the following four 

criteria required by the abovementioned Bank's policy and directive:  
 

 The country's commitment to implement its overall development programme; 

 The financing allocated by the country to the sector targeted by Bank assistance; 

 The country's fiscal situation and debt level.  

 Upper cost-sharing limit and guidelines laid down in the country financing 
parameters. 

This waiver could be extended to other "ADB or Blend" countries in the Centre Region; these 

include the Republic of Equatorial Guinea (ADB) and Cameroon (Blend). 

 

Country’s Commitment to Implement its Overall Development Programme 

 

7.  After three years of severe economic crisis, Congo has just adopted a National Development 

Plan (NDP) 2018-2022. This Plan, which derives from the social project "The March towards 

Development", takes into account the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and those of Agenda 

2063 for Africa's development. The NDP identifies two strategic priorities: (i) reform of the 

education system and skills development and vocational training and (ii) diversification of the 

economy with priority to the agricultural, tourism and industrialisation sectors. This Plan aims to 

lay the foundation for sustainable and inclusive economic and social development, including 

through economic diversification, further construction of competitive infrastructure, improved 

governance, strengthening of human resources and promotion of regional integration. 

  



VI 

 

Financing Allocated by the Country to the Sector Targeted by Bank Assistance 
 

8. Mindful of the key role of the various target sectors of the Bank's operations in the 

Congolese economy, the Government in recent years sought to allocate significant resources to 

these sectors to improve their performance. It is worth recalling that Congo is one of the few RMCs 

that has mobilised an average of more than 50% of counterpart funds. It should be noted that, unlike 

most African countries, most transport infrastructure expenditure has been financed from domestic 

resources, with public sector financing through oil revenue averaging 75%. The authorities' 

financial effort was particularly significant for the road sub-sector, which saw its budget allocations 

increase by nearly 72.0% over the period. It reflects the authorities' awareness that road transport 

is one of the sub-sectors with the most significant rehabilitation and investment needs. 

 

9. Additionally, the Bank has a pipeline of projects for its re-engagement in Congo. This re-

engagement includes projects for the development of agro-industrial value chains, energy, regional 

infrastructure for economic diversification and sustainable and inclusive economic growth, and 

support for the strengthening of capital and governance for a total amount of UA 806 million. It 

should be noted that Congo has allocated significant resources to the financing of regional 

integration infrastructure. In particular, the country has significantly increased its participation in 

investments in regional road projects, particularly those of the Bank, which are increasingly co-

financed by the Government. Congo’s average contribution to Bank-financed regional integration 

projects is over 60%. However, despite the significant efforts made by the State over the past four 

years, the needs remain huge. 

The Country’s Fiscal Situation and Debt Level 

10. The country's fiscal situation has significantly weakened in recent years with the fall in oil 

prices leading to a deterioration in its fiscal position. The sharp decline in oil sector revenue, which 

accounted for more than 80% of government revenue until 2014, combined with an expansionary 

fiscal policy despite the sharp decline in oil prices, led to an average deficit of more than 19.9% 

between 2015 and 2017, after a decade of budget surpluses. In response to the persistently low oil 

prices, the Government adopted measures aimed at restoring fiscal balance. From a level of CFAF 

4,000 billion in revenue and CFAF 2,818 billion in expenditure in 2013, the State budget was 

significantly adjusted and stood at CFAF 1,415 billion in revenue and CFAF 1,828 billion in 

expenditure at the end of 2017, representing a deficit of 5.1% of GDP, due mainly to the contraction 

of public expenditure and suspension of certain investment projects. However, this was an 

improvement compared to the 2016 budget that stood at 12.9% of GDP. 

11. Regarding the country's debt level, external debt has been rising steadily since it reached 

the completion point of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative, rising from 20% of 

GDP to 118.7% of GDP in 2017. Congo presents the profile of a country with high risk of over-

indebtedness, according to the Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) conducted jointly by the IMF 

and the World Bank in 2017. Missing a payment due on 30 June 2016 on the country's only 



VII 

 

Eurobond issued in 2007 resulted in the downgrading of its credit rating11, highlighting the pressure 

exerted by the oil counter-shock on the country's fiscal and external positions and the need for 

Government to undertake a major structural reforms programme with the IMF. An agreement is 

being concluded with the establishment of a debt restructuring strategy. These measures are 

necessary to preserve the country's solvency and its ability to repay its debt in the medium term, 

including to the Bank and other international creditors. 

 

Upper Cost-sharing Limit and Guidelines Laid down in the Country Financing Parameters 

 

12 For countries such as Congo whose financing parameters (CFP) are not available, the World 

Bank Operational Guidelines specify that the share of total costs financed by the Bank in the overall 

lending programme is determined according to the country's ranking and per capita income. 

Specifically, these Guidelines set out the cost-sharing limits as follows: (i) 90% for IDA countries 

with per capita income below USD 1,235; (ii) 75% for IBRD and Blend countries in the same per 

capita income group; (iii) 60% for countries with per capita income between USD 1,236 and 4,465; 

and (iv) 50% for countries with per capita income above USD 4465. These limits apply to the 

Bank's overall in-country lending programme12 and not to individual projects. For individual 

projects, a minimum contribution of 10% is generally expected from the Borrower. Finally, in 

exceptional cases, the Guidelines offer the possibility of financing all project costs from external 

resources. 

 

13.  In the specific case of Congo, whose per capita income is USD 2,540, the Bank's share in 

the overall lending programme for the period 2013-2017 is 46.8% compared to a limit of 60%. On 

the other hand, the national counterpart for the project concerned (10.76%) is higher than the 

minimum contribution of 10% expected for individual projects. In addition, it is worth noting that 

Congo's contribution to the Project’s financing is higher than that requested for its new projects by 

the World Bank, which has revised the financing model for its operations in light of the decline in 

public revenue resulting from the fall in oil prices. 

 

14. In conclusion, based on the foregoing, and at the Government’s request, it is proposed 

that the national counterpart be set at 15% of the total project cost net of taxes. This level of 

counterpart takes into account the country's particularly difficult fiscal situation. The reality at 

present is that Congo is facing a severe economic crisis following the negative shock in the prices 

of oil sector products, the main source of the country's economic growth. This macroeconomic 

                                                 
11    In August 2016, the rating agencies Fitch, S&P and Moody's downgraded Congo's credit rating, the first two 

rating agencies placing it in the "Partial Default" category. This decision was taken after the country missed a 

payment on its single Eurobond issued in 2007, as part of the restructuring of its commercial debt to London Club 

creditors. The Government explained that this failure was due to a technical problem and not to cash flow 

constraints and has since made the outstanding payment. As a result of this regularization, Fitch upgraded Congo's 

rating to "CCC" while S&P restored it to "B-".

shock has led to a significant fiscal imbalance. Since the drop in oil prices, Congo has experienced 

revenue losses that have negatively impacted the State's finances, the financial sector and the real 

sector, and the country's inability to meet the payment of counterpart contributions to development 

projects and programmes, which stood at a cumulative amount of CFAF 123.214 billion at the end 

of 2017.The Congolese Government's contribution will be used to finance part of the works, and 

all the expropriation costs and operating costs of the executing agency as well as the fiscal 

expenditure associated with the programme resulting from exemptions from customs duties and 

other taxes.

PROJECT EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

Background: the African Development Bank-funded Project to Support the Development of 

Agricultural Value Chains in Six Provinces in the Democratic Republic of Congo (PADCA-6P) aims 

to sustainably improve food and nutrition security and increase the incomes of the target population. 

PADCA-6P will be implemented over a five-year period (2019-2024) for a total cost of UA 22.153 

million in the provinces of Kwilu, Kasaï, Haut Iomami, Iomami, Maniema, and Tshopo. It will target 

some 1,768,825 rural households, 60% of which are women, with 8, 394,125 direct beneficiaries, and 

build knowledge for the rural world at large.  

In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the agricultural sector employs more than 70% of the 

labour force in rural areas. Arable farmland, which is estimated at about 80 million hectares, is largely 

underutilized. Ten per cent is developed, that is about 3.5 million hectares used for farming and some 

4.5 million hectares for livestock breeding. Only 13,500 hectares, representing 3.2% of available 

areas, are irrigated. DRC’s agricultural sector can create more than 60% of jobs in the country, if 

managed sustainably. The diagnosis of the agricultural sector and the operations being implemented 

therein have helped to focus the project’s activities on four growth crop sub-sectors, namely cassava, 

beans, maize and rice.  

The DRC’s food deficit is estimated at between 20% and 30% of total food needs (according to 

region). In addition, the incidence of poverty at the national level, which stands at 63.4%, is very 

high, and 43% of under-five children suffer from chronic malnutrition, that is about 1 in 2 children. 

Furthermore, 38% of the country’s population lives on a poor and limited diet and only 9.3% of 

children aged 6-23 months have a minimum acceptable diet. According to a study on the Cost of 

Hunger in Africa carried out in DRC in 2017, economic losses owing to malnutrition in the country 

are estimated at 3% to 8% of the gross domestic product, that is an annual loss of USD 1.174 billion. 

Against this backdrop, the improvement of agricultural production is an urgent priority for the 

Congolese Government.  

Bank’s Value Added: the proposed project seeks to actively involve agricultural sectors in efforts 

to achieve economic growth so as to create jobs and generate substantial incomes in rural areas. It is 

perfectly in line  with the Strategy for Agricultural Transformation in Africa (2016-2025); the Bank’s 

Ten-year Strategy (2013-2022), particularly two of its High-5s, namely Feed Africa, and Improve the 

quality of life for the people of Africa; the strategy covering the 2014-2019 period titled “Addressing 

Fragility and Building Resilience in Africa”; the Jobs for Youth in Africa Strategy which targets the 

agricultural sector and the entrepreneurial training of rural youths; the Multi-Sectoral Nutrition 

Action Plan concerning the pillar that seeks to increase the production and consumption of safe and 

nutritious food; and the Bank’s Technologies for African Agricultural Transformation (TAAT) 

programme whose objective is to deploy agricultural technologies to increase the productivity and 

quality of agricultural production in targeted sectors. The project is technically justified and feasible 

and will generate positive impacts in terms of rebuilding the productive base, reviving economic 

activities and contributing to DRC’s efforts to achieve economic and social development. 

Knowledge Building: PADCA-6P will help to: (a) develop crop sub-sectors through the introduction 

and ownership of new technologies aimed at increasing the productivity of the crops identified; (b) 

provide institutional support, improve governance and build the capacity of existing entities in order 

to enhance their professionalization, particularly through the use of the value chain approach, and to 

improve coordination and dialogue between value chain actors through the platforms established. All 

these activities will serve as the Bank’s pilot schemes in DR Congo and generate invaluable 

knowledge for future developments in the country’s agricultural sub-sectors.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF BANK GROUP MANAGEMENT TO THE 

BOARD OF DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSAL TO GRANT A UA 20 MILLION TSF  LOAN TO 

THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO TO FINANCE THE PROJECT TO SUPPORT 

THE DEVELOPMENT OF AGRICULTURAL VALUE CHAINS IN SIX PROVINCES IN 

THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO (PADCA-6P) 

Management hereby submits the following report and recommendation concerning a proposal to 

grant a UA 20 million ADF loan to the Democratic Republic of Congo to finance the Project to 

Support the Development of Agricultural Value Chains in Six Provinces in the Democratic Republic of 

Congo (PADCA-6P). 

I. STRATEGIC THRUST AND RATIONALE 

1.1 Country Context 

1.1.1  The period of political transition in the Democratic Republic of Congo which began at end-

2016 ended with the holding of presidential, legislative and provincial elections on 30 December 

2018. The country experienced its first peaceful transfer of power on 24 January 2019 between an 

outgoing and an incoming President of the Republic. On the economic front, The Democratic 

Republic of Congo recorded a growth rate of 8.3% on average over the period 2013-2015. However, 

this growth momentum was interrupted in 2016 (2.4%) due to a sharp fall in the prices of the 

country’s main export products (copper and cobalt) and political instability. Growth rose to 3.7% in 

2017 and 4.1% in 2018, driven by an increase in mining production and a rise in the prices of mining 

products especially in 2017. However, the country’s recent economic performance has had a limited 

impact on the population’s well-being due to low inclusiveness of growth which is driven mainly by 

the mining sector. Despite its enormous potential, DRC is one of the world’s poorest countries. More 

than 82% of the population lives below the poverty line (USD 1.25 a day). Developments in the 

present political context marked by the holding of the December 2018 (presidential and legislative) 

elections will help to lay the foundations for the country’s socio-economic development. Poverty, 

discrimination and violence against women are major causes of malnutrition. The poor (invariable 

and undiversified) diet that mothers and their children live on has irreparable consequences on the 

development of children and, hence, leads to economic losses due to a decrease in productivity. 

1.1.2 DRC has considerable agricultural potential and offers tremendous opportunities for 

investment, especially a potential market of more than 100 million inhabitants, given its population 

and that of neighbouring countries. Arable farmland which is estimated at about 80 million hectares 

is highly underdeveloped (10% is developed). Food crop production, excluding groundnuts, 

plantains and cereals, is estimated at about 17 million tonnes on 3,700,000 hectares of land. Food 

shortage is estimated at 20% to 30% of total food needs (according to the regions). 

1.1.3 Agricultural and rural sector development is hampered by numerous constraints including 

(i) advanced environmental degradation and inadequate basic infrastructure; (ii) weak institutional 

and management capacity; (iii) low access to inputs, production equipment and supervisory services, 

and lack of access to markets; and (iv) weak capacity of farmers’ organizations and difficulties in 

accessing financial services and governance. According to the National Agriculture Investment Plan 

(NAIP), the major challenges to be met by the country to significantly alleviate rural poverty by 2020 

are: (i) securing and modernizing the farming system to sustainably improve sub-sector production; 

and (ii) overcoming malnutrition and food insecurity. 



 

2 

1.2 Project Linkages with Country Strategy and Objectives 

1.2.1 The project is consistent with the five main priorities of the National Agricultural 

Investment Programme (PNIA) which are to: (i) improve agricultural governance, promote gender 

mainstreaming and build human and institutional capacity; (ii) sustainably promote agricultural sub-

sectors, particularly food sub-sectors, and develop agri-business in order to increase the incomes of 

farmers and other sector operators; (iii) improve the management of the population’s food and 

nutrition security and build strategic reserves; and (iv) develop and disseminate research products to 

users and improve the level of professional competence of various actors. 

1.2.2 The project is also consistent with the priorities of the Bank’s 2013-2017 Strategy for DRC 

(updated at end-2018 and whose update for the second time to 2020 is under study) which seeks to 

help the country to emerge from fragility by creating conditions conducive to strong and inclusive 

growth driven by renewed vitality in the productive sectors of the economy. It is particularly 

consistent with the second pillar of the Country Strategy Paper (CSP) which aims to build the 

Government’s capacity to increase public revenue and establish a framework of incentives for private 

investment, especially in the second thrust which seeks to create conditions conducive to inclusive 

and diversified growth driven by private investment. Lastly, the project is in line with the CSP’s 

spatial approach which consists in focusing the Bank’s operations in the country’s greater centre 

region. 

1.2.3 PADCA-6P is aligned with the Bank’s Ten-year Strategy (2013-2022) and will contribute 

to achieving two of its five (5) strategic priorities, namely Feed Africa and Improve the quality of 

life for the people of Africa. The project is also perfectly in keeping with the thrusts of Feed Africa: 

Strategy for Agricultural Transformation in Africa 2016-2025, Multi-Sectoral Nutrition Action Plan, 

and Jobs for Youth in Africa Strategy. The project is technically justified and feasible and will 

generate positive impacts in terms of rebuilding the productive base, reviving economic activities 

and contributing to DRC’s efforts to achieve economic and social development. 

1.3  Rationale for Bank Involvement  

1.3.1 DRC and its partners are committed to strengthening the population’s resilience through a 

collaborative approach linking food security, social cohesion and access to financial resources in 

order to achieve stability. In this regard, agriculture has been re-positioned at the centre of political 

and strategic concerns to ensure the country’s sustainable recovery. Thus, the objective of Congolese 

authorities is to achieve a sustained annual growth rate of more than 6% in the agricultural sector by 

2020, which is essential to reduce poverty, ensure food and nutrition security for the Congolese 

people, generate sustainable jobs and incomes, especially for the youth. In addition, given the heavy 

concentration of the Congolese economy on the mining sector, the development of the agricultural 

sector contributes to diversifying the productive fabric, thus reducing the vulnerability of the 

economy to external shocks resulting from fluctuations in the prices of mining products. DRC 

imports about USD 1.5 billion worth of food products per year. The project, which will help to 

increase agricultural production (especially food production), is a response to food insecurity. 

1.4  Donor Coordination 

1.4.1 The activities of DRC’s development partners are coordinated through the Aid and 

Investment Management Platform (PGAI) hosted in the Ministry of Planning. This platform records 

the investments made by the various partners, but technical activities are discussed and planned in 



 

3 

thematic groups chaired by the Ministry exercising supervisory authority over the theme. For 

example, the Agriculture and Rural Development Thematic Group is chaired by the Ministry of 

Agriculture. In September 2013, the Ministry of Agriculture, in collaboration with this thematic 

group and in consultation with all stakeholders, designed the National Agricultural Investment 

Programme (PNIA) for the period 2014-2020. 

II. PROJECT DESCRIPTION 

2.1. Project Objectives and Components 

2.1.1  The project’s sector objective is to contribute to sustainably improving food and nutrition 

security. 

2.1.2  The project’s specific objective is to improve agricultural production by: (i) increasing the 

productivity of the growth sub-sectors, namely cassava, maize, bean/cowpeas, and rice; (ii) building 

the capacity of stakeholders to ensure the sustainability of investments in value chains; and (iii) 

promoting youth and women’s entrepreneurship. 

2.1.3  Project Design 

The project design is based on the value chain approach and takes into account the TAAT initiative 

which aims to contribute significantly to: (i) increasing agricultural productivity and production by 

identifying and disseminating appropriate farming technologies; (ii) conducting training and 

extension campaigns for the adoption of good farming practices through the effective provision of 

technologies to farmers; and (iii) promoting a plant sub-sector development policy.  

2.1.4  The project will comprise the following three components: (1) Plant Sub-sector 

Development; (2) Institutional Support, Improvement of Governance and Capacity Building; and (3) 

Project Coordination, Management and Monitoring and Evaluation. Table 2.1 below presents project 

activities by component.

2.2 Technical Solutions Adopted and Alternatives Explored 

2.2.1 The replacement of the cowpea varieties being disseminated with new iron- and zinc-rich 

varieties (high iron bean – HIB) which meet market requirements (major market classes) will 

significantly increase production and profitability for all actors involved in the value chain. The 

importance and adoption of high iron beans have been well documented in Rwanda and published in 

international science journals (Hass et al. 2016; Oparinde et al. 2015, 2016).  

2.2.2 The continued promotion of new varieties by extension officers and all project partners will 

help to accelerate the adoption and use of new technologies. To fast-track the adoption of input 

technologies, it is necessary to use the integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) approach.

Name Brief Description Reasons for Rejection 

Adoption of 

techniques for 

the use of 

fertilizers 

The integrated soil fertility management 

(ISFM) approach should be used to 

better rationalize the use of fertilizers. 

Former soil fertility management paradigms which 

focused on fertilizer or “low input” approaches, and 

rarely on both, ignored the vital scientific fact that 

fertilizers are more effective and efficient on well-

conserved soils which contain organic matter. 

Use of bean 

varieties being 

disseminated 

(traditional) 

The replacement of the bean varieties 

being disseminated with new iron- and 

zinc-rich varieties (high iron bean – 

HIB) which meet market requirements 

(major market classes) will help to 

significantly increase production and 

profitability for all the actors involved 

in the value chain. 

The replacement of the bean varieties being

2.3. Project Type 

This is an investment project. It falls within the framework of the assistance provided to regional 

member countries by the Bank through the Feed Africa initiative and the value chain approach, and 

is in keeping with the Feed Africa strategy. 

2.4 Project Cost and Financing Arrangements 

2.4.1 The indicative project cost is estimated at about UA 21.434 million (USD 30.008 million), 

excluding tax and duty of which 64% in foreign exchange and 36% in local currency. The project 

will be financed as follows: UA 20 million ADF loan, and the remaining UA 1.434 million the 

counterpart contribution of the Government (less than 10% of the total project cost – see supporting 

documents in Annex C.4) and beneficiaries. Project activities will be implemented over a five-year 

period. The summary project cost, financing breakdown and expenditure schedule are presented in 

Tables 2.4 to 2.6. 

2.4.2 The Bank loan will be used to finance all works exclusive of taxes, except community 

infrastructure for which municipal councils will be required to pay a 10% contribution (FEICOM 

will assist beneficiary local authorities in mobilizing this counterpart contribution). Goods and 

services will be fully financed in accordance with the appended financing plan. Civil servants’ salary 

and part of office rental (1/3) costs will be borne by the Government.

2.5. Project Target Area and Beneficiaries 

2.5.1. The project impact area is defined by crop and by province as follows: (1) Kwilu: cassava 

and maize (Idiofa, Bulungu and Bagata Territories); (2) Lomami: maize (Ngandajika Territory and 

Muene-Ditu Centre); (3) Kasaï: maize (Mweka Territory); (4) Haut Lomami: beans (Kanyama 

Territory); (5) Maniema: rice (Kibombo, Kassongo, Kabambare sites); and (6) Tshopo: rice (Opala, 

Isangi, Imela, and Banalia Territories). These areas were proposed based on the following criteria: 

(i) accessibility; (ii) existence of infrastructure (warehouses and packaging lines); (iii) mastery of the 

relevant crop by experienced farmers with a high level of organization; (iv) easy access to inputs and 

a high level of production; and (v) existence of plant materials for reproduction and propagation. The 

targeted provinces have a substantial and diverse agricultural potential which, if harnessed, will help 

to partly reduce the country’s food shortage. 

2.5.2 This is one of the priority development areas defined in the Government’s Five-Year 

Programme 2012-2016.This choice is also based on a spatial approach as recommended in the 2013-

2017 CSP, which has been extended to 2020 and focuses particularly on the central and neighbouring 

provinces, and on criteria for the use of the integrated approach to sector-based operations, and the 

consolidation and enhancement of the achievements of Bank-funded and supported operations. The 

provinces of Maniema and Tshopo (rice-growing provinces) have been added to those of the Centre 

Zone to take into account the Government’s desire to implement many operations in the country’s 

rice production sub-sector and to complement the operations of other technical and financial partners 

(IFAD). 

2.5.3. Project Beneficiaries 

Some 1,768,825 rural households, including 60% of women, will benefit directly from the project. 

Given that the average size of a household is about six (6) people, 10.612.950 people will therefore 

benefit directly from the project. The benefits will take several forms, including capacity building in 

the use of modern farming techniques, innovations and good farming practices. Other benefits 

include increased productivity and production, better crop management, improved food and nutrition 

security and increased household incomes, as well as improved general well-being of households. 

Besides the rural households that will benefit directly from the project, about 3,353,650 households 

would benefit indirectly from the project through the dissemination of farming technologies, 

innovations and good practices among the direct project beneficiaries. 

2.6 Participatory Approach for Project Identification, Design and Implementation  

2.6.1. The project design is based on the value chain approach adopted for the TAAT programme 

and takes into account several factors including, in particular, proven high-performance technologies, 

agricultural sub-sector support infrastructure, ability of producers and available manpower, conditions 

for market access, market demand and consumer preference.  

2.6.2 A broad-based participatory approach was used during the preparation of PADCA-6P. During 

the preparation mission, discussions and exchanges were held with all stakeholders involved in project 

implementation. Meetings were held with the representatives of the Ministry of Finance and the 

Ministry of Agriculture, particularly the Project and Programme Monitoring Unit of the Ministry of 

Finance. Discussions were held with key agricultural sector stakeholders such as the National Institute 

of Economics and Agricultural Research (INERA), the National Seed Service (SENASEM), the 

National Extension Service (SNV), Provincial Inspectorates of Agriculture, and other seed sub-sector 



 

10 

and private sector stakeholders represented by the Fédération des Entreprises du Congo (Federation of 

Congolese Businesses) and the General Directorate of the Bukanga Lonzo Agro-industrial Park. 

Consultations and due diligence meetings were held with the key TFPs operating in the agricultural and 

nutrition sector in DRC, notably the Inter-Donor Group for Agriculture and Rural Development 

(GIBADER), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the World Food Programme (WFP), the 

European Union (EU), the Belgian Development Agency (ENABEL – formerly Belgian Technical 

Cooperation) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), to familiarize 

them with ongoing operations and envisage improved aid and operation coordination. 

2.6.3 This participatory, inclusive and holistic approach which is based on lessons learned from 

similar projects aims to contribute significantly to:(i) increasing agricultural productivity and production 

by identifying and disseminating appropriate technologies;(ii) providing training and organizing 

agricultural extension campaigns on the adoption of good farming practices through the effective 

provision of technologies to farmers;(iii) promoting a plant sub-sector development policy; and (iv) 

offering vulnerable groups, particularly women and youths, the opportunity to participate fully in the 

main stages of agricultural sub-sector development. Discussions with the authorities and officials of the 

Ministry of Agriculture, other technical and financial partners (GIBADER and FAO), as well as 

farmers’ groups and associations, and NGOs led to a better definition of the priority actions to be 

implemented in this regard. 

2.6.4 Field visits and discussions held with actors on agricultural value chains helped to identify 

major weaknesses in (i) the production chain (input supply, support/counselling and poor organization, 

inappropriate farming practices, and lack of equipment); (ii) processing (poor organization, lack of 

equipment and inadequate marketing); and (iii) marketing. 

2.7. Bank Group Experience and Lessons Reflected in Project Design 

2.7.1 As at 31 December 2018, the Bank Group’s active portfolio in DRC comprised a total of 31 

public sector operations for a cumulative amount of UA 1 020.67 million. This includes 25 national 

operations for a cumulative amount of UA 895.77 million, of which 21 investment projects (UA 891.15 

million), 3 studies (UA 3.90 million) and 1 emergency humanitarian operation (UA 0.72 million).These 

operations are financed mainly by the ADF for a total of UA 873.21 million (of which UA 163.49 

million under the Transition Support Facility (TSF), that is 18.25%),the Rural Water Supply and 

Sanitation Initiative(RWSSI): UA 4.87 million, the African Water Facility (AWF): UA 1.53 million, 

and the Forest Investment Programme (FIP): UA 15.43 million. The portfolio also includes 6 regional 

projects for a total amount of UA 124.90 million, financed by the ADF, of which UA 65.90 million 

under the TSF. At the national level, the breakdown of the portfolio by sector, which is perfectly 

consistent with the orientations of the CSP and the Bank’s five operational priorities and Ten-year 

Strategy, is as follows: infrastructure sector: (79% transport: 41%, energy: 26%, water and sanitation: 

12%); agricultural sector: 12%; governance sector: 7%, and social sector: 2%.Concerning the 

agricultural sector, 6 national operations are being implemented for cumulative net commitments of UA 

107.65 million (see Annex 3). 

2.7.2 On the whole, from the CSP analysis, portfolio performance as at 31 December 2018 was 
considered satisfactory with a score of 3 on a scale of 4. Performance has remained stable compared 

with the CSP mid-term review carried out in 2015 and the one carried out during the extension of 

the CSP in 2017 to 2020. However, the Portfolio Flashlight Report noted that portfolio performance 

is moderately satisfactory. According to the December 2018 Flashlight Report, only 66% of the 

portfolio achieved a performance considered satisfactory (that is 47% of the portfolio with a 



 

11 

performance considered satisfactory and 19% with a performance considered moderately 

satisfactory), while 33% of the portfolio has an unsatisfactory performance.  

2.7.3 Despite the improvements noted, the implementation of operations continues to face 
recurrent problems which affect performance. These constraints include: (i) delays in fulfilling the 

conditionalities of agreements, particularly the ratification of loan agreements and the fulfilment of 

first disbursement conditions; (ii) the insufficient involvement of line ministries in project 

monitoring; (iii) the poor financial management of some projects, including the conduct of audits; 

and (iv) long delays in the processing of some files by the Bank. 

2.7.4 In light of these findings and in a bid to ensure rapid and consistent project implementation, 
the project design aims to: (i) ease conditions precedent to first disbursement under the project; 

(ii)better involve the line ministry (Ministry of Agriculture) in project monitoring through the 

Secretary-General and the support ministry (Ministry of Rural Development); (iii) promote closer 

and greater collaboration between sector (AHAI) and regional (RDGC)directorates and strengthen 

the country office to ensure the swift processing of files submitted to the Bank for approval. 

2.8 Key Performance Indicators 

2.8.1 The main performance indicators contained in the project logical framework are:(i) food 

insecurity rate; (ii) severe malnutrition prevalence rate; (iii) level of increase in food crop 

productivity (cassava, rice, maize, beans/cowpeas);(iv) number of women and youths integrated into 

agricultural value chains; number of job and economic opportunities created for youths and women; 

(v) number of households that have adopted new technologies; (vi) increase in crop productivity 

through proper fertilization;(vii) number of groups structured; (viii) number of seed producer and 

multiplier groups supported; (ix) number of seed laws adopted; and (x) number of platforms 

facilitating technological innovations established. Concerning the food and nutrition security of 

people in DRC, the food insecurity rate will be reduced to less than 20%, the severe malnutrition rate 

from 10% to a level below 5%, and the chronic malnutrition rate from 43% to below 20%.The 

productivity and production of beans will be increased to 0.86 t/ha, cassava from 8 t/ha to 10 t/ha, 

rice from 0.720 kg/ha to 4-7 t/ha and maize from 0.8 t/ha to 1.5 t/ha.  

2.8.2 The number of households adopting new technologies is estimated at more than 75%. The 

number of women and youths involved in agricultural value chains is expected to be 80 000 (women) 

and 60 000 (youths). In the second year, the project will establish the baseline situation and register 

beneficiaries in the production basins of each crop. All these indicators relate to the African 

Development Bank’s Feed Africa programme. 

III. PROJECT FEASIBILITY 

3.1. Economic and Financial Performance 

3.1.1. Project financial analysis was conducted using three models of activity based on market 

prices. The main assumptions underlying the analyses include: (i) 80 000 farmers are actively 

engaged in agriculture under the project at full capacity; (ii) the project will lead to a 25% increase 

in incomes; (iii) farmers will adopt improved varieties of maize, bean and rice seeds; (iii) a 20-year 

period was used to measure the incremental benefits of the project; (iv) the opportunity cost of the 

capital used to update future benefits was estimated at 12%.  



 

12 

3.1.2 For economic analysis: (v) the value of wage labour was adjusted using a conversion factor 

of 0.75; and (vi) the rehabilitation of the seed system will ensure national supply of quality seeds. 

These analyses were carried out based on financial and economic costs generated using Costab 32. 

The financial and economic analysis is summarized in Annex VII and developed in Annex B6 of 

Volume II of the Appraisal Report. 

3.1.3 The project is expected to generate the following benefits: (i) increased food production; 

(ii) increased private sector investments; (iii) improved seed production and storage; (iv) increased 

average household income; (v) job creation for 140 000 farmers and entrepreneurs; and (vi) improved 

nutrition through use of bio-fortified foods. 

Table 3.1: Key Economic and Financial Figures 

IRR (baseline scenario): 19%   NPV equivalent to:  FC 18 753 235 485.13   

ERR (baseline scenario):  26%   NPV equivalent to:  FC 22 530 519 219.40   

NB: Detailed calculations are presented in Annex B7 

3.1.4 Financial Analysis: based on the above assumptions, the financial analysis generated a net 

present value of FC 18 753 235 485.13 and a 19% internal rate of return, as shown in the technical 

annexes (B6). Based on the above analysis, the project is deemed financially viable. The 19% IRR 

is above the opportunity cost of capital (12%). 

3.1.5 Economic Analysis: the economic analysis was carried out using the same approach as for 

the financial analysis, based on the reference prices of tradeable goods and the total project cost. In 

addition, other indirect benefits were also expected such as reduced post-harvest losses, the 

establishment of an agricultural equipment service centre, a reliable soil information system for 

fertilizer mixtures, an efficient system for the distribution of inputs through the farmer database 

system and reduced cost of transporting goods and services. However, it was difficult to assess these 

additional benefits in monetary terms owing to the limited scope of this report. Under such 

conditions, the economic analysis showed an NPV of FC 22 530 519 219.40 and a 26% IRR, as 

shown in the technical annexes. 

3.2 Environmental and Social Impact 

Environment 

3.2.1 The proposed activities do not entail any physical or economic resettlement. The project 
falls under the TAAT initiative which focuses much more on technology transfer. Besides 

introducing and disseminating new technologies in production areas, the project will only rehabilitate 

infrastructure deemed necessary. Production is mostly rain-fed and rice is irrigated in some areas 

under well controlled conditions.  

3.2.2 PADCA-6P has been classified under Environmental Category 2 pursuant to the Bank’s 

environmental and social assessment procedures (ESAPs), considering the nature of its activities. An 

environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA), together with an environmental and social 

management plan (ESMP), was prepared between January 2019 and March 2019, PADCA-6P 

outcomes are not expected to generate major environmental and social impacts. They will mostly 

address the following real social problems: (i) improvement of the food and nutrition security of the 



 

13 

people; (ii) provision of support for the production, supply and distribution of improved seeds, taking 

into account climate, certified plant material and input risks/variations; (iii) promotion of farm 

mechanization; (iv) promotion of processing systems; and (v) building the technical and 

organizational capacity of farmers’ organizations, civil society and the private sector involved in the 

value chains of the agricultural products concerned. These outcomes will radically improve the living 

conditions of the beneficiary populations (employment of youths and women) in the six project 

provinces and at the national level.  

3.2.3 There will be no irreversible or large-scale negative impact. Most of the impacts will be 

temporary and limited in time. The negative environmental and social impacts of PADCA-6P 

activities will be: (i) risks of pollution of the ground water and water rivers as well as soil degradation 

linked to the use of pesticides and fertilizers (even the project will promote the use of the use of 

mineral and organic fertilizers with local adaptation according to soil deficiencies locally adapted 

mineral and organic fertilizers, depending on soil deficiencies); (ii) fertilization and cropping (crop 

association and rotation) and herbicide (biodegradable materials will be recommended to reduce 

negative impacts) system. 

3.2.4 Socially, there could be the recrudescence of water-borne diseases; insecurity and social 

constraints due to the influx of migrant populations into the project area; risks of accidents and 

nuisances resulting from the rehabilitation and construction of various infrastructure such as 

platforms (the project will set up 6 multipurpose platforms (MPPs) in the project area). Each MPP 

will cover a surface area of between 100 and 200 square metres, including access to drinking water 

and sanitation in storage areas (100-square metre storage room). To prevent these risks, measures 

have been proposed in the ESMP and the overall cost of implementing the environmental and social 

safeguard measures will stand at USD 505,000. The Project Management Unit will be responsible 

for implementing the ESMP. 

Adaptation to Climate Change 

3.2.5 The agricultural sector is very vulnerable to climate change in DRC because of the extreme 

variability of climate parameters, especially rainfall. Seasonal droughts cause serious disruption of 

agricultural calendars, while agriculture is rain-fed, which significantly affects production and, 

hence, the food security of communities, especially in rural areas. They also cause poverty because 

farming is the main means of livelihood in these areas. In addition, the climate risks identified under 

PADCA-6P are compounded by a rain-dependent production system, subsistence agriculture, 

environment-unfriendly farming practices, absence of rigorous compliance with crop management 

techniques and lack of a climate risk information and management system. The specific impacts in 

the project impact area include: (i) drop in the yields of the main crops (cassava, maize, rice, beans 

and cowpea), including those targeted by PADCA-6P; (ii) physical and chemical soil degradation 

leading to reduced agricultural productivity and pasture plant resources for animals; and (iii) 

worsening of land conflicts. 

Gender Situation 

3.2.6 Gender equality is a right enshrined in the country’s constitution. The country has also 

ratified international protocols on the promotion of gender equality. However, despite the progress 

made regarding the legal framework, gender equality is still a major challenge in the country.  Gender 

equality-related issues may be mainstreamed in the various value chain development activities.  

Although women play a key role in agriculture, they face many challenges and constraints, 



 

14 

particularly limited access to the various means of production, unequal access to agricultural inputs 

(seeds, fertilizers, etc.) and lack of access to credit.  

3.2.7 For women to also benefit from the project, specific activities will be designed for them to 

enhance their economic and social empowerment. The project will seek to: (i) ensure socio-economic 

empowerment; (ii) increase the participation of men and women in the promotion of agribusiness in 

the project areas; (iii) create conditions for equal access to project resources by men, women and 

youths; and (iv) increase the participation of women in the decision-making process throughout the 

agricultural value chain. The project will encourage a gender transformation approach through: (a) 

capacity building in all aspects of the agricultural value chain, including the establishment of 

cooperatives/business associations headed by women, and the development of their leadership and 

entrepreneurship technical skills; and (b) the construction of gender-sensitive infrastructure. The 

project will also support gender-specific monitoring and evaluation information activities that will 

be indicated in the reports prepared. 

IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION 

4.1 Implementation Arrangements – Monitoring and Evaluation Mechanism  

4.1.1 PADCA-6P will be placed under the oversight of the Ministry in charge of agriculture 

through the Secretariat General for Agriculture (SGA) which, in that capacity, will facilitate 

interactions with the other sector ministries and technical and financial partners. It will also 

coordinate monitoring and evaluation activities. Consultation at the national level will be carried out 

by a National Steering Committee (CNP) which, for reasons of harmonization and consistency, will 

be the same one set up under PEJAB (see Volume II- Technical Annex B5). At the decentralized 

level, consultation will be carried out by Provincial Consultation Committees (CCs). These bodies 

will validate and supervise the implementation of provincial investment planning in order to ensure 

alignment and coherence with provincial and national strategies and other sector operations.  

4.1.2  Regarding the Project Management Unit (PMU), it was agreed that the PEJAB Coordinator 

will be the PDACA-6P Coordinator, assisted by a project officer. The PMU will be responsible for 

project implementation, assisted by a project officer recruited for that purpose. It will ensure effective 

management and recruit the experts required (1 procurement expert, 1financial management expert, 

1 accountant, 1 environmental expert, 1 rural infrastructure expert placed on secondment from the 

Ministry of  Rural Development and 1 value chain monitoring and evaluation officer). The project 

will supply additional equipment (logistics, ICT and management tools). The project will provide 

resources to reinforce the project management and coordination entity.  

4.1.3 The project monitoring and evaluation mechanism will be designed taking into account the 

target indicators adopted for the project components as well as their expected impact, outcome and 

output indicators. Socio-economic surveys will be conducted according to a frequency to be 

determined to inform the performance and impact indicators. At project start-up, a baseline situation 

will be clearly established, with gender-disaggregated data to provide information on the level of the 

initial key indicators that will be monitored. Monitoring and evaluation activities will be carried out 

in collaboration with the National Agricultural Statistics Service. 

4.1.4  Quarterly and annual progress reports will also be prepared and submitted to the Bank, in 

accordance with the agreements signed. The Bank will field at least two monitoring and supervision 

missions annually. The DRC Country Office will maintain permanent dialogue with the Government 



 

15 

and monitor the project. At the end of the project, the Government will prepare a Completion Report 

on the basis of which the Bank will draft its Project Completion Report (PCR). 

4.2 Procurement Arrangements 

4.2.1 Procurements of goods (including non-consultancy services), works and consultancy 

services financed by the Bank under the project will be done in accordance with the “Procurement 

Policy and Methodology for Bank Group-funded Operations” approved in October 2015, as well as 

the provisions set forth in the Financing Agreement. Specifically, procurements will be done in 

accordance with: (i) the Borrower’s national procurement procedures (NPPs)  governed by Law No. 

10/10 of 10 April 2010 on Public Procurement, as well as its implementing decrees; (ii) Bank 

procurement methods and procedures (BPMPs) using relevant standard bidding documents (SBDs) 

for contracts that are (a) above the thresholds shown in Annex  B7, Para. B.7.3.2 or (b) for 

procurements for which the Borrower’s national procurement procedures (NPPs) is considered 

inappropriate; and (iii) third party procurement systems (e.g. co-financing).  

4.2.2 Procurement Risk and Capacity Assessment (PRCA): the country, sector and project 

procurement risks as well as the procurement capacity of the executing agency (EA) were assessed 

and the findings used to guide the selection of the procurement system (Borrower, Bank or third 

party) to be used for specific activities or group of similar activities under the project. Appropriate 

risk mitigation measures have been included in the action plan presented in Para. B.7.9. of Annex 

B7. 

4.2.3 PADCA’s PMU will be responsible for procurement of goods, works and services. The 

PMU will backed by the Public Procurement and Management Unit (CGPMP) of the Secretariat 

General of MINAGRI, in pursuance of the provisions of Section 13 (1) of the Public Procurement 

Code, as supplemented by Article 2 of Decree No. 10/32 2012 on the establishment, organization 

and functioning of the Project and Public Procurement Management Unit. 

4.2.4 The unit’s procurement capacity is deemed insufficient. The Implementation Unit of 

PADCA-6P should therefore recruit a project procurement expert whose commencement of work 

should be approved beforehand by the Bank.  

4.2.5 A procurement plan (PP) was designed during project preparation. The PP will be updated 

by the PMU at project start-up and posted on the Bank’s website. The PP will cover an initial period 

of 18 months and updated each year as appropriate, but always after 18 months during the project 

implementation period. The procurement plan, detailed procurement methods and the goods and 

service procurement table are presented in the technical annexes of the report (Annex B7). 

4.3 Financial Management Arrangements 

Project financial management will be entrusted to a project team to be recruited. The team will 

benefit from the close collaboration of the Coordination Unit of PEJAB through: (i) the supervision 

of financial and accounting tasks; (ii) the updating of management tools (existing software and 

manual); (iii) the reinforcement of the internal control mechanism; (iv) the preparation of interim 

financial reports and annual financial statements; and (v) the monitoring of audit activities and 

transmission of audit reports to the Bank. The PADCA-6P procedures manual will be based on that 

of PAJEB, but revised to take into account the specificities of PADCA-6P. The project financial 

management conditions will be confirmed and presented in detail in Volume II- Technical Annexes 

of the Project Appraisal Report. 

 



 

16 

4.4 Disbursement Arrangements 

4.4.1 Loan resources will be disbursed in accordance with the Bank’s Disbursement Manual once 

the Loan Agreement enters into effect, and the conditions precedent to first disbursement are 

fulfilled. It is envisaged that the first disbursement will be effected within the three months following 

signature of the Loan Agreement. The following disbursement methods will be used for 

disbursement of loan resources by the Bank: (i) the direct payment method and (ii) the revolving 

fund or special account method, and (iii) the reimbursement method. The direct payment method 

will be used for payment of works, goods and services contracts. The special account method will 

be used to finance operating expenses. The Bank will transmit the "Disbursement Letter" specifying 

the special provisions for the withdrawal of project funds and management of special accounts.  

4.4.2 The Bank reserves the right to take protective measures in compliance with the general 

conditions to, among other things, suspend the disbursements of funds where its fiduciary 

requirements are not met.  

4.4.3 The Government will contribute to project financing through accounting valuation of the 

recurrent operating expenditure (salaries, rents, etc.) of the SGA financed by the State budget. There 

will be no other disbursements in terms of financial flows in respect of the national counterpart 

contribution. 

4.4.4 Disbursements will be made according to the list of goods and services and in accordance 

with Bank rules and procedures as laid down in the disbursement manual. Disbursement conditions 

are presented in detail in the technical annexes. 

4.5 Audit Arrangements  

External Audit: on the date of project appraisal, the SGA had not submitted the 2017 audit report 

for the Study on the Development of Agro-industrial Parks due on 30 June 2018, that is a delay of 

close to 8 (eight) months. The 2017 PPF audit reports for PEJAB and LEAFII were deemed 

acceptable by the Bank. Many audit reports are expected on 30 June 2019, and the processes for the 

recruitment of audit firms are ongoing. Annual project audits financed with loan resources will be 

conducted by an independent external audit firm to be recruited on a competitive basis and in 

accordance with the standard terms of reference (ToR) in force at the Bank. The external auditor 

could be recruited in collaboration with the Court of Auditors.  Audit-related expenses will be borne 

by the project. Audits will be conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing 

(ISA) and International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAI). Financial statements 

audited by the independent audit firm will be transmitted (see table for frequency) to the Bank within 

the six months following the closure of the financial year under consideration.

4.7 Governance 

4.7.1 The Mo Ibrahim Foundation report on 54 African countries (2017 Edition) notes that DRC 

is among a group of countries that made the most remarkable progress in the 2017 Index of African 

Governance. The World Governance Index created by the World Bank also shows significant 

progress regarding transparency and accountability, political stability, government effectiveness, 

regulation, rule of law and control of corruption. The project will contribute to enhancing agricultural 

governance in the provinces of Kwilu, Kasaï, Lomami, Haut-Lomami, Tshopo and Maniema in 

support of the promotion of the agricultural value chain. 

4.7.2. The recent presidential election is expected to strengthen governance quality. PADCA-6P 

implementation will be placed under the oversight of the Ministry in charge of agriculture through 

the Secretariat General for Agriculture which, in that capacity, will facilitate interactions with the 

other sector ministries. It will also coordinate monitoring and evaluation activities. Consultation will 

be carried out by a National Steering Committee (CNP) at the national level and by Provincial 

Consultation Committees (CCs) at the decentralized level. 

4.7.3 The improvements noted notwithstanding, the Bank portfolio review showed that the 

implementation of operations is still facing recurrent problems that affect performance. The 

constraints faced include: (i) bottlenecks in the fulfilment of loan agreement conditionalities, 

particularly the ratification of loan agreements and the fulfilment of conditions precedent to first 

disbursement; (ii) the low involvement of oversight ministries in project monitoring; and (iii) the 

poor financial management of some projects, especially the conduct of audits. To mitigate these risks 

and enhance good governance, the project will reinforce the PADCA management team which will 

comprise a procurement expert. In addition, the project will support local governance through greater 

regional consultation, secured land tenure systems and capacity building for infrastructure 

management cooperatives and bodies.  

4.8 Sustainability 

4.8.1 Project sustainability will be ensured by enhancing the capacity of institutional actors 

(beneficiaries, State services, service-providing NGOs, local elected representatives, etc.) to replicate 

the good initiatives the project would have developed throughout its existence. The potential effect 

and the sustainability of the expected impacts of the implementation of the activities of the various 

sub-sectors mainly depend on the project’s holistic approach, its intervention and support principles 

upstream and downstream of the sub-sectors.  



 

18 

4.8.2 The sustainability of investments and expected benefits is contingent upon: (i) beneficiaries 

who are better trained and equipped for production and processing; (ii) the choice of locally tested 

and easily mastered varieties, techniques and technologies; (iii) support for the restructuring and 

supervision of beneficiaries in the management, maintenance and replacement of productive 

facilities; (iv) social cohesion, especially community work, which will  contribute to ensuring 

sustainability ; (v) institutions and other actors who are trained and empowered to better conduct 

participatory variety selection (PVS) tests and adoption of good farming practices; (vi) the 

development of partnerships and synergies with national institutions and organizations such as the 

National Extension Service, the National Seed Service and the National Institute of Agronomic 

Studies and Research, which will contribute to ensuring sustainability; and (vii) the involvement of 

the private sector in seed multiplication and the marketing of products, which will ensure continuity 

of production, processing and marketing.  

4.8.3 The national and international laws in place in DRC require the conduct of a prior 

environmental and social impact assessment, especially Law No. 11/9 of 9 July 2011 on the 

fundamental principles for protection of environment, Section 2 of which states that: “Every 

development, infrastructure or industrial, commercial, agricultural, forestry, mining, 

telecommunications, etc. project likely to have an environmental impact shall be subject to a prior 

environmental and social impact assessment, together with its duly approved management plan”. 

4.9 Risk Management 

4.9.1 The project will adopt a participatory approach based on response to request. It will 

introduce technological and technical innovations already tested in research/development institutions 

and/or pilot farmers, through the activities of research centres.  As a result, the technical risks related 

to these activities will be few. The other risks that could affect PADCA-6P are:  

(i) The difficulties in finding local service providers capable of providing the institutional 
and technical support that the project seeks to develop;    

(ii) The weak capacity of the population to implement a participatory, decentralized 
approach for expressing priority needs in a context characterized by the absence 

and/or weakness of grassroots community organizations.   

Mitigation  measures: the risk mitigation strategy adopted by PADCA-6P consists in: (i) promoting 

the structuring, organization and capacity building of the population/farmers’ organizations; and (ii) 

developing, in collaboration with financial partners and specialized NGOs in the provinces 

concerned, consultation and conflict prevention mechanisms among traditional rulers and 

decentralized local authorities. The new political climate ushered in by the presidential and 

legislative elections is expected to mitigate this risk. 

4.9.2 The major potential risks that project implementation may face and their mitigation 

measures are presented in the table below: 

  



 

19 

4.10. Knowledge Building 

4.10.1 Cassava sub-sector activities contribute to knowledge building and sharing. They include: 

(i) the dissemination of production and processing technologies which will help to develop expertise 

in the sub-sector and promote mechanization; (ii) training in production and processing and exchange 

visits which are tools for interaction between researchers, advisory support workers and 

beneficiaries; (iii) awareness-raising and information dissemination through various communication 

channels (community radios, media programmes, website, etc.); and (iv) promotion of innovative 

actions for  youth and women employability in the growth areas of the sub-sector.  

4.10.2 The project will use the Semi-Autotrophic Hydroponic (SAH) rapid multiplication 

technology. The introduction of this technology helps to rapidly obtain large quantities of healthy 

cuttings.  

4.10.3 Regarding fertilization, the project will introduce the integrated soil fertility management 

(ISFM) approach which combines organic and inorganic soil fertility inputs. To improve agronomic 

efficiency, the use of mineral and organic fertilizers with improved varieties will be promoted. They 

will also be adapted to the local context in case the soils need additional lime or dolomite for greater 

increase in productivity. 

 

 

No. Potential Risks Level Mitigation Measures 

1 Insufficient synergy of action 

between project partners 

High - Establishment of a project coordination 
unit and proper planning of activities, 

and fielding of joint missions 

- Reinforcement of collaboration and 
coordination between research and 

agricultural counselling institutions. 

2 Insufficient support from the 

population 

Moderate - Establishment of an appropriate 
communication plan for all actors and 

agricultural counselling and training 

activities 

- Establishment of platforms 

3 Worsening of the political and 

security crisis in the country and its 

spread to the project area 

 

High 

- Establishment of coordination branches 
in the provinces 

- Coordination of security information 
with the United Nations system  

- Facilitating social cohesion  

4   Climate hazards and pest 

outbreaks 

High - Mainstreaming of the adaptation 
dimension in activities   

- Integrated farming approach and use of 
resistant and tolerant varieties 

5 Inadequate road infrastructure Moderate - Synergy with existing AFDB projects

Project Summary 

1. Project overview: The Rural Economy Integrated Development Support Project 
(PROADER) will be implemented in the rural areas of Kasaï-Central, Kasaï, Kasaï-Oriental, 

Kwilu, Kwango, Kongo Central and Mai-Ndombe Provinces. About 60% of the inhabitants of 

these provinces live below the extreme poverty line of USD 1.9 per day. The targeted corridor is 

an integral part of areas most severely affected by the humanitarian crisis in the Democratic 

Republic of Congo (DRC). The area has a huge agricultural, forestry, pastoral and fisheries 

production potential, and can serve as a vector for the promotion of agribusiness. It is the junction 

area between the West (Kinshasa border with the Republic of Congo), the Southwest (border with 

Angola) and the Southeast (Grand Katanga towards Zambia). The overall objective of the project 

is to promote a dynamic and prosperous rural economy by improving agricultural and rural 

socioeconomic services, and by diversifying and enhancing agricultural production. To achieve 

this objective, PROADER’s activities will be centred on the following components: (a) local 

governance and institutional capacity building; (b) promotion of productive and social 

investments; and (c) project coordination and management. The project cost is estimated at UA 

49,49 million, of which UA 39,99 million will be contributed by ADF Loan, UA 2,1 million by 

ADF grant from Loan cancellation, UA 6,84 million by the Government and UA 0.56 million by 

the project beneficiaries. The project will be implemented over a six-year period. 

2. PROADER will directly affect 380,000 households in the 30 selected agricultural, 
forestry and pastoral basins, representing nearly 10% of households in the seven targeted 

provinces, or about 2 million people, of whom 50% are women and at least 40% are young 

people. The project will indirectly affect nearly 500,000 households or about 2.6 million people. 

The expected project benefits are the increase in rural household income, the reduction in chronic 

malnutrition among children under five, the increased share of the agricultural sector in the 

national Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and the enhanced resilience of rural households. 

3. Needs assessment: The Bank’s intervention is justified partly by the considerable 

investment needs of the DRC agricultural sector, which must be met to allow the actors of this 

sector to fully play their roles in the structural transformation of Congolese agriculture. The 

project area is replete with natural resources that offer value-adding opportunities with the 

potential to generate wealth for the rural economy. However, agricultural/rural development 

continues to face problems that hinder the dynamism of the rural economy and should, therefore, 

be given special attention. These problems include: (i) the low productivity of traditional 

subsistence farming systems characterised by shifting cultivation and slash-and-burn practices, the 

use of degenerated local seeds, rudimentary farming techniques and high vulnerability to climate 

change. According to the E-QUIBB 2016 survey, 1.8% of households use modern farming 

techniques and 0.8% have access to agricultural machinery; (ii) weak local governance leading to 

significant inadequacies in the planning and maintenance of basic infrastructure required for 

economic development; and (iii) lack of development opportunities for small- and medium-sized 

enterprises in occupational areas related to the development of agricultural and rural services. The 

formal request of the DRC Government was made to the Bank in March 2019. 

4. Bank’s value-added: The Bank’s value-added stems from its experience acquired 

through its interventions in the agricultural and rural sector. Bank intervention will consolidate the 

gains of Bank-financed rural development sector projects under which several rural infrastructure 

facilities were rehabilitated. It will also revive the rural sector, which was left in utter shambles by 

the conflicts. This project lays special emphasis on the establishment of a sustainable mechanism 

for the management and maintenance of rural infrastructure, including roads, with the building of 

the institutional and financial capacity of Decentralised Territorial Entities (ETDs) and the 

involvement of economic actors and the communities concerned.

5. Knowledge building: PROADER will generate knowledge on the development of the 

rural economy in the DRC, including the challenges, methodologies and benefits of local planning, 

integrated water management, digitisation of farms and registration of producers, the public-

private-producer partnership (or 4P)1 and the financing of gender mainstreaming innovations. As 

part of knowledge management, an electronic library will be set up to store all relevant documents 

from the agricultural and rural sector, which will be accessible to stakeholders and the public. To 

this end, an inventory of best practices, identification of local knowledge and innovations will be 

carried out. This activity will be developed as part of institutional support to the Department of 

Studies and Planning (DEP) of the Ministry in charge of Rural Development. The project's 

monitoring and evaluation system and the gender-sensitive social and institutional communication 

strategy that will be developed will facilitate the production of information for dissemination to 

stakeholders, particularly through partner community radio stations. The knowledge generated by 

the project will help to fuel policy dialogues, support and improve the design of new projects.  

 

                                                 
1  A 4P is a cooperation arrangement between a government, entrepreneurs and small producers, who agree to work together to 

reach a common goal or perform a specific task, while jointly assuming the risks and responsibilities and sharing benefits, 

resources and skills. An illustration of a 4P is presented in Annex B.1.4, Volume II, of the Appraisal Report.

BANK GROUP MANAGEMENT’S REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION TO THE 

BOARD OF DIRECTORS CONCERNING A PROPOSAL TO GRANT A LOAN TO THE 

DEMOCRATIC DEVELOPMENT REPUBLIC OF CONGO TO FINANCE THE RURAL 

ECONOMY INTEGRATED DEVELOPMENT SUPPORT PROJECT (PROADER) 

 

Management hereby submits this report and its recommendation concerning a proposal to grant a 

Loan of UA 39.997.947 and a Grant of UA 2.100.000 from Loan cancellations to the Government 

of the Democratic Republic of Congo to finance the Rural Economy Integrated Development 

Support Project. 

I. STRATEGIC THRUST AND OBJECTIVES 

1.1. Project Linkages with Country Strategy and Objectives 

1.1.1 The project is consistent with the DRC's 2016-2021 Strategic Development Framework 

(SDF), which seeks to achieve economic and social development by diversifying the economy 

through: (i) agriculture and the agro-food chain; (i) forest exploitation, timber processing and 

marketing industries; (iii) mining; (iv) construction and building materials; (v) the tourism and 

hotel business; and (vi) financial services. The project is also aligned with the National 

Agricultural Investment Plan (PNIA) for 2014-2020, whose overall objective is to stimulate 

sustained annual growth of the agricultural sector by more than 6% - an essential prerequisite for 

reducing poverty, ensuring the people’s food security and nutrition, and sustainably generating 

jobs and income. PROADER is in line with the country's Decentralisation Policy, which 

empowers the Provinces and ETDs to plan and assume responsibility for the economic 

development of their communities and to become real drivers of development from the grassroots. 

According to the 1-2-3 Survey (2016), 63.4% of the population, or 46 million Congolese, live 

below the poverty line and close to three-quarters of them below the extreme poverty line. In 

terms of the human assets index (HAI) and the human development index (HDI), the DRC ranks 

146th out of 157 countries, with an HAI of 0.37 (2017), and 176th out of 189 countries with an HDI 

of 0.457 (2018). The country offers very few formal job opportunities and overall 

underemployment affects 85.7% of the workforce (82% of men and 89.7% of women).  

1.1.2  PROADER is consistent with the 2013-2017 Country Strategy Paper (CSP), extended 

respectively to the end of 2018 and the end of 2020, the two pillars of which are: (i) development 

of private investment and regional integration support infrastructure; and (ii) building central 

government’s capacity to increase public revenue and create an enabling framework for private 

investment. The project will help to strengthen the structural transformation of the rural and 

agricultural sector, which offers a real opportunity to diversify the country's economy and create 

jobs. The project design is in line with the Bank's "Feed Africa" strategy, which is based on the 

value chain approach and seeks to improve productivity and resilience by adopting technology 

through two flagship programmes: Technologies for African Agricultural Transformation (TAAT) 

and Africa Climate-Smart Agriculture (ACSA). PROADER is also aligned with youth 

employment strategies, including the “ENABLE YOUTH” initiative. Lastly, the project will help 

to strengthen women's economic empowerment, and thus dovetails with Pillar 2 of the Bank's 

Gender Strategy, which is based on women's economic empowerment. 

1.2. Rationale for Bank Intervention  

1.2.1. The development of agriculture and agribusiness is an economic diversification pillar of 

the Strategic Development Framework (SDF), aimed at the economic and social development of 

the DRC. The DRC abounds in natural resources, which offer opportunities for the creation of 

value-added that could lead to the generation of wealth for the rural economy. However, 

agricultural/rural development continues to be handicapped by: (i) the low productivity of 

traditional subsistence farming systems characterised by shifting cultivation and slash-and-burn 



2 

practices, the use of degenerated local seeds, rudimentary farming techniques and high 

vulnerability to climate change; (ii) weak local governance leading to notable inadequacies in the 

planning and maintenance of basic infrastructure required for economic development; and (iii) the 

lack of development opportunities for small- and medium-sized enterprises in occupational areas 

related to the development of agricultural and rural services.. Therefore, the project will help to 

strengthen the structural transformation of the agricultural and rural sector, which offers a real 

opportunity to diversify the country's economy and create jobs, especially for young people. It will 

support the improvement of agricultural productivity and the organisation of small producers to 

guarantee regular and appropriate supply for agro-industries located in the selected production 

basins and operating in the priority value chains of the targeted areas. Moreover, this intervention 

will enhance and consolidate the major gains of previous Bank-financed projects in terms of rural 

development sector infrastructure, and will thus promote the revival of a rural sector that was 

completely in tatters due to lack of investments and as a result of conflicts in the project areas. 

Furthermore, the Bank's intervention will help to strengthen social cohesion and reduce the 

fragility of the intervention area, which is the focus area of the operational activities of the current 

CSP. 

1.2.2. The agricultural and rural sector requires significant investments to enable all actors in 

the sector to fully play their role in the transformation of Congolese agriculture. In this context 

and as a result of its experiences gained through the implementation of its strategies for 

transforming agriculture, overcoming fragility and building resilience in Africa, the Bank enjoys a 

real comparative advantage as far as this intervention is concerned. 

1.3. Aid Coordination 

1.3.1. The activities of the DRC's development partners are coordinated through the Aid and 

Investment Management Platform (PGAI), hosted in the Ministry of Planning. Technical activities 

are discussed and planned in thematic groups, including the Inter-Donor Group for Agriculture 

and Rural Development (GIBADER). PROADER will develop synergies and complementarities 

with ongoing investment projects in the agricultural and rural sector financed by other donors, 

which include: (i) the Government-funded Agricultural Voluntary Programme (PVA); (ii) the 

PAPAKIN project, financed by IFAD; (iii) the Kwilu/Kwango Districts Agricultural Development 

Programme (PRODAKK) and the Kwilu/Kwango Access Improvement Programme (PRODEKK), 

financed by the Kingdom of Belgium and implemented by Enabel (former Belgian Technical 

Cooperation); and (iv) the World Bank-funded Growth Pole Development Project (PDPC) in the 

Western Region. Lastly, the project will scale up successful public-private-producer partnership 

initiatives in village palm oil value chains (with the private concern known as Huilerie, 

Plantations, Élevage du Kwango Kwilu - HPEK) (Kwango Kwilu Oil Mill, Plantations and 

Livestock Company), maize with STRATEGOS, cassava with two private concerns: Entreprise de 

Consultance et de Services Agricoles au Congo (Consultancy and Agricultural Services Enterprise 

in Congo) (ECOSAC) and LAYUKA. The project will support the country in mobilising climate 

funds. Lastly, an expected partnership with the next IFAD project that is being designed for 

Kassaï Oriental and Central will maximise the project impact. The following table provides a 

summary of the coordination of the agricultural sector.

2.2. Technical Solution Adopted and Alternatives Explored  

2.2.1 Participatory local development. In accordance with the Constitution of 18 February 

2006, which confers on Decentralised Territorial Entities (ETDs) the responsibility of planning 

and overseeing the economic development of their communities, EDTs are required to manage 

operational activities in their territory. In this context, they play a key role in establishing good 

local governance, facilitating the development of the rural economy and the maintenance of rural 

infrastructure. Under PROADER, preference will be given to the demand-driven approach and the 

strengthening of local project management. In this regard, project investments will not only be 

based on the needs clearly expressed by the actors within the context of the development of value 

chains, but must also support the development of the local economy and be linked to local 

development plans.  

2.2.2 Development of public-private-producer-partnership (4P)3: There are specialised private 

agricultural enterprises in the project intervention area that offer small producers various services, 

including mechanisation, improved input supply and agricultural advisory services. The project 

will adopt the "subcontracting" approach by delegating services related to the improvement of the 

                                                 
2  Including physical and financial contingencies. 
3  A 4P is a cooperation arrangement between a government, entrepreneurs and small producers, who agree to work together to reach a common 

goal or perform a specific task, while jointly assuming the risks and responsibilities, and sharing benefits, resources and skills.  



5 

agricultural productivity to specialise agricultural enterprises located in the production basins and 

operating in the targeted value chains. These enterprises will be responsible for supporting 

producers by: (i) providing agricultural advisory services (application of good farming practices), 

(ii) ensuring access to resilient and good quality agricultural inputs (improved seeds and cultivars, 

fertilisers, pesticides, etc.); (iii) purchasing the surplus marketable production from small 

producers and/or unions, following an aggregation model, at a fair price that takes into account the 

cost of production and the market price. Specialised private agricultural enterprises will also 

process raw products into finished and/or semi-finished products for sale on the local, national and 

international markets, which will create value-added in the basins with spin-offs on the rural 

economy in terms of job creation. Specialised private agricultural enterprises will be remunerated 

based on the work actually carried out after the quality of such work has been assessed by all the 

parties concerned (the project/the Government, the private operator and the union). In this regard, 

PROADER will sign partnership protocols/contracts with the following specialised agricultural 

enterprises: (i) Huilerie, Plantation, Élevage de Kwilu/Kwango (HPEC) (Kwilu/Kwango Oil Mill, 

Plantation, Livestock Company), headquartered in Kikwit (Kwilu Province), to support farmers' 

unions in the production of palm oil from the village oil palm plantation covering an area of 2,000 

hectares; (ii) STRATEGOS, headquartered in Lusanga, Kwilu Province, to support 10,000 

producers in maize production. Its intervention will cover 350 villages within a radius of about 50 

km of Lusanga on the right and left banks of the Kwilu River; (iii) LAYUKA, headquartered in 

Madimba, Kongo Central, to support 200 producer associations, representing about 5,000 

households, in cassava production; (iv) Consultance et des Services Agricoles (ECOSAC Sarl) 

(Consultancy and Agricultural Services), to support small producers in the production of cassava. 

This company is currently operating in Bukango Lonzo, Kwango Province, where it is 

headquartered, but plans to set up operations in Kikwit and Bandundu City (Kwilu Province) to 

support the activities of small-scale cassava producers.   

2.2.3 Youth skills development and innovation.: The project will set up a competitive 

mechanism for innovation and promotion of youth entrepreneurship in rural areas. It will finance 

an innovation fund to support entrepreneurs, young people and producer organisations (POs) with 

innovative ideas and initiatives for improving the quality of life and income in rural areas. These 

innovations could concern: (i) the development of new products or new markets; (ii) equipment 

tests and processes; (iii) the use of alternative energy; (iv) new environment-friendly technologies; 

(v) expertise in food quality and safety; (vi) the use of new information and communication 

technologies in the marketing and promotion of products, including fortified cassava flour; and 

(vi) the certification and labelling of processed products. Annual competitions will be held at the 

national level to identify ideas and initiatives with potential for large-scale impact. The innovation 

selection process will include the following steps: Phase A, preselection of the best ideas in 

agricultural value chains based on project profiles submitted by potential candidates; Phase B 

intended to (a) identify potential applications of the technology, (b) learn to recognise the 

market(s) targeted, (c) guide research and development (R&D) taking into account market needs, 

and (d) conduct a technical and commercial proof of concept, to validate the business model and 

design the business plan. By means of a stringent selection process, candidates with the greatest 
potential to succeed will be selected; and Phase C dealing with the funding and close 

support/coaching/mentoring of candidates whose innovations were selected. Individual technical 

assistance will be mobilised for the development of operational procedures based on similar 

successful experiments (Tony Elumelu Entrepreneurship Program, AgriPitch, the Competitive 

Fund for Agricultural Innovation of Côte d'Ivoire, etc.). Financial institutions, telecommunications 

sector operators and private concerns will be encouraged to co-invest in this fund, including 

through acquisition of stakes in the identified micro-, small- and medium-sized agricultural and 

rural enterprises (MPMEARs).

2.2.4 Promotion of community agroforestry: Various agroforestry models have already been 

tested in many African countries with positive results and trials have also been conducted 

successfully in the DRC. The agroforestry system model that will be promoted by the project is 

based on the association between food production (cassava and maize, plus legumes/beans and 

soya beans), fruit trees and charcoal production with Acacia auriculiformis as flagship species for 

soil fertilisation. The model chosen is based on the success of the Mampu Agroforestry Project 

funded by the European Commission, which covers an area of 8,000 hectares. Agroforestry will 

aim to: (i) increase cassava production and yield from 9 tonnes per hectare to 15 tonnes per 

hectare, for a total area of at least 10,000 ha, while slashing production costs by about 30%; (ii) 

increase maize production and yield from 1.5 t/ha to 3 t/ha, for a total area of at least 5,000 ha, 

while slashing production costs by about 25%; and (iii) increase farmers' income by at least 20%.    

2.2.5 Sustainability of investments. The opening up of production areas will mainly concern 

targeted rehabilitation consisting of treatment of critical points (quagmires, low-lying areas, water 

crossing points, steep-slope areas, etc.) to allow the year-round use of a given road section. The 

structures will be made of durable materials and sized in such a way as to allow the proper flow of 

water. The project will support the establishment and operationalisation of multifunctional service 

platforms (PMS) for the promotion of women's economic empowerment. Each platform will 

include a Gender Multifunctional Centre (CMG) for rural job training, awareness raising, 

managerial and leadership capacity building for women. Each infrastructure promoted and 

implemented by the project will be accompanied by a service package (maintenance system, 

technical training in the use and management of the infrastructure, etc.).

2.5. Project Area and Beneficiaries  

2.5.1 PROADER will carry out its operations in seven provinces, namely Kongo Central. 

Kwango, Kwilu, Maindombe, Kasaï, Kasaï Occidental and Kasaï Oriental. This area has 

enormous potential for agro-pastoral and fisheries production. It is the main supplier of staple 

foodstuffs to the country's major cities (Kinshasa, Lubumbashi, Mbuji-Mayi, Kananga, Kikwit and 

Matadi). Moreover, about 70% of the population of this area is rural, having agriculture and 

related activities as their main source of livelihood. With a total population estimated at 

19,558,3054, the project area accounts for nearly 25% of the DRC's total population and covers 

about 22% of the national territory. The project area is part of the Government's priority 

development areas, the more so since the corridor targeted by the project, including the central 

region, is one of the areas most severely affected by the humanitarian crisis in the DRC. 

2.5.2 This area is crossed by the railway and National Road No. 1 (RN 1), which are the part of 

the regional network connecting Kinshasa to Johannesburg in South Africa. Until now, this vast 

territory did not enjoy the benefits of cross-border trade because of its isolation. The operations 

currently being carried out by the Bank on RN1 in coordination with other technical and financial 

partners (TFPs), in particular the European Union, for the extension of this road up to Mbuji-

Mayi, and the World Bank, for the rehabilitation of the Ilebo-Lubumbashi railway, will help to 

open up this major corridor. The project’s intervention area is a continuation of the Bank's 

previous operations in the agricultural and rural development sector in the Central Region and 

Kongo Central.   

2.5.3. Beneficiaries. The Project will target mainly small family farms, producer organisations 

(POs) and their unions, cooperatives and micro-, small- and medium-sized agricultural and rural 

enterprises (MPMEARs) upstream and downstream of the production chain. Of all these actors, 

special attention will be given to women, young people and MPMEARs owned by young people 

and women. The other PROADER beneficiaries are the EDTs, central and devolved State public 

entities, and specialised private agricultural enterprises operating in the targeted production basins 

that not only provide support services, including agricultural extension services and inputs, but 

also add value through the processing of agricultural products. PROADER will directly affect 

380,000 households in the 30 targeted agricultural, forestry and pastoral basins, representing 

nearly 10% of households in seven targeted provinces, or about 2 million people, of whom 50% 

women and 40% young people. Indirectly, the project will affect some 500,000 households or 

about 2.6 million people. PROADER will primarily target young people and women, by 

increasing employment opportunities and income from production and processing activities, 

supporting the development of agricultural entrepreneurship in activities related to production 

(ploughing service, transport, road maintenance, processing, marketing, etc.) and providing 

appropriate advisory support. 

2.6.  Participatory Approach for the Project Identification, Design and Implementation  

2.6.1 The project was designed using a participatory approach based on consultations with the 

various stakeholders throughout the formulation process. In this context, the Secretariat General 

for Rural Development set up a multidisciplinary team of national experts who worked closely 

with Bank experts during the project preparation and appraisal phases. The consultations included 

the Ministries of Rural Development, Agriculture, Decentralisation, Planning, Gender, Child and 

Family, Small- and Medium-sized Enterprises and Technical and Vocational Training, the private 

sector, represented by the Federation of Congolese Enterprises (FEC), non-governmental 

organisations, producer umbrella organisations, producers and processors of agricultural products, 

individually or in association, political and administrative authorities as well as devolved technical

services in the project area, private agricultural operators, ETDs, project managers, specialised 

private agricultural enterprises, microcredit institutions, and several NGO-led initiatives in the 

agricultural and rural development sector.   

2.6.2 These consultations, among other things, helped to identify and more clearly define: (i) 

production basins and priority sectors; (ii) market dynamics and trade flows; (iii) business and 

value-adding opportunities in value chains; (iv) previous project operations; (v) the business 

regulatory environment; constraints to the involvement and effective/proper private sector 

participation; (vi) innovations and technologies for the improvement of production and 

processing; (vii) the involvement and aspirations of women and young people in value chains and; 

(viii) experiences and constraints regarding access to funding, especially on a medium- and long-

term basis, for agricultural and rural development ventures, agribusiness and MPMEARs. 

Stakeholder consultations will continue during project implementation to ensure effective 

implementation and the sustainability of interventions.   

2.7. Consideration of Bank Group Experience and Lessons Learned in the  Project Design 

2.7.1. The portfolio performance as of 31 December 2018 is generally satisfactory, with a rating 

of 3 on a scale of 1 to 4. The average portfolio age increased from 3.8 years in 2017 to 4.4 years as 

of 31 December 2018. The national portfolio does not include any project-at-risk (PAR). 

Regarding the agricultural and rural sector in the DRC, the operations carried out over the past 

five years relate to: (i) the financing of the Rural Infrastructure Development Support Project 

(PADIR), scheduled to close on 31 December 2019. PADIR’s physical implementation rate is 

nearly 98%, with a disbursement rate of 92%. The project has made significant gains in the 

rehabilitation of rural roads (1,300 km) as well as the building of several other rural infrastructure 

facilities leading to the revival of the rural sector that was completely moribund; (ii) new projects 

including the Youth Entrepreneurship in Agriculture and Agri-Business Project, targeting young 

graduates and the Agricultural Value Chain Project in six provinces, which focuses on the 

dissemination of agricultural technologies developed by TAAT programme compacts. Recurrent 

problems have been highlighted by lessons learned from previous projects and the portfolio 

performance, including: (a) difficulty in ensuring the timely fulfilment of conditions precedent to 

loan effectiveness and first disbursement, (b) delays in the procurement process, with a negative 

impact on overall disbursement, and (iii) weak empowerment of beneficiaries of rural 

development projects. 

2.7.2. These weaknesses are addressed in the revised Portfolio Improvement Plan (PAP) 

2018/2019. Hence, the project design takes these lessons into account through: (i) support for local 

participatory development in terms of building the capacity of local actors in project planning and 

management; and (ii) encouragement of sustainable partnerships between public and private actors 

and producers to improve access to agricultural and rural services. Furthermore, the Bank will 

strengthen its presence on the ground to facilitate the close monitoring process. In addition, the 

project will draw lessons from the report of the internal audit conducted by the Bank in 2017 on 

projects financed in Central Africa, especially as concerns delays in the submission of audit 

reports and the low level of implementation of the environmental and social management plans.    

2.7.3 The project has taken into consideration the lessons learned from IDEV's assessment of 

the Bank’s support for the development of agricultural value chains (AVC)5, which recommends 

the following basic principles, among others: (i) analyse the entire value chain; (ii) develop a 

strategy to ensure inclusion; (iii) maintain the ability to adapt to market developments; (iv) think 

in terms of profitability with value-added; and (v) establish plans for creating a sustainable impact. 

Accordingly, the project design capitalised on the guidelines of the sub-regional forum on the

revitalisation of the rural economy in Central Africa, jointly organised by the Bank and the 

International Labour Office (ILO) in February 2019 in Brazzaville. These are: (a) increase 

investment and attractiveness of rural areas, (b) promote an integrated training and skills 

development system to address the challenges of innovative agriculture, (c) diversify the rural 

economy through the development of rural occupations and opportunities in rural areas, and (d) 

develop skills and approaches that take into account the crisis and resilience context. 

2.8. Key Performance Indicators 

2.8.1. PROADER’s impact indicators are: (a) improvement of farm household income from less 

than USD 2,000/year in 2018 to USD 3,500/year in 2025; and (b) reduction of chronic 

malnutrition rate among children under 5 in rural areas from 43% in 2019 to 38% in 2025 The 
project is expected to produce the following outcomes: (i) increase of the percentage of the 

population in targeted basins with access to all-season roads from 25 to 60%; (ii) improvement of 

the rate of access to mechanisation from 0.8 to 10%; (iii) increase of the percentage of the budget 

allocated by ETDs for the maintenance of access roads to production basins from 0 to 10%; (iv) 

improvement of the rate of rural women’s access to technological innovations in agriculture from 

0 to 30%; (v) improvement of the productivity of the following main crops: maize - from 0.8 to 2 

t/ha ; cassava - from 8 to 20 t/ha; palm nuts - from 2.5 to 20 t/ha/year; (vi) 40% increase in 

additional marketed volume; (vii) reduction of post-harvest losses from 30% to 20% for cassava 

and from 25% to 10% for maize; (viii) improvement from 8.4% to 20% the percentage of children 

between 6 and 23 months with a minimum acceptable diet; (ix) improvement of the rural women 

empowerment index from 1 to 3 (scale of 1 = low and 5 = high). The project’s detailed baseline 

situation, including the environmental and social baseline situation, will also be prepared by 

capitalising on the results of the household surveys to be conducted at the completion of PADIR in 

collaboration with the National Institute of Statistics (INS). To assess the progress achieved, 

surveys will be carried out at mid-term and at project completion in the same areas (project and 

buffer areas where the baseline surveys were conducted). 

III –  PROJECT FEASIBILITY 

3.1. Economic and Financial Performance 

3.1.1. Financial performance was assessed for four (4) typical model farms and enterprises that 

produce cassava, maize and palm nuts, and carry out cassava processing operations, reflecting the 

range of activities that the project plans to support. Financial analysis shows that these 

investments will lead to a substantial increase in the net profits of farms and enterprises, which 

means that the PROADER-supported activities will be profitable. As indicated by Table 3.1 below, 

these results show that the project support will improve the financial performance of farms, 

cooperatives, micro, small- and medium-sized agricultural and rural enterprises (MPMEARs) 

engaged in the production, processing and marketing of these food products.   

3.1.2. Financial analysis: Based on the above assumptions, the financial analysis generated a 

net present value of USD 86.4 million and a financial internal return rate (FIRR) of 18%, meaning 

that the project is financially feasible.  

3.1.3.  Economic analysis: The economic analysis was carried out using the same approach as for 

the financial analysis, which consisted in analysing the benefits generated by the farms and 

enterprises concerned, based on the reference prices of the tradable goods and the total project 

cost. The results of the economic analysis show that the benefits of the project are positive.  The 

project's economic return rate (ERR) is 19% and the net present value (NPV) is estimated at USD 

95.5 million. However, these benefits should be higher if account is taken of the unquantifiable 

gains derived from nutritional and financial education, access to clean water, sanitation, women's 

economic empowerment and improved accessibility of production areas. Nutritional education and 



11 

access to clean water will help to improve the health condition of households, which would result 

in improved labour productivity of household assets and a reduction in household medical 

expenses, among other benefits. Access to road infrastructure will not only increase the volume of 

marketed production but would also facilitate access to health and education services for 

beneficiaries. The improvement in the curriculum of technical and vocational training centres will 

enable the latter to offer young people quality training tailored to the needs of the job market.  

Sensitivity analysis confirms the strength of the project’s positive economic effects and impacts.

3.2.  Environmental and Social Impacts 

Environment 

3.2.1 The project is proposed for classification in Category 2 of the Bank's Integrated 

Safeguards System (ISS) and the Bank’s Climate Safeguard System, equivalent to Category B at 

the national level, although at this stage of preparation most of the sites and activities are yet to be 

determined. The activities under project component 2 are likely to have adverse impacts on the 

environment, namely: (i) the production of pollution and waste during infrastructure construction 

works; (ii) the production of pollution and waste during the processing of value chain products; 

(iii) the risks of land and water pollution by agrochemicals, endangering the health of users; (iv) 

the risk of plant and wildlife degradation during the operation of quarries and borrow pits for 

construction works; (v) the risk of accidents at construction sites and on the sites of processing 

units, and (vi) the risk of spread of communicable diseases on the sites.   

3.2.2 However, the expected negative impacts will be limited in scope and time. The "capacity 

building" component will contribute significantly to strengthen local governance and the ongoing 

decentralisation process, and to reduce conflicts over the use of natural resources (IWRM 

approach/support for the promotion of the green economy and the blue economy). The IWRM-

associated blue economy promotes the conservation of aquatic ecosystems, as well as the use and 

sustainable management of their resources. Given their nature, the planned activities are certainly 

not likely to generate any negative impacts or major risks, or lead to any significant asset losses or 

displacement. However, the building of certain production and processing support infrastructure 

facilities, depending on their size and the situation of the host environment, is likely to affect the 

environment, and possibly cause negative impacts on the biophysical and human ecosystems if 

preventive or mitigation measures are not considered at this project design stage and during 

implementation.   

3.2.3 Given that the siting and environmental and social characteristics of all investments are 

not known, an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) has been prepared in 

accordance with the requirements of the Bank's Integrated Safeguards System. The ESMF 

indicates the mitigation and management procedures and measures that will need to be 

implemented by the project once the sites and sub-projects are known. These measures are 

described in the Environmental and Social Management Framework Plan (ESMFP) and comprise, 

among others, sub-project analysis and screening procedures, consultation, communication and 

conflict management procedures; environmental and social management plans (ESMPs) and 

environmental and social clauses that should be included in competitive bidding documents and 

sub-project implementation contracts, forest and wetland management guidelines, and pesticide 

and pest management guidelines. The project activities will have many positive impacts on both 

the local communities and the environment. Thus, the participatory approach involving local 

communities in the rehabilitation of access facilitation infrastructure, the dissemination of more 



12 

sustainable and climate-smart agricultural practices, including community agroforestry, and the 

reduction of post-harvest losses, will enhance the resilience of the livelihoods of rural households, 

restore soil fertility and increase tree cover, thereby significantly reducing greenhouse gas 

emissions.   

3.2.4 Functions relating to environmental safeguard measures will include: (i) the screening of 

sub-projects and identification of their category based on the environmental and social selection 

sheets; (ii) the recruitment of firms/consultants for the ESMP preparation after validation of the 

process by the Directorate General of the Environment; (iii) the inclusion of environmental clauses 

in the process of recruiting works implementation contractors; (iv) monitoring and evaluation of 

the implementation of sub-projects; and (vi) audit coordination. The entire environmental and 

social function needs to be strengthened within the institutions involved in project 

implementation. Furthermore, measures should be adopted to support institutional and technical 

measures, training and awareness-raising in order to build the capacity of structures and human 

resources that will be set up. Such measures will aim to: (a) operationalise the PROADER Project 

environmental management strategy, (b) foster the emergence of local expertise and professionals 

in environmental and social management, (c) raise the level of professional consciousness and 

accountability among employees in production enterprises, and (d) protect the urban and rural 

environment and the health and safety of beneficiary communities. 

3.2.5. Consultations were held in the context of the ESMF at various phases of the project 

preparation and participants' observations were incorporated into the Environmental and Social 

Management Framework (ESMF). The ESMF was validated by the Bank's Safeguards Department 

and published on 2 October 20196.  

Climate Change  

3.2.6 The impacts of climate change can be seen in the DRC through the persistence of high 

temperatures, heavy rains, land degradation (particularly gully erosion), the prolonged dry season, 

increased sequences of dry spells during the rainy season, and floods, among others. Given that 

agriculture remains rain-fed, these phenomena exacerbate the vulnerability of the rural population. 

More frequent and longer seasonal droughts lead to disruptions in agricultural calendars. In terms 

of agricultural production, these climatic disturbances should have a direct impact on food 

security, which is already precarious for a large majority of the Congolese population. The project 

will contribute to the resilience of communities and ecosystems by improving the living 

conditions and food and nutrition security of rural communities. This is in line with the country's 

nationally determined contribution (NDC) in respect of climate change, which targets a 17% 

reduction in greenhouse gas emissions over the period 2021 to 2030. The project is classified 

under Category 2 of the Bank's Climate Safeguards System. Activities financed under PROADER 

will strengthen the resilience of ecosystems and communities to climate change by improving 

production systems, limiting the practice of extensive farming, restoring ecosystems through the 

application of good agricultural practices, institution building on climate change and green 

growth, and capacity building on climate change. The project plugs into the Bank's Climate 

Change Action Plan and contributes to domestic climate financing through the activities under 

Component 2. 

Gender 

3.2.7. The project is classified under Gender Category 27 of the Bank's Gender Marker System 

(GMS), since it will help to narrow the gender gap in terms of access to factors of production, 

                                                 
6  https://www.afdb.org/en/documents/rdc-projet-dappui-au-developpement-integre-de-leconomie-rurale-proader-resume-cges  

 
7  A project is classified in Gender Category 2, when gender equality (GE) and/or economic empowerment (EE) is one of the project outputs, but 

not the main one. PROADER is in this situation.

13 

knowledge, innovation and income improvement. Women, who make up about 50% of Congo's 

population and 70% of the agricultural workforce, account for 80% of food crop production, 22% 

of commercial agriculture, and nearly 90% of agricultural processing, are more severely affected 

by poverty. Therefore, the project's targeting strategy takes this into account and will ensure that at 

least 50% of women benefit from project activities. The project will mobilise nearly USD 5 

million to finance (i) the construction and equipment of gender-specific multi-service platforms 

for rural women. These platforms will act as multipurpose incubators for technical and 

entrepreneurial capacity building, learning, advocacy and female leadership; (ii) the organisation 

of foras and exchange trips; and (iii) the promotion of essential activities in the areas of nutrition, 

hygiene and sanitation. Hence, the project will help to enhance the economic empowerment of 

women in the project area through a series of integrated actions, including building their capacity 

in that area of activity, establishing sustainable agricultural production systems, providing access 

to inputs in production basins and markets, easing their work and setting up a framework tailored 

to the conditions of women farmers. As much as possible monitoring indicators will be gender 

disaggregated to take gender aspects into account.   

3.2.8. In addition to the gender and age disaggregation of indicators, gender-specific indicators 

are included in the results-based logical framework for measuring women's empowerment index in 

agriculture. This index measures the increase in women's capacity to make strategic life choices in 

their households and communities, focusing on five areas of agricultural empowerment: (i) 

production (women's role in decision-making in the household context regarding agricultural 

production); (ii) resources (women's access to productive capital, access to and decision-making 

on credit); (iii) control over the use of income; (iv) leadership and individual influence of women 

in the community; and (v) time allocation for women. This index will be used as a diagnostic tool 

and as a monitoring indicator to measure the project’s impact on women's empowerment.   

Social 

3.2.9. The project will strengthen food and nutrition security, especially for children under five, 

and promote the creation of local employment opportunities. It will help to reduce poverty and the 

vulnerability of communities, while decreasing unemployment and the exodus of young people 

particularly through the development of 300 micro-, small- and medium-sized agricultural and 

rural enterprises in agricultural and rural occupations (product processing, manufacture of 

equipment and material, maintenance of agricultural equipment and machinery, supply of 

production factors, including inputs, etc.). PROADER will contribute to the enhancement of local 

governance through institution and capacity building for ETDs, as well as to the economic 

empowerment of women who, with their rising literacy rates, should be able to improve their 

participation in household decision-making concerning production, in addition to increasing their 

power over the distribution of household income. The project will improve access to socio-

economic services through the construction of about 100 social infrastructure facilities that will be 

identified in a participatory manner. As far as young people are concerned, they will be offered 
specific benefits through (i) the establishment and support of youth-oriented micro-, small- and 

medium-sized agricultural enterprises and the setting up of a competitive fund for innovation and 

promotion of youth entrepreneurship and agricultural start-ups; and (ii) the improvement of the 

skills and employability of young people.   

Forced Resettlement  

3.2.10. PROADER activities will not entail land acquisition or the forced resettlement of people 

and/or restriction of their access to resources or livelihoods. In terms of transformative 

infrastructure, the project will adopt an intervention approach that emphasises the participation 

and empowerment of sector and local community actors at all stages of implementation (from the 

planning of activities to the completion of works). Requests for support should come from ETDs 

or producer unions/cooperatives. The sites for infrastructure, such as markets and other buildings, 



14 

will be owned by ETDs or communes that will be responsible for their management and 

maintenance. The rehabilitation of agricultural feeder roads will be on an ad hoc basis and will 

focus on critical points (quagmires, low-lying areas, watercourse crossing points, steep-slope 

areas, etc.) with maximum reliance on local participation. The project will establish local and 

provincial complaint management committees that will also initiate and supervise the payment of 

any compensation that may be payable for the degradation of an asset or restricted access to a 

resource because of project activities. Financial allocation for these compensations will be 

provided for in the ESMP, particularly for infrastructure construction or rehabilitation sub-

projects.   

IV. IMPLEMENTATION 

4.1. Implementation Arrangements 

4.1.1 The project will be under the supervisory authority of the Ministry of Rural Development 

(MDR). PROADER will be managed by the existing Steering Committee (COPIL) responsible for 

agricultural and rural sector projects and programmes. COPIL will be expanded to include 

Secretaries-General of the Ministries in charge of Decentralisation, Planning and Land Affairs. 

COPIL shall meet at least twice a year and shall be mandated to: (i) review and approve the annual 

work plans and budgets (AWPBs) prepared by the project; (ii) review half-yearly, annual and mid-

term review and project completion reports; (iii) ensure that the activities of sector-based 

programmes/projects are in line with project objectives; (iv) review progress towards achieving 

project objectives; (v) facilitate the coordination of project activities carried out by the various 

entities involved in the implementation; and (vi) analyse the risks and obstacles related to the 

project implementation and formulate the necessary guidelines for achieving the expected 

outcomes.   

4.1.2 The Project Management Unit (PMU). On the operational front, PROADER will be 

anchored to the Directorate of Rural Economy, whose capacity will be strengthened by the project. 

This Directorate will be strengthened by the establishment of a Project Management Unit that will 

comprise a national coordination unit and three branches covering the three targeted economic 

hubs. To that effect, the Ministry of Rural Development will nominate the following staff: (i) 

Director of Rural Economic, Project Coordinator; (ii) Administrative and Financial Director 

(DAF) of the Ministry of Rural Development; (iii) Accountant; (iv) Monitoring and Evaluation 

Expert; (v) National Expert in Procurement; (vi) Administrative and Financial Assistant; (vii) 

Bookkeeper; and (viii) two drivers.  The qualifications and experience of the nominated staff 

should be prior acceptable by the Bank. The management tools (financial management software, 

database, etc.) that were developed in the context of the PADIR project and are already in use, as 

well as the monitoring and evaluation, financial management and accounting team will be 

capitalised on. The PMU will: (i) ensure inter-sector coordination; (ii) monitor the implementation 

of the recommendations of COPIL deliberations, the recommendations of audit, portfolio review 

and mid-term review reports; and (iii) oversee the fiduciary management of the project and 

undertake all other matters deemed of its competence.   

4.1.3 The PMU team will be strengthened by a project manager with sound knowledge of 

agricultural development and private sector issues, working under the authority of the Director of 

Rural Economy; an accountant and an assistant accountant working under the supervision of the 

Administrative and Financial Directorate (DAF) of the Ministry of Rural Development, a 

procurement expert who will be under the supervision of the Procurement Unit of the Ministry of 

Rural Development, a monitoring and evaluation expert (RPSE) and an IT specialist/database 

manager, a communication expert (RCOM), a skills development and entrepreneurship expert, 

who will also cover the woman’s empowerment component, a rural engineer, an environmental 

and climate change expert, and the necessary support staff (cashier, secretary, drivers, guards, 

etc.). The PMU will work directly with the Technical Directorates of the Ministries involved in 



15 

the project implementation. Each technical directorate will designate a focal point for the 

operational monitoring of the technical implementation of the component falling within its 

jurisdiction.   

4.1.4 Departmental branch offices. Three project branch offices will be established to cover 

the targeted provinces. They will be located in Matadi, Kikwit and Mbuji Mayi. Provincial Rural 

Development Inspectors will be the project focal points in each province. The provincial branches 

will be responsible for: (i) coordinating the project at the provincial level and establishing links 

with local authorities; (ii) developing the annual work plan and budget (AWPB), ensuring the 

monitoring and evaluation of AWPB-related activities at the provincial level and drafting progress 

reports; (iii) providing technical support for the implementation of the project’s technical 

components; (iv) monitoring and ensuring close supervision of the implementation of project 

activities and service providers; (v) participating in the tripartite (Government/private 

sector/producers) evaluation of agreements and service providers’ performance contracts; (vi) 

mobilising actors involved in the implementation of operations; and (vii) developing synergies and 

partnerships across their area of intervention. Each branch office will be headed by a Branch 

Manager and will comprise an expert specialised in one of the three sectors (animal, plant and 

fisheries), a capacity strengthening and gender expert, a decentralisation and local governance 

expert, an accounting assistant, a monitoring officer, a procurement assistant with expertise in 

civil or rural engineering, and support staff.   

 

4.1.5 The Project Manager and technical staff will be recruited based on an open invitation to 

bid, and following the Bank’s opinion concerning the recruitment report. The Secretary-General 

for Rural Development will set up an inter-ministerial recruitment commission for the assessment 

of applications. PMU staff will sign annual contracts, renewable if their performance is deemed 

satisfactory, following the annual evaluation. The evaluation of staff performance will be based on 

the following criteria: (i) disbursement rate; (ii) quality of the implementation of the components; 

(iii) compliance with good governance and transparency requirements; and (iv) the AWPB 

implementation rate. The Project Manager will be evaluated by the Director of Rural Economy, 

while the rest of the staff will be evaluated by the Project Manager.   

4.1.6 Technical assistance and start-up support: The experience and lessons learned from 

project implementation in the DRC highlight three major constraints: (i) delays in project start-up; 

(ii) weakness of implementation teams and operators; and (iii) bureaucracy surrounding the 

procurement process. To accelerate the implementation of PROADER, technical assistance from 

the Department of Rural Economy of the International Labour Office (ILO) in Turin will be 

mobilised. The ILO's technical assistance will focus on the preparation of planning and 

management tools for the rural economy of EDTs targeted in the context of DRC’s 

decentralisation. Therefore, pre-start-up activities should now be initiated. These activities 

include: (i) launching the technical staff recruitment competitive process; (ii) updating the 

administrative, financial and accounting procedures manual and the project implementation, 

monitoring and evaluation manual; (iii) preparing competitive bidding documents for the 

procurement of equipment and materials; (iv) raising awareness among stakeholders and preparing 

the AWPB and the Procurement Plan for the first 18 months of project implementation; (v) 

preparing partnership contracts with private specialised agricultural enterprises and agreements 

with various technical departments and services involved. The implementation of these activities 

can be supported by technical assistance. Expenditures relating to these activities will be 

coordinated by the Secretary-General for Rural Development and covered by PADIR resources. 

Moreover, the Bank, acting through the PADIR and PRISE projects, had recruited technical 

assistance services for procurement and financial management, one of whose missions was to 

build the capacity of national counterparts. Hence, the MDR has competent services and qualified 

financial management and procurement officers. In accordance with the Paris Declaration, these 



16 

structures will support the project in their areas of expertise, to ensure ownership of the project by 

these public entities.    

Arrangements for the Procurement of Goods, Works and Services  

4.1.7 Procurement of all goods and services through international bid invitations, as well as the 

use of consultants financed from Bank resources will be conducted in accordance with the Bank's 

Procurement Policy for Bank Group-Funded Operations, dated October 2015, using appropriate 

standard Bank bidding documents and in accordance with the project financing agreement clauses. 

In accordance with the Bank policy and in the light of several evaluations conducted, it was 

convened that: (a) works for agriculture, rural, social infrastructure and for the rehabilitation of 

administrative building as well as diverse goods, vehicles, and material for project management 

unit, provincial offices and local government offices, will be procured using national procurement 

system as stipulated in law 10/010 of April 2010 for public procurement; (b) all other works and 

goods different from the above will be procured in accordance with Bank’s procurement policy. 

Procurement of goods and works through national bid invitations will be carried out in accordance 

with national procurement legislation, using the country's standard bidding documents and the 

provisions set out in the financing agreement. A procurement plan for the first 18 months was 

prepared by the Government during the appraisal mission and will be regularly updated 

throughout the project implementation period. The procurement arrangements are detailed in the 

technical annex. 

4.1.8 Evaluation of Risks and Capacities in Procurement (ERCA).  In order to take into 

account project specificities, the bank evaluated: (i) the risks at national, sectoral and project 

levels; and (ii) the capacity of the implementing entity.  The results of these evaluations concluded 

that the risk level is substantial for the procurement under the project. Nevertheless, appropriate 

risks mitigation measures have been proposed in the technical appendix to ensure a satisfactory 

project execution.    

4.1.9.   Particular Modalities related to the Utilisation of National System. The use of national 

procurement system requires the setup of particular measures to allow the bank to continue 

ensuring its fiduciary responsibility even in this case.  These measures are described in paragraphs 

B.5.7 of technical appendix B5 and consist of the following aspects: (i) eligibility; (ii) audit of 

public procurement; (iii) complains management; (iv) publication of bid results; (v) control of 

reasonable price; and (vi) reports.    

Financial Management and Disbursement Arrangements  

4.1.10 The Bank's decision on whether to use the national public finance management (PFM) 

system or otherwise was reviewed based on: (i) the assessment of the country's PFM performance; 

(ii) the Bank’s guidelines, practices and risk tolerance; and (iii) other factors such as perception of 

the governance and corruption levels. This review indicates that the level of risk, as assessed under 

CSP 2013-2020, does not allow the Bank to adopt an approach based exclusively on national 

public financial management procedures and systems. However, the reforms initiated by the 

Government have provided the Secretariat General for Rural Development (SGDR) with an 

operational administrative and financial directorate, as per Decree No. 15/043, which 

decentralised public expenditure authorisation centres through the establishment of the 

Administrative and Financial Directorate (DAF). The assessment of the capacity of the Ministry of 

Rural Development was carried out in accordance with the Bank's policy, based on lessons from 

implementing the PADIR and PRISE projects. The fiduciary risk of PROADER’s financial 

management is deemed substantial. The financial management arrangements proposed to support 

the Project Management Unit (PMU) meet the Bank's minimum requirements, as defined by the 

policy on “financial management of projects financed by the African Development Bank”, issued 

in February 2014. The arrangements will help to improve the financial management of the project 



17 

through the risk mitigation measures agreed in the financial management action plan detailed in 

annex. These measures will maintain the fiduciary risk at a moderate level and provide, with 

reasonable assurance, reliable financial information consistent with the Bank's minimum 

requirements. 

4.1.11 The financial management system will rely on the DAF, which will be strengthened with 

the management tools acquired from previous projects, especially from the PADIR project 

currently drawing to a close. At the time of the mission, only the PRISE project regularly 

submitted audit reports deemed acceptable by the Bank. The DAF will be strengthened by 

bringing on board financial staff (accountant, assistant accountant, treasurer) dedicated entirely to 

PROADER. This directorate will oversee financial and accounting operations related to the 

financial and accounting management of the project and will co-sign payment requests and 

documents. This approach allows the Ministry of Rural Development, through the conduct of 

PROADER activities, to mobilise the counterpart resources to be used for local economic 

development, as well as ensure the effective management of external resources. The project will 

contribute to the training of DAF executives in the area of planning/programming and budgeting, 

financial management of development operations, monitoring of audits and financial supervision.   

4.1.12 Annual audits of project loan resources will be performed by the Court of Auditors, 

which will include PROADER's audit missions in its annual work programme. The Court of 

Auditors may be assisted by an external auditor whose recruitment will devolve on the PMU, in 

accordance with the terms of reference in force at the Bank. Audited financial statements will be 

forwarded (see table for frequency) to the Bank latest six months after the close of the fiscal year 

concerned. The capacity of the Court of Auditors will be strengthened to enable it to include audit 

missions of Bank-funded projects in its annual programmes while undertaking to forward reports 

of financial years to the Bank on schedule. A portion of the loan resources will be allocated to 

expenses related to missions that would be carried out for PROADER and other Bank-financed 

projects. The terms of reference of audit missions should be those in force at the Bank, which may 

be used subject to obtaining the Bank’s prior opinion.   

4.1.13 The planned disbursements from the loan resources will be made in accordance with the 

Bank's Disbursement Handbook upon effectiveness of the Loan Agreement and fulfilment of 

conditions precedent to first disbursement. Generally, three methods are used for the disbursement 

of funds at the Bank: (i) the direct payment method; (ii) the working capital or special account 

method; and (iii) the reimbursement method. A disbursement letter specifying project-specific 

disbursement arrangements will be negotiated between the Bank and the Borrower. Two special 

accounts will be opened in Kinshasa, of which one is to receive the loan resources intended for the 

financing of working capital needs and a second one to receive the loan resources intended for the 

financing of community activities. In addition, the Ministry of Finance will authorize the project 

to open sub-account for each PROADER provincial branch.    

4.2.  Monitoring  

4.2.1. The PMU will assume primary responsibility for the internal monitoring of activity 

implementation and the ensuing impacts. It will prepare quarterly and annual progress reports 

focused on the analysis of the technical (outputs, outcomes and impact) and financial outcomes 

relative to the AWPB forecasts and the progress towards achieving the final result. Information 

will be tapped from monitoring and evaluation tools (manual, database of household surveys 

conducted in the context of PADIR with the support of the National Institute of Statistics). 

Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) will include internal monitoring (implementation monitoring), 

external monitoring (outcomes and impact monitoring, and participatory evaluation and planning) 

and should enable the identification of problems, risks and measures taken to mitigate them, and 

the evaluation of the performance of project actors. The implementation manuals and the PADIR 

monitoring and evaluation system (including the manual, the database and the geographic 



18 

information system) will be updated and/or developed to take the specific features of PROADER 

into account.   

4.2.2. Half-yearly external monitoring missions under the leadership of the MDR Secretariat 

General, comprising three to four COPIL members and to whom may be added other experts as 

necessary, will be fielded prior to the holding of COPIL meetings. At the provincial level, under 

the coordination of Provincial Rural Development Inspectorates, quarterly monitoring missions 

will be carried out with the participation of other relevant provincial technical services. These 

missions are intended to review the progress of the project, evaluate its performance and the 

quality of its management and achievements and, if necessary, propose adjustments in 

consultation with the Bank.  All monitoring mission reports should be attached to the project 

progress report. A focal point of the Ministry of Environment in Kinshasa will be involved in the 

coordination of environmental and social safeguard activities. In addition to the close monitoring 

that will be carried out by the Bank's Country Office in the DRC (COCD), the Bank will also keep 

an eye on the project through half-yearly supervision missions leading to the preparation of aide-

memoires, reports on implementation progress and results (IPR), using the Bank’s template. These 

aide-memoires and IPR reports will be used to rate the overall project performance and conduct 

the project’s annual external technical and financial audits. 

4.3. Governance  

4.3.1. According to the 2017 Mo Ibrahim Index of African Governance (IIAG), the DRC 

ranked 47th out of 54 countries, with a score of 32.1 out of 100. Scoring 20 on a scale ranging 

from 0 (very corrupt) to 100 (very clean), the DRC ranked 161st out of 180 countries in 

Transparency International’s 2018 global Corruption Perception Index, representing a loss of 2 

spots compared with the 2015 raking. In addition, according to the Bank's Country Policy and 

Institutional Assessment (CPIA), the country's overall governance rating stagnated at 3.2 between 

2013 and 2015, before declining to 3.1 in 2016 and 3.07 in 2018. The public finance management 

reform process initiated since 2008 has led to: (i) the adoption of a Public Finance Reform 

Strategic Plan and a Public Finance Organic Law (LOFIP) introducing the results-based budget 

system; and (ii) the setting up of a Steering Committee for Public Finance Reform (COREF).   

4.3.2. The risks of poor governance related to this project mainly concern the procurement and 

implementation process. This risk will be mitigated by: (i) the presence of a senior procurement 

expert in the Project Management Unit (PMU) and three procurement assistants at the provincial 

branch offices; (ii) the holding of information, training and technical assistance sessions with the 

PMU, decentralised territorial entities and procurement committees, to allow better ownership of 

the Bank's procurement procedures; (iii) the existence of an administrative, financial and 

accounting procedures manual and a community procurement manual; (iv) ex-ante or ex-post 

control of the different stages of the procurement process; and (v) supervision and financial audits 

of the project. Furthermore, the DRC Country Office (COCD) will provide continuous support in 

procurement, contract and financial management. In addition, the participatory approach to local 

development with the involvement of ETDs, the private sector, non-governmental organisations 

and beneficiaries in the steering and implementation of activities will promote citizen control, 

thereby guaranteeing good governance.   

4.4. Sustainability  

4.4.1. The probability of sustaining and even scaling up the project’s gains in the long term is 

high. The sensitivity tests of the economic and financial analysis show that the project remains 

profitable despite the fall in profits, the escalation of input prices and the drop in commodity 

prices. The sustainability of investments and expected benefits is based on the existence of an 

institutional framework for rural infrastructure piloting and management, as well as participatory 

and entrepreneurial capacity-building approaches. Regarding rural infrastructure, especially rural 



19 

roads, there is a maintenance mechanism that depends on financing from the road maintenance 

fund and on local road maintenance committees (CLERs) for manual repair works, while 

monitoring is ensured by the Directorate of Agricultural Road Roads and the empowerment of 

decentralised territorial entities. Thus, PROADER will support this institutional arrangement by 

providing CLERs with road maintenance equipment and by assisting them in establishing small- 

and medium-sized labour-intensive enterprises. These road maintenance arrangements remain 

valid for all infrastructure built under this project. In collaboration with the ETDs, the project will 

support the establishment of a sustainable management and maintenance mechanism for each 

infrastructure provided, based on the promotion of micro-, small- and medium-sized maintenance 

enterprises. This principle will strengthen local governance and the sustainability of project 

achievements, thus enabling ETDs to play their roles in land-use planning and the inclusive 

management of the structures. ETDs will be strengthened to improve resource mobilisation. In this 

regard, all sub-projects carried out under the project will be selected through a participatory 

process, involving ETDs, economic actors and producer organisations of the relevant production 

basins at the local level. In addition, the development of public-private-producer partnerships with 

the participation of specialised private agricultural enterprises located and operating in the targeted 

production basins, the structuring and professionalisation of organisations and players in value 

chains based on an expressed request will help ensure the ownership and use of the infrastructure.   

4.5. Risk Management  

4.5.1. The main risks that the project could face are: (i) vulnerability to climate change; (ii) low 

sustainability of the infrastructure set up; (iii) reluctance on the part of public entities regarding the 

empowerment of ETDs; (iv) bad governance; and (v) poor knowledge of gender issues by actors 

and their impact on the performance of household activities. To mitigate these risks, the following 

measures will be taken: (a) dissemination of smart farming technologies (community agroforestry, 

short-cycle and attack-resistant seeds, etc.); (b) establishment of a local infrastructure maintenance 

mechanism with the empowerment of ETDs, private agricultural enterprises, small- and medium-

sized enterprises, cooperatives and producer associations; (c) dissemination of legislation on 

decentralisation and capacity building for public entities; (d) strengthening of citizen control with 

the empowerment of beneficiaries and economic actors in the planning, implementation and 

project output management process, and raising of stakeholder awareness of the available 

remedies; and (e) gender mainstreaming in local planning strategies and raising of household 

awareness on the benefits of gender mainstreaming. Residual management risks will be minimised 

through competitive recruitment of staff and partners and preparation of annual performance 

contracts, renewable based on good performance, as well as capacity building of project 

management teams at the different levels.  

4.6. Knowledge Building 

4.6.1. As part of knowledge management effort, an electronic library will be set up for the 

storage of all relevant documents on the agricultural sector, best practices, local knowledge and 

innovations. The library will be accessible to stakeholders and the public. This activity will be 

developed as part of the institutional support for the Studies and Planning Directorate (DEP) of the 

Ministry of Agriculture. The communication tools and resources will be shared with other projects 

in the agricultural sector, including the Youth Entrepreneurship in Agriculture and Agri-Business 

Project (PEJAB) and the Agricultural Value Chains Development Support Project in Six DRC 

Provinces (PADCA-6P). Mechanisms will be developed for communication between the players 

involved upstream and downstream of the targeted value chains. The knowledge generated by the 

project will help to inform policy dialogue on topics that may affect the improvement of the local 

economic environment, support and improve the design of new projects.

Appendix IV- Key Drivers of Fragility and Sources of Resilience of the DRC  

The corridor targeted by PROADIER, including the central region, is one of the areas most 

severely affected by the humanitarian crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo. In April 2017, 

five provinces in this central region were deeply affected by the high levels of insecurity, 

stemming from interethnic tensions and clashes between armed groups. In 2017, the humanitarian 

crisis in the DRC worsened and spread, affecting people in this area previously considered stable, 

and undermining the resilience of people who were victimised by the previous crisis. The DRC 

recently became the African country most severely affected by population movements, with 1.7 

million new IDPs in 2017, bringing the total number of IDPs to 4.3 million, 52% of them women 

(as of 30 November 2018).   

In the Kassaï Provinces, there are areas, albeit isolated, where the risks of resurgence of inter-

community tensions are still present. More than 102,000 conflict-affected persons are in need of 

non-food items, shelter and tools, and 400,000 children are at risk of dying from severe acute 

malnutrition. According to official sources, between 1 October 2018 and 31 January 2019, 

402,300 Congolese nationals returned from Angola. National data validated by the Directorate 

General of Migration (DGM) show that 300,365 voluntary returnees and 101,935 deportees were 

received in five provinces of the DRC: Kasaï, Kasaï Central, Kwango, Kongo Central and 

Lualaba. During this period, 28,563 people crossed the border at a rate averaging about 635 per 

day. In addition, deportees account for 84% of returnees, with 50% of them transiting through 

Kwango Province. Given the sensitivity of the context, there is a need to carry out community 

activities in order to promote social cohesion through: (i) the active and participatory 

involvement of local communities in implementation activities; (ii) harmonisation of intervention 

procedures and targeting criteria; (iii) front-end analysis of the risks and issues related to the “do 

no harm” principle.    

 
Key Drivers of Fragility Main Sources Resilience 

Political, Institutional and Security Factors 

 

*Pockets of insecurity in the eastern and central parts of 

the country with the proliferation of armed groups; 

*Relative political stability that may be undermined 

despite the holding of the elections;  

*Various dysfunctionalities characterised by: (i) weak 

capacity; (ii) public services run by staff that are ageing 

but not replaced; (iii) incomplete decentralisation; and 

(iv) lack of independence of the judiciary and high 

levels of corruption; (v) high levels of human rights 

violations.   

Huge potential for renewable natural resources, especially 

forest and water resources 

 

 

The country abounds in rich and varied natural resources 

whose rational exploitation offers a real opportunity for 

sustainable development and green growth promotion. It 

has a forest cover of about 1.5 million km², water resources 

of 19,967/m3/year/inhabitant, an estimated hydropower 

potential of 100,000 MGW and a wide range of mineral 

resources (over 1,100 minerals and precious metals listed).   

 

Economic Factors 

 

* Undiversified economy, exposed to external shocks; 

* Unattractive business environment and undeveloped 

financial system; 

* Low tax revenue mobilisation capacity;  

*Lack of economic infrastructure (energy, transport, 

agriculture, ICT). 

 

Vast industrialisation potential of the agricultural and 

energy sector  

 

 

The development of the country's agricultural potential 

could accelerate the transformation of agriculture. 

Agricultural land is estimated at about 80 million hectares, 

of which barely 10% is farmed annually. The climatic and 

ecological conditions are very conducive to the farming of 

various crops, including export crops. 



VI 

 

Social Factors 
* Low human development levels, high poverty, 

inequality and unemployment levels, especially among 

young people and women; 

*Lack of social infrastructure (health, education, water); 

*Persistence of gender inequalities and gender-based 

violence; 

*Large population displacements as a result of the armed 

conflict and possible instigation of ethnic and 

community tensions. 

Privileged Geographical Position  

 

The DRC has 9 neighbouring countries and is at the meeting 

point of five regional economic communities. This position 

is a major asset for the country’s development and offers it 

enormous potential for trade with several countries if 

multisector interconnections are organised. 

Environmental Factors (Climate Change and Related 

Risks) 

 

*High deforestation levels in the Congo Basin, frequent 

floods and low resilience of communities to climate 

change; 

*Significant mercury emissions from artisanal mining 

activities, representing a major risk to human health. 

Environmental Factors  

 

Given that the project area is part of the Congo Basin, it can 

contribute to climate change mitigation through the 

restoration of forest landscapes, reduction of emissions from 

deforestation and forest degradation, and climate finance. It 

can also create opportunities for green growth through 

sustainable development of targeted sectors (energy, 

agriculture, etc.).

PROJECT SUMMARY 

1. Project Overview: 
 

1.1 The Sierra Leone Agribusiness and Rice Value Chain Support Project (SLARiS) aims 

to stimulate a viable upstream agribusiness sector in Sierra Leone in order to promote economic 

diversification, food security, sustainable employment opportunities and improved livelihoods. 

These are all key identified priorities of the New Direction Agenda and the Medium Term 

National Development Plan of the Government of Sierra Leone. The development goal of the 

project is to promote domestic agribusiness focusing on priority agricultural value chains which 

will serve as sustainable and inclusive business opportunities targeted at enhancing production 

and productivity to improve the livelihoods of men and women beneficiaries. The project will 

primarily focus on the rice value chain which is the staple food in Sierra Leone. It will also 

support the emergence of maize and livestock as secondary value chains which have the strong 

potential of meeting domestic food demands, import substitution, improving nutrition and 

farmers’ income. The SLARiS project which will be executed in the identified high potential 

agro-ecological zones in the country (specifically Kambia, Kenema and Moyamba) will be 

implemented over a period of five (5) years (2019 – 2024). The project comprises three (3) 

components namely: a) Support to Enhancement of Agricultural Input Production & 

Distribution Systems; b) Support to Agribusiness Development; and c) Institutional capacity 

development and Project Management. The total project cost is UA 8.52 million with an ADF 

Grant of UA 7.99 million (93.8%) and Government of Sierra Leone (GoSL) contribution of 

UA 0.53 million (6.2%). The project benefits from parallel co-financing from the Islamic 

Development Bank (USD 34.12 million) and the International Fund for Agricultural 

Development (USD 11.2 million) 

  

2. Needs Assessment:  
 

2.1. Sierra Leone is food insecure, with over half the population (i.e. more than 3.5 million 
people) lacking access to sufficient amounts of safe and nutritious food. The Global Hunger 

Index 2018 ranked Sierra Leone as the sixth hungriest country in the world, with an estimated 

35.7% of the population undernourished. These households are exposed to acute fragility and 

unable to cope with socio-economic and environmental shocks such as drought, floods and 

fluctuating food prices. Importation of staple foods such as rice and maize are high due to the 

inability to meet market demand through domestic production. According to the Ministry of 

Agriculture and Forestry, the total rice demand was 1,600,000 metric tons in 2018. In contrast, 

local production was only 700,000 metric tons, with the balance imported from international 

markets. The annual cost of rice imports (including seeds and grains) alone stands at about 

USD 250 million. Similarly about 20,000 metric tons (40 % of total demand) of maize is 

imported into Sierra Leone annually, which is closely associated with equally high importation 

of poultry products as the main ingredient in animal feed is maize.  

 

2.2 Despite the huge potentials of the country’s agriculture, the sector has not been able to 

attain national food and nutritional security, and generate of decent employment opportunities 

for the country’s bulging youth population. The seemingly lacklustre performance of the 

agricultural sector in Sierra Leone is the result of a combination of weak public policy and 

institutions, limited infrastructure, and failures in both the input and output markets. These 

greatly impede the sector’s productivity growth, and its capacity to support the country’s 

poverty reduction and youth employment generation efforts. Specifically production and 

productivity are constrained by low use of improved technologies particularly agricultural 

inputs (e.g. improved seed varieties, fertilizers and pesticides), low levels of value chain 

integration mainly due to inefficient systems that undercut competitiveness, limited access to 



 

v 

 

agricultural finance and a weak enabling environment. Sierra Leone’s dependency on food 

imports and food aid exacts dire socio-economic consequences on the economy and is 

unsustainable. Economic diversification to promote domestic agricultural production and 

productivity is therefore imperative. This is critical to ending hunger and enhancing food 

security as per the Sustainable Development Goals, improving economic growth, social 

welfare, livelihoods and job creation as well as building resilience to shocks.  

 

2.3 The rationale for this project is premised on the fact that Sierra Leone is endowed with 
agro-ecological conditions and water resources to support a vibrant agricultural sector. There 

is significant opportunity for growth in the agribusiness sector across the value chain. 

Furthermore, Sierra Leone’s Medium Term National Development Plan (2019-2023), the 

National Strategic Agriculture Development Plan (NSADP) (2010-2030) which is Sierra 

Leone’s in-country version of the Comprehensive African Agriculture Development 

Programme (CAADP) and the recently launched National Agriculture Transformation Strategy 

(NATS) (2019-2023) evidence clear commitment by the Government of Sierra Leone to 

diversify its economy from its dependence on mining through promoting investments to 

strengthen the agriculture sector and thereby increase its contribution to the national economy. 

Expanding the agribusiness sector will also assist the Government of Sierra Leone to tackle the 

major challenge of youth unemployment in the country (estimated at 60%) which remains an 

important source of fragility. The project will seek to create new jobs to ensure socio-economic 

empowerment, particularly amongst the youth and women by supporting them along the value 

chain. 

 

3. Bank’s Value Added: 
 

3.1 The Bank’s comparative advantage and added value in the project are derived from its 

accumulated expertise and experience in funding agriculture and agribusiness projects in 

various Regional Member Countries (RMCs). The SLARiS project will provide opportunities 

to capitalize on the Bank’s experience in supporting public sector enabled and private sector 

led growth of agricultural value chains and on the gains of past projects in the Mano-River 

Union region, other ECOWAS countries and across the continent. Lessons were drawn from 

extensive continent-wide analysis carried out under the Technologies for African Agricultural 

Transformation (TAAT) and its associated TAAT-Savanah, the Continental Investment 

Program on Rice Self Sufficiency in Africa (CiPRISSA) and the African Agricultural Seed 

Index (TASAI) program as well as various investment operations in Gambia, Ghana, Guinea-

Bissau, Senegal and Zambia. 

 

4. Knowledge Management:  
 

4.1 The project will support research and knowledge development in collaboration with the 
Sierra Leone Agricultural Research Institute (SLARI), AfricaRice and Njala University to 

develop: i) an effective agricultural input system; (ii) innovative crop production techniques 

for rice and maize in the presence of soil challenges; (iii) the emergence of a robust maize value 

chain with strong linkages to the livestock industry; and (iv) support the growth of horticulture. 

The knowledge generated from the research will be disseminated amongst farmers for better 

productivity at the farm level, agro-dealers and agribusiness actors. Additionally, this project 

will implement the ENABLE-Njala Youth Empowerment Model which is an innovative 

initiative combining research, integrated farming systems with business incubator and 

accelerator systems. These experiences will be documented and could be useful in the design 

of other youth in agribusiness development projects. Finally, collaborative knowledge 

development will enhance the systemic development of capacity in agriculture university 

faculties in Sierra Leone.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF MANAGEMENT TO THE BOARD OF 

DIRECTORS ON THE PROPOSED ADF GRANT TO THE REPUBLIC OF SIERRA 

LEONE FOR THE SIERRA LEONE AGRIBUSINESS AND RICE VALUE CHAIN 

SUPPORT PROJECT (SLARIS) 

 

Management hereby submits this Report and Recommendation for an ADF grant of UA7.99 million 

from the African Development Fund to the Government of Sierra Leone to finance the Sierra Leone 

Agribusiness and Rice Value Chain Support Project. 

I. STRATEGIC THRUST & RATIONALE 

1.1 Project linkages with Country Strategy and Objectives 

1.1.1 Rice is by far the most important crop in the food economy of Sierra Leone. With an average 
annual per capita consumption of about 131 kg which is one of the highest in the world, rice is 

synonymous with food and constitutes a larger portion of total food intake than any other cereal. In 

fact, in rural areas of Sierra Leone, rice provides up to 75% of total calorie intake. Sierra Leone was 

a net rice exporter in the 1970s and the country still retains its agro-ecological competitive advantage 

to satisfy domestic requirements for food and to increase incomes for smallholders. However, 

limitation to domestic production continue to exist principally as a result of unfavourable policies 

and insufficient access to (i) quality agricultural inputs (seed, fertilizer and pesticides) (ii) improved 

production technology and capabilities and (iii) affordable finance. The total area under rice 

cultivated in Sierra Leone is about 530,000 hectares produces an average of 700,000 metric tons/year 

(compared to an estimated annual milled-rice requirement of 1,600,000 metric tons), which 

corresponds to a very low yield of 1.3 tons/ha. Presently, there is a sharp decline in the incomes of 

farmers due to importation of rice which puts heavy stress on the country’s foreign exchanges (annual 

rice import bill averages about USD 250 million). Rapid population growth, coupled with the 

escalating rural-urban migration, and environmental degradation pose serious threats to food security 

in the country.  

 

1.1.2 The proposed project is well aligned with Sierra Leone’s Medium Term National 
Development Plan (MTNDP) (2019 – 2023). The MTNDP articulates agriculture as one of the 

primary drivers of economic diversification and inclusive economic development. At the sector level, 

the project is in accordance the National Strategic Agriculture Development Plan (NSADP) (2010-

2030) which is Sierra Leone’s in-country version of the Comprehensive African Agriculture 

Development Programme (CAADP). It is also consistent with the recently launched National 

Agricultural Transformation Strategy NATS (2018- 2023) which focuses on developing agricultural 

value chains, making available improved inputs (seeds, fertilizers, pesticides and machinery), 

increasing productivity and production, and establishing crops and livestock processing zones across 

the country. The Strategy prioritises four components, namely: rice self-sufficiency, livestock 

development, crop diversification and bio-diversity management. It strengthens three enablers that 

include: improvement of the policy environment, promoting women and youth in agriculture, and 

setting up of private-sector-led mechanisation. Implementation of the NATS is expected to address 

low productivity, improve linkages with industry and access to financial services and markets. The 

approach also targets urban, peri-urban and rural communities particularly women and the youth as 

well as improved institutions and infrastructure aimed at revitalising rural communities.  

 

 

1.1.3 The project is consistent with the Bank’s Country Strategy Paper (CSP) for Sierra Leone 
(2013 – 2017, extended to 2019) through its Pillar 1: Enhancing Economic Governance and 

Transparent Management of Natural Resources Revenue. During the CSP Mid-Term Review in July 

2016 it was decided to place more emphasis on sub-pillar 3 of Pillar 1 which deals with enabling 

business environment and private sector development, in order to enhance pay-off in deepening the 



 

2 

 

inclusive growth agenda of the strategy. Pillar 1 was specifically re-focused to emphasize private 

sector development, agribusiness and agro-processing.  The project is well aligned to sub-pillar 3 of 

pillar I of the strategy. 

1.2 Rationale for Fund’s involvement 

1.2.1 The agriculture sector in Sierra Leone is important for employment (70% of the national 

labour force), income (more than 40% of GDP) and as a source of food and nutrition. The climate 

and ecological conditions are highly favourable for agriculture. Rice is the single most important 

commodity in Sierra Leonean agriculture mainly because it is the staple food of the local diet. Nearly 

85% of Sierra Leonean farmers grow rice and it is also dominant in terms of cultivated area, volume 

produced and contribution to farm income. More than 5.4 million hectares of arable bolilands, 

mangroves, inland valley swamps, and riverine grasslands are suitable for growing rice and other 

crops. Yet only 10% of these fertile, diverse lowlands are under cultivation. Rice farming is 

dominated by smallholder farmers with average land holdings of 0.5-2.0 hectares and a few medium 

to large scale producers. 

1.2.2 Sierra Leone was self-sufficient in rice production in the 1950s and even exported rice within 

the Mano River Union region in the 1970s. However the onset of the civil war in the 1980s dealt a 

heavy blow to all sectors of the economy. In the case of agriculture, production was seriously 

undermined, agricultural extension services were handicapped and distribution of food disrupted by 

insecurity and lack of mobility resulting in severe food shortages. With the exception of the decline 

caused by the outbreak of the Ebola Virus Epidemic in 2014/2015, the Sierra Leonean economy has 

exhibited strong post-civil war recovery. Yet despite these gains in the agriculture sector continue to 

lag in performance. Over the years Sierra Leone unable to meet local demand through domestic 

production has become a net importer of food and major importer of rice, wheat flour, sugar and 

poultry. Importation of these four commodities consumes an average of $ 700 million of the country’s 

foreign exchange annually. Rice imports alone account for 14.3% and has been on the increase over 

the past decade. Current domestic rice output is 700,000 metric tons compared to total domestic 

demand of 1,600,000 metric tons (approximately 42.9% rice self-sufficiency). The national demand 

for rice is expected to increase to an estimated 2,130,000 metric tons by 2025. Locally produced rice 

is not only more nutritious but also attracts a 15% to 20% premium over comparable grades of 

imported rice. Rising population and domestic demand for local rice presents a viable opportunity 

for investment in domestic rice production. 

1.2.3 Three critical constraints to on-farm productivity in Sierra Leone were identified as access to 

inputs including finance, improved technologies and access to markets. The supply of improved seeds 

fertilizer, agrochemicals and animal feeds is below current demand and far below potential demand. 

According to data collected in the 2015 Comprehensive Food Security and Vulnerability Assessment, 

the most commonly constraint cited by farmers to increasing agricultural production was the 

unavailability of improved seeds. The continuous involvement of Government in the production, 

procurement and distribution of seeds, fertilizers and other agro-inputs to the farmers at non-

competitive market prices is a major disincentive to private sector involvement in agricultural 

transformation that ought to be government-enabled and private sector-led. It is estimated that only 

5% of farmers in Sierra Leone have access to improved seeds varieties. Furthermore, agricultural 

input distribution systems are weak with a ratio of 1 agro-dealer for every 17,033 agricultural 

households in Sierra Leone. Addressing these constraints will improve production and productivity, 

and the latter will lead to better incentives for producing improved food availability, employment 

(particularly for the youth and women) and higher household incomes. 

1.2.4 With the recent volatility in iron prices, the need to diversify the economic base of Sierra 

Leone becomes ever more compelling. Sustainable reductions in poverty will depend on key sectors, 

particularly agriculture, which employs the majority of the population, especially in rural areas. The 



 

3 

 

renewed focus will be to transform the largely subsistence low-input, low-output agriculture into a 

more productive and commercialized system capable of creating gainful employment as a basis for 

broad-based poverty reduction. The project will promote agricultural transformation by supporting 

the emergence of competitive agribusinesses in the agricultural input supply sector.  It will incite the 

development of a private sector driven agricultural input (seeds, fertilizer and pesticides) production 

and distribution which is key to ensuring the timely availability of high-quality of improved, 

appropriate products at affordable prices for commercial and smallholder farmers in Sierra Leone. 

Furthermore, the project will provide support to national institutions and policymakers to create and 

maintain enabling environments that will accelerate the development of competitive formal input 

systems to adequately farmers. 

 

1.2.5 Rice has been selected as the initial crop that this project will focus on because there is strong 

domestic demand for it along with consumer preference. While maize will be the secondary crop due 

its market potential and linkage to the livestock and fisheries industries through its use in the 

production of animal feed.  The project will therefore promote inclusive economic development by 

targeting areas where rice and maize farming is already being practiced but has not been taken to its 

full economic and business potentials. To this end, the project will serve as a bridge between the 

existing major players and medium to small scale producers through supporting out-growers scheme 

with technical assistance. The project seeks to ensure socio economic empowerment, increase the 

involvement of both genders in the advancement of the agribusiness sector in Sierra Leone; create 

conditions for equitable access by men and women to project resources and increase decision-making 

for women along the agricultural value chain. Project interventions will thus deliberately target 

women and youth as beneficiaries and provide opportunities to increasing household income levels. 

 

1.2.6 The project activities are closely aligned to the Bank’s Country Strategy Paper as it will 

induce a great level of private sector participation in the sector’s development and overall economy 

at large. Furthermore, the project is consistent with the Bank Group’s policies and strategies including 

the Ten Year Strategy (2013-22) and the High Five Priority Areas particularly Feed Africa, and 

Improve the Quality of Life of Africans. It supports the Bank’s Strategies for African Agricultural 

Transformation (2016-2025) and Jobs for Youth in Africa (2016-2025) as well as the Strategy for 

Addressing Fragility and Building Resilience in Africa (2014-2019). The project is also firmly rooted 

in the Bank’s main agriculture flagship programs focused improving agricultural productivity 

through technology dissemination and scaling (TAAT, TAAT-S and PHAP), enhancing resilience to 

climate change through climate-smart agriculture and promoting youth empowerment (ENABLE 

Youth). Finally, the proposed project is line with the Bank’s Regional Integration Strategy 

Framework 2018-2025 (Pillar 2: Trade and Investment, which also includes the “Agricultural 

Transformation”) and the CCAP of the Bank for promoting climate-resilient agriculture. 

1.3 Donor Coordination 

1.3.1 Sierra Leone continues to be highly dependent on external development assistance. The Bank 

engages in dialogue with Development Partners under the guidance of the aid effectiveness principles 

embodied in the Paris Declaration, Accra Agenda for Action and Sustainable Development Goal No. 

17 - strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable 

development. The main DPs active in the agriculture sector include the AfDB, the World Bank (WB), 

the IsDB, the IFAD, the FAO and WFP. The Presidential Taskforce on Agriculture chaired by the 

President of the Republic of Sierra Leone and comprised of the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, 

other relevant Ministers and heads of DPs active in the agricultural sector is the main decision-

making body and coordination mechanism in the sector. In addition, an Agriculture Advisory Group, 

comprising DPs, private sector and others, provides technical support to program implementation. 

The Bank is an active participant in the DP Group and other diverse micro and thematic advisory 

groups including the National Rice Working Group.

1.3.2 This project is the outcome of extensive consultations with DPs in the agricultural sector. It 

benefits from parallel co-financing from the IsDB (USD 34.12 million) and IFAD (USD 11.8 

million). The SLARiS project will focus on optimizing the agricultural input supply system which 

would feed into the IsDB financed Rice Value Chain Development Project (RVCDP) and the IFAD 

financed Agricultural Value Chain Development Project (AVDP) both of which target upstream 

production and value addition. 

II. PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
 

2.1 Project Components 
2.1.1 The overall goal of the project is to stimulate a viable upstream agribusiness sector in Sierra 

Leone in order to promote economic diversification, food security, sustainable employment 

opportunities and improved livelihoods.  The specific project objective is to transform the agricultural 

input supply sub-sector as a viable and inclusive business opportunity, in order to promote enhanced 

production and productivity required to improve the livelihoods of beneficiaries along priority value 

chains (rice and maize).  
 

2.1.2 This objective would be achieved through: a) support and promotion of reliable access to 

quality input markets (seeds, fertilizers and pesticides) through liberalisation, adequate regulation 

and certification of the sub-sector sector which in turn is expected to facilitate the entry of new actors 

and expansion of business opportunities by the existing players; b) creation of an enabling 

environment for private sector led agribusiness growth upstream in the value chain through support 

to the emergence and growth of private seed producers and agri-input (seeds, fertilizers and 

pesticides) agro-dealers;  c) empowering young men and women to engage in the agriculture sector; 

d) supporting growth in farmer efficiency, productivity and income through providing improved 

technologies, climate-smart farming techniques, innovations and good agricultural practices; and e) 

increasing reliable output market through strengthening outgrower farming models. 
 

2.1.3 The project consists of the following components: (1) Support to Enhancement of 

Agricultural Input Production & Distribution Systems; (2) Support to Agribusiness Development; 

and (3) Project Management and Institutional Capacity Development.

2.2 Technical solutions retained and other alternatives explored  

2.2.1 The technical solutions which were retained comprises of a multipronged approach based on 

government creating an enabling environment to drive domestic private sector production and 

distribution of agricultural input supply for farmers in order to increase production and productivity 

in the targeted value chains. In addition, the youth empowerment scheme under the project 

encapsulates technical training as well as practical skills in agriculture and agribusiness activities. 

Two alternatives to the investment approach were considered and rejected are as follows: 
 

Table 2.2: Project Alternatives Considered and Reasons for Rejection 

 

2.3 Project Type 

2.3.1 This intervention is designed in the form of a stand-alone Investment Project with the main 

aim of up-scaling production and productivity and reducing imports of rice and maize through 

provision of agribusiness development, technical assistance and capacity building. 

2.4 Project cost and financing arrangements  

2.4.1 Project Costs: The total cost of the project is estimated at UA 8.52 million (USD 11.93 

million), net of taxes and customs duties, and based on 2019 prices, comprising  36.29% of the total 

cost in foreign cost, and 63.71 % in local costs. The project cost comprises an ADF grant of UA 7.99 

million (USD 11.19 million) (93.8 %) and GoSL in-kind contribution of UA 0.53 million (USD 0.74 

million) (6.2%). This cost is inclusive of physical and price contingencies estimated at average rates 

of 6% and 7% respectively. The price contingencies were estimated on the basis of actual and 

projected levels of local and foreign inflation rates of about 5.5% and 2.2% per annum, respectively. 

The physical contingencies are estimated from 0 to 15%. The ADF grant contribution to the project 

cost exceeds the threshold of 90% stipulated by the Policy on Expenditures Eligible for Bank Group 
Financing. This is justified by evident commitment to the project exhibited by the GOSL which is a 

transition state confronted with budget constraints in the face of significant development challenges.  

A summary of the project cost estimates by components and expenditure accounts is shown in Tables 

2.3, 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6 below, while details are provided in the Technical Annexes – Volume II of the 

appraisal report. 
  

Alternative name Brief description Reasons for rejection 

Alternative 1 Support the development of 

special agro-industrial 

processing zones in Sierra Leone  

Currently the level of agricultural productivity and 

production of priority crops is too low to sustain a 

viable SAPZ. This could be considered for future 

projects. 

 

Alternative 2 Focus AfDB financing on 

infrastructure development of 

feeder roads in the same area at 

the IsDB project 

Better value for money would be derived from 

available AfDB allocation by financing the 

establishment of a viable private sector led 

agricultural input supply system, agribusiness 

enhancement and youth development compared to 

a purely infrastructure investment in feeder roads.

2.5 Project’s target area and population  

2.5.1 Project Areas: The project interventions will be implemented in the high agricultural 

production potential zones of Kobia and Rokupr (Kambia), Kenema (Kenema) and Njala (Moyamba) 

Districts. These areas were selected following initial technical recommendations and also after the 

stakeholder consultations based on the criteria of: (i) potential for successful rice and maize 

production; (ii) market proximity; (iii) population and poverty incidence; and (iv)ability to build 

synergies with parallel co-financed investments of other development partners particularly the IsDB 

and IFAD. 

 

2.5.2 Project Beneficiaries: The estimated number of direct beneficiaries is about 32,000 farmers 

in the high potential targeted regions/zones. In addition, 1000 young agri-preneurs and 4000 young 

graduates (disaggregated by age and gender) will benefit from the incubation program and the new 

agribusiness training curriculum respectively. The project will create approximately 50,000 direct 

jobs and improve the lives of 150,000 indirect beneficiaries. 

2.6 Participatory process for project identification, design and implementation 

2.6.1 The Project was conceived following GoSL request to the AfDB to support a Rice Value 

Chain Development Project in 2018. On the strength of this formal request, the Bank fielded a project 

identification mission between 21 and 26 September 2018, followed subsequently by a preparation 

mission from 21 to 30 January 2019. An appraisal mission was mounted between 18 and 29 March 

2019 to fine-tune the project. The proposed project is the result of wide and detailed consultations 

with the various stakeholders including the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Ministry of Trade 

and Industry, Ministry of Youth, National Youth Commission, Ministry of Social Welfare, Gender 



 

9 

 

and Children’s Affairs, Ministry of Technical and Higher Education, Sierra Leone Agricultural 

Research Institute, Sierra Leone Seed Certification Agency, the Seed Multiplication Program, private 

sector actors including seed companies, animal feed millers, the Sierra Leone Chamber for 

Agribusiness Development, the Environmental Protection Agency, various Commercial Banks, and 

wide range of Development Partners (IFAD, IsDB, FAO, EU, WFP and WB). Apart from bilateral 

and focus-group meetings, a stakeholder consultative workshop which brought together 

representatives of the various stakeholders of the project was also organised during the appraisal 

mission. 

2.6.2 In effect, the project design and its listed activities were the outcome of broad-based 

consultations (meetings, discussions and workshops) with all the stakeholders who expressed their 

views on what the project should aimed at achieving. This participatory and consultative process 

clearly identified lack of quality inputs (particularly seeds), technologies and finance as three key 

challenges to the development of the agriculture sector. The components of the project were therefore 

designed to address the problems identified during consultations. The participatory process will 
continue throughout program implementation to ensure ownership and sustainability. 

2.7 Bank Group experience, lessons reflected in project design  

2.7.1 The Bank’s ongoing portfolio comprised a total of 18 operations, with a total commitment of 

UA 129.49 million (Annex 1). In terms of sector distribution, infrastructure accounts for 89.12% of 

the total portfolio, of which energy, transport, water and sanitation account for 45.14%, 20.48% and 

34.38% respectively. Although the Bank was previously active in the agriculture sector having 

funded 8 operations and studies since inception, there is currently no active agriculture project in the 

portfolio. The 2018 Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR) assessed the overall performance 

of the portfolio as satisfactory, with a rating of 2.96 on a scale from 1 to 4. Implementation progress 

(IP) was rated 2.93, while average development objective (DO) was rated 3.0 indicating that the 

ongoing operations have high likelihood of meeting their development objectives. There is no project 

at risk. The overall supervision rating is Non-PP/Non-PPP. The Country Policy and Institutional 

Assessment (CPIA) rating is 3.2 for 2014 (3rd Quintile). There is no Project Completion Report (PCR) 

backlog for closed Projects. Nevertheless, the CPPR highlighted challenges in existing project 

implementation including procurement, contract and financial management and results monitoring 

and evaluation. The CPPR recommended that the Bank should continue improving portfolio quality 

ensuring higher quality at entry of project, providing regular fiduciary clinics to project management 

agencies and increasing the use of country systems where possible.  

 

2.7.2 The Bank has accumulated notable experience in the implementation of agriculture sector 

projects in Sierra Leone. Although the last agriculture project closed in 2013, previous agricultural 

projects funded by the Bank include the Torma Bum Rice Development Project, the Moyamba 

Integrated Rural Development Project, the Northern Integrated Agricultural Development Project, 

the Artisanal Fisheries Development Project, the NERICA Rice Dissemination Project and the 

Agricultural Sector Rehabilitation Project. The Bank has gained useful experiences from its on-going 

and previous operations across various sectors in the country. The lessons garnered from these design 

and implementation experiences as well as the CPPR have been duly incorporated into this project.

2.8 Key performance indicators  

2.8.1. The project’s key performance indicators to be measured throughout the project life are 

presented in the Results Based Logical Framework. The M&E expert of the PMU will carry out 

internal project monitoring and evaluation in collaboration with MAF to monitor performance. 

Regular implementation progress will be measured through Quarterly Progress Reports, bi-annual 

Bank supervision missions (by Headquarters and CoSL), and annual technical and financial audits. 

The main indicators defined for monitoring the program outputs, outcomes and impact include: (i) 

poverty reduction; (ii) improved incomes; (iii) reduction in food imports; (iv) improvement in seed 

quantity and quality; (v) number of young men and women agripreneurs trained; (vi) number of youth 

and women led agribusinesses established; (vii) improvement in market linkages; and (viii) number 

of beneficiaries (males and females) trained. 

 

Various supervision missions and periodic progress reports will systematically render an account on 

the achievement level of the indicators. These will be regularly presented to decision and policy 

makers to guide project mid-term review and to facilitate project management after completion. 

III - PROJECT FEASIBILITY 

3.1 Economic and financial performance  

3.1.1 A financial assessment of the project was undertaken using activity models, and on the basis 

of prevailing market prices. The key assumptions underlying the analyses include: (i) Additional 

quantity of foundation seeds (rice- 9500 metric tons and 2600 metric tons maize) will be produced at 

full capacity of the project; (ii) production of certified improved seed varieties; (iii) a 10-year time 

period was used to measure the incremental benefits from the project. Farm gate prices were used in 

estimating the total revenue from the project; (iv) the opportunity cost of capital (OCC) used for 

discounting future benefits was estimated to be 12%. For the economic analysis; (v) hired labour 

value was adjusted by a conversion factor of 0.75. These analyses were carried-out with financial 

and economic costs generated using Costab 32. Summary of financial and economic analysis is in 

Annex VII and further elaborated in Annex B6 in Volume II of the appraisal report. 

 

3.1.2 On the basis of the above-captured assumptions, the project is expected to generate the 

following benefits: (i) Increase rice production and productivity resulting in total annual rice of 

1,600,000 metric tons; (ii) Increase maize production and productivity resulting in total annual rice; 

of 150,000 metric tons; (iii) improve market linkage and value chain for rice and maize production; 

(iv) improve average household income of beneficiaries to USD 800; and (v) provide employment 

for 20,000 farmers and entrepreneurs.

EIRR (base case) 20%         USD  16,325,400.25 

NB: detailed calculations are available in Annex B6 

 

 

3.1.3 Financial analysis: Based on the above assumptions, the financial analysis generated Net 

Present Value (NPV) of USD 12,105,388.14 and internal rate of return (IRR) of 19%, as captured in 

the technical annexes (B6). Based on the above analysis, the project is deemed financially feasible. 

The FIRR of 19% is higher than the opportunity cost of capital (12%). 

 

3.1.4 Economic analysis: The economic analysis was conducted using the same approach as the 

financial analysis, on the basis of shadow prices (prices in conditions of the efficient market 

operation) of tradable goods and total cost of project. In addition, other indirect benefits were also 

expected, such as, easy access to markets through market linkages; provision of agro-service centre, 

reliable market information system and business developments from the incubation trainings. 

However, these additional benefits were difficult to value in monetary terms due to the limited scope 

of this report, hence they could not be adequately captured in the analysis. In these conditions, the 

economic analysis yielded an NPV of USD 16,325,400.25 and EIRR of 20% as captured in the 

technical annexes. 

 

3.1.5 Sensitivity Analysis: The results of the sensitivity analysis indicate that with 5%, 10% and 

15% decrease in production the FIRR decreases to 18%, 17% and 16% respectively. The same 

exercise was carried out for successive decrease in prices by 5, 10, and 20% with a combination of 

yield decline. A decrease in output prices by 20% (switching values) would have to occur before the 

project’s economic benefits reduces to break-even point at 12%, the opportunity cost of capital. A 

combined 10% decrease in output price and 15% decrease in output will break-even at 12%, the 

opportunity cost of capital. 

3.2 Environmental and Social Impacts  

3.2.1 Environment: Based on the proposed project scope the environmental and social (E&S) 

classification is Category 2 according to the African Development Bank’s Environmental and Social 

Assessment Procedures (ESAP). There are parallel co-financed investments from the Islamic 

Development Bank, the World Bank and IFAD and these donors had earlier prepared Environmental 

and Social Management Framework, and Pest Management Plan for the project. These documents 

were reviewed and found to have followed the African Development Bank Environmental and Social 

Assessment Procedures (ESAP). Hence these safeguards documents were adopted and their 

Executive Summaries disclosed on the Bank’s website on 22nd May 2019.  

 

3.2.2 The classification and attendant requirement is commensurate with the project classification 

stipulated by the Sierra Leone Environmental Protection Regulations. The principal objectives of 

conducting this environmental and social assessment and planning was to ensure that the project 

integrates mechanisms to reduce environmental impacts along the entire value chain, from 

production, marketing to product value addition/manufacture, usage and disposal.  

 

3.2.3  Environmental and Social Management Framework indicate that although the project will 

have some site specific negative impacts, it is also posed to have numerous positive impacts among 

them, notably: (i) improved production and competitiveness of selected agriculture commodities that 

will contribute to increased income opportunities for value chain actors, and support the local 

economy of the provinces; (ii)  reduced food imports; (iii) improved agronomic practices and 

technologies for rice and maize improved varieties that are adapted to the local conditions; (iv)  

improved agricultural production, productivity and market linkages that will foster job creation along 



 

12 

 

the value chains (improve quality and quantities of seeds; (v) improved incomes for women and men;  

(vi) increased  number of private sector input producers and distributors; (vii) increased training of 

Youth (disaggregated by gender); (ix) established youth-led agribusinesses ; and (x) improved market 

linkages. 

 

 3.2.4 The negative impacts will stem from a number of rehabilitation activities in the infrastructure 

development and value chain components of the project. The potential negative impacts of the project 

include those associated with the rehabilitation and equipping of two Seed Multiplication Centers, 

agriculture production and value chain activities. Rehabilitation activities may result in; (i) noise, 

vibration and emissions from operation of machinery that may impair air quality and induce health 

implications; (ii) generation of wastes (including rehabilitation waste and construction wastes); (iii) 

occupational health and safety of the rehabilitation crew. During operation phase, agriculture 

activities of value chain actors may lead to: (i) increased use of agrochemicals including pesticides 

and fertilizers, which may contribute to soil and water (surface and groundwater) contamination, and 

increase health-risks of people exposed to pesticides; and (ii) waste and effluents from processing 

and marketing facilities. These impacts are site specific and can be readily managed with the 

application of well-defined measures elaborated in the detailed site specific ESMPs. Some of the 

mitigation measures to be implemented include: (i) refilling the exposed or excavated soil soon after 

completion of works and avoiding or minimizing compaction of soils; and (ii) capacity building of 

value chain actors to promote good agriculture practices, improved agriculture technologies such as 

integrated soil fertility management (ISFM), integrated pest management (IPM) and sustainable land 

and water management practices.  

 

3.2.5 Climate Change: Agriculture production in Sierra Leone is vulnerable to the impacts of 

climate variability and change. Drought and floods are increasing in frequency and intensity, while 

average temperatures during the growing season are rising. Crop failures, reduction in productivity 

and outbreaks of pest and diseases are exacerbated by extreme climatic events. Cognizant of the 

national commitment to combat climate change, the project is being prepared taking into 

consideration the various National Strategies, Plans and Institutions relevant to Climate Change 

Overall, the project will facilitate climate resilience along the selected value chains by promoting 

climate smart agriculture and improved agriculture technologies. 

 

3.2.6 Gender: Women make up more than half of Sierra Leone’s agricultural labor force yet they 

are under-represented in land ownership and income. Discussions during the appraisal mission 

identified four major constraints that limit women’s productivity (as compared to men) and their full 

inclusion in the domestic agricultural economy namely: lack of access to assets, lack of access to 

financing, limited training and time constraints. To alleviate these constraints, the project will seek 

to: (i) increase the number of female entrepreneurs in agribusiness by providing training and 

improving access to financing; (ii) increase income by improving productivity and training women 

in core business skills; (iii) increase access to niche markets by marketing products from women-led 

value chains; and (iv) reduce women time constraints by providing them with improved technologies 

and adequate agro processing equipment’s and trainings.  

 

3.2.7 Five actions and interventions will foster these expected results: trainings and sensitization 

campaigns, financing, enhancing market links, strengthening women’s business groups and 

increasing their access to farm inputs. To implement these actions and monitor them efficiently, the 

Project Management Team will include a Youth and Gender expert to work closely with the Gender 

in agriculture and Nutrition Unit of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry as well as the Ministry 

of Social welfare, Gender and Children’s Affairs. Based on the above expected outcome, activities 

and strategy, the project is classified as Category 2, in accordance with the Bank’s Gender Marker 

System. 

 



 

13 

 

3.2.8 Human Capital, Youth Employment and Jobs: The rapidly growing youth population and 

youth unemployment was a major root cause of the outbreak of civil conflict. According to the 

National Youth Commission of Sierra Leone, the problem of youth unemployment is very complex 

as there are three categories of unemployed youth: uneducated, semi-skilled, and educated youth. 

Approximately 60% of youth are underemployed or unemployed and an estimated 800,000 youth 

today are actively searching for employment. Furthermore, illiteracy remains a persistent challenge 

and youth that lack the skills and education find it extremely difficult to compete for the limited jobs 

available. The main reasons for this high level of unemployment are lack of financial or other 

resources to start businesses, family responsibilities and the lack of skill requirements or experience. 

This frequently causes feelings of hopelessness and despair among young people pushing them to 

migrate from rural to urban areas .As young people move to the urban areas in search of better 

opportunities, urban migration is exerting more pressure on the limited infrastructure. The need to 

address youth unemployment and its underlying causes cannot be over-emphasized, given that large 

numbers of unemployed youths are a potential source of insecurity in view of their vulnerability to 

recruitment into criminal and violent activities. Youth unemployment in Sierra Leone has been 

recognized as a potential trigger for social instability, the prolonged state of underdevelopment and 

economic stagnation. 

 

3.2.9 Agricultural transformation is one of the key enablers for employment and job creation 

especially for young people in Sierra Leone and Africa at large. This project will support agribusiness 

training/incubation, entrepreneurship development through establishing an Enable Youth 

Agribusiness Centre of Excellence in partnership with Njala University of Agriculture.  In an 

integrated model the Agribusiness centre will offer multi-purpose training to meet the needs of Njala 

university students, rural youth and farmers including women. It will offer trainees an 

integrated/holistic practical training opportunity to gain experience from the units that will be 

established at the university (sequenced from production, harvesting, agro-processing, packaging, 

sales and marketing). This practical experience is expected to prepare the trainees for both 

employment and agripreneurship. A tracer study will also be carried out to monitor the progress 

achieved by youth supported by the project. It is estimated that 1,000 young promising agripreneurs 

will be supported to establish their own businesses while 4,000 will be equipped with technical skills 

to access employment. The project will create approximately 50,000 direct jobs and further 150,000 

jobs indirectly. 

 

3.2.10 Social Impact: The project will increase farmer incomes, improve livelihoods and 

consequently support better health, education and well-being indicators among project beneficiaries. 

Youth (both male and female) employment has a positive social impact on economic growth and 

productivity that cannot be ignored. When a great amount of skilled youth and university graduates 

(including young women) in Sierra Leone are able to find jobs and put their knowledge and 

capabilities into innovation and contributing to economic growth. Furthermore, having a large share 

of the workforce mainly youth employed will lead to increase productivity and gross domestic 

product (GDP). Increased capacity of youth (including women) through skill development and job 

creation under the Project will strengthen community cohesion and empowerment thus making it less 

likely for youth to engage in violence crime. 

 

3.2.11 Addressing Fragility: Sierra Leone has made significant progress in consolidating peace and 

security country-wide and in rebuilding its economy that was nearly destroyed by the decade long 

conflict. While Sierra Leone has not fully recovered from the twin shocks of the 2014-2016 Ebola 

crisis and slump in global commodity prices that severely affected the economy and created political 

uncertainties, it has been able to maintain security in the aftermath of the drawdown of the UN 

Mission and conducted peaceful political transition between parties. Rapid urbanization fuelled by 

migration of mainly youth from rural localities into the city of Freetown in search of opportunities is 

posing serious development challenge for the Government of Sierra Leone. In post conflict country 



 

14 

 

of such with major infrastructural deficits, the mass movement of people into Freetown increases 

more pressures on the Government and slow development of the city. Urban migration rate is 

currently 4.20% (about 46,000 people per annum) of the existing 1.1 million people living in 

Freetown which is exerting more pressure on the city limited infrastructure as estimated 15% of the 

country population lives in Freetown and environs alone. This has resulted to creating unsafe 

settlements around the city especially protected enclaves.  

 

3.2.12 Sierra Leone continues to experience some challenges stemming from the root causes and 

drivers of fragility which manifested itself over the decade-long conflict. The underlying drivers of 

fragility continue to pose significant downside risks for the country’s development. The root causes 

of fragility persist in all their political, economic, social and environmental dimensions and 

expressions. Intermediate drivers of fragility, such as limited national cohesion, food insecurity, high 

rates of youth unemployment, gender inequality, high levels of perceived and real corruption, weak 

human and institutional capacities and poor economic governance systems, especially public 

financial management (PFM) and limited revenue management systems are prevalent. With the 

above, the country has more pressures compared to capacity to withstand it. Increasing the Sierra 

Leone capacity and at the same time reducing these pressures through meaningful interventions will 

assist build resilience. 

 

3.2.13 Involuntary resettlement: There will be no resettlement as a result of the project. Any 

proposed activity will be located in areas which have no land disputes. No land acquisition is 

envisaged under this Project. 

IV.    IMPLEMENTATION 

4.1 Implementation Arrangements  

4.1.1 Executing and Implementing Agencies: The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry will be 

executing agency and will execute the project through a project management team to be established.

financed by the Fund will be carried out in accordance with the “Procurement Framework for Bank 

Group Funded Operations” dated October 2015 for high value contracts and the Recipient’s 

Procurement System for low value contracts.  The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Food 

Security will serve as the executing agency for this project and a Project Management Team (PMT) 

will be established that will be charged with the responsibility of implementing the project.  The 

Project Management Team will comprise a Procurement Specialist who will be recruited on a 

competitive basis to provide support on procurement related activities and also mentor the existing 

Procurement Officers managing the procurement unit of the ministry.  The PMU will carry out the 

procurement of goods, works, and consultancy services including preparation of procurement plan, 

standard bidding documents, open and evaluate bids, contracting and management of contract 

execution.  

 

4.2.2 Procurement Risks and Capacity Assessment (PRCA): The procurement capacity of the 

Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry was assessed and it was noted that the Procurement Officers are 

University graduates and they have acquired some experience on the Recipient’s procurement 

system. However, they have limited knowledge and experience on the Bank’s Procurement 

framework and will require further procurement training and mentoring on the use of donor 

procurement policies in readiness to assume procurement function of the a National Development 

Partners Program Coordination Office (NDPPCO).The procurement plan for the project will be 

prepared for the entire project duration and included in Section B5 of the Technical Annexes to this 

report. 

 

4.2.3 Financial Management: The financial management of the project will be handled an 

experienced qualified Project Accountant (PA) with hands-on experience on use of accounting 

software and practical application of International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS, 

Adopted by the GoSL for financial reporting). The Project Accountant (PA) will be competitively 

recruited. The PA will use the Tompro Accounting package (in harmony with other projects under 

MAF) for accounting and financial reporting. On a quarterly basis the PA will generate interim 

financial reports (IFRs) from Tompro, for the benefit of MAF and transmit copies to the Fund within 

30 days after the end of each calendar quarter. The project financial statement at end of the year shall 

be audited and certified copies together with the related management letter submitted to the Fund 

within 6 months after the end of each financial year. A  Financial Management Manual (FMM) and 

Project Implementation Manual (PIM) will be customised from the existing manuals and adopted to 

codify FM practices and guide project implementation. The internal auditor responsible for MAF 

will provide internal checks and periodically review project operations. The internal auditor will 

report to the NPSC through the Director of Technical Services and the NPSC ensure that all audit 

recommendations implemented and monitored. 

 

4.2.4 Disbursement Arrangement: Four disbursement methods are used by the Fund in disbursing 

funds to projects. The assessment recommends: (i) Direct payments; and (ii) Payments through 

Special Account (SA) under this project. The other 2 methods –reimbursement and reimbursement 

by guarantee shall be available to the project, if desired. Direct payments will be used for the 

payments against larger contracts signed between project management and contractors/suppliers/ 

service providers. The SA method will be used for meeting recurrent/ administrative expenses and 



 

16 

 

smaller contracts under the project. Here, a United States Dollar denominated Special Account will 

be opened at a Commercial Bank acceptable to the Fund, to receive funds from the Fund. A local 

currency account will be opened at same Bank to receive transfers from the SA for making payments 

in local currency. A second local currency account will be opened at the same bank for project 

operations.. All disbursements will follow with the disbursements procedures outlined in the Bank’s 

Disbursement Handbook. 

 

4.2.5  External Audit: The Auditor General (AG) of Sierra Leone will be responsible for the audit 

of the project on an annual basis in line with the Constitution of Sierra Leone, and use of country 

systems. Whilst the project will not pay related audit fees from its resources for audits performed by 

the AG, it shall bear reasonable incidental audit expenses duly submitted by the AG and cleared by 

the Fund. However, in instances of workload, where the AG cannot perform the audit, MAF and the 

Fund will be notified in time for an independent audit firm to be competitively recruited. The auditor 

terms of reference (TOR) will be agreed with the Fund. Certified copies of the audit reports, together 

with the accompanying management letter, must be submitted to the Fund within six (6) months at 

the end of each financial year.  

4.3 Monitoring and Evaluation  

4.3.1 The M&E system will be developed and managed by the M&E Officer, within the framework 

of the project Results Based Logical Framework. The M&E Officer will regularly track, document 

and report the project’s results and progress, facilitate knowledge building, and share knowledge with 

key stakeholders. The monitoring and reporting plans will be developed based on gender 

disaggregated indicators in the log frame. It will be part of the obligation of all project implementers 

to provide reports in prescribed format on outputs and outcomes achieved within the implementation 

agreements. The Project will provide financial resources to facilitate training, proper data gathering, 

processing and reporting. 

 

4.3.2 The project’s reports and key milestones are indicated in the table below. The Fund will 

supervise the implementation of the project through regular Supervision Missions which will be 

undertaken at least twice a year. These missions will verify implementation progress to ensure that 

key verifiable indicators, including gender specific indicators, related to the outputs, outcomes and 

impacts are being monitored. The M&E activities, including implementation progress and 

expenditure will therefore be an integral part of the project implementing agency, as a regular 

management function through the PMU’s M&E Specialist. The PMU will submit to the Fund 

progress reports, annual work plans and budgets, and annual procurement plans using Fund’s format. 

The quarterly progress report will be submitted to the Fund within 45 days after the end of the 

reporting period, whilst the annual progress report will be submitted within three months after the 

end of reporting period.

4.4 Governance 

4.4.1 According to the 2018 Mo Ibrahim Index on African Governance (IIAG), Sierra Leone ranked 

26th out of the 54 African countries assessed with a score of 50.9 which is slightly higher than the 

continental average of 49.9. Sierra Leone’s performance across four categories of governance namely 

(a) Safety & Rule of Law (20th out of 54), (b) Participation & Human Rights (15th out of 54), (c) 

Sustainable Economic Opportunity (39th out of 54), and (d) Human Development (44th out of 54). 

With regard to corruption perception, the 2018 Transparency International Report ranks Sierra Leone 

129th out of 180 with a Corruption Perception Index (CPI) of 30, on a scale of 0 (high corruption) to 

100 (very low corruption). 

 

4.4.2 In order to support the ongoing reform momentum in the country and foster good governance, 

the Fund, in close collaboration with the IMF and other partners, has regularly maintained sustained 

policy dialogue with the Sierra Leonean authorities through reform and institutional support 

operations. The government’s recent reform to operationalize the Treasury Single Account is a 

welcome step, as are policies to ensure that spending commitments are in line with the available 

financing envelope. More broadly, these efforts will lead to better governance, helping promote 

macroeconomic stability and inclusive growth. 

 

4.5 Sustainability 

4.5.1 One of the key aspects of the project is commercial orientation. This implies bringing out the 

business opportunities in the agriculture sector. The project activities will lead to the emergence of 

business oriented agripreneurs who are expected to run their businesses as a going-concern with the 

enhanced capacity they will receive from the project. This will lead to economic sustainability of the 

project. Also, the participatory approach adopted during the design stage of project will continue 

even at implementation in order to enhance ownership by beneficiaries thus ensuring sustainability. 

Implementation through government line ministries will ensure that project activities are in line with 

broader government programmes. All the critical enabling infrastructure that the project would invest 

in under the SMP, SLESCA and the ENABLE-Njala Youth Program will have in place, a 

management arrangement that would ensure that they are run on commercial basis by private 

operators under special management agreement with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. 

4.6 Risk management 

4.6.1 Risks to the successful implementation of the project and attainment of targeted outcomes 

and impact will stem primarily from the uncertainty in Government’s commitment to liberalize the 

domestic seed sector. The mitigation is that the National Seed Act was promulgated in 2017, which 

clearly depicts a publicly enabled but private sector driven seed sector.  

 

4.6.2 A related risk is the ability of private sector agro-input producers and agro-dealers to 

effectively fill the market void that would be created from Government’s withdrawal from 

procurement and distribution of seeds and other agro-input. The mitigation is that the project will 

support the provision of incentives including training and capacity building to provide a conducive 

enabling environment for private sector growth during the gradual withdrawal of Government from 

the sub-sector. 

 

4.6.3 Another risk relates to the novelty in the implementation of a commercially oriented youth in 

agribusiness empowerment project within an existing national university in Sierra Leone. The 

mitigation here is that they would not offer the service free but the project will pay for the incubation 

of the identified entrepreneurs who will form satellite farms for the anchor investors. The mitigation 

is that Funds will be managed by a carefully selected funds manager and also the risk for default by 

borrowers limited as the cost Potential risks are summarized below. The overall risks are rated 

moderate as they are manageable and mitigation measures will be in place.

No. Potential Risk Rating Mitigation Measures 

1. Government commitment to deregulating 

the agricultural input supply sector. 

Low Project is aligned to the MTNDP & 

NATS’s focus of economic 

diversification and private sector led 

supply systems 

2. Political influences of SMP, ENABLE-

Njala & SLeSCA  

Low SLESCA, SMP & ENABLE-Njala 

will be run as PPP outfits to ensure 

autonomy, efficiency and 

sustainability. 

3. Young agripreneurs are unable to establish 

viable businesses on their own. 

Medium Incubation training, business 

development, competitive seed grant 

and linkage to markets are provided to 

increase probability of success 

4.7 Knowledge building  

4.7.1 The project will support research through providing support to the Sierra Leone Agricultural 

Research Institute (SLARI) which has a long standing cooperation with the Consultative Group for 

International Agricultural Research Agencies. This research will support the development of 

improved breeder and foundation seeds for rice and maize as well as the varietal maintenance of these 

varieties. The project also includes collaborative knowledge development through Njala University, 

the foremost agricultural university in Sierra Leone. The knowledge generated through these research 

avenues will be disseminated to farmers through strengthened extension services to support better 

productivity at the farm level and youth to promote agribusiness development.

Project Executive Summary 

Project Overview: the Value Chains, Agricultural and Rural Entrepreneurship Support Project 

(PACVEAR) will be implemented in three regions, namely Bafata, Oio and Gabu, in northern and eastern 

Guinea-Bissau. The project’s objective is to improve the rice and market gardening subsector production 

environment, and promote enterprises in all targeted subsector value chain links to create sustainable jobs 

and increase rural income. 

The project will be implemented over five years (November 2019 to December 2024). The total project 

cost, exclusive of taxes and customs duties, is UA 10.62 million (XOF 8.607 billion) financed through a 

UA 5.46 million Transition Support Facility  (TSF) grant (51%), a UA 3.04 million TSF loan (29%) and 

a UA 1.06 million African Development Fund (ADF) loan (10%). 

The project will directly benefit 4 400 households and farmers in the project area, i.e. 35 000 people, at 

least 13 000 of them women. The expected project outcomes are: (i) an additional annual production of 

4 000 tonnes of rice and 2 000 tonnes of market garden produce; (ii) creation and/or strengthening of 600 

agricultural and rural enterprises to create 2 000 sustainable jobs, 30% of them for women and 40% for 

youths; and (iii) increase in average rural income to XOF 250 000 per household. 

Needs Assessment: Irrigated areas (18%) are still too small to reduce the shortfall in rice production, 

estimated at 80 000 tonnes per year. The project will increase irrigated areas by developing additional 

660 hectares of land, half of which will be equipped for full irrigation water control with the availability 

of detailed designs and bidding documents for 720 hectares. In addition, the main sources of fragility in 

the country include political instability, extreme poverty and high youth unemployment, as well as lack 

of opportunities for youth socio-professional integration. Consequently, it is necessary to design an 

agricultural and rural enterprises development programme targeting youths and women that would 

contribute to addressing this unemployment challenge. 

Value Added for the African Development Bank: Through its previous operations, the Bank has helped 

to increase developed areas and to acquire specific expertise in key domains (irrigation, seed production 

and control, solar energy, processing, etc.). With PACVEAR, the Bank will help to consolidate the gains 

of previous operations and promote rural entrepreneurship, with a view to boosting growth and the 

professionalisation of the agricultural sector. By supporting the development of agricultural 

infrastructure, the Bank will create factors conducive to the development of agricultural and rural 

enterprises in all targeted subsector value chain links, thus creating employment particularly for youths 

and women (production, processing and marketing). 

Knowledge Management: The project will generate knowledge that will be used to create numerous 

jobs through the upgrading of incubation centres to train and support youths willing to embark on 

agribusiness activities. The project will also support the Food and Nutrition Security Information System 

(SISSAN) in collecting and processing data for use in developing relevant sector policies. In addition, 

PACVEAR’s specific contribution to structuring the seed subsector through the introduction of 

technologies for African agricultural transformation (TAAT) will help to generate knowledge that will be 

used to consolidate production methods, thus increasing production. The setting up of demonstration units 

and the dissemination of best practice, as well as the introduction of solar energy in drainage and 

agricultural product processing and conservation systems will further enhance knowledge, particularly on 

new technologies in these areas.

VALUE CHAINS, AGRICULTURAL AND RURAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP 

SUPPORT PROJECT (PACVEAR) 

Management hereby submits the following report and recommendation concerning a proposal to award a 

UA 5.46 million TSF grant and extend a UA 3.04 million TSF loan and a UA 1.06 million ADF loan 

to the Republic of Guinea-Bissau to finance the Value Chains, Agricultural and Rural Entrepreneurship 

Support Project (PACVEAR). 

I. Strategic Thrust and Rationale 

1.1  Project Linkages with Country Strategy and Objectives 

1.1.1  PACVEAR is fully consistent with Guinea-Bissau’s strategic orientations, particularly the Terra 

Ranka Strategic and Operational Plan (2015-2020), which hinges on four main engines of economic 

growth, including agriculture and agro-industry. It also plugs into Sub-programme 1 of the second 

generation of the National Agricultural Investment Programme (PNIA) “Promotion of Crop Production 

Sub-sectors”, adopted in December 2017, which focuses on the development of food crops (including 

rice) and market gardening through better control of water and increased access to factors of production. 

It aligns with the orientations of the Letter of Agricultural Development Policy (LADP) and its action 

plan, which aim to guarantee food security, increase and diversify agricultural exports and improve the 

living conditions of rural dwellers. It also embraces the orientations of the National Food Security 

Programme (PNSA) and the Rice Farming Development Programme (PDR - 2016). PACVEAR is 

consistent with the “Develop Infrastructure to Promote Inclusive Growth” pillar of CSP 2015-2019 

through the development of agricultural infrastructure and opportunities in agriculture (especially for the 

youth and women).  

1.1.2  Guinea-Bissau is characterised by fragility, further aggravated by overall institutional weakness 

and a non-inclusive development model without economic alternatives. Sector constraints include the 

isolation of production areas, the obsolescence of production systems, inadequate access to inputs and 

weak agricultural product processing capacity. The main challenge is to strengthen institutional, economic 

and social resilience, while building the capacity of actors, reducing gender disparities and supporting the 

country's structural transformation through the construction of key infrastructure to ensure inclusive and 

green growth. Agricultural transformation through the development of value chains, the promotion of 

youth entrepreneurship, the mainstreaming of the gender dimension and greater involvement of non-State 

actors (including the private sector) will contribute to building resilience and reducing fragility in the 

country. 

1.1.3  In spite of Guinea-Bissau’s agricultural potential, the State’s withdrawal from the agricultural 

sector and the political crises of the last few decades have impeded genuine agricultural development in 

the country. This lack of interest in the agricultural sector has led to a serious structural weakening of 

production systems (agricultural and livestock). This is compounded by vagaries of the weather and 

climate change, which pose a serious threat with consequences on the management of ecosystems and 

other renewable agricultural and natural resources, all of which can impede the country’s social cohesion, 

stability and sustainable development. This combination of structural and cyclical crises has far-reaching 

consequences on the entire agricultural, silvicultural and pastoral sector, food and nutritional security, and 

the livelihoods of most of Guinea-Bissau’s population who depend on agriculture (in the broadest sense). 

1.1.4  According to the agriculture sector study conducted in 2014 (Portuguese Cooperation Trust 

Fund), it is essential to optimise the use of farmland, create added value for products, and enable 

households to generate sufficient income to purchase certain commodities. Rice is the staple foodstuff 

(eaten by 90% of Guinea-Bissau’s households) and food deficit is made up annually by rice imports of 

about 80 000 tonnes. The promotion of market gardening, stockbreeding and related services will not only 

help to diversify the sources of food, but also improve the income of rural communities, particularly 

women and youths in the targeted regions in the northern and eastern parts of the country. Garden crop 

production currently meets only 60% to 70% of demand. The main constraints on growth subsectors (rice 

and market gardening) are the remoteness of production areas, the degradation of production systems, 

insufficient access to inputs (particularly quality seeds) and markets, weak processing capacity, the lack 

of information and economic opportunity exploration networks to promote the employability of rural 



 

2 

youths, and the inadequate private sector integration into the value chains of growth subsectors and related 

activities to act as an engine and a lever for private enterprises. 

1.2 Rationale for Bank Involvement 

1.2.1 PACVEAR is in line with two of the Bank’s High 5s, namely “Feed Africa” and “Improve the 

quality of life for the people of Africa”. The project will contribute to attaining these two priorities by 

developing rice and market garden value chains, building the capacity of actors, creating jobs and 

improving income. The project is aligned with the Bank’s Long-term Strategy (LTS 2013-2022) and its 

two overarching objectives: inclusive growth and transition to a green economy. 

1.2.2  PACVEAR is aligned with the Bank's Long-Term Strategy (SLT 2013-2022) and its two major 

objectives of inclusive growth and transition to green growth. The project is built on the three areas of 

special emphasis of the LTS: fragile States, agriculture and food security, and gender. It is consistent with 

the orientation of the Bank’s new Strategy for Agricultural Transformation in Africa (2016-2025), which 

puts special emphasis on the development of value chains and agricultural entrepreneurship. In addition, 

it will contribute to achieving the objectives of the Enable Youth and Jobs for Youth in Africa flagship 

initiatives, by promoting capacity building and the creation of opportunities for youths. Furthermore, the 

project is in keeping with the Bank’s Technologies for African Agricultural Transformation (TAAT) 

programme, which focuses on the adoption of new production and processing technologies in agricultural 

value chains. 

1.2.3  PACVEAR concords with the Bank’s Gender Strategy (2014-2018) “Investing in Gender 

Equality for Africa’s Transformation”, more specifically Pillar II, “Economic Empowerment”. It also 

follows the recommendations of the gender profile prepared by the Bank and UNWomen in 2015, on the 

need to integrate women into value chains. Specifically, it plugs into climate-change adaptation initiatives 

by promoting renewable energy, water-saving technologies and resilient methods. 

1.2.4  Agriculture remains one of the country’s most important strategic sectors and the only sector 

that can benefit the largest number of people, combat food and nutrition insecurity and provide jobs for 

young people and women. The continuous support provided by the Bank to the sector is justified by: (i) 

the highly satisfactory performance of similar Bank-funded operations, notably the Agricultural and Rural 

Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project (PRESAR) (completed in 2012) and the Rice Value Chain 

Development Project (PDCV-Riz) (launched in 2017); (ii) unmet needs in terms of irrigation 

infrastructure and support as well as the development of value chains and agricultural entrepreneurship; 

and (iii) the strong mobilisation and involvement of the Government, local and regional actors and 

beneficiaries. The activities proposed by the project, namely the development of irrigation schemes 

(particularly full control of irrigation water), the integration of value chains and agricultural 

entrepreneurship will help to promote the employment of young people and women in rural areas, 

strengthen adaptation to climate change and increase the resilience of segments of the population that are 

vulnerable to food and nutrition insecurity. 

1.3  Aid Coordination 

1.3.1  Since the April 2012 crisis, the technical and financial partner (TFP) consultation framework 

that was operating through multi-sector thematic groups has been put on hold. However, it should be noted 

that, in general, aid coordination and monitoring mechanisms have always suffered from the structural 

weaknesses of public administration. In this regard, before the coup d’état of 2012, the Bank approved a 

technical assistance project (PECA II) to build coordination capacity. The project included the convening 

of donor round tables in Brussels in March 2015 as well as capacity-building activities organised by the 

Ministry of Economy and Finance. 

1.3.2  Based on the “Letter of Agricultural Development Policy”, several bilateral and multilateral 

partners provided significant support for rural development, food and nutrition security in Guinea-Bissau, 

including: (i) IFAD (Economic Development Project for the Southern Regions - PADES and design of a 

new project for the diversification of family farming in the eastern and northern regions); (ii) BOAD 

(Food Security Support Project - PASA and Project to Promote Rice Cultivation by Youths - PPRFJ); (iii) 

ECOWAS (support for the preparation of the National Agricultural Investment Programme - PNIA); and 

(iv) WAEMU (feasibility study on the Irrigated Rice Cultivation Intensification Support Project - PAIRI 

and the Crop and Grain Storage Warehouse Construction Programme). It is worth noting that ECOWAS, 



 

3 

WAEMU and CILSS set up the Global Alliance for Resilience Initiative – Sahel and West Africa (AGIR) 

whose objective is to achieve “zero hunger” in 20 years. From an institutional standpoint, the activities of 

partners are coordinated by the Ministry of Economy and Finance. For agriculture in particular, the 

partners reached a consensus on the sector strategy, notably PNIA, during the partners’ round table 

convened in Brussels in March 2015. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) plays 

a major role in policy support and coordination of activities. 

The project will establish synergies with projects being implemented and those being designed. More 

broadly, the involvement of the various partners in the rural sector (agriculture, livestock production, 

fisheries and environment) is presented in Annex A4 of Volume 2 and summarised below:

II. Project Description 

2.1. Project Objectives and Components 

PACVEAR’s overall objective is to contribute to enhancing the competitiveness of subsector value chains 

(rice and market gardening) to boost inclusive and sustainable growth in the agricultural sector. Its specific 

objective is to improve the rice and market gardening subsector production environment, and promote 

enterprises in all targeted subsector value chain links, with a view to creating sustainable jobs and 

increasing rural income. PACVEAR, which will be implemented over a five-year period (November 2019 

to October 2024), comprises three main components: (i) Improve the Competitiveness of Agricultural 

Value Chains (rice and market gardening); (ii) Promote Agricultural and Rural Entrepreneurship; and (iii) 

Project Coordination and Management. The table below presents a summary of the activities selected. A 

detailed description of the activities is provided in Annex C3 of Volume 2.

2.2 Technical Solutions Adopted and Alternatives Explored 

2.2.1  The technical solutions adopted for PACVEAR are based on field data and lessons drawn from 

similar projects, discussions with beneficiaries, the specific characteristics of each site to be developed, 

the water resources to be mobilised as well as the ease of managing facilities and equipment. Therefore, 

the proposed works take into account not only rice cultivation, but also horticulture which is already being 

carried out in the lowlands with full irrigation water control, particularly during the dry season. Three 

options were considered: (1) lowlands with full irrigation water control will be developed into small plots 

that are easy to manage, maintain and improve; (2) market gardening areas will be systematically equipped 

with a mini submersible solar-powered borehole pump, a storage tank, a drip irrigation system1 and a 

protective grid fence and hedges; and (3) the mechanisation of tillage operations by providing support to 

agricultural mechanisation service providers (tractors and accessories) in project impact areas will 

contribute to improving tillage operations and creating new employment opportunities for youths. 

Table 2.2: Alternatives Explored and Reasons for Their Rejection 
Alternative Rejected Brief Description Reason for Rejection 

Develop just one large area 

with full irrigation water 

control where the project 

would be concentrated  

 

Construction of a large pumping station, covered 

water transportation canals with large civil 

engineering structures for water collection, 

carriage and distribution.  

This alternative does not ensure the availability 

of labour, in terms of quantity or quality, for the 

development of the facilities and the investments 

required. It is quite likely that the area will not be 

fully used. In addition, it will be quite difficult to 

manage and maintain the area. 

Develop market gardening 

areas with indurated wells 

without any dewatering 

mechanism  

Construction of one or more wells 5 metres to 10 

metres deep (one well per hectare) where 

irrigation water is collected manually and then 

stored in small basins and carried to the parcels 

by the farmers using watering cans or buckets.  

The manual collection of water from indurated 

wells and irrigation with watering cans makes the 

task, which is carried out mainly by women, very 

tedious and takes up an enormous amount of 

work time and water. This problem will be 

compounded in the medium term once 

groundwater dries up, obliging farmers to fetch 

water from a greater depth (20 metres to 30 

metres). 

Develop animal-drawn 

cultivation in the intermediary 

phase instead of motorising 

soil cultivation activities.  

Animal-drawn cultivation practised in the 

project regions is suited for light soils with 

limited humidity, to ensure high productivity. Its 

effectiveness largely depends on the physical 

conditions of the area to be cultivated.  

Large arable land in the region, the short period 

available for soil preparation and the short rainy 

season are factors militating against animal-

drawn cultivation.  

 

2.3 Project Type 

2.3.1 PACVEAR is an investment operation financed with ADF and TSF resources. The Government of 

Guinea-Bissau has not yet started implementing projects and programmes using the sector-based approach, 

given a number of institutional constraints and the fragility context. For now, the project approach is the most 

appropriate to ensure the achievement of outcomes and the effective/efficient use of the resources allocated to 

the project, which will also consolidate the gains achieved with PRESAR and PDCV-Riz. 

2.4. Project Cost and Financing Arrangements 

2.4.1. The project cost, exclusive of taxes and custom duties, is estimated at UA 10.62 million, (XOF 8.607 

billion). The foreign exchange portion represents 36% of the total cost, exclusive of taxes, or UA 3.85 million. 

Custom duty and taxes will be covered by the State, which shall to take the necessary measures to implement 

this provision. A 4% provision for physical contingencies and a 3% provision for price escalation have been 

included in the project cost. The summary of the project cost by component and expenditure category, as well 

as the expenditure schedule are presented in Tables 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5 below. 

 

 

 

                                                 
1  Overall, market gardening areas in Guinea-Bissau are irrigated manually (98% using watering cans). Consequently, drip irrigation will be 

introduced gradually over time. In this regard, basin irrigation (water is pumped from the well into a reinforced concrete storage tank and then 
conveyed gravitationally through buried pipes to supply small 2 metre to 3 metre brickwork basins) will first be used in market gardening areas. 

Each small basin will supply irrigation water to ten 250 m2 plots, or 0.25 hectares. Once women farmers are able to control the cost of managing, 

operating and maintaining their market gardening areas, a drip irrigation system will be established to replace the small basins.

2.4.2 The project will be financed with a UA 5.46 million TSF grant (51% of the project cost), a UA 

3.04 million TSF loan (29% of the project cost) and a UA 1.06 million ADF loan (10% of the project 

cost). Considering the country’s fragile context, the Government’s financial contribution is estimated at 

UA 0.20 million (2% of the project cost). It will cover detailed design and BDs for sites already developed, 

the allocation of premises for the PMU (head office at Bissau and field office in Bafata), the procurement 

of subsidised fertilisers (INPA), support for the preparation of the seed subsector diagnosis and the 

implementation of the seed subsector action plan, support for the establishment of the framework for the 



 

7 

monitoring of TFP operations, and dissemination of data through the Food and Nutrition Security 

Information System (SISSAN). The contribution of beneficiaries will be limited to the computation of 

their participation in easy-to-undertake ongoing development and maintenance works, estimated at UA 

0.86 million (8% of the project cost). The breakdown of project cost by source of financing is given in

2.5 Project Target Area and Beneficiaries 

2.5.1  PACVEAR will cover three regions in northern and eastern Guinea-Bissau, namely Bafata, Oio 

and Gabu, out of the country’s nine regions. It will cover 57% of the national territory and accounting for 

43% of the country’s total population2. The project impact area was selected based on several criteria: (i) 

the need to consolidate the gains of other Bank operations implemented in Bafata and Oio, and to extend 

them to Gabu - a region with a huge irrigation potential; (ii) geographic concentration of operations and, 

hence, sustainability and better visibility of actions; (iii) absolute poverty rates prevailing in the area, 

namely 83% in Gabu, 75% in Bafata and 73% in Oio; (iv) food and nutrition insecurity (above 15.6%); 

(v) high youth unemployment (30% in 2010); (vi) small area of irrigated land (18% of the agricultural 

potential); (vii) lack and obsolescence of facilities, difficulty in accessing factors of production (certified 

seeds, quality inputs, ploughing and post-harvest equipment, etc.); (viii) eagerness of youths and women 

to farm the land to be developed; and (ix) existence of local private initiatives that provide a real breeding 

ground for local small- and medium-size enterprises capable of enhancing the growth of value chains3.  

2.5.2 The infrastructure sites were selected based on the needs expressed at the grassroots level and a 

multi-criteria analysis combining: (i) the existence of local and sector operational dynamics; (ii) the 

absence of latent land conflicts; (iii) the commitment of FOs and local communities to ensure the 

management of the facilities to be developed; and (iv) the optimisation of the outcomes of similar projects 

(PRESAR/AfDB, PAIRI/WAEMU, PPRFJ/BOAD, etc.) to improve data quality at project entry. Thirteen 

(13) lowland rice cultivation sites have been selected under PACVEAR (the detailed list of sites is 

presented in Annex C3 of Volume 2)4.  

2.5.3 Specifically, PACVEAR will benefit many rural producers who would have easier access to 

facilities, inputs and equipment, and probably sell their produce more easily and at reduced cost. Project 

activities will focus on two highly vulnerable target groups in rural areas - women and youths. The project 

will directly benefit 4 400 households/farmers, or 35 000 people, at least 13 000 of them women. It will 

indirectly benefit all households in the three regions concerned through the outcomes of its activities and 

transformational investments. From the institutional viewpoint, the project will involve some 110 FOs, 

unions, EIGs and management committees. The implementation of project activities will create 2 800 

                                                 
2  Projection derived from the results of the 2009 GPHS based on a population growth rate of 2.2%. 
3  There is a need to build on the innovative initiatives implemented by NGOs and associations operating in the project area, such as ADPP, 

APRODEL, COAJOQ and ADIC-Nafaia, to promote value chains and create jobs. 
4  Detailed design and BDs (PAIRI 2018) for 12 of the 13 lowlands selected are available. This would help to rapidly commence works during the 

first year after the review of BDs.

decent jobs (for men, women and youths)5. 

2.6  Participatory Approach for Project Identification, Design and Implementation 

2.6.1  The project design was based on a participatory and inclusive approach involving all 

stakeholders, namely technical services, producer organisations, women’s/youth groups, civil society, 

private sector, development partners, beneficiary populations, projects, etc. These broad-based 

consultations were carried out through numerous meetings held during project identification, preparation 

and appraisal. This helped to make sound technical and operational choices that could contribute to 

ensuring the sustainability of project outcomes. During several visits to potential project sites and the sites 

of previous projects, discussions were held with the communities concerned and the representatives of 

producers to better identify the difficulties they faced, prioritise the activities to be implemented and select 

the relevant sites. That process helped to win the support of various stakeholders and led to a broad 

consensus on project design and implementation arrangements. 

2.6.2 This entire participatory process revealed great interest for the project, which builds on the 

achievements of PRESAR, PDCV-Riz and other past and ongoing projects. Producers reaffirmed the need 

to fully exploit the project area’s considerable potential and opportunities to mainstream pilot activities in 

the livestock sector particularly in Gabu district. Women expressed their interest for market gardening, 

processing and marketing of farm products, with the modernisation of production and processing tools 

and improved access to markets. Youths showed their enthusiasm in promoting agricultural and rural 

entrepreneurship through training, incubation and post-incubation support for private individual or 

collective initiatives in all value chain links. The development of a good communication strategy for 
PACVEAR and the maintenance of the participatory approach during its implementation are guarantees 
that local actors will take ownership of the project during the implementation phase. 

2.6.3 The consultations and working sessions held with technical services such as the General 

Directorate of Agriculture, the General Directorate of Livestock, the National Institute of Agricultural 

Research (INPA), Directorate of Seed Control and Certification, and NGOs (ADPP, APRODEL, ADIC-

Nafaia and COAJOQ) on the implementation of some project activities will help to ensure the 

methodological ownership of the project by partners and to conclude partnership agreements upon project 

start-up. 

2.6.4 Sites were selected for the development of irrigation schemes through field visits, consultations 

with technical services, farmer organisations, women’s and youth associations, beneficiaries and the 

analysis of the relevance of studies and projects such as the Irrigated Rice Cultivation Intensification 

Support Project – PAIRI (WAEMU, 2018) and the Project to Promote Rice Cultivation by Youths – 

PPRFJ (BOAD, 2015). The outcomes of these consultations are reflected in this appraisal report. 

However, adjustments may be made during project start-up. 

 

2.7. Bank Group Experience and Lessons Reflected in Project Design 

2.7.1 The Bank’s active portfolio in Guinea-Bissau as at May 2019 comprised ten (10) operations for 

a total net commitment of UA 73.47 million, of which eight (8) national public sector projects (UA 45.52 

million) and two (2) regional operations (UA 27.95 million). There is no ongoing project under the Bank’s 

private sector window. There is no problematic project (PP) or potentially problematic project (PPP). The 

distribution of the national project portfolio by sector is as follows: energy (74.7%); governance (13.7%) 

and agriculture (11.6%). The portfolio’s age has dropped considerably, from 6.2 years in 2014 to 2.6 years 

in 2017, due mainly to the closure of old projects (Education III and Health II). There are three ongoing 

operations in the agricultural sector, namely the Rice Value Chain Development Project – PDCV-Riz (UA 

4.19 million), the Study on the Revival of the Cotton-Textile Sector (UA 0.35 million) and the Emergency 

Assistance for Fall Armyworm Control (UA 0.73 million). 

2.7.2 The Agricultural and Rural Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project (PRESAR) financed by the 

Bank to the tune of UA 5.8 million, which was completed in 2012, rehabilitated/developed 3 800 hectares 

                                                 
5  The Employment Impact Assessment of the Job Saving Plan (PES) conducted by AfDB in 2018 showed that agricultural sector investments have 

a significant multiplier effect on employment (every UA 1 million invested creates at least 282 direct and indirect jobs). This sector has the most 

significant impact on the poorest quintile and helps to increase the number of people in the middle class.

of lowlands and mangroves, and provided support for the development of 460 hectares of market 

gardening areas. The project completion report prepared in February 2014 rated the project performance 

as satisfactory (score of 3.12 on 4), despite its implementation in a difficult socio-political context. In 

addition, the PDCV-Riz initiated in 2017 envisaged the development of 470 hectares of lowlands and 

mangroves, and 19 hectares of women’s market gardening areas equipped with solar-powered pumps and 

the construction of access roads, markets, input stores, product storage and conservation areas. Thus, the 

two projects funded by the Bank have significantly increased the land area available for cultivation (about 

5 000 hectares), improved agricultural production (rice and market garden products), increased income, 

and opened up and integrated production areas into the market economy. Lessons from these experiences 

are that the implementation of an inclusive participatory approach to infrastructure development, together 

with a mechanism for supporting grassroots actors, offer genuine opportunities for improving food 

security and farmers’ income. PACVEAR will also focus on rural entrepreneurship, which is an 

innovative approach adopted to boost agricultural sector growth and professionalisation. 

2.7.3  The project is also based on the conclusions of the mid-term review of the Bank’s Country 

Strategy and Programme in Guinea-Bissau for the period 2015–2019 conducted by IDEV in September 

2018, which recommends that the Bank should improve the quality of its portfolio, supervise operations 

more effectively, build the capacity of government technical services, select local operators/implementing 

partners based on objective criteria, better mainstream gender particularly by involving community 

leaders in raising awareness on gender equity and equality in agricultural development and, lastly, make 

project outcomes and impacts more sustainable. 

These recommendations have been taken into account by: (i) improving the quality of project design 

through the involvement of the PDCV-Riz project team designated by the PACVEAR 

coordination/management unit, formulating and analysing the relevance of available engineering studies 

on irrigation schemes; (ii) setting up an internal monitoring committee to supervise the project (twice a 

year); (iii) planning government technical service capacity-building activities; (iv) involving sector 

leaders in the selection of beneficiary sites and infrastructure management; (v) building the technical 

capacity of management committee members in infrastructure maintenance with the participation of 

SMEs; (vi) assessing implementing partners and developing new selection criteria; (vii) establishing an 

effective results-based project monitoring and evaluation mechanism, and building the project team’s 

capacity in monitoring and evaluation; and (viii) mainstreaming the gender dimension in all project 

components by improving production capacity, rice and market garden product conservation, building the 

capacity of women and youths, improving product processing and marketing capacity, and raising 

awareness for behaviour change. 

2.7.4  Final design and BDs for sites for the development of irrigation schemes (with total or partial 

irrigation water control) are available (12 out of 13 lowlands covering about 560 hectares, or 85% of the 

area to be developed). These studies were analysed during project preparation/appraisal missions and used 

as a basis for estimating investments in the irrigation schemes envisaged under the project. Once the loan 

agreement is signed, the PDCV-Riz team will start adapting the BDs to Bank standard BDs and launch 

bid invitations for works, thus helping to comply with timeframes. Standard plans for storage warehouses 

and vaccination yards are also available. 

2.7.5  To select local partners responsible for coordinating and organising producers around value 

chains and supporting young economic project promoters, PACVEAR solicited the services of 

experienced local NGOs that have a satisfactory working relationship with the Bank or other partners. 

Agreements and protocols specifying their roles and expected outcomes will be concluded with these 

entities. 

The NGOs concerned are APRODEL (Bafata), ADPP (Oio), ADIC-Nafaia (Gabu) and COAJOQ 

(Cacheu). APRODEL and ADPP are currently involved in PDCV-Riz and will be maintained. ADIC-

Nafaia satisfactorily implemented many activities on behalf of several partners, including FAO, the 

European Union and the World Bank. It is currently supervising the beneficiaries of 500 hectares of 

lowlands in Gabu Region. COAJOQ, which is based in Canchungo Division in Cacheu Region, is 

involved in implementing the European Union-funded Integrated Project to Revitalise the Private Sector 

in Cacheu Region. It is currently collaborating with 37 local producer associations with 1 850 members, 



 

10 

50% of them women practising market gardening. It also participates in the training of youths in 

agricultural mechanisation within an associative and sustainable context. 

2.8 Key Performance Indicators 

2.8.1  A gender-specific baseline situation will be established to examine the context, the level of 

indicators to be informed and other relevant parameters before project start-up. This will help to regularly 

assess the progress made, particularly in terms of outcomes and impact. Special emphasis will be laid on 

targeting those parameters that can be monitored and collected internally, and others specifically related 

to women and youths (women- and youth-disaggregated data). It will be necessary to analyse youth 

employment, salt flats and climate change issues in the current project area. 

The monitoring/evaluation specialist will monitor and evaluate project activities and results-based logical 

framework indicators internally, in close collaboration with technical experts (infrastructure engineer, 

employment promotion specialist and value chain expert) and project partners, including support NGOs. 

2.8.2  The key performance indicators that will be monitored based on the baseline scenario include: 

(i) surface area of lowlands developed with partial irrigation water control for rice; (ii) rice-growing areas 

developed with full irrigation water control; (iii) market gardening areas developed; (iv) number of short-

cycle livestock units promoted by gender; (v) infrastructure developed and operated (number of markets 

commissioned, kilometres of feeder roads developed, stores for storage of produce built, etc.); (vi) level 

of additional production (tonnes) and crop yields (t/ha); (vii) number of farmers (including women) per 

type of facility; (viii) number of demonstration units (DUs); (ix) number of structured producer 

organisations and facility management committees established; (x) growth level of farmers’ income, 

including those of women and youths; (xi) number of jobs created for youths and women through 

entrepreneurial initiatives and number of young entrepreneurs trained, incubated and installed; (xii) 

number of producers, processors and traders trained and organised; (xiii) level of involvement of women 

in decision-making bodies and their rate of access to post-development land; (xiv) number of processing 

units established and allocated (including for women); and (xv) number of nutrition activities supported, 

number of school canteens supported and level of impact on food and nutrition security. 

2.8.3  All indicators selected for the project will be aligned on those selected for PNIA II and will help 

to enhance the performance of the agricultural sector in Guinea-Bissau. The Bank’s various supervision 

missions and periodic progress reports will reflect the level of achievement of the indicators. 

 

III Project Feasibility 

3.1 Financial and Economic Performance 

Table 3.1: Key Financial and Economic Data  

NPV (8%) XOF 20 944 million 

EIRR (baseline scenario) 16.9% 

 

3.1.1 The project financial and economic analysis was carried out based on the cost/benefit of 

additional cash flows from the two priority sector crop (rice and market gardening) and livestock (small 

ruminants, broilers and pigs) entrepreneurial production models. The detailed assumptions of the financial 

and economic analysis, the tables of farming models (the baseline and “with project” situations) and the 

financial and economic flows are presented in Annex B7 of Volume 2. The results of the financial and 

economic analysis show that PACVEAR is financially and economically profitable. 

3.1.2 Financial performance: the additional income from various farming models adopted are as 

follows: (i) farms benefiting from the development of 364 ha of lowlands with partial irrigation water 

control (rainy season rice cultivation) with an income of  XOF 0.237 million/ha; (ii) farms benefiting from 

the development of 296 ha of lowlands with full irrigation water control (double-cropping of rice and 

market garden products) with an estimated income of XOF 1.680 million/ha; (iii) 60 ha of market 

gardening areas for women (rainy season and off-season crops) with an income of XOF 5.867 million/ha; 

(iv) pig farms (introduction of 1 genitor boar for 3 sows for 30 beneficiaries) with an income of XOF 8.22 

million/beneficiary in peak year; (v) poultry farms (broiler chickens) with an average income of XOF 0.38 



 

11 

million/beneficiary; (vi) small ruminant farms (2 genitors and 8 female) ) with  an average income of XOF 

2.98 million/beneficiary. The additional income generated by the project will contribute to increasing 

overall value added, hence its contribution to agricultural GDP. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) 

is estimated at 14.8% for an NPV, at the opportunity cost of capital 8%, of XOF 20.11 billion, which 

reflects a significant result. 

3.1.3 Economic performance:  the basic economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is 16.9% for a NPV, 

at the opportunity cost of capital 8%, of XOF 20.944 billion, and the cost/benefit ratio (CBR) is 2.1. This 

amount is significant, especially as some of the benefits could not be taken into account in calculations 

owing to lack of data for assessing them, notably the improvement of living conditions and food and 

nutrition security thanks to increased income, food availability, the impacts of watershed and 

environmental protection actions, capacity building for other types of economic activities carried out by 

beneficiaries and multiplier effects on sector players (suppliers of inputs, equipment, services, etc.).  

Sensitivity tests were conducted taking into account a possible increase in costs (+10%), a decrease in 

agricultural production in case farmers do not adopt the proposed farming techniques (-10%) and a 

reduction in benefits (-10%) caused by plant and animal species, coupled with an increase in investment 

costs (+10%).  The respective IRRs for sensitivity tests are 15.0%; 14.8% and 13.1%. Other sensitivity 

tests were conducted taking into account assumptions of flow variability resulting from endogenous 

variables, and are presented in Annex B7 of Volume 2. 

3.1.4 The other project economic impacts can be summarised as follows: (i) the upstream effects of 

additional income on service providers (contractors, suppliers, NGOs, consulting firms); (ii) the 

downstream effects of additional income generation on producers, traders and processors who are mostly 

women and youths; (iii) a decrease in foreign exchange costs in the trade balance, thanks to the significant 

reduction in rice importation; and (iv) the impact on wealth creation in the country owing to an increase 

in GDP resulting from the generation of additional value added. Project benefits for households will 

improve the nutrition of vulnerable groups (children, women of childbearing age and the elderly), ease 

the hardship of the tasks of agricultural workers, especially women, reduce the impact of monetary and 

non-monetary poverty, and strengthen the livelihoods and the resilience of PACVEAR target groups to 

food insecurity and the effects of climate change, among others. 

3.2. Environmental and Social Impact 

3.2.1  Environment: PACVEAR is classified under Environmental Category 2 according to the 

Bank’s Environmental Safeguards Policy. It underwent a strategic environmental and social assessment 

(SESA) and has an environmental and social management master plan (ESMP)6. The Competent 

Environmental Assessment Authority (Autoridad de Avaliação Ambiental Competente - AAAC) of 

Guinea-Bissau has also classified the project under Environmental Category B, which is equivalent to 

Environmental Category 2 of the Bank's safeguards, in accordance with Law No. 10/2010 of 24 September 

2010 relating to environmental assessment.  

3.2.2 PACVEAR’s infrastructure will not generate significant environmental and social impacts.  

However, there will be a few negative impacts during the lowland development and infrastructure 

construction phase. These will include sound emanations, increase in dust in the air, earthworks, risk of 

STI/HIV/AIDS transmission during the construction phase, and the outbreak of malaria and waterborne 

diseases during the operations phase. These impacts will be relatively moderate and limited to receiving 

environments with low ecological sensitivity. The dispersal of the facilities across the three regions in the 

northern and eastern part of the country will also reduce their impacts, which will be limited in time and 

mitigated by appropriate measures. The project impact area does not contain protected areas or gazetted 

forests7.  

                                                 
6  Engineering and environmental studies on irrigation scheme development sites are available. However, the sites for support facilities (water points, 

rural roads, storage warehouses, etc.) are not known at this stage. If necessary, they will be the subject of environmental impact assessments to be 

carried out by a private service provider at project start-up and submitted to the Bank. Against this backdrop, it was decided that a strategic 

environmental and social assessment (SESA) should be conducted and an environment and social management master plan (ESMP) prepared. 
7  Guinea-Bissau has no gazetted forest. The relics of primary forests are gradually being replaced by mono-specific cashew nut plantations, which 

considerably reduce biodiversity in these three regions. 

   



 

12 

3.2.3  Project facilities will not entail any displacement of people or restriction of their access to 

property or livelihoods. Deeds of transfer and operation will be issued to farmers’ organisations (FOs) 

that will act as representatives of beneficiaries. This will lead to secure land tenure for the sites to be 

developed. Consultation frameworks comprising traditional authorities, landowners, support/assistance 

organisations and beneficiary organisations will be established for the issuance of an operation permit in 

the form of a deed of gift to beneficiaries (at least 30% to women and 20% to youths) by land right holders. 

To ensure the sustainable operation of the facilities built, sensitisation and information meetings will be 

held, followed by a landowner and land right owner identification phase that will lead to the signing of a 

deed/declaration of gift by village landowners, endorsed by the village chief, the mayor of the municipality 

or even the governor of the region concerned. Most of the facilities to be built by the project will be a 

concrete response to priority development problems (lack of irrigation water, lack of infrastructure to 

support agricultural value chains, construction of access roads, access to markets, etc.). 

3.2.4  Impact mitigation measures to be implemented before, during and after construction works as 

well as the improvement activities envisaged (protection of facilities, fruit tree planting, etc.) will 

strengthen project environmental compliance. Project environmental management activities will be 

coordinated by PACVEAR’s environmental expert who, under a framework agreement, will be backed 

by the Competent Environmental Assessment Authority (AAAC) for better management of the 

environmental aspects of the project. The project will also use the services of environmental focal points 

(EFPs) in the Regional Directorates of Forestry and Wildlife to conduct environmental monitoring during 

the implementation phase. These workers will undergo training in environmental and social assessment, 

and will receive the support and permanent assistance of the AAAC in carrying out the various activities. 

3.2.5  The budget allocated for environmental monitoring and evaluation is UA 162 000. This amount 

will cover the development of specific ESIAs and ESMPs for some sites (provisions) by an external 

consulting firm, the implementation of the mitigation measures contained in them, campaigns to raise 

beneficiary awareness and institutional support to the AAAC.  The ESMP summary is presented in Annex 

B8 of Volume 2. The environmental and social management framework and its summary were approved 

by the Safeguards and Compliance Department (SNSC), and posted on the Bank's website on 13 June 

2019. 

3.2.6  Climate change: a climate change risk assessment was conducted for the project using the 

Climate Safeguards System (CSS). The project is classified under Climatic Category 2 and may be 

vulnerable to climate risks. Practical risk management and adaptation options will be incorporated into 

project design and implementation plans. 

3.2.7  There is no known history of severe drought in the project area. In the course of the rainy season, 

rice farms may sometimes become flooded in places during periods of normal rainfall. This phenomenon 

is primarily the result of sand silting in the natural canals that serve as outlets to the production sites. To 

address the impacts of climate change, the project will adopt measures prescribed by the National Action 

Programme for Adaptation to Climate Change (PANA) following participatory assessments of the 

country’s vulnerability and adaptation to climate change, based on the agricultural sector diagnoses. The 

project will fully align its activities with PANA’s strategic orientations by developing lowlands and 

horticulture, supporting school canteens and establishing school gardens with a view to strengthening the 

food and nutrition security of the beneficiaries. The project will use a holistic approach that is designed 

to eliminate constraints at all levels of rice and horticultural value chains. Specifically in horticulture 

areas, PACVEAR will introduce solar technology and the plot water-saving system to control water and 

reduce water extraction.  

3.2.8  For better management of occasional flooding in rice fields, the natural canals of the target sites 

will be drained and resized to allow for the evacuation of any excess flow in the rice-growing lowlands 

concerned. To prevent silting in rice fields, which is the primary cause of flooding in the lowlands, bunds 

consolidated with soil-fixing plants will be built opposite slopes with strong runoff. The project will also 

make it easier for producers to acquire certified seeds by putting in place a programme, in conjunction 

with the National Institute of Agricultural Research (INPA) and seed multiplier organisations. It will also 

introduce the rational use of fertiliser to improve yields and, hence, agricultural productivity. The related 

agricultural infrastructure will be set up and designed with additional measures for adapting to climate 

change, to make them more resilient.

3.2.9 Gender: the Value Chains, Agricultural and Rural Entrepreneurship Support Project (PACVEAR) 

takes into account all the components of the gender dimension through the following activities: 

- Improvement of rice and market garden produce production and conservation 
capacity: the project will facilitate women’s access to land by allocating 30% of the rice 

fields developed and 90% of market gardening areas to women. The risk of limited access 

to land by women and youths has been taken into account as this concern will be an integral 

part of the intervention criteria, and the land issue will be systematically clarified before 

any operation (prior authorisation, land negotiation by the competent authorities, etc.).  

- Capacity building: the skills of women and youths will be developed through training in 
the use of improved seeds and rice farming, market gardening and cereal farming 

techniques.  

- Improvement of product processing and marketing capacity: the project will provide 
women’s groups with equipment for rice processing and husking (rice parboiling) and 

processing into by-products. This will lighten their workload and improve the quality of 

rice produced.  

- Awareness-raising for behaviour change: awareness and communication campaigns 
will be organised to improve the nutritional status of under-five children and pregnant 

women. The selection of themes will vary according to the needs of each project area: for 

instance, nutrition and health (family planning and reproductive health, HIV/AIDS, etc.), 

education (education of the girl child), conflict management, gender and gender-based 

violence, etc. 

Gender categorisation: PACVEAR is classified under Gender Category 2 according to the “Gender 

Marker System”. The gender analysis and action plan for implementing gender promotion and women's 

empowerment activities are presented in Annex B10 of Volume 2. 

Gender promotion activities concern: rice-growing areas (30%), market gardening areas for women 

(90%), processing equipment, drying units, promotion of women-headed small- and medium-size 

enterprises (at least 30%), promotion of gender equity and equality within farmers' organisations through 

workshops, training of members of women and mixed farmers’ organisations in farming techniques, 

leadership and gender, experience-sharing trips and equitable access to socio-economic infrastructure 

(feeder roads, storage warehouses, etc.). The budget allocated for the gender dimension is estimated at 

UA 2.786 million, i.e. approximately 27% of the total budget (cf. Annex B10, Volume 2). 

3.2.10  Nutrition: horticultural production on approximately 60 hectares of land will contribute to 

improving the nutrition of beneficiary households and have a positive impact on the health of the most 

vulnerable segments of the population, namely children and women of childbearing age. The project will 

develop initiatives to improve the hygiene and nutritional quality of food consumed by the people, 

especially women and children. It will also collaborate with RESAN for the pilot development of six 

school canteens and six school gardens. Additional peak year production of horticultural and animal 

products will contribute to making people’s food and nutrition better. Activities aimed at informing, 

raising awareness and educating on nutrition, hygiene and the prevention of the resurgence of waterborne 

diseases will also contribute to improving people’s health and nutrition. To enhance market access for 

processed products, PACVEAR will sensitise and support processing units/SMEs in upgrading 

parcelling/packaging and labelling according to standards. The budget allocated for nutrition support 

measures is UA 123 000. 

3.2.11  Social issues: the envisaged infrastructure and support for rice farming and market gardening 

will help to reduce the problems of low productivity and product conservation, and to better structure 

value chains for the benefit of beneficiaries. The project will pay particular attention to women and youths 

who are very active in rural areas, but often lack adequate training and resources. The development of 

market gardening areas primarily for women will enhance their empowerment and promote a more 

balanced diet in households. Specific support will also target women and young people in the development 

of rural entrepreneurship. In addition, training in organisational development and the structuring of FOs 

and producer unions will improve their roles in local governance and decision-making bodies, as well as 

the monitoring of the outcomes of activities promoted within such organisations.  



 

14 

The rehabilitation of feeder roads, the construction of markets and storage warehouses, and the setting up 

of small processing units will help to reduce post-harvest losses, increasing the availability of food 

products and household income. Improving access to socio-economic infrastructure will contribute to 

easing daily tasks and allow beneficiaries to engage in income-generating activities such as market 

gardening, seed production, poultry and pig farming, as well as agricultural product processing and 

marketing, including small-scale breeding.  

The jobs that will be created through the promotion of rural entrepreneurship among young people and women 

(close to 2 000 people targeted) and the establishment of many enterprises by this population segment will 

contribute to developing a business culture among people proposing projects aimed at increasing income in 

the project area, and fostering the creation of growth poles that can reduce youth urban migration, including 

attempts to immigrate.  

3.2.12  Involuntary resettlement: PACVEAR’s activities will not lead to any people displacement or 

restriction of access to property or means of livelihood. 

IV. Project Implementation 

4.1. Implementation Arrangements 

4.1.1  PACVEAR will be under the supervisory authority of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural 

Development (MADR). It will be attached to the General Directorate of Agriculture. Project piloting and 

supervision activities will be carried out by the PDCV-Riz steering committee set up by Decree No. 

1/2018 of 4 January 2018, which will be amended by ministry decision, at project start-up to take its 

specificities into account. The committee will meet once a year in ordinary session. The chairmanship 

will be ensured by the Minister MADR or his representative and the secretariat by the coordinator of the 

PMU. Also, a technical committee for monitoring the project will be set up. It will meet every three 

months to monitor project implementation, quarterly review of the activity report, as well as the technical 

program and the quarterly budget, and identify opportunities and constraints to improve project outcomes.  

4.1.2  PACVEAR will be coordinated by the PDCV-Riz Management Unit whose mandate will end in 

December 2020. This team satisfactorily implemented PDCV-Riz projects and, previously, PRESAR. It 

was also involved in PACVEAR preparation and appraisal. The PMU will be headed by the Coordinator, 

supported by the following sTSFf: an administrative and financial officer, a procurement specialist, a rural 

engineer, and an agronomist specialised in value chains, agricultural and rural entrepreneurship, and 

support sTSFf (drivers, secretaries, messengers, etc.). The team will be maintained and consolidated with 

the competitive recruitment of an environmental monitoring/evaluation specialist, a rural infrastructure 

specialist (technical assistance), a procurement specialist and an accountant. Apart from the fiduciary team 

(the Coordinator, the administrative and financial officer, the procurement specialist, the accountant, etc.) 

that will operate from project head office in Bissau, all other experts will be based at the field office in 

Bafata. 

4.1.3 The project intervention strategy will be based primarily on subcontracting. Under the 

agreements signed with the project, the national technical services (and their decentralised entities) will 

be strongly involved as project owner, works controller and supervisor, as well as executing agency, 

service provider or project manager. Private service providers (contractors, suppliers, consulting firms, 

individual consultants, etc.) will be recruited on a competitive basis and linked to the project by contracts. 

4.1.4  Applicable procurement policy and framework: the procurement of goods (including non-

consultancy services), works and consultancy services financed by the Bank under the project will be 

done in accordance with the Procurement Framework for Bank Group-funded Operations approved in 

October 2015, as well as the provisions set forth in the Financing Agreement. Specifically, procurement 

will be done in accordance with Bank Procurement Methods and Procedures (BPMPs), using relevant 

standard bidding documents (SBDs) for goods and works contracts as well as consultancy services for 

which BPMPs are considered most appropriate. An analysis of Guinea-Bissau’s procurement system as 

presented in Technical Annex B5 of this report showed that the procurement risk is substantial. As a result, 

the Bank’s Procurement Methods and Procedures will be used for PACVEAR’s implementation. A 

capacity building action plan will be discussed with the Guinea-Bissau authorities to enable the use, in 



 

15 

the short term, of the national procurement system following the conduct of reforms identified as 

necessary. 

4.1.5 Procurement risk and capacity assessment (PRCA): to take project specificities into account, 

the Bank assessed: (i) country, sector and project risks; and (ii) the executing agency’s capacity. The 

outcomes of these assessments revealed a substantial procurement risk level, and guided the decision to 

use BPMPs for all project activities. Appropriate risk mitigation measures have been included in the 

PERCA Action Plan presented in Annex B5, volume 2.  

4.1.6 Procurement arrangements: PACVEAR’s management will be under the responsibility of the 

PDCV-Riz actual management team. This institutional arrangement is the result of the desire to build on 

the achievements of the key sTSFf of this ongoing Bank-funded project. It is worth pointing out that the 

team had already implemented other Bank projects, including PRESAR. Support from a procurement 

expert was deemed necessary in view of the workload that will have to be added to the procurement 

activities of PDCV-Riz. The current team will be strengthened with the competitive recruitment of an 

environmental monitoring/evaluation specialist, a rural infrastructure specialist (technical assistance), a 

procurement specialist and an accountant. All experts will sign a performance contract that will be subject 

to an annual performance review. 

4.1.7  Financial management: the project implementation team will be responsible for the 

administrative, financial and accounting management of PACVEAR. The team will monitor and supervise 

project implementation, and should have sufficient technical, human and material resources to set up an 

efficient internal control system and an acceptable financial management system, particularly through 

proper and exhaustive recording of all transactions carried out during the project cycle, the safekeeping 

of financial information and assets, and information on and audit of the resources provided.  

The assessment of the PDCV-Riz implementation unit’s capacity revealed that it has the minimum 

capability and tools for proper recording of funds and accountability. However, given the unit’s duty to 

manage many projects simultaneously, it shall be strengthened with additional human resources, 

particularly an accountant experienced in managing development projects implemented using a private 

accrual accounting system. The accountant shall be recruited through open call for applications based on 

Bank rules and procedures. The recruitment will be monitored by the Bank's Fiduciary Services and 

Inspection Department (SNFI), which shall validate both the integrity of the process and the accountant's 

qualifications. 

The project administrative, accounting and financial procedures manual has already exist in PDCV-Riz. 

This document should be reviewed to take into account the multi-project management dimension of the 

executing agency and submitted to the Bank for approval. The manual will take PACVEAR’s components 

and categories into account. It will also include the general, budgetary and analytical accounting plans, 

the accounting principles and methods, as well as all applicable posting details.  

An integrated accounting and financial management software is also available. It should be reconfigured 

to make it multi-project, multi-user, multi-currency and multi-donor, thereby enabling the production of 

general, analytical and budgetary data required for financial and accounting monitoring, i.e. for producing 

financial statements by expenditure component, category and activity; and by source of financing for 

resources. At the minimum, the software should have the following modules: (i) general accounting; (ii) 

budget management; (iii) contract management; (iv) tangible assets management; (v) financial 

monitoring, etc. It will also be configured to have the three (3) levels of registration, validation and 

approval. At the end of the year, the software should help to obtain summary annual financial statements 

comprising a table of resource applications for the year, together with a balance sheet, a statement of 

special account reconciliation, and notes to the financial statements, among others. It will also allow for 

the monitoring of budget execution. 

Accounts will be kept based on the private accrual accounting system and using an integrated software 

adapted to development project management. The accounting plan will be drawn up based on the 

accounting standards of the revised Uniform Act of the Organization for the Harmonisation of African 

Business Law (OHADA) in force in Guinea-Bissau.   

Lastly, the project will produce an annual work programme and budget (AWPB) that will take into account 

all funding from all partners, as well as quarterly financial management reports based on the 



 

16 

implementation of the annual work programme and budget, and appended to the quarterly progress reports 

submitted to the Bank, in which a clear analysis must be made between budget forecasts and executions 

for the quarter. Any gaps should be analysed and explained.  

4.1.8  Disbursements: the Bank’s resources will be disbursed according to its rules of procedure, 

notably the disbursement manual. Disbursements will be made through the following three methods 

presented in detail in the project Appraisal Report (Annex B4 Volume 2): (i) the special account method; 

(ii) the direct payment method; and (iii) the reimbursement method. 

4.1.9 Auditing: the internal audit function as well as the PACVEAR internal control system will be 

assessed once or twice yearly by the General Inspectorate of Finance (IGF), depending on project risk 

assessment. An agreement will be prepared for that purpose and submitted for the Bank's no-objection 

opinion. An institutional support in the form of IT software and hardware will also be provided to the 

IGF. The external audit of project accounts will be conducted by an independent audit firm acceptable to 

the Bank and based on terms of reference agreed beforehand with the Bank. The recruitment of the 

external auditor will be in accordance with the Bank’s rules and procedures for the use of consultants. The 

auditor will be required to submit his/her report within six months following the close of the financial 

year audited. 

 

4.2. Monitoring 

4.2.1  Monitoring mechanisms: the project’s monitoring and evaluation system will be designed in 

relation to the expected impacts, outcomes and outputs contained in the project logical framework. The 

system will be participatory and will provide regular relevant information on performance and impact 

indicators as well as on the implementation of activities scheduled. A baseline situation will be 

established, based on the identified and selected sites many of which have already been studied. The 

monitoring and evaluation framework will systematically include gender-disaggregated data. 

Furthermore, targeted surveys will be conducted to better understand issues relating to income, food 

security, nutrition, job creation, gender mainstreaming, vulnerability and resilience. The information 

collected will be fed into the computerised monitoring and evaluation system to capture the actual values 

of project activities and inputs, and gauge project outcomes and impacts. In turn, these will be recorded 

in periodic progress reports highlighting the project implementation status and the achievement of 

outcomes.  

The Bank and MADR will supervise project implementation through a reinforced internal monitoring 

technical committee. Given the country’s weak capacity and fragility, the Bank, as part of its new 

development and business delivery model, will closely monitor all activities, especially by fielding 

periodic supervision missions (twice yearly).

4.3. Governance 

4.3.1  Guinea-Bissau’s political, economic and social governance indicators remain mixed, in spite of 

the progress made in recent years. As regards political governance, it is necessary to find lasting solutions 

to possible conflicts and establish mechanisms for ensuring justice. Guinea-Bissau’s governance and anti-

corruption performance is low, due generally to frequent political and institutional crises. In 2018, the 

country was ranked 42nd out of 54 countries in the Mo Ibrahim Index of African Governance (and 
particularly the 42th in the rule of law sub-indicator), which is a slight improvement over the last three 

years. In the area of economic governance, particularly in public financial management, the country’s 
performance has deteriorated because of the crisis and the capacity to mobilise domestic resources remains 

weak, as noted in the Bank’s analysis on the governance of projects approved in 2015 and in the 2016 
Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) scores.  

4.3.2  As part of PACVEAR’s implementation, and in an effort to mitigate the risks inherent in the 

weaknesses and instability of the administration and improve project quality-at-entry, it was decided to 

maintain the PMU of the ongoing PDCV-Riz since the unit is already conversant with Bank procedures, 

and to build on existing implementation studies. Moreover, although progress has been made in aligning 

the public procurement system with WAEMU directives, the bureaucracy characterising the procurement 

system is still one of the main challenges in implementing development programmes. Regarding 

procurement, operational arrangements were adopted to address the weaknesses noted. 

4.3.3  With regard to professional organisation in Guinea-Bissau, much remains to be done to promote 

effective rural stakeholder representative institutions. Producers are organised within professional 

agricultural organisations, including the National Association of Farmers of Guinea Bissau (ANAG) and 

the National Consultation Framework of the Farmers’ and Agricultural Producers’ Organization of 

Guinea-Bissau (QNCOCPA/GB). In addition, due to lack of resources, the activities of these organisations 

have had limited impact on their members, particularly in producer management and training. Many local, 

cultural, youth and women's associations are also present, and a large number of producer groups have 

been set up, with some of them already well organised. They are indispensable relays for support to small 

producers and the professionalisation of farmers. Nevertheless, the development of these associations is 

facing various constraints, including: (i) legislation that is ill-adapted to the current conditions of 

producing, processing and marketing products; (ii) difficulties in obtaining legal recognition; (iii) lack of 

training of managers in management and facilitation; (iv) lack of access to technical and market 

information; and (v) poor knowledge of legislation, particularly as regards the taxation system. 

PACVEAR is intended to better structure and organise producers and value chains stakeholders by 

strengthening and empowering community entities that represent the target beneficiaries. 

4.4. Sustainability 

4.4.1  The sustainability of project investments relates mostly to the capacity of the beneficiaries to 

ensure infrastructure maintenance and management regularly and over time. Irrigation, pastoral and 

support infrastructure management committees will be set up prior to the start of the construction of each 

facility, and are expected to facilitate community mobilisation and participation. Management committee 

members will receive organisational, technical and facility management support to enable them to 

supervise the work of contractors, in collaboration with the project team and the works control firm. The 

involvement of these committees in close works monitoring and acceptance will enhance their ownership 

of infrastructure built, thus resulting in greater sustainability. The project will also organise exchange 

visits to other facilities by management committee members.  

4.4.2  The project will build the capacity of young local artisans in routine infrastructure and equipment 

maintenance (cleaning of canals, maintenance of pumps, cleaning of irrigation basins, etc.) and provide 

them with kits for these operations. These local artisans could operate as maintenance service providers 

and will be easy to mobilise in case of breakdown.  

Beneficiaries, particularly producer groups, farmers' organisations and management committees, will also 

be structured, in collaboration with technical partners. The managerial, accounting and logistical capacity 

of these entities will be built to enable them to continue to provide services over time. Project-driven 

development of local expertise will promote long-lasting technical capacity, thus guaranteeing 

infrastructure sustainability.

4.5. Risk Management 

The potential risks and proposed mitigation measures are presented in the table below. 

Risks Risk Level Mitigating Measures 

Political instability, due to a difficult 

economic situation  

High Contribution to improving socio-economic and 

environmental resilience for greater stability.  

Climatic instability, with direct effects on 

agricultural, livestock production and 

development 

Low Storage and water control facilities, resistant seeds; 

Use of short-cycle and high-yielding species.

project implementation. 

Low project ownership by stakeholders and 

beneficiaries 
Low 

Involvement and participation of beneficiaries in all 

capacity building stages (producers, MADR). 

Outbreak of plant diseases 
Moderate 

Training of producers in plant disease management and 

ecologically appropriate use of pesticides. 

Low capacity of implementation partners 

and contractors, resulting in poor 

performance and delays in project 

implementation 

Moderate 

Careful selection of implementation partners and 

contractors. 

Close control of partners and works contractors by the PIU 

and consulting firms, the technical monitoring committee, 

the beneficiary management committee and the PMU. 

4.6. Knowledge Building 

PACVEAR will contribute to the development and consolidation of producer expertise.  Adopting an 

inclusive approach, it will enable young people and women to develop technical and entrepreneurial 

capacity by settling on land with modern farming infrastructure and resources. The project will also help 

to generate knowledge that will be used to create many jobs by upgrading incubation centres that could 

train and support young people wishing to engage in agribusiness. Moreover, it will support the Food and 

Nutrition Security Information System (SISSAN) in collecting and processing data that will be used to 

formulate sound sector policies. Furthermore, the project’s specific contribution to structuring the seed 

sector with the introduction of Technologies for African Agricultural Transformation (TAAT) will 

generate knowledge that will enhance production techniques, thus increasing production. The 

establishment of demonstration units, the dissemination of best practice, the introduction of solar 

technology into dewatering and processing systems, and the preservation of agricultural products will 

further strengthen the sector. 

PACVEAR will support MADR in preparing strategic and sector discussion themes through external 

service providers. The themes  include: (i) agricultural sector institutional study; (ii) diagnostic of the 

performance of youth incubation centres (ADPP and COAJOQ) and support for their evolution into pilot 

incubation centres; (iii) youth agricultural and rural entrepreneurship promotion strategy: potentials and 

constraints; (iv) support for updating legislation and veterinary regulations; and (v) support for the 

collection, processing and dissemination of data on the Food and Nutrition Security Information System 

(SISSAN).  

As regards communication and visibility of project actions, there will be: (i) awareness-raising and 

information dissemination through various communication channels (community radios, media 

programmes, website, films, etc.); and (ii) promotion of innovative youth and women's employability 

actions and activities to build the resilience of vulnerable groups to food and nutrition insecurity. 

V. Legal Framework 

5.1. Legal Instrument 

The legal framework of the project will be a grant protocol agreement and two loan agreements signed 

between the Republic of Guinea-Bissau and the Bank.  

5.2. Conditions for Bank Intervention

IV 

Annex IV: Fragility Context 

1.  Fragility in Guinea-Bissau is reflected by the gap between the State and the society, with weak 

State institutions and a weak State presence outside of Bissau, which renders the State ineffective in the 

eyes of many citizens. Furthermore, the military is strongly engaged in political and economic spheres, 

the justice sector is weak and the economy is undiversified and captured by elite interests. Guinea-Bissau’s 

fragility factors, which considerably impede the development of its institutions and inhabitants, can be 

summed up in five key areas: (i) an endemic lack of governance and functional institutions, fuelled by 

political instability and elite capture; (ii) a dysfunctional and politicised security sector; (iii) a captured 

and undiversified shock-prone economy; ( (iv) a gap between urban and rural areas resulting in acute lack 

of infrastructure and services; and (v) lack of investment in human development and human capital.  

2.  In Guinea-Bissau, poverty is both a symptom and a cause of political instability and violence. 

Decades of political instability and weak capacity of social and economic institutions have created an 

environment that undermines development and makes the country one of the poorest in the world. The 

dominant role of the cashew sector is a key structural challenge in Guinea-Bissau. Cashew is the most 

important agricultural product in the country, accounting for more than 90% of total exports. About 80% 

of the population relies on cashew nuts as the main source of income, which they exchange for rice (staple 

food) or other consumer goods. Although Guinea-Bissau has the potential to produce its own rice, most 

of its rice fields are not under cultivation, and the country imports most of its rice. 

The exploitation of natural resources, including agriculture (cashew), fisheries and forestry, is 

affected by rent-seeking behaviour because of weak controls and lack of monitoring. By limiting the 

number of export licences, many sector decrees issued by the Council of Ministers in 2017 also reflect 

weak governance and rent-seeking comportment in the public sector, particularly with regard to cashew. 

3. The weakness of State institutions and the lack of State presence outside of Bissau are a deciding 

factor of fragility, which has rendered the State ineffective in providing services, thus creating mistrust 

between citizens and the State. Today, 40% of the population lives in Bissau, which enjoys greater access 

to public services and has a relatively low poverty rate, with 50% of its population living below the 

national poverty line (USD 2 a day). The national average of people living below the national poverty line 

is 70%, suggesting that 80-90% of Guinea-Bissau's poor people live in rural areas. The incidence of 

poverty in rural areas is higher in the north where most of the rural population is concentrated. The few 

local services (water, education and health care) are often provided by non-State actors. The lack of socio-

economic opportunities among youths may increase social unrest and riots. About 60% of Guinea-Bissau's 

population is under 25, has not benefited from a functional education system and stands a very slim chance 

of entering the formal economy which, in any case, offers very few jobs. 

4. In spite of the significant progress made over the past fifteen years, Guinea-Bissau's human 

development indicators are still among the lowest in the world. In 2017, Guinea-Bissau was ranked 178th 

in the Human Development Index. Guinea-Bissau's GDP per capita is USD 723 and life expectancy at 

birth is 57.8 years, or three years below the average of sub-Saharan African countries. The level of 

employment in the formal sector is low and youth unemployment is very high. Due to the precarious 

nature of Guinea-Bissau’s institutions and discriminatory traditional practices, women's access to services 

is quite limited, particularly in terms of education, as reflected in literacy rates below the national average. 

Women in Guinea-Bissau are disproportionately affected by human rights violations, especially sexual 

and gender-based violence, discrimination in the workplace, child marriage, etc. More than 48% of 

women have been subjected to genital mutilation despite the 2011 law banning the practice. 

5. These fragility factors notwithstanding, the country has sources of resilience and other factors 

capable of neutralising fragility drivers that the government, the Bank and other development actors 

should strengthen to prevent further instability. They include: (i) regional integration within regional 

organisations and West African regional markets; (ii) a vibrant civil society; and (iii) community 

solidarity. 



 

V 

6. PACVEAR will help to reduce fragility by applying the following measures during its design 

and implementation stages: (i) strengthen non-State actors such as grassroots associations, local NGOs 

and the private sector in terms of their economic and social commitments; (ii) strengthen dialogue with 

the Government of Guinea-Bissau, as well as with other TFPs to keep abreast of developments in the 

political and security situation, and factor political risks into the project's monitoring and evaluation 

system; (iii) ensure that the project takes account of social sensitivities by seeing to it that certain segments 

of the society are not left out and especially that gender equity is taken into account when making 

decisions related to access to land at community level; (iv) ensure that the project includes ancillary 

activities aimed at empowering the most vulnerable segments of society; (v) under the project, implement 

activities to raise awareness among and empower residents of the project area concerning good nutrition 

practices and ways of achieving food security; and (vi) contribute to the creation of sustainable jobs, 

especially for young people.

PROGRAMME SUMMARY 

General Overview: The Republic of Guinea covers an area of 245,857 km² and had an 

estimated population of about 11,555,061 in 2017, comprising 51.61% women and 48.39% 

men. The rural population, estimated at 64.41%, derives most of its income (79%) from 

agricultural activities. There is, however, a marked contrast between the country’s economic 

situation and its natural potential. In addition to its mineral wealth, there are significant surface 

water (188 km3) resources and 72 km3 of groundwater. Estimated arable land potential is 6.2 

million hectares, of which 25% are cultivated annually. According to 1993 estimates, there were 

70,000 km² of rich and varied grazing land composed of almost 350 fodder species. The country 

has about 300 km of coastline with significant artisanal and industrial fisheries potential. 

However, Guinea’s imports of fresh food products are valued at almost USD 745 million 

(2016), most of which can be produced locally, in particular, cereals with an import value of 

USD 339 million in 2016. 

In order to reverse this trend and boost sustainable development, the Government has launched 

many development initiatives on the basis of growth sources and lessons learned from past 

decades, including Vision 2040, reflected in the Plan for Economic and Social Development 

(PNDES).  The PNDES is being implemented through the National Agricultural Development 

Policy (PNDA) whose implementing instrument is the National Agricultural Investment, Food 

and Nutrition Security Plan (PNIASAN). PDZTA is the 1st phase of a programme of ten (10) 

agrihubs under the PNIASAN and is intended to strengthen economic activity in the Boké and 

Kankan regions, particularly in agriculture, livestock, fisheries, forestry, industry, mines, 

handicrafts, trade, catering, hotels, banks, etc. Over 80% of these activities are carried out in 

the informal sector. Cereal production is very important as well as market garden and food 

crops. These regions are considered to be cereal basins and provide real opportunities for the 

supply of maize, the manufacture of cattle and poultry feed but also of fortified cereals to reduce 

chronic malnutrition. The establishment of storage facilities and a processing zone for 

aggregating cereal products, in particular maize and even sesame, might boost the agricultural 

sector in these two regions that lack commercial and road infrastructure and have limited 

opportunities for reaching outlets. Other crops such as mangoes and cashew nuts are becoming 

increasingly important. Since there is no processing unit in the region, most of the output is 

exported as raw products. 

The Bank’s intervention will contribute to the development of two (2) major regions in Guinea 

with an administrative area of about 103,333 km², of which 31,186 hectares lie in the Boké 

Region with an arable land area of about 2,720,000 ha, of which 800,000 ha lie in the Boké 

Region alone.  The programme will cover about 110,000 ha throughout the entire programme 

area (PA) and have a significant impact on about 220,000 direct beneficiaries and 670,000 

indirect beneficiaries, 50.7% of whom will be women. 

Needs Assessment: The programme area covers the two (2) regions of Boké and Kankan, 

whose hydro-agricultural and socio-economic potential warrants the establishment of a 

production and processing system for agricultural products which constitute these regions’ 

potential.  The programme is based on the establishment of agro-parks for the upstream 

processing of production and to serve as outlets for agricultural products, thereby contributing 

to an all-round drop in imports of agro-food products whose volume and amounts are 

approaching worrisome levels.  

 



 

 

 

v 

In accordance with its strategic directions, the country will contribute to the processing of 

agricultural products while improving productivity and production in growth sectors, resulting 

in a reduction in the imports of various agro-food products, with as main outcome the 

transformation of Guinean agriculture and improvement of food and nutrition security. 

Bank’s Value Added:  The PDZTA-BK’s objective is to provide Guinea with support to   

implement its agricultural transformation process by promoting private investments by 

establishing conditions and implementing a wide range of incentive measures that will attract 

national and international private sector investors to the Boké and Kankan agro-industrial parks.  

These conditions and measures concern: (i) the implementation of measures likely to create an 

enabling environment for the establishment of agro-industrial enterprises in the parks; (ii) the 

establishment of long-term smart infrastructure to facilitate the installation of private operators, 

their operations and transactions linked to their activities; and (iii) improved operation of 

growth-bearing sectors. This innovative approach was proposed as the flagship programme of 

the Bank’s 2016-2025 ‘Feed Africa’ Strategy  known under the flagship’s programme name of 

‘Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zones’ (SAPZs). Its proposed approach is to increase 

private investment in the agricultural sector through the creation of favourable conditions by 

central government, an area in which the Bank has both experience and expertise. It can also 

mobilise its domestic financial resources as well as additional resources from its technical and 

financial partners and private banks on the basis of its Triple A rating. The Bank has also 

acquired experience in setting up such operations in Togo, Ethiopia, DRC, Zambia and 

Tanzania.  It will, therefore, be able to roll out this operation with every chance of success.  

Knowledge Building and Management: Implementation of the Special Agro-Industrial 

Processing Zones Development Project (PDZTA-BK) will help to build a body of knowledge 

that could be replicated throughout the programme to develop ten (10) agricultural development 

hubs in the country including those of Boké and Kankan. This will concern knowledge on: 

(i) the most effective way of working with the private sector, either on the basis of a PPP 

formula or in the form of a non-sovereign operation (NSO) or a combination of the two 

formulae ; (ii) a multi-sector approach involving the intervention of sectors such as transport, 

energy, water and sanitation, agribusiness, agriculture, communication (NICT), education, 

health and nutrition, employment and trade; (iii) a combination of: (a) two of the Bank’s 

strategies, namely ‘Feed Africa’  and ‘Jobs for Youth’ to enhance the skills of youth, and (b) at 

least  four (04) flagship programmes , namely, the Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zones 

(SAPZs), Technologies for African Agricultural Transformation (TAAT), Agricultural Value 

Chains (AVC), Post-Harvest Losses Reduction and ENABLE Youth programmes.  (iv) product 

processing, as a great challenge for which solutions will be sought under this programme; 

(v) employment in general and in the agricultural sector in particular, as a solution proposed in 

the Programme; and (vi) a contribution to the reduction of massive imports of agro-food 

products by the Continent, and by Guinea, in particular.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE MANAGEMENT OF THE BANK 

GROUP TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS ON A PROGRAMME TO DEVELOP 

THE BOKÉ AND KANKAN SPECIAL AGRO-INDUSTRIAL PROCESSING ZONES 

Management submits this report and its recommendation on a proposed ADF loan of UA 2.99 

million, an ADF grant of UA 2.94 million (including UA 331,461 from cancelled resources) 

and a TSF loan of UA 3.69 million from the ADF country allocation to the Government of 

Guinea to finance the activities of the PDZTA_BK, the first phase of Guinea’s Agri-hub 

Development Programme. 

I. STRATEGIC THRUST AND RATIONALE 

1.1 Programme Linkages with Country Strategy and Objectives 

1.1.1 The Programme is consistent with Pillar 2 of the National Plan for Economic and 

Social Development (PNDES) 2016-2020, i.e. sustainable and inclusive economic 

transformation that will result in the establishment of development hubs in Boké and Kankan 

based on agricultural potential which is one of the major assets of Guinea and these regions. It 

also has a strategic linkage with the three (3) other PNDES pillars: (i) Pillar 1: Promoting good 

governance for sustainable development by promoting good governance of the country’s 

agricultural wealth; (ii) Pillar 3: Inclusive development of the human capital by investing in it 

in order to take charge of the development of Guinea’s Special Agro-Industrial Processing 

Zones; and (iii) Pillar 4: sustainable management of natural capital by ensuring that agricultural 

development hubs are not established at the expense of natural resources.  

1.1.2 At sector level, the PNDES is implemented through the National Agricultural 

Development Policy (PNDA) whose implementing instrument is the National Agricultural 

Investment and Food and Nutrition Security Plan (PNIASAN) 2018-2025 which itself is in 

keeping with the Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zones Development Programme (PDZTA-

BK) through its priority activities which are the development of plant, animal and fisher y   

products. Therefore, PDZTA-BK is, , an operational means of focusing efforts on achieving a 

6% growth rate of agricultural value added and a central government budget allocation of 10% 

to the agricultural sector (Maputo Commitment). PDZTA-BK is, therefore, fully aligned with 

the country’s strategic objectives. 

1.2 Programme Alignment with Bank Policy 

1.2.1 This programme is considered as a priority by the Bank as part of its  strategic choice 

of transforming Guinean agriculture as reflected in Pillar 2 of the 2018-2022 CSP concerning 

the development of agricultural and industrial value chains. It is also consistent with the Bank’s 

second strategic thrust, its Strategy for Agricultural Transformation in Africa (2016-2025) [the  

2016-2025 ‘Feed Africa’ Strategy], one of the Bank’s Hi-5s, which are to: (i) Light Up and 

Power Africa; (ii) Feed Africa; (iii) Industrialise Africa; (iv) Integrate Africa; and (v) Improve 

the quality of life for the people of Africa. The programme’s alignment with the Bank’s policy 

is further underscored by the fact that it will help to boost the transformation of Guinea’s 

agriculture, industrialisation and increase Guinea’s energy capacity.  More specifically, it is 

fully in keeping with the promotion of smart agriculture and product enhancement on every 

link in the priority value chains promoted under this operation.

1.3 Rationale for Bank’s Involvement 

1.3.1 Like most RMCs, Guinea imports most of its fresh food products which are valued at 
almost USD 745 million (2016), most of which can be produced locally, in particular, cereals 

with an import value of USD 339 million in 2016. However, Guinea has strong agricultural 

potential, particularly in terms of its abundant land and water resources, a 43,000 km2 

continental shelf and enjoys mild temperatures providing it with significant opportunities for 

the development of a varied range of agro-silvo-pastoral products and significant potential for 

the development of a blue economy. The Bank has defined 5 operational priorities for such a 

situation, one of whose four objectives is to reduce imports and make Africa a net exporter. 

Guinea has, therefore, followed in the Bank’s footsteps with different strategies aimed at 

addressing this situation by developing Guinea’s agricultural potential, by establishing long-

term infrastructure in the areas of transport, energy, agricultural production, marketing and 

processing with private sector involvement in the sector. 

1.3.2 The Bank’s interventions, through the PDZTA-BK, which is the first phase of a 
programme of ten (10) agro-hubs, are consistent with the Bank’s CSP (2018-2022) and Hi-5s. 

The programme will help to effectively boost economic development since it is consistent with   

the Bank’s strategies by consolidating the role of the private sector and communities in rural 

development, a guarantee of inclusiveness in Africa, and in Guinea, in particular.  It was, 

moreover, designed on the basis of complementarities with ongoing operations and those under 

preparation, especially those relating to implementation of the Boké-Québo Road Project and 

the Support Programme for the Transformation of Guinean Agriculture and Youth Agricultural 

Entrepreneurship (PATAG-EAJ), with a view to seeking synergies. This programme will, 

therefore, seek to leverage the ongoing actions in the Boké and Kankan Regions to ensure the 

operation’s relevance and effectiveness. 

1.4 Aid Coordination 

1.4.1 Development aid is coordinated by the Government of Guinea through the Coordination 
and Consultation Framework (CCF) at the level of the Permanent Secretariat at the Office of the 

Prime Minister. All the TFPs align their operations with those of the Guinean Government. While 

implementing the PNDES 2016-2020, the Government affirmed its will to strengthen aid 

coordination by setting up consultation mechanisms. In addition to the Coordination and 

Consultation Framework (CCF), which is the strategic coordination forum between the Government 

and the TFP, a Technical Monitoring Committee (TMC) has been set up to strengthen inter-sector 

coordination and Thematic Dialogue Groups (TDGs) established, bringing together TFP and 

government representatives at sector level. The ‘rural development, food security and environment’ 

thematic group is chaired by the World Bank representing the TFP and the Ministry of Agriculture 

for the Government. 

1.4.2 The Bank, through COGN, is an active member of the CCF and some TDGs. The key 
ongoing programmes supported by the TFPs with an Agricultural Value Chain (AVC) 

component with which the PDZTA must seek synergies are contained in Volume 2. These 

are: (i) the Agri-hub G Agricultural Development Support Programme (PADAG –Abu Dhabi 

Fund); (ii) the Family Farming, Resilience and Markets Programme in Upper and 

Middle Guinea (AgriFARM - IFAD) ; (iii) the World Bank’s Guinea Integrated Agricultural 

Development Programme (PDAIG); (iv) the WB’s Agricultural Sector Support Programme 

(PASAG); (v) the World Bank’s Enclave Programme for Agribusiness Development in the 

Boké Region, being prepared for 2019; (vi) the JICA (Japan) Rice Sub-Sector Technical 

Assistance Operation; (vii) the USAID Guinea Agricultural Services (GAS) Programme; and 

(viii)  the Programme for the Socio-Economic Integration of Guinean Youth (INTEGRA-ITC).

1.4.3 The programme is also designed in phases and on the basis of complementarities with 
the Bank’s programmes, in particular, the Boké-Québo Road Construction Programme with a 

rural roads component for access to agricultural production zones and the Support Programme   

for the Transformation of Guinean Agriculture and Youth Agricultural Entrepreneurship  

(PATAG-EAJ). This first phase that only involves the Bank will be followed by others, 

gradually mobilising several technical and financial partners (TFP).

II. PROGRAMME DESCRIPTION  

2.1 Programme Components 

2.1.1 The Boké and Kankan Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zones Development 

Programme (PDZSTA-BK) is the first phase of a programme to develop ten (10) agrihubs. Its 

goal is to contribute to the reduction of food imports and improve Guinea’s food and nutrition 

security by establishing private sector-driven agro-industrial development hubs. The 

programme will be implemented through the following three (3) components: (i) Establishment 

of governance in the Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zones (APZ); (ii) Development of 

processing and access infrastructure; and (iii) Programme coordination and management.  

 

2.1.2 The programme will build on production activities as well as those concerning the 

establishment of access and marketing infrastructure for operations that are starting up or being 

prepared for 2019, upstream of the agro-industrial parks, for the supply of raw materials in the 

first phase. In Boké Region, these programmes are the Bank’s PTAG-EAJ programme (UA 

8.99 million), the Bank (UA 40.04 million) and European Union (EUR 20.38 million) Boké-

Québo Programme and the World Bank’s Enclave Programme for Agribusiness Development 

(USD 50.00 million).  In the Kankan region, these are the IFAD AgriFarm (USD 61 million) 

ABEDA (USD 20 million) and OFID (USD15.00 million) Programmes.  Additional financing 

is, therefore, required in equivalent amounts of USD 137.57 and USD 96 million for the Boké 

and Kankan regions. The first phase of the programme will not be exposed to the risk of lack 

of agro-park production or supply if the actions are well coordinated between the different 

sectors and technical and financial partners.

2.2 Technical Solutions Retained and Other Alternatives Explored 

2.2.1 The PDZTA-BK’s objective is to approach the key issue of the transformation of 

Guinean agriculture, through an approach that puts the private sector in a leadership role 

while the public sector attempts to create incentive conditions that are likely to attract 

private investors to fully developed and serviced agro-industrial parks. It is necessary to 

adopt an agricultural development approach based on Special Agro -Industrial Processing 

Zones (APZ). The APZs for spatial development initiatives are based on agriculture and 

designed to concentrate agricultural processing activities in areas of high agricultural 

potential in order to boost productivity and integrate the production, processing and 

marketing of a number of agricultural crops. These initiatives may or may not enjoy Special 

Economic Zone status. They contribute to the operationalisation of the ‘agricultural value 



 

 

5 

 

chain’ concept by giving it content, i.e. : (i) agricultural production sites in compliance with 

the required standards through the Technologies for African Agricultural Transformation 

(TAAT) Programme which proposes cutting-edge technological innovations adapted to 

production conditions; (ii) agro-industrial parks for the processing of raw materials from 

the production sites serving as outlets for agricultural output; (iii) establishment of  key 

physical and smart infrastructure for connections to markets and major mass consumption 

centres countrywide and outside the country.  In some cases, they are also known as Agro-

Industrial, Agribusiness parks, Mega Supply Parks, agro-hubs and agro-clusters, etc. 

2.2.2 The approach is integrated and pragmatic, innovative and inclusive in all the 

agricultural value chain links and is wealth-creating through the jobs it generates but also   

because it contains foreign exchange outflows due to a reduction in imports of agro-food 

products. It is the focus of efforts of all the other sectors that contribute to the success of 

agricultural development, in particular, the industrial, transport, energy, water and NICT 

sectors, including within the Bank. It also incorporates the interventions of the other 

development partners in a systematic bid to seek synergy-creating complementarity.  In the 

case of the PDZTA-BK, this concerns the World Bank, IFAD, the European Union, AFD 

and the Abu Dhabi Fund. 

2.2.3 The APZ approach also focuses on support from the key actors of promising sub-

sectors through the implementation of a capacity building programme to develop specific 

advanced skills to meet the programme’s requirements. 

2.2.4 In the case of the PDZTA-BK, the main crops and stock farming activities concern 

(i) cash crops such as cashews, oil palms, sesame and soya; (ii) food products such as rice, 

fonio, groundnuts, maize, potatoes, yams and cassava ; (iii) fruit such as oranges, mangoes 

and pineapples; (iv) market garden products, in particular, tomatoes, onions, okra and 

chillies; (v) poultry and sheep breeding; (vi) fishery products from fish farming; (vi) non-

wood forest products such as honey, leaves, wild seeds and fruit, oils and resins, infusions, 

etc. 

2.2.5 The APZ technical solutions break with the traditional approach adopted to 

improve productivity, production and sales without specifying the content . 

Table 2.2  

ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS EXPLORED AND REASONS FOR REJECTION  

ALTERNATIVE 

SOLUTION 
BRIEF DESCRIPTION REASONS FOR REJECTION 

Traditional approach for 
agricultural programmes 

Approach aimed at improving productivity, 
production and sales  

This approach has no value chain content 
and is, therefore, constrained by the reality 
on the ground concerning the key issues of 
processing, markets and outlets. 

Mono-sector agriculture-
based approach 

Sector approach based solely on agricultural 
activities  

It does not integrate the other development 
sectors that impact on agricultural 
development and thus constitute factors for 

that sector’s success.  

Mainly use of Bank’s 
public resources 

The programmes are mainly financed from 
the Bank’s and Government’s public 
resources 

AVC financing needs exceed the Bank’s 
public resources for they include private 
sector financing, co-financing by 
development partners and non-sovereign 
operations. 

Extension of 

technological innovations 
using the traditional 
method of training and 
visits to producers 

Approach based on regular visits to producers  

in accordance with a specific schedule and a 
supervisory framework with tools such as the 
contact group (CG), observation point (OP) 
and the system study point (SSP) 

In addition to being cumbersome and costly, 

this method has shown its limitations in the 
past and is less effective is less effective 
than the client-supplier system that focuses 
on skill development in all the relevant 
areas of activity.

2.3 Programme Type 

The Special Agro-Industrial Processing Development Programme (PDZTA-BK) is a public 

investment programme aimed at creating the required conditions for increasing private 

investment in value added creating sub-sectors, especially regarding agricultural product 

processing, the supply of inputs and provision of agricultural and marketing services.  This 

programme will be implemented in several phases on the basis successive ADF allocations and 

the mobilisation of additional donor resources. 

2.4 Programme Cost and Financing Arrangements 

2.4.1 Programme Cost: The total programme cost for the ten (10) Special Agro-Industrial 

Processing Zones (SAPZ) is estimated at around UA 550 million (about USD 758 million), the 

first phase of which was appraised at UA 120.84 million (GNF 1,535.75 billion), including a 

pilot phase.  The total cost of the pilot phase which fully covers Boké and partly Kankan, is 

estimated at UA 12.04 million (GNF 152.92 billion), excluding taxes and customs duties. These 

costs comprise UA 7.19 million (GNF 91.32 billion) in foreign exchange and UA 4.85 million 

in local currency (GNF 61.65 billion). They include provisions for physical contingencies and 

financial contingencies which are respectively estimated at an average of 3% and 4 %.  The 

provision for financial contingencies was estimated on the basis of current and forecast average 

annual inflation rates for respective local currency and foreign exchange costs of 8.0 % and 

1.8 %. The provision for physical contingencies is estimated at between 0 and 7 %. A summary 

of the programme’s estimated cost by component and expenditure category is presented in the 

Tables below, including the detailed costs. The first phase of the programme will concern the 

establishment of APZ governance and the total or partial completion of the respective agro-

parks of Boké and Kankan.  The programme will be rolled out gradually, as and when the 

additional resources are mobilised.  The pilot and first two phases will cover Boké and Kankan.

2.5 Programme Target Area and Beneficiaries 

The Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zones Development Programme (PDZTA) covers two 

regions and the Bank’s intervention will contribute to the development of two (2) major regions 

in Guinea with an administrative area of about 103,333 km², of which 31,186 hectares lie in the 

Boké Region with an arable land area of about 2,720,000 ha, about 800,000 ha of which lie 

solely in the Boké Region.  The programme will cover about 110,000 ha throughout the entire 

programme area (PA) and have a considerable impact on about 220,000 direct beneficiaries and 

670,000 indirect beneficiaries, of whom 50.7% will be women. It concerns the Kankan Region 

in Upper Guinea where several small and medium-sized agro-food enterprises have been set up 

including the Guinea Fruit Corporation, Maden Mining Ltd, Diaoune Agro-Industry and the 

Coopération des professionnels agricoles de Guinée (Guinean agricultural professional 

organisation) (CPA-G) and the Boké Region where agro-food SMEs are also developing. 

Economically, the region is very dynamic as a result of the mining of minerals by Chinese and 

American companies.  

The Bank’s intervention will contribute to the development of two (2) major regions in Guinea 

with an administrative area of about 103,333 km², of which 31,186 hectares lie in the Boké 

Region with an arable land area of about 2,720,000 ha, of which 800,000 ha lie solely in the 

Boké Region.  The programme will cover about 110,000 ha throughout the entire programme 

area (PA) and have a considerable impact on about 220,000 direct beneficiaries and 670,000 

indirect beneficiaries, 50.7% of whom will be women 

2.6 Participatory Process for Programme Identification, Design and 
 Implementation 

2.6.1 A consultation-based participatory process was the guiding principle for the project’s 

design. It was adopted for discussions and consultations with officials from the Ministries 

concerned (agriculture, industry, transport, energy, trade, etc.), public administrations, the 

private sector,  local authorities (of Kankan and Boké), producer organisations, civil society 

and TFP (World Bank, AFD, IFAD, European Union, Chinese and Japanese Cooperation and 

the Abu Dhabi Fund). It was implemented in the following stages: (i) preparation and proposal 

by the country team of terms of reference for the programme feasibility studies; (ii) preparation 

by the Bank team of a report on the establishment of a Programme Preparation Facility (PPF); 

(iii) preparation of the PPF by the Bank until its approval by the country team; (iv) broad-based 

consultation of stakeholders during project appraisal in Conakry, Boké and Kankan, especially 

during the assessment of environmental safeguard measures required for environmental 

categorisation and publication of the summary of the Strategic Environmental and Social 

Assessment (SESA) Report; (v) continuation of consultations during the appraisal mission 

during field visits to Kankan and Boké, consultations with all the stakeholders and key actors 

(civil society, public administration, private sector and technical and financial partners) in 

Conakry. 

2.6.2 This proposal is also a response to strong demand from grassroots communities, due 

to inconsistencies between the potential of the regions concerned and weak agricultural 

development in the zones concerned. This participatory process will continue during the 

programme’s implementation through: (i) a steering structure that will bring together  

representatives of all parties, (ii) capacity building for institutions and communities on the 

participatory process, (iii) community involvement in the implementation of activities; and (iv) 

the establishment of a programme results-based monitoring and evaluation system.  In addition, 

the Bank’s Country Office in Guinea will constantly ensure that the consultation mechanism is 

operational throughout the programme’s implementation.

2.7 Bank Group Experience, Lessons Reflected in Project Design 

2.7.1 The PDZTA’s formulation incorporates the lessons learned from the Bank’s previous 

and ongoing operations in Guinea and through the regional member countries taking into 

account issues concerning portfolio performance and the country’s fragility. These lessons were 

reiterated in the most recent July 2018 review following which portfolio performance was 

considered to be satisfactory.  However, the review noted that efforts should be continued in 

order to improve: (i) the effectiveness period (11 months instead of the Bank’s recommended 

6 months); (ii) mobilisation of programme management teams; (iii) procurement periods 

considered to be too long; (iv) mobilisation of counterpart funds; (v) the programme personnel 

performance monitoring system  by the systematic establishment of performance contracts and 

renewal of staff contracts on the basis of the results of the annual staff evaluation; and (vi) the 

time taken to update the baseline situation and establish the monitoring and evaluation system. 

2.7.2 The Portfolio Performance Improvement Plan (2018 PPIP) also recommended that   

specific measures be taken to accelerate the programme implementation rate.  This 

recommendation, which has been  taken into account in this proposal,  is reflected in: (i) the 

maintenance of stakeholder dialogue and close monitoring by the Bank’s Country Office 

(COGN) in order to mitigate risks relating to delays in the PDZTA-BK implementation and 

administration period and process and the fulfilment of conditions precedent to effectiveness; 

(ii) improvement of quality at entry by using advance procurement action for preparing bidding 

documents and management tools (Manual of Accounting and Financial Procedures-MAFP, 

Computerised Accounting and Financial Management System – SIGCF, and of monitoring and 

evaluation prior to Programme commencement; and (iii) capacity building for programme 

management teams in procurement and financial management. It is also worth noting that the 

ongoing portfolio has been considerably rejuvenated in recent years, that the average age for 

operations fell from 5.5 years in 2011 to 2.7 in 2017 and that it contained no problematic 

programme (PP) or potentially problematic programme (PPP) in 2017.  

2.7.3 The PDZTA design, therefore, took into account the lessons learned from previous 

operations and incorporated in the 2018 PPIP in order to meet the design and implementation 

criteria contained in Presidential Directive 002/2015.

III. PROGRAMME FEASIBILITY 

3.1 Economic and Financial Performance 

3.1.1 The programme is designed to have direct spinoffs in terms of crops promoted and 

developed through private investments to establish agribusinesses, i.e. about 100 units per agro-

industrial park in Boké, with a total of 200 agribusinesses in under ten (10) years in these two 

regions. In addition to the spinoffs from private enterprises established in the Boké and Kankan 

agro-industrial parks, significant income will be earned by the beneficiaries of the agricultural 

production sites, also developed and from which enterprises will be supplied with raw materials 

concerning the crops and stock farming activities already mentioned in Section 2.2, i.e. cashew 

nuts, oil palms, sesame, soya, rice, fonio, groundnuts, maize, potatoes, yams, cassava, fruit 

(oranges, mangoes and pineapples), tomatoes, onions, okra and chillies, poultry, sheep, 

fishery products, non-wood forest products such as honey, leaves, wild seeds and fruit, oils 

and resins and infusions, etc..  However, the analysis does not take into account revenue 

generated at farm level given that this first phase of the programme only concerns agro-

industrial parks. 

3.1.2  In addition to these spinoffs, the programme is designed to generate other benefits 

such as: (i) the creation of temporary and permanent jobs as a result of the programme’s 

achievements estimated at 500 per processing unit (i.e. 10,000, for the agro-industrial units 

alone).  



 

 

11 

 

3.1.3 Financial Analysis: Much of the above-mentioned spinoffs does not concern 

commercial transactions or is not even tangible and is not suitable for an analysis of financial 

performance on the basis of existing markets.  Under these conditions, it was not considered 

relevant to factor it in to a quantitative analysis on the basis of a production or profitable   

business model approach.  It was, however, possible, to carry out a cost/benefit analysis of 

different agro-industrial enterprise and agricultural production models (FARMOD). 

3.1.4 With regard to agro-industrial enterprises, a scenario is proposed on the basis of three 

(3) types of processing unit, i.e. small, medium and large enterprises with respective 

investments of USD 2, 5 and 11 million each in accordance with the average investment profiles 

for this type of model.  Under these conditions, annual turnover per enterprise is USD640,000, 

1.6 million and 3.52 million respectively for small, medium and large-sized units from the 5th 

year over an operating period of about 20 years. 

3.1.5 As regards agricultural crops on production sites for farmers and suppliers of agro-

industrial park enterprises, FARMOD type production models and a cost-benefit model 

(input/output, with or without programme implementation) will be applied over a 20-year 

operating period. 

3.1.6 The financial analysis results were: (i) a financial impact of over USD109 million per 

year from the 5th year of operation over a 20-year period in accordance with similar types of 

operation, depending on the investment life cycle. This implies that the financial impacts of the 

programme over the operational period exceed the cost of investments required to finance it ; 

(ii) a cost/benefit ratio of 2.27, where the benefits are higher than the cost of investments; 

(iii) an internal rate of return of 24.21 %, which is higher than the opportunity cost of capital 

(the cost of tying up financial resources for investments under the programme), estimated at 

12 %.  On the basis of these results, it may be concluded that the programme has a rate of return 

profile that financially justifies the cost of its investments. 

3.1.7 Economic Analysis: The economic analysis was carried out using the reference price 

method, i.e. prices under conditions of economic efficiency in accordance with the Pareto 

optimum. It was also carried out by comparing the ‘no programme’ and ‘with programme 

implementation’ situations of production models used in the financial analysis. In this model, 

tradeable goods are those likely to be the subject of commercial transactions outside the country 

(FOB port CIF to port of Marseille).  Under these conditions, the reference prices for these 

products (economic prices) are estimated on the basis of the ex-ante equilibrium of these crops 

that will give the export parity price at farm gate.  Labour was economically valued at 65 % of 

its financial value of USD3/day to factor in the inelasticity of demand for labour in the country 

in general and in the programme area, in particular. 

3.1.8 On the basis of realistically defined scenarios, the programme’s economic rate of return 

(ERR) was estimated at 26.97%, with a cost-benefit ratio of 2.38. As a result, the Programme’s 

overall rate of return may be considered to be satisfactory in light of these results.

IRR (baseline scenario) : 24.21% NPV amount :  USD109.17 million 

ERR (baseline scenario) : 26.97% NPV amount :  USD 123.03 million 

3.1.9 Sensitivity Analysis: The sensitivity tests on the basis of a reduction in production 

prices measured the stability of financial and economic performance indicators. The tests showed 

that it is necessary to lower prices to 39.17% (break-even point or switching value) to cancel out 

the additional benefits generated respectively at the economic and financial level, with IRR and 

ERR equal to the opportunity cost of capital, i.e. 12 %.  This test shows that the programme’s rate 

of return profile is robust, although it was not carried out on all the model’s endogenous values.  

However, the price variable is the most important and is the only one that is outside the 

Programme’s management and operation. A summary of the sensitivity analysis is presented in 

the technical annexes, page 72 of volume II of this report. 

3.2 Environmental and Social Impact 

3.2.1 Environment: The PDZTA has been classified in Category 1 and, at this stage of its 

formulation process, subjected to a Strategic Environmental and Social Assessment that was 

posted on the following link: https://esa.afdb.org/document/etudes-dimpact-environnemental-

et-social-21., on Monday, May 06, 2019.  Category 1 programmes are likely to have significant 

or irreversible environmental and/or social impacts or severely impact the environmental or 

social impacts considered by the Bank or borrowing country to be sensitive. Boké Department 

is located in the administrative region of Boké which, itself, is located in Maritime or Lower 

Guinea. With the presence of the Atlantic coast, Lower Guinea is the alluvial basin for major 

coastal rivers such as the Kogon, Fatala, Konkouré and Kolente Rivers. The area is also covered 

by mangrove swamps (Rizophora racemose and Avicennia nitida). This natural region of Lower 

Guinea is also home to the country’s main mining centres: the Guinean Bauxite Company 

(CBG) in Boké, ACG in Fria and the Kindia Bauxite Company (Débélé), etc. 

3.2.2 With regard to potential sites mainly for the PDZA-BK’s anchor programmes, in 

particular the irrigation schemes in Boké Prefecture, the Denken plains covering an area of 

almost 600 ha located in Kolaboui rural municipality and the Kapatchez plains covering about 

9,200 ha located in Kamsar rural community provide significant development opportunities. In 

the Boké Administrative Region, there are also the 9500 hectare Mankountan Plain, the 4,000 

hectare Monchon Plain and the 6,000 hectare Koba Plain. 

3.2.3 Kankan Department, the programme’s target area, is located in Upper Guinea. This 

natural region covers the entire north-east and centre of Guinea’s territory. It is a region of 

plains and savannah, located between 200 and 400 metres of altitude. The Niger River and its 

tributaries have cut moist terraced flatlands into it. 

3.2.4 In relation to the programme, large sedimentary plains in Upper Guinea border the 

main water courses and cover vast areas: the Niger plains in Faranah, Kouroussa, Siguiri, the 

Milo plains, the Fié plains and the Banié –Tinkisso plains. In Kankan prefecture, the following 

sites have significant irrigation potential:  the Bafèle plain with about 11,000 ha of irrigable 

land located in Moribaya rural municipality and the Samanka plain with 800 ha located in Tinti 

Oulen rural municipality. 

3.2.5 Climate Change: Guinea, at the gateway to the Sahel, is highly exposed to climate 

change. According to 2,100 climate projections, temperatures will rise throughout the country 

and, more specifically: (i) in Middle and Upper Guinea (north-east and north-west areas of the 

https://esa.afdb.org/document/etudes-dimpact-environnemental-et-social-21
https://esa.afdb.org/document/etudes-dimpact-environnemental-et-social-21


 

 

13 

 

country), by about 0.4 to 3.3°C, with a sensitivity of 2.5°C; (ii) in Lower Guinea and Forest 

Guinea (south-west and south-east areas of the country), from 0.3 to 2.7°C with a sensitivity of 

2.5°C. This rising temperature will be accompanied by changes in the distribution and volume 

of rainfall.  These changes could reach 36.4 % of the present norm from 2050 and 40.4 % in 

2100.  Forest resources are among the most vulnerable resources to climate change because of 

the impact of human activities on forest ecosystems (carbonisation, excessive tree felling, 

nomadic pastoralism, agricultural clearing, mining and uncontrolled food gathering, etc.). 

3.2.6 In terms of greenhouse gas emissions, Guinea remains a very low emitting country, 

with GHG emission per capita of 2.1 tCO2e/inhab. in 1994 and less than 0.1% of global 

emissions.  They have, however, increased fairly rapidly. Between 1994 and 2015, these 

emissions rose 21.5 times, that is, an average annual increase of almost 10 %. This means they 

doubled almost every 7.2 years. Guinea’s objective in this area is to reduce its greenhouse gas 

emissions by 13% by 2030, compared to the 1994 level. In the forestry sector, this commitment 

concerns the stabilisation by 2030 of the mangrove areas, the reforestation of 10,000 hectares 

per year and the preservation of classified forests and protected areas. 

3.2.7 Gender: On average, Guinean agriculture contributes an average of 17.5% to 23% to 

GDP and occupies 50% of the work force 75% of which is in rural areas (RGPH3, 2014). It is   

largely dominated by family-type farms.  Over half of those in work (52.6%) are employed in 

the ‘agriculture, livestock, forestry and fisheries’ sector, 50.9% of whom are male and 53.5% 

female. Guinea has a gender policy, dating back in January 2011.  This policy covers: (i) Access 

to basic social services: education - health - HIV/AIDS - water- hygiene and sanitation; 

(ii) compliance with human rights and the elimination of violence: fundamental rights - little 

girl - violence - human trafficking; (iii) access, control of resources and equitable income 

sharing: economy - poverty - environment; (iv) improving governance and equitable access to 

decision-making bodies: power - media - institutional mechanisms - armed conflicts - ICT; and 

(v) gender integration into macro-economic framing: national development policies and 

programmes. This policy helps to minimize gender inequalities. 

3.2.8 Women play a major role in the agricultural economy throughout the agricultural 

chain from production and processing to marketing. However, despite their impact in the 

agricultural production chain, they still face many difficulties, including: 

 Access to resources and factors of production, in particular land, inputs and 
fertilisers. Because of customs and traditions women are not usually the owners 

of farmed land;  

 In decision-making and conflict management in the agricultural sector, women 
have less influence;  

 In terms of financial resources: the lack of resources is a real problem both in 
the agricultural sector and in other areas (education, health etc.); and  

 Concerning training: this remains a real concern, especially regarding capacity 
building, entrepreneurship, management… The literacy level of some women is 

also a handicap. 

3.2.9 In order to alleviate these difficulties, the Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zones 

Development Programme proposes the following gender promotion and women’s 

empowerment actions throughout its implementation: i) entrepreneurship, job creation for 



 

 

14 

 

women and young people and access to markets; ii) agricultural production capacity building; 

iii) skill building in agricultural production and processing, starting and managing a business, 

marketing and market access; iv) sensitisation campaigns on behavioural changes regarding 

birth control and reproductive health, balanced nutrition, gender and the prevention of gender-

based violence, the prevention of early marriages, HIV/AIDS, lifestyle management and 

environmental sanitation.  

3.2.10  According to the Gender Classification System, the programme is classified in 

Category 2.  The detailed gender analysis and gender action plan are presented in the Technical 

Annex on gender.  The budget allocated to gender promotion and women’s empowerment 

actions is UA 2.883 million. 

3.3 Involuntary Resettlement 

3.3.1 Operational Safeguard 2 (OS 2): Involuntary resettlement: land acquisition, 

population displacement and compensation: the risk of physical displacement or resettlement 

of the population is minimal as well as the loss of major assets during the programme’s 

implementation.  However, the issues of land tenure and nomadic livestock breeding are two 

key challenges that should be taken into consideration. In the event of the physical displacement 

or resettlement of population, Resettlement Action Plans (RAP) will be prepared and 

implemented in accordance with the Bank’s procedures and in compliance with OS2. 

3.4 Cost of ESMP Measures 

3.4.1 The costs of some measures will be included in the BDs and others covered by the 

FESMP. Some measures such as the application of good practices, the reforestation 

programmes, erosion control and resettlement will be taken into account in the cost of works 

and included in the bidding documents (BDs) and contractors will be obliged to implement 

them under the supervision of the control office and Programme Implementation Unit (PIU). 

The cost of the additional gender and women’s empowerment programme to be formulated on 

a participatory basis will be included in the programme’s budget. 

3.4.2 The estimated costs of the FESMP activities will primarily concern environmental and 

social measures not taken into account in the BDs.  Control Mission services will be covered in 

its contract.  

3.4.3 The overall ESMP cost is estimated at USD 500,000. Details are provided in the 

following Table.

ESMP implementation will be the subject of periodic reports on monitoring and supervision 

but also on evaluation and supervision by the different actors or structures involved in its 

implementation. 

IV. IMPLEMENTATION 

4.1 Implementation Arrangements 

4.1.1 At national level, programme management will be placed under the oversight of the 

Authority for the Development and Administration of Special Economic and Industrial Zones 

(ADAZZ), attached to the Presidency of the Republic. This institutional arrangement is due to 

the multi-sector nature of the programme and the need for strong leadership to provide 

coordination among all the programme’s actors. For this purpose, ADAZZZ will be 

strengthened institutionally through the PDZTA Programme Management Unit (PMU). The 

PMU will be lightly structured and responsible mainly for coordination, financial management, 

procurement and programme monitoring and evaluation activities. It will comprise: (i) a 

national coordinator; (ii) a monitoring and evaluation officer; (iii) a procurement officer; (vi) 

an environmental specialist, (vii) an administrative and financial officer; and (ix) an 

accountant. 

                                                
6 The preparation of manuals on good environmental practices has been factored in to the programme

4.1.2 The PMU will also be supported by periodic technical assistance (international and 

national consultants). On the ground, it will be assisted by partner organisations, in particular, 

administration structures, the Guinean Institute for Agricultural Research (IRAG), the Private 

Investment Promotion Agency (APIP) as well as the Ministries and technical agencies involved 

in the programme. The signing of agreements with these partner structures, including IRAG, 

will be one of the loan and grant conditions under ‘other conditions’. The documentation on 

these agreements will have to be included as soon as possible and prior to effectiveness in order 

to facilitate the programme implementation no-objection process. 

4.1.3 A Strategic Orientation Committee (SCO) will be set up to provide strategic direct ion 

for the implementation of the programme.  It will be chaired by the Minister Secretary General 

for the Presidency of the Republic. The Vice-Presidency will be held by the Minister in charge 

of the Plan. The committee will be composed of Ministers in charge of Economy and Finance, 

Agriculture, Industry and SMEs, Investments and PPPs, Mines, and Trade, as well as the 

President of the National Chamber of Agriculture. The SCO will meet at least once a year, and 

its Secretariat will be provided by ADAZZ. 

4.1.4 A Program Steering Committee (PSC) will also be established. It will be chaired by 

the Secretary General of the Ministry of Agriculture or its representative. In addition to the 

representatives of the Ministries within the SCO, ADAZZ, the National Chamber of 

Agriculture, the PSC will be composed by representatives of the Regional Governors, the 

private sector and the Civil Society. The PSC Secretariat is provided by the representative of 

the Ministry of Industry and SMEs. The PSC will be responsible: (i) for reviewing and 

approving the annual work programme and budget (AWPB), (ii) for validating the results of 

the program's performance, and (iii) for framing innovations and ensuring the relevance of the 

major choices to be made at the implementation. It will meet at least twice a year. 

4.2 Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements 

4.2.1 Procurement Arrangements: The procurement of goods (including services other 

than consulting services), works and the acquisition of consulting services financed by the Bank 

under the programme will be carried out in accordance with the Procurement Framework for 

Bank Group-financed operations, 2015 edition, and in compliance with the provisions of the 

financing agreement. More specifically, procurements will be made in accordance with the 

Bank’s Procurement Methods and Procedures (BPP), on the basis of the relevant standard 

bidding documents (SBDs) for goods and works contracts as well as consulting services for 

which the BPP are considered to be the most appropriate. Indeed, following an analysis of the 

Guinean procurement system as presented in Technical Annex B5 of this report, the 

procurement risk was considered to be substantial. As a result, for the implementation of this 

programme, the Bank’s Procurement Methods and Procedures will be used, since a capacity 

building action plan will be the subject of dialogue with the Guinean Authorities in order to 

rapidly ensure use of the national procurement system following the reforms identified as 

necessary. 

4.2.2 Procurement Risks and Capacity Assessment (PRCA): The assessment of 

procurement risks at country, sector and programme level as well as the capacity of the 

executing agency (EA) was carried out and the results were used to influence the decision to 

choose the BPM for all activities planned under the programme. The appropriate risk mitigation 

measures were included in the PRCA action plan presented in Annex B5. 



 

 

17 

 

4.2.3 Organisation of Procurement Implementation: Programme procurement will be 

carried out by the Programme Executing Agency. In light of the conclusions of the assessment 

of the executing agency’s capacity, a management unit including a procurement expert will be 

recruited to implement the procurement process but also to build the capacities of the different 

actors involved in procurement. 

 

4.2.4 Advance Procurement Action (APA): The Government intends to submit to the Bank 

for approval a request for the use of APA in order to recruit consultants to conduct studies on 

agro-park infrastructure and irrigation schemes.  This request shall be submitted to the Bank 

prior to the programme’s presentation to the Bank’s Board of Directors. 

4.2.5 Disbursement: The disbursement methods to be used to mobilise the ADF loan 

financing are: (i) the direct payment method; (ii) the special fund/revolving fund method and 

(iii) the reimbursement method. Direct payments will be made in respect of contracts for works, 

goods and services signed between the Borrowers and suppliers, in accordance with the Bank’s 

procurement rules and procedures and national procurement legislation. The special account 

method will be used to settle operating expenditure, training costs, field mission costs etc. It 

will require the opening of a Special Account at the Central Bank of Guinea, which will, in 

turn, pay all the funds received from the ADF into the PMU bank account opened in a bank 

acceptable to AfDB. The opening of the Bank account will be a condition precedent to the first 

disbursement. The reimbursement method will be used when eligible expenditure on ADF loan 

resources are pre-financed with the Bank’s prior approval. These disbursements will be made 

in accordance with the list of goods and services and the Bank’s rules and procedures as 

described in the Disbursement Handbook. Details of the disbursement arrangements will be 

presented in the Technical Annexes (Volume II of the Programme Appraisal Report). 

4.3 Financial Management 

4.3.1 The Programme Management Unit (PMU) will be responsible for the programme’s 
overall coordination and financial management. Its financial management staff will comprise the 

programme coordinator, the administrative and financial officer, the accountant and cashier, all of 

whom will be recruited in accordance with the programme’s procurement arrangements. 

4.3.2 The financial management systems of the ADAZZ management unit whose structures 
will be used under the PDZTA are not satisfactory on the whole and the overall fiduciary risk is 

substantial because of the absence of: (i) a financial coordinator and personnel as mentioned above; 

(ii) an administrative, financial and accounting procedures manual; (iii) operational accounting and 

financial management software; and (iv) financial management tools and reference framework. 

4.3.3 As a result, the PMU should take the following measures: (i) as soon as the programme 
is launched, prepare a budget plan coupled with the indicative activities schedule; (ii) when the 

programme is launched, recruit a consultant to prepare the administrative, financial and accounting 

procedures manual (AFAPM), and another responsible for establishing the computerised 

accounting and financial management system (SIGCF) ; (iii) assign financial tasks as soon as the 

financial staff are recruited; (iv) establish the financial management framework and instruments in 

accordance with Annex B6 of Volume II of the Programme Appraisal Report. 

4.3.4 Audits: Once a year, a competent and independent firm of external auditors will verify 
the reliability of the consolidated financial statements prepared by the PMU and will assess the 

operation of the internal control system of the entire programme. It will be recruited in accordance 

with the terms of reference and bidding procedures recommended by the Bank.  Audit costs will be 

financed by the ADF loan. The audit reports must be forwarded to the Bank each year, no later than 



 

 

18 

 

six months after the closure of the audited period. Audits will be performed in accordance with 

SYSCOA international audit standards and the Bank’s comprehensive terms of reference which 

will be communicated to the programme. 

 

4.4 Monitoring 

Internal monitoring and evaluation will be carried out by the Programme Monitoring and 

Evaluation Unit, while external monitoring-evaluation will be the responsibility of the Ministry 

of Planning and the Ministry in charge of Finance. The objective of external monitoring and 

evaluation is to assess the efficacy and efficiency of the programme’s outputs and their 

contribution to the achievement of the development objectives which are the programme 

outcomes and impacts. It will be carried out with the involvement of the other stakeholders in 

addition to two annual supervision missions organised by the Bank. The mid-term review will 

be carried out in year 3. Following the programme’s closure, the Bank and Government will 

produce a completion report within the required timeframe. 

4.5 Governance 

4.5.1 The government authorities’ efforts to improve good governance during the past five 

years have made some positive progress especially in the area of procurement.  However, these 

efforts have not yet produced any tangible results, insofar as the corruption perceptions index 

in Guinea still averages 25 compared to a regional average of 34 with a ranking of 143rd out of 

180 countries, virtually unchanged over the 2012-2017 period. The political, economic and 

social governance indicators for Guinea are, therefore, mixed despite the progress made in 

recent years. This is mainly due to poor performances in the areas of governance and the fight 

against corruption, the consequence of repeated political crises that have weakened the 

government institutions that are required to ensure regular monitoring of the governance system 

in Guinea. 

4.5.2 In light of the foregoing, the PDZTA-BK design includes capacity building support 

for actors as well as institutional support to contribute to the reduction of governance-related 

risks to the programme’s implementation.  This support concerns the preparation and 

establishment of financial management and monitoring and evaluation tools as well as the use 

of recognised   transparency and competitive methods in the PMU staff recruitment process and 

the establishment of a system to reduce procurement delays, one of the main reasons for the 

shortcomings noted in the performance of the development portfolio in Guinea despite the 

alignment of the public procurement system with regional guidelines. These procurement-

related operational measures will resolve the shortcomings raised. 

4.6 Sustainability 

4.6.1 The Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zones Development Programme (PDZTA-

BK) was designed on the basis of a participatory process initiated following the APZ dialogue 

mission to Guinea and throughout all the programme formulation stages, i.e. the PPF 

preparation as well as the preparation and appraisal missions concerning this proposal. This 

approach has helped to raise awareness among the population and central government of the 

economic importance of agricultural transformation by promoting the processing of agricultural 

production (agro-industrial), in addition to the technological innovations disseminated to 

farmers.  Against this backdrop, the key actors in growth-bearing sub-sectors will be 

sufficiently strengthened to guarantee the regular supply of raw materials on the basis of a plan 

that will ensure the sustainability of their jobs and incomes.  This system should ensure the 

autonomy of this development model whereby the agro-industrial enterprises established in the 



 

 

19 

 

parks operate with a guaranteed supply of raw materials and central government is assured of 

revenue from corporate taxes and dividends from the asset holding companies to be established 

to manage the agro-industrial parks.  

4.6.2 The agro-industrial park management system will be formalised through the 

establishment of an asset holding company with a clear legal status including land tenure.  The 

agro-industrial parks will be established, then managed in accordance with the existing 

investment code and the special status of the Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zones 

(SAIPZ). 

4.7 Risk Management  

4.7.1 Achievement of the PDZTA outcomes is subject to a number of risks for which it is 

necessary to find mitigation solutions in order to guarantee the programme’s success.  In 

addition to the risks already identified that are common to the entire portfolio, specific risks 

were identified and mitigation measures proposed:  

 

No. POTENTIAL RISKS MITIGATION MEASURES 

01 Lack of commitment of oversight authorities to 

support the coordination team and slippage on 

programme implementation 

The programme is one of central government’s 

priorities and was designed on the basis of the 

systematic consultation of stakeholders including 

representatives of the administration and 

municipalities concerned 

02 Risk of weak private sector mobilisation The programme was designed on the basis of a 

platform of exchange of information with the 

private sector whose concerns are taken into 

account in the programme’s final formulation, a 

guarantee of the SME involvement in, and 

ownership of, the programme 

03 Slow acceptance by certain stakeholders could 

delay the programme’s implementation 

The programme was designed on the basis of 

systematic sensitisation and consultation to ensure 

its gradual ownership by all stakeholders 

4.8 Knowledge Building  

4.8.1 The Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zones Development Programme (PDZTA-

BK) was designed to reflect the approach and principles of the Special Agro-Industrial 

Processing Zones (SAIPZ) Programme of the Bank’s 2016-2022 ‘Feed Africa’ Strategy.  The 

key to this programme’s success is the transformation of agriculture through the involvement 

of the private sector in a leadership role while central government will guarantee the conditions 

for its establishment and success.  To ensure its success, the PDZTA-BK was designed to build 

knowledge on how to work more effectively with the sector, either on the basis of a PPP formula 

or in the form of a non-sovereign operation (NSO), or a combination of the two formulae.  Its 

development will be guaranteed by private sector involvement on the basis of public sector 

financing. 

4.8.2 The other types of knowledge generated are: (i) a multi-sector approach involving the 

intervention of sectors such as transport, energy, water and sanitation, agribusiness, agriculture, 

communication (NICT), education, health and nutrition, employment and trade. At this level, it 

is necessary to generate a 2nd type of knowledge concerning the pooling of efforts in order to  

produce rapid results in the area of agricultural transformation (ii) a combination of: (a) two of 

the Bank’s strategies, namely ‘Feed Africa’  and ‘Jobs for Youth’, enhancing the skills of youth, 



 

 

20 

 

and (b) at least  four (04) flagship programmes, namely, the Special Agro-Industrial Processing 

Zones (SAPZs), Technologies for the African Agricultural Transformation (TAAT), 

Agricultural Value Chains (AVC), Post-Harvest Losses Reduction and ENABLE Youth 

Programmes. The combination of strategies and programmes is the third level of knowledge 

provided  by PDZTA-BK;  (iii) product processing, as a great challenge for which solutions 

will be sought under this programme is the third level of knowledge provided  by this operation; 

(iv) employment in general, and in the agricultural sector, in particular, as a solution proposed 

in the Programme is the fourth level of knowledge likely to be generated by this proposal; (v) a 

contribution to a reduction in the massive imports of agro-food products by the Continent, and 

by Guinea, in particular which offers a fifth level of knowledge  to be generated by the PDZTA-

BK. 

4.8.3 Lastly, this programme’s success will help to build a body of knowledge that could 

be replicated throughout the programme to develop ten (10) agricultural hubs in the country, 

including those of Boké and Kankan. 

V. Legal Framework 

5.1 Legal Instrument  

The legal framework for the PDZTA-BK will comprise two (2) Loan Agreements signed 

between the Republic of Guinea, on the one hand, and the African Development Bank and 

African Development Fund (collectively called ‘the Fund’), on the other, acting in their capacity 

as administrators of the Transition Support Fund (TSF).  

5.2 Conditions Associated with Bank’s Involvement 

5.2.1 Conditions precedent to effectiveness: effectiveness of the TSF Loan Agreement 

will be subject to fulfilment by the Borrower, to the Fund’s satisfaction, of the conditions set 

out in Section 12.01 of the General Conditions Applicable to the African Development Fund

POLITICAL, INSTITUTIONAL AND 

SECURITY FACTORS  

 

1. Legitimate Policies and Political Governance (legitimacy, inclusiveness, State-building and 

confidence in State Institutions 

Legitimacy: Guinea experienced recurrent contestation of its 

legitimacy from independence until the adoption of a new democratic 

and pluralistic constitution in 2010. The situation of political and 

institutional instability experienced until then improved following the 

holding of the first multiparty elections which elected the incumbent 

Head of State as the country’s leader and installed a National Assembly 

composed of several political parties.  The easing of political tension 

observed was bolstered by a series of structural reforms of the 

Republic’s institutions. Despite the recurrent protests of the opposition 

parties which are constantly challenging the neutrality of those 

institutions in charge of elections and the Constitution, any revision of 

the latter would probably increase the opposition’s distrust of the 

government and weaken the rediscovered social cohesion. The issue of 

a third term as well as the expiry of the current term of the National 

Assembly remain as pockets of institutional fragility and present a 

political risk that could reverse Guinea’s trend towards societal 

resilience.  

 

 The Boké and Kankan Special Agro-

Industrial Processing Zones 

Development Programme (PDZTA)  

will contribute indirectly to 

overcoming certain obstacles relating 

to political and spatial inclusion and 

reducing intercommunity tensions 

created by a feeling of exclusion. The 

type of actions promoted by the 

project are in keeping with the 

Government’s vision of consolidating 

its interventions throughout the 

country through development 

activities.

General Government Policy backed by the Technical and Financial 

Partners (TFP) 

Measures by AfDB’s intervention 

under  PDZTA-BK  (2019-2022) 

Governance: In recent years Guinea has implemented a series of reforms 

aimed at improving its situation. The Government, supported by its 

technical and financial partners, has established an administrative 

modernisation programme. From 2014 it has carried out a biometric 

census of all civil servants. This led to the identification of almost 10.5% 

of fictitious civil servants and resulted in monthly savings of about 2.2 

million euros. Furthermore, additional management controls such as the 

recording of salaries, the crosschecking of civil service files with those of 

the National Social Security Fund and the physical control of employees 

with electronic time clocks helped to identify bottlenecks and remove civil 

servants with two jobs. The capacities of the Guinean Administration 

remain weakened at both the central and local levels in the areas of 

management and procurement but also in the preparation, implementation 

and monitoring and evaluation of development projects and programmes 

and assimilation of the principle of accountability. 

Transparency: Furthermore, despite reasonable progress, the perception 

of corruption remains high according to Transparency International’s 

Corruption Perceptions Index (105th ranking in 2018 compared to 148th 

ranking out of 180 countries in 2017) and the recent Governance 

Diagnosis for Guinea carried out by the National Institute of Statistics 

according to which 9 out of 10 Guineans surveyed consider corruption to 

be one of the most serious problems marking Guinean society at present. 

Public-private partnership (PPP) has no formal consultation framework 

and is sometimes misused to award direct contracts.  Other challenges 

include lack of transparency in the management and concession of natural 

resources, land tenure rights and, increasingly, central government’s 

inability to combat drug trafficking, organised crime and corruption. 

Indeed, the lack of transparency and good governance in the award of 

public contracts and large-scale allocation of land for agricultural, mining 

and forest resource exploitation through the abusive use of private use 

 The Boké and Kankan Special Agro-

Industrial Processing Zones 

Development Programme (PDZTA) 

will enhance the governance system in 

general and establish a legal and 

judicial framework for APZ which, 

when the programme closes, could be 

used as a model to consolidate the 

progress already made with regard to 

administrative governance.

permits are symptomatic of major unresolved problems and weaknesses 

in natural resource governance and persistent shortcomings of the land 

tenure framework. These issues continue to pose major challenges for 

peace and security in rural areas.   
2.      Issues of security and violence, capacity and performance of the security sector 

Security: While the security situation has considerably improved since the 

advent of democracy in 2010, incidents have continued to periodically occur 
that could potentially destabilise the situation, which justifies the continuing 

efforts to implement structural actions in the security sector. The first actions 

in this direction were encouraging, since over 4,000 soldiers were retired 
following the advent of democracy and the efforts made to professionalise 

the armed forces appear to be delivering results
7
 with support from the 

technical and financial partners. Indeed, the reform programme includes

action to build the capacities of the armed forces and key civil institutions 

such as the Ministries of Defence and Interior. The restructuring of the police 

and establishment of community policing to combat crime and violence, 

especially in urban centres, are also part of the reforms. It is, however, 
necessary to limit the systematic involvement of the Defence and Security 

Forces (DSF) in the country’s economic and political life and to provide them 

with sufficient resources to effectively perform their duties.  

The Boké and Kankan Special Agro-

Industrial Processing Zones 

Development Programme (PDZTA) 

does not contribute directly to the 

security factor but provides solutions 

to mitigate risks that could deteriorate 

the security situation in the 

programme area.  

3. Justice sector (inclusive access to justice, rule of law and judicial independence and countervailing 
mechanisms 

A weakened justice system: The previous and recurring crises in 

Guinea have had a negative impact on the judiciary. Already 

unstructured by the different causes of fragility, it was exploited for  

political ends by all the political actors and appears to be undermined 

by the lack of independence, corruption problems and lack of technical

and material resources. The Government and development partners 

consider justice reform to be a priority sector. An overall reform 

programme has been embarked upon.  One of its measures is to 

increase the number of judges, establish a Supreme Council of Judges 

and reform certain Codes in particular those pertaining to business. 

Despite the modest progress made, these bodies are gradually being 

restored. The system’s malfunctioning remains structural and long-

term efforts are necessary to improve the situation.

vulnerable segments of the 

population, especially women and 

young people. 

ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL FACTORS  

 

4.        Strengthening of economic and community resilience (equitable access to infrastructure and 

benefits of natural resources) 

Natural resources management: Management of Guinea’s 

considerable natural resources still falls far short of achieving the 

desired objectives of improving the living conditions of its population, 

which remains poor even though, paradoxically, the country is rich in 

natural resources. Guinea is relatively less rich with gross domestic 

product (GDP) of about USD 9.86 billion in 2018 for a population of 

12 million people. Guinea’s current growth trend is chiefly explained 

by income from a new extraction of natural resources. As long as 

strong collaborative measures are not taken to improve natural 

resources management, the country could find itself in a natural 

resource trap (‘natural resource curse’).  Furthermore, the type of 

growth generated by natural resources is characterised by wide income 

disparities that are isolationist and fragmented 

The Boké and Kankan Special Agro-

Industrial Processing Zones 

Development Programme also 

addresses the issue of natural 

resources, in particular, land and 

water. The Programme contains 

measures to support the renewal and 

building of the capacities  of 

institutions involved in the 

management of water as a means to 

improve the management of the 

resources in the programme area 

SOCIAL FACTORS: POVERTY AND 

INEQUALITY  

 

5. Increase resource mobilisation to create opportunities for jobs, income and inclusive access to social 

services, focused on the critical role of central government, enhancement of financial governance, and 

appropriate refocusing of government's role 

Inequalities: Regional disparities are glaring and rural areas are 

hardest hit by poverty. Population pressure, driven by a high birth rate, 

creates additional pressure on the country’s living standards which are

already greatly strained. Rapid and runaway urbanisation is another 

type of social pressure that does not spare urban communities and by 

extrapolation, empties rural areas of the work force required to tap into 

agricultural wealth and accelerates the deterioration of ageing and 

sometimes inadequate infrastructure in urban areas. Moreover, the 

majority of the population, in particular, women and young people are 

socially marginalised and lack economic and political opportunities. 

The restoration of social cohesion and inclusive growth, guarantees of 

stability and prosperity for all Guineans is essential. In addition, the 

population’s food security, the most common features of which are 

abundant rainfall for a successful crop year, the population’s access to 

basic social services, the availability of able-bodied labour for harvests, 

political stability and the absence of disasters such as natural calamities 

or epidemics.  Over 32 % of Guinean rural households were in a 

situation of food insecurity9 in 2015 and this relatively low rate before 

the Ebola virus disease crisis, could rise in the event of a new epidemic. 

The thorny issue of reconciliation between excellent land use for 

agriculture and mines arouses feelings of insecurity among the local 

population concerned by illegal occupancy and ownership of their 

land. Despite the law, therefore, land control remains a source of 

community and intergenerational tensions. This time bomb must be 

urgently defused politically, legally and urgently to prevent it 

becoming a source of conflict in the country. 

addresses spatial inequalities 

accumulated over several years and 

provides fresh momentum for 

balanced territorial development. The 

programme also aims to empower 

local communities to initiate 

transformative projects that will boost 

employment dynamics. 

Sources of income: Despite its significant potential resources, the 

Guinean economy remains very fragile and dependent on bauxite and 

agriculture. Bauxite is Guinea’s main economic resource and accounts 

for 14.42 % of overall production. Bauxite and agriculture contribute

13% and 20.2% respectively to GDP formation in terms of export 

revenue. Agriculture alone is a challenge for about 56% of Guinea’s 

work force. The sector provides employment for over half of the 

country’s work force, a large proportion of which is female, and 

remains one of the drivers of economic growth. Therefore, the 

volatility of world mining product prices remains likely to harm the 

country’s economy with serious social consequences. Many studies 

have found that "countries whose economies depend on the export of a 

limited number of primary commodities are more likely to be 

politically fragile and marked by conflicts”.  

industrialisation of the Guinean 

economy. The high potential agro-

industrial sub-sectors selected by the 

programme will be growth drivers 

through the processing of raw 

materials which will help to reduce 

the country’s dependency on the 

mining sector. 

Regulatory framework (central government’s role in the provision 

of services): Unfortunately, Guinea is disadvantaged by not having 

had high quality infrastructure assets since it gained independence. 

Investment in the development of priority infrastructure to improve the 

quality of service delivery by central government to the population is 

one of the government’s leitmotifs for its development programme in 

all sectors of activity likely to bring about a change in the population’s 

living standards and provide economic opportunities. Although 

progress has been noted in the energy sector despite persisting wide 

regional disparities, public utility-related sectors (water, waste, ICT 

and transport) are struggling to take off because of a lack of rapid and 

efficient actions and also because of funding delays. The uneven 

distribution of public services between the regions and segments of the 

population could in the longer term weaken the rediscovered social 

peace and cohesion unless corrective measures are taken to reverse the 

trend. 

The Boké and Kankan Special Agro-

Industrial Processing Zones 

Development Programme is part of a 

multi-sector approach whose 

completed activities will increase the 

number of socio-economic facilities 

in the programme area as well as the 

number of people or households with 

access to public utility easements in 

the areas of drinking water, electricity, 

transport, education, health and 

markets.

PROGRAMME SUMMARY 

Overview: Mali covers an area of 1,241,238 km² and the rural sector is the mainspring of its 

development, with agriculture accounting for 45% of GDP, providing employment for 80% of 

the total population and generating more than 75% of export earnings. However, it is constantly 

subject to climatic hazards, degradation of its natural resources (degradation of soil, water, air, 

vegetation, biodiversity, climate, etc.) and deterioration of terms of trade (steady drop in the 

prices of its agricultural export products), which limit the incomes of the rural population and 

expose them, particularly young people, to immigration. 

The degradation of natural resources results in land production loss of 6.5 T/ha/year, which 

corresponds to significant losses of soil nutrients, with a financial impact of up to CFAF 

90,000/ha/year (Strategic Investment Framework for Sustainable Land Management (SIF-

SLM)). All the environmental degradation-related factors (soil erosion, deforestation, air, 

quality of life, water and solid waste, wildlife heritage, mineral resources, etc.) have a 

significant impact on GDP which has declined from 26.5% to 20.9%. 

In addition, the value-added created by the agro-industry sector (biscuits, pasta, confectionery, 

canning industry, brewery, bakery, oil works, sugar refinery, dairy products, textile and 

tobacco) fell by 46.61% from XOF 1,465.64 billion in 2013 to XOF 782.48 billion in 2014. 

This trend is continuing, with annual agro-food imports for about EUR 597 million to fill the 

gap. The foreign exchange losses are enormous, and high enough to develop the entire 

programme of the country's twelve (12) agricultural growth poles (agropoles). 

The Development Programme for the Special Agro-industrial Processing Zone of Koulikoro 

and Semi-urban Bamako Regions (PDZSTA-KB) is a proposal to reverse the downward trend 

in agro-industry value added in Mali and disseminate agricultural development technologies 

that can slow down the degradation of natural resources, thereby creating conditions for 

sustainable agriculture, with the support of an additional contribution of the Italian Government 

to TSF Pilar I. The programme will include sustainable land management (SLM) at each stage 

of the proposed technical itineraries, within and outside irrigation areas, unlike extensive or 

intensive agricultural practices that foster the excessive use of agrochemicals. 

The Bank's intervention will help to develop two (2) major regions of Mali with an area of 

28,571.43 km² (2.30% of the country's total area), a population of 1.6 million inhabitants 

(8.63% of the total population in 2017) and an annual growth rate of 3.4%. The population 

density of 56 inhabitants/km² is well above the national average of 14 inhabitants/km². 

Consequently, there is heavy pressure on natural resources, which are rapidly deteriorating in 

the absence of any strong action to control, monitor and curb the trend. 

Needs Assessment: The programme area covers two (2) regions (Koulikoro and Semi-urban 

Bamako) whose irrigation and socio-economic development requires facilities for the 

production and processing of agricultural products that constitute the regions’ potential. The 

programme involves establishing an agro-industrial park to process products upstream and 

serve as an outlet for marketing agricultural products, thereby helping to reduce all-out import 

of agro-food products whose volume and incurred expenditure are becoming alarming.  

In accordance with the country's strategic guidelines, the programme will contribute to the 

processing of agricultural products, while improving the productivity and production of growth 

sectors. This will reduce imports of various agro-food products, with the main outcome of 

transforming Malian agriculture and improving food and nutrition security. 



 

 

 

v 

Added Value for the Bank: PDZSTA-KB seeks to support Mali in its agricultural 

transformation programme by promoting private investment, as well as creating conditions and 

providing incentives likely to attract the national and international private sector to establish in 

Bacoumana agro-industrial park (AIP). The conditions and measures include: (i) adopting 

measures that can create an enabling business environment for the establishment of agro-

industrial enterprises in the agro-industrial park; (ii) constructing physical and smart long-term 

infrastructure to facilitate the establishment of private companies, their operations, and 

transactions related to their activities; and (iii) improving the operation of growth sectors. This 

innovative approach was proposed as a flagship programme of the Bank's Feed Africa Strategy 

2016-2025, known as the Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zones (SAPZs) Flagship 

Programme. It proposes an approach to increase private investment in the agricultural sector, 

with the Government creating favourable conditions. Therefore, this is an area in which the 

Bank has experience and expertise. It can also raise internal financial resources, as well as 

additional resources from its technical and financial partners and private banks, relying on its 

“Triple A” rating. The Bank has also gained experience in developing this type of operation in 

Togo, Ethiopia, Guinea, DRC, Zambia and Tanzania. Hence, it can develop this operation with 

a high probability of success.  

Knowledge Building and Management: The implementation of the Development Programme 

for Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zones (PDZSTA-KB) will provide a wealth of 

knowledge that can be replicated throughout the country's twelve (12) agricultural development 

poles, including those in Koulikoro and Semi-urban Bamako Regions. The knowledge 

concerns: (i) the best way to work with the private sector, through a PPP approach or as a non-

sovereign operation (NSO), or a combination of both; (ii) the multi-sector approach, involving 

sectors such as transport, energy, water and sanitation, agro-industry, agriculture, 

communication (NICT), education, health and nutrition, employment and trade; (iii) a 

combination of: (a) two Bank Strategies, namely "Feed Africa" and Skills Development, 

especially for young people, and (b) at least four (4) flagship programmes, namely, Special 

Agro-Industrial Processing Zones (SAPZ), Technologies for African Agricultural 

Transformation (TAAT), Agricultural Value Chains (AVC), Post-Harvest Loss Reduction and 

Youth Employability (Enable Youth);  (iv) product processing, as a major development 

challenge for which solutions will be sought in this programme; (v) employment in general and 

in the agricultural sector in particular, as a solution proposed in the programme; and (vi) 

contribution to reducing massive agro-food imports from the continent, and from Mali, in 

particular.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION BY BANK GROUP MANAGEMENT TO THE 

BOARD OF DIRECTORS ON A DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME FOR SPECIAL 

AGRO-INDUSTRIAL PROCESSING ZONES IN BOKE AND KANKAN 

 
Management submits this report and its recommendation concerning a proposal for an ADF 

Grant of UA 1.42 million, a TSF Grant of UA 2.262 million (including an additional 

contribution of the Republic of Italy to  TSF Pillar I of EUR 1.38 million, i.e. UA 1.102 

million), and a TSF Loan of UA 10.50 million, from the ADF and TSF country allocation, to 

the Government of the Republic of Mali to finance the activities of PDZSTA-KB, which is the 

Pilot Phase of Mali’s Agropoles Development Programme. 

I. STRATEGIC THRUST AND RATIONALE 

Programme Linkages with Country Strategy and Objectives 

1.1.1. The programme is consistent with three (3) of the five (5) strategic pillars of the 

Strategic Framework for Economic Recovery and Sustainable Development (CREDD) 2019-

2023, namely: (i) Inclusive growth and structural transformation of the economy (Pillar 3); (ii) 

Environmental protection and building resilience to climate change; and (iii) Human capital 

development. CREDD serves as a framework for intervention by Mali's various Technical and 

Financial Partners. It is aligned with the MDGs and the objectives of the African Union's 

Agenda 2063, and aims at "A well-governed Mali, where harmonious coexistence of the various 

components of the society is restored, peace consolidated and collective and individual security 

ensured in unity, cohesion and diversity, where the wealth creation process is inclusive and 

environment-friendly, and where human capital is developed for the benefit of the population, 

particularly young people and women".  

1.1.2 At sector level, CREDD is implemented under Mali's Agricultural Development 

Policy (PDA) and includes the Development Programme for the Special Agro-Industrial 

Processing Zones of Koulikoro and Semi-urban Bamako (PDZSTA-KB). It is also implemented 

through its priority activities of developing agricultural products, protecting livelihoods and 

resilience to climate change, and enhancing human capital. The activities will, as a result of 

improved living conditions, promote sedentary lifestyles and reduce migration among the 

population. Therefore, PDZSTA-KB is a PDA operational programme which guides efforts 

towards achieving 6% growth in agricultural added value and allocating 15% of the State budget 

to the agricultural sector (10% in Maputo Commitment). Indeed, PDZSTA-KB is fully 

consistent with the country's strategic objectives. 

Programme Alignment with Bank Policy 

1.2.1 The Bank's intervention, through PDZSTA-KB which is the pilot phase of a 

programme for twelve (12) agropoles, is considered a priority by the Bank. Consequently, the 

Bank has made the strategic choice of transforming Malian agriculture, as reflected in Pillar II 

of CSP 2015-2019: "Infrastructure development to support economic recovery". The 

programme is also consistent with three (3) of the High 5s, namely: (i) Feed Africa (Strategy 

for Agricultural Transformation in Africa 2016-2025); (iii) Industrialise Africa; (iv) Integrate 

Africa; and (v) Improve the quality of life for the people of Africa. The programme’s alignment 

with Bank policy is further underscored by the fact that it will also help to enhance the 

transformation of Malian agriculture, boost industrialisation, and increase Mali's energy 

capacity. Specifically, it will help to promote smart agriculture, with product processing on all 

links of the priority value chains fostered under this programme.

Rationale for Bank Intervention 

1.3.1 The rural sector is the mainspring of Mali's development. It accounts for 45% of GDP, 

employs 80% of the total population, and generates more than 75% of export earnings. 

Therefore, agriculture is the main source of income for the rural population. However, 

agriculture is constantly subject to climatic hazards, degradation of natural resources 

(degradation of soil, water, air, vegetation, biodiversity, climate, etc.), and deterioration of 

terms of trade (steady drop in the prices of agricultural export products), which limit the 

incomes of the rural population. Indeed, the degradation of natural resources stems from 

inappropriate agricultural practices, and is the main cause of recurrent drought, leading to rapid 

destruction of livelihoods and threatening Mali's future, with negative effects on the country's 

food and nutrition security. All the environmental degradation-related factors (soil erosion, 

deforestation, air, quality of life, water and solid waste, wildlife heritage, mineral resources, 

etc.) have contributed to GDP decline from 26.5% to 20.9%. 

1.3.2 The deterioration of terms of trade is due to the low level of transformation of Mali's 

agriculture, and therefore of Mali’s economy. The value-added created by the agro-industry 

sector (biscuits, pasta, confectionery, canning industry, brewery, bakery, oil works, sugar 

refinery, dairy products, textile and tobacco) fell by 46.61% from XOF 1,465.64 billion in 2013 

to XOF 782.48 billion in 2014. This trend is continuing, and Mali is forced to import the 

equivalent of about EUR 597 million worth of agro-food products each year to fill the gap. The 

foreign exchange losses are enormous, and high enough to develop the entire programme of the 

country's twelve (12) agropoles. 

1.3.3 PDZSTA-KB is a proposal to reverse the downward trend in agro-industry value-

added in Mali and disseminate agricultural development technologies that can slow down the 

degradation of natural resources, thereby creating conditions for sustainable agriculture. The 

first principle of the programme is to group all the companies within an agro-industrial park 

(AIP) serviced to the required standards so as to avoid disorganised installations that breach 

environmental protection requirements. The second principle of PDZSTA-KB is that the AIP 

will be supplied with inputs from land developed in accordance with practices that include 

sustainable land management (SLM) at each stage of the proposed technical itineraries, within 

and outside irrigation areas, unlike the current inadequate agricultural practices in the area. The 

third principle is to upgrade the skills of young people and women in growth agricultural value 

chains and enable them to effectively benefit from future jobs that will be created within the 

AIPs. In the process, the programme will create conditions that promote sedentary lifestyles 

and reduce migration from the programme area to other countries or to hazardous gold panning 

activities. 

1.3.4 Since the programme incorporates the Bank's relevant strategies, it will effectively 

boost economic development by consolidating the role of the private sector and communities 

in rural development to ensure inclusiveness in Africa and in Mali, in particular. Furthermore, 

its design is based on complementarities with operations underway and/or being developed, 

particularly operations relating to women’s economic empowerment in the shea sector 

(PAEFEK). It also seeks to strengthen food and nutrition security in Koulikoro region 

(PRESAN-KL), as well as enhance food security by developing irrigated crops (PRESA-DCI). 

Such complementarity will contribute to the search for synergies in interventions. Therefore, 

this programme will strive to benefit from ongoing activities in Koulikoro and semi-urban 

Bamako regions, particularly the operations of the World Bank (PATAM, etc.) and IsDB, so as 

to ensure its relevance and effectiveness on the ground.

Aid Coordination 

1.4.1 Development assistance is coordinated by the Government of Mali, through the 

following three (3) consultation and coordination mechanisms: (i) At the general and policy 

level, a Troika; (ii) at the sector and thematic level, and (iii) at the sub-sector level. All TFPs 

align their interventions with the priorities of the Malian Government. In the rural development 

sector, the TFPs are organised around the Agricultural and Rural Economy Thematic Group 

(ARETG), which coordinates activities related to the sector. The group has two subgroups: 

"Livestock and Fisheries" and "Food and Nutrition Security ", as well as an "Irrigation" Focal 

Point replacing the Irrigation Sub-Group, which has been abolished. The AfDB, WB, IFAD, 

IsDB, GIZ, AFD, Netherlands and FAO are the main financial partners in the rural sector. As 

regards Mali’s external financing, the Bank comes second to the World Bank, with 13% of the 

financing. 

1.4.2 The Bank, through COML, is an active member of the CCC and some Thematic 

Groups (TG), particularly the Environment and Climate Change TG comprising UNDP, 

Sweden, Belgium, Norway, European Union, Canada, World Bank, UNCDF, France, Spain 

and Netherlands. The Bank works closely with the TFPs in this group in GEF activities. Such 

collaboration facilitates the exchange of best practice.

II. PROGRAMME DESCRIPTION 

Programme Components 

2.1.1 The Development Programme for the Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zone in 

Koulikoro and Semi-Urban Bamako Regions (PDZSTA-KB) is the Pilot Phase of a 

development programme for twelve (12) agro-industrial processing zones. It is intended to help 

reduce agro-food imports and improve food and nutrition security in Mali by establishing 

private sector-led agro-industrial development poles. The poles will address migration-related 

fragility factors in Koulikoro area by promoting sedentary lifestyles among the population, 

especially young people, who suffer from problems of deterioration of livelihoods (natural 

resources), climate change, "sahelisation" and extremely rapid desert encroachment. The 

programme will be implemented through the following four (4) components: (i) Establishment 

of Governance in the Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zones (SAPZs); (ii) Development of 



 

4 

 

Transformation and Access Infrastructure; (iii) Capacity Building for Key Stakeholders of 

Growth Sectors; and (iv) Programme Coordination and Management.  

2.1.2 The programme will be based on production activities, as well as the construction of 

access and marketing infrastructure for ongoing operations or operations under appraisal for 

2019, upstream Bancoumana agro-industrial park, for the supply of inputs for the pilot phase. 

The operations are the Bank's PRESAN-KL (UA 36.06 million), the Bank's Programme for 

Enhancing Food Security through Irrigated Crop Development (PRESA-DCI) (UA 36.00 

million), and the Bank's Women’s Economic Empowerment Project in the Shea Sector 

(PAEFFK (UA 5.63 million). This requires supplementary financing amounting to the 

equivalent of EUR 97.27 million. In addition to these Bank portfolio operations, other donors 

are very active in the programme area, particularly the World Bank, IsDB, European Union, 

etc. Under these conditions, the pilot phase of the programme will not be exposed to the risk of 

lack of input production and supplies to Bancoumana agro-park, if the activities are properly 

coordinated between the various operations mentioned above.

Technical Solutions Adopted and Alternatives Considered 

2.2.1 PDZSTA-KB seeks to address the central issue of the transformation of Malian 

agriculture in a way that puts the private sector in a leading role, while the public sector 

strives to create incentive conditions that will attract private investors to developed and 

serviced agro-industrial parks. It is an agricultural development approach that creates 

Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zones (SAPZs). The SAPZs are spatial development 

initiatives based on agriculture and designed to concentrate agricultural transformation 

activities in areas with high agricultural potential so as to boost productivity and integrate 

the production, processing and marketing of a number of agricultural inputs. The initiatives 

may or may not have Special Economic Zone status. They are, in some cases, also known 

as Agro-Industial Parks, Agribusiness Parks, Mega Food Parks, Agropoles, Agro-Clusters, 

etc. 

2.2.2 It is an integrated and pragmatic approach that has innovations, is inclusive on all 

links of agricultural value chains (AVCs) and creates wealth through the jobs it generates. 

It also creates wealth by reducing foreign exchange outflows as a result of cuts in agro-food 

imports. The approach also reduces emigration by promoting sedentary lifestyles among the 

population who now find huge employment opportunities and wealth creation at their 

doorstep. In addition, it pools the efforts of all other sectors that contribute to the success 

of agricultural development, particularly industry, transport, energy, water and NICT, even 

within the Bank. It also includes interventions by other development partners in the 

systematic search for complementarity to generate synergy. In the case of PDZSTA-KB, 

the development partners are the World Bank, IFAD, European Union, BCEAO, IsDB, etc. 

2.2.5 Therefore, SAPZ technical solutions break with the traditional approach of 

improving productivity, production and sales, without specifying their content .

Table 2.2   

ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED AND REASONS FOR REJECTION  

ALTERNATIVES BRIEF DESCRIPTION CAUSES FOR REJECTION 

Traditional approach of 

agricultural programmes 

Approach of improving productivity, 

production and sales 

This approach has no AVC content, and has 

therefore stumbled against field realities on 

key issues such as processing, markets and 

opportunities. 

Single-sector approach, 

based on agriculture 

Sector approach based exclusively on 

agricultural activities 

It does not include other development 

sectors that have an impact on agricultural 

development and therefore constitute 

success factors for this sector. 

Use of the Bank's public 

resources mainly 

The programmes are financed mainly from 

the resources of the Bank's public window and 

those of the Government 

AVC financing needs to go beyond the 

Bank's public resources, as they include 

private sector financing, co-financing from 

development partners, and non-sovereign 

operations. 

Dissemination of 

technological innovations 

according to the 

conventional method of 

training and visit to 

producers 

Approach based on regular visits to producers, 

according to a specific schedule and based on 

a control framework with tools such as 

contact group (CG), observation point (OP), 

and system study point (SSP) 

In addition to being cumbersome and costly, 

this method has shown its limitations in the 

past and is less effective than the client-

supplier system, which focuses on 

developing skills in all relevant fields of 

activity. 

Programme Type 

The Development Programme for Special Agro-industrial Processing Zones (PDZSTA-BK) is 

a programme that is facilitated by the public sector through major public investments to 

stimulate private sector interest in investing in growth by providing leadership to the 

programme, particularly in the processing of agricultural products, the supply of agricultural 

inputs and services, and marketing. It is a programme that will be implemented in several 

phases, depending on successive ADF allocations and mobilisation of additional resources from 

development partners. 

Programme Cost and Financing Arrangements  

2.1.1 Programme Cost: The overall cost of the twelve (12) agropoles programme is estimated 
at UA 660 million (about EUR 826.32 million), with the first phase estimated at UA 55.00 million 

(XOF 45.17 billion) which will start with a pilot operation estimated at UA 16.26 million (XOF 

13.36 billion), exclusive of tax and customs duty. This cost comprises UA 8.83 million (XOF 7.25 

billion) in foreign exchange and UA 7.44 million (XOF 6.11 billion) in local currency. It also 

includes provisions for physical contingencies and price escalation, which are estimated at an 

average of 3% and 4% respectively. The provision for price escalation was estimated on the basis 

of current and programmed levels of cost inflation rates in local and foreign currencies of 2.5% and 

1.8% respectively per year on average. The provision for physical contingencies is estimated at 

between 0 and 7%. A summary of the programme cost estimate by component and expenditure 

category is presented in the tables below.

Programme Area and Beneficiaries 

2.5.1 The programme area covers three districts, namely Kangaba, Kati and Koulikoro, in 

addition to Bamako District, with a population of 1.6 million inhabitants, of whom at least 79% 

are employed in agriculture. The site identified for the agro-industrial park is located in Kati 

District, Siby District, and Bancoumana rural municipality, 50 km from Bamako District. The 

area has Mali's most vulnerable communities due mainly to the alarming degradation of natural 

resources, climate change and the misperception of gold panning and migration as lucrative 

ventures. The entire programme area will cover 60,000 ha and will directly affect at least one-

third of the agricultural population, or about 421,000 people, and indirectly affect at least 1.2 

million people. The area is economically very dynamic, with the exploitation of precious 

minerals. Therefore, the programme area will include development works already financed by 

the Bank covering an area of about 2,921 ha, an agro-park of about 200 ha in Bancoumana, as 

well as areas outside the scope of this programme, i.e. more than 60,000 ha. 

2.5.2 The programme area’s population is young, with an average age of about 20 years. 

The population under 15 years of age accounts for 50.8% of the total population. On the other 

hand, the 15-59 age group accounts for 45.1% of the total population. Specifically, Bancoumana 

rural municipality has a population of 23,577 inhabitants (GPHC 2009), with 10,456 men and 

11,635 women, and 48 and 52% respectively of the population.  The young people tend to 

migrate to other economic sectors such as gold panning or very often to other countries in the 

sub-region and the West because of natural challenges and economic realities with very few 

alternatives. 

Participatory Approach to Programme Identification, Design and  Implementation  

2.6.1 The participatory approach, based on consultation, was the guiding principle for the 

programme design. The approach was adopted for discussions and consultations with officials 

of the relevant ministries (Agriculture, Industry, Transport, Energy, Trade, etc.), public 

administrations, the private sector, local authorities (Bancoumana, Kangaba and Kati), farmer 

organisations, civil society and TFPs (IsDB, BOAD, BCEAO, World Bank, European Union, 

and bilateral cooperation agencies). It was implemented in the following stages: (i) the country 

team prepared and proposed the terms of reference for the environmental and social 

assessments; (ii) the Bank team drafted a programme preparation report; (iii) the programme 

document was reviewed for approval by the Board of Directors; (iv) there were broad 

stakeholder consultations during the programme preparation in Bamako and Bancoumana, 

particularly in the assessment of environmental safeguard measures required for environmental 

categorisation and publication of the summary Strategic Environmental and Social Assessment 

                                                 
1 Additional contribution of the Republic of Italy to TSF Pilar I

(SESA) report; (v) the consultations continued during the appraisal mission, field visits to 

Bancoumana, meetings with all stakeholders and key actors (civil society, public 

administration, private sector, and technical and financial partners) in Bamako. 

2.6.2 This proposal is also a response to strong demand from grassroots communities 

because despite the huge potential of the regions concerned, there was inadequate agricultural 

development in the areas. The participatory approach will continue during the programme 

implementation through: (i) a steering structure with representatives of all the parties; (ii) 

capacity building in participatory approach for the institutions and communities; and (iii) 

community involvement in the implementation of activities; and (iv) implementation of a 

monitoring and evaluation system focused on programme outcomes.  In addition, the Bank's 

Country Office in Mali will, on a permanent basis, ensure that the consultation platform is 

operational throughout the programme implementation. 

Bank Group Experience and Lessons reflected in Programme Design 

2.7.1 PDZSTA formulation incorporates lessons learned from the Bank's past and ongoing 

operations in Mali and across regional member countries, taking into account portfolio 

performance issues and the country's fragility. The lessons were included in the last review. 

The Bank's active portfolio in Mali has twenty-three (23) operations (with 3 regional and 3 

private sector) for an approved amount of UA 430.3 million. The gross disbursement rate for 

operations that have already started their activities is 35%. At the end of the review, the 

performance of the Bank's national public portfolio in Mali in 2018 was deemed satisfactory 

with a rating of 3 out of 4.  However, it noted that more efforts were needed to focus more on 

the following aspects: (i) the need for the baseline situation and measurable performance 

indicators; (ii) the importance of effective supervision and regular meetings with stakeholders; 

(iii) the need for an integrated approach that involves key stakeholders of the sector; (iv) the 

utility of a good communication plan; (v) the need for a good selection mechanism for 

contractors eligible for projects; (vi) the need to strengthen the technical and managerial 

capacities of social groups, particularly young people and women entrepreneurs, in addition to 

access to financing; and (vii) initiatives should not be limited to a percentage of women (30%). 

2.7.2 The Portfolio Performance Improvement Plan (PPIP 2018) also recommended specific 

measures to accelerate programme implementation. Incorporating the recommendations in this 

proposal has resulted in: (i) maintaining dialogue with stakeholders, and ensuring close 

monitoring by the Bank's Country Office (COML) to reduce risks of delays in timeframes and 

processes for PDZSTA-KB implementation and management in general, and for fulfilling the 

effectiveness conditions; (ii) improving the quality of projects at entry by resorting to advance 

contracting for the preparation of bidding documents and management tools (Accounting and 

Financial Procedures Manual, Computerised Accounting and Financial Management System, 

and monitoring and evaluation before programme start-up; and (iii) capacity building for project 

management teams in procurement and financial management. It should also be noted that the 

age of the current portfolio operations has significantly reduced over the past few years, with 

the average age reducing from 5.5 years in 2011 to 2.7 years in 2017, and there were no problem 

(PP) or potentially problematic (PPP) operations in 2017.  

2.7.3 Therefore, the PDZSTA design has reflected the lessons learned from previous 

operations by drawing on PPIP 2018 to meet design and implementation criteria as specified in 

the Bank’s Presidential Directive No. 002/2015.

III. PROGRAMME FEASIBILITY 

Economic and Financial Performance 

3.1.1 The programme is designed to mainly generate direct benefits in terms of the 

processing of crops promoted and developed through private investments to establish agro-

industries, i.e. about 35 units on Bancoumana agro-industrial park, for the programme period. 

In addition to the impact on private companies located in Bancoumana agro-industrial park, 

significant incomes will be generated by the beneficiaries of the agricultural sites also 

developed, from which companies will be supplied with the inputs already mentioned in Section 

2.2, namely: maize, shea butter, sesame, milk, rice, mango, groundnuts, livestock/meat, 



 

11 

 

tomatoes, poultry, and non-wood forest products such as honey, leaves, wild seeds and fruits, 

oils and resins, herbal tea, etc.). 

3.1.2 In addition to these benefits, the programme is designed to generate other benefits such 

as: (i) climate regulation functions by setting up a forest cover of 8.00 ha, thus creating the 

conditions for intelligent, and therefore sustainable agriculture; (ii) improving the well-being 

of populations by preventing drought and famine, improving food security, reducing the 

medical bill with the regulation of climatic conditions, reducing the hardship of women and 

vulnerable groups, improving people's life expectancy, better incomes to access health and 

education, etc.; (iii) improving all livestock and livestock production, due to the quality and 

abundance of pasture and water; (iv) improving the effects of carbon sequestration (carbon 

credit); and (v) the creation of temporary and permanent jobs, resulting from the programme's 

gains, resulting from the programme's estimated gains of 50 to 500 per processing unit (i.e. 

5,250, at the level of agribusiness units alone, for an average of 150 jobs per industrial unit) 

3.1.3 Financial Analysis: Many of the above impacts are not commercially tradable, or even 

tangible, and therefore do not lend themselves to financial performance analysis based on 

existing markets. In these circumstances, it was not considered appropriate to include them in 

a quantitative analysis based on production models or profit-making activities.  However, it was 

possible to carry out a benefit/cost analysis of agro-industrial business models and various 

agricultural production models (FARMOD). 

3.1.4 As regards agro-industrial enterprises, an assumption is proposed on the basis of three 

(3) types of processing units, namely small, medium and large enterprises with investments of 

USD 2 million, USD 5 million, and USD 11 million each respectively, in accordance with the 

average investment profile in such models.  Under these conditions, the annual turnover for 

each company will be USD 640,000, USD 1.6 million, and USD 3.52 million for the small, 

medium and large units respectively, as from the 5th year, over an operating period of about 20 

years. 

3.1.5 With respect to agricultural products of farmers who supply inputs to agro-industrial 

enterprises in the parks, FARMOD-type production models and benefit/cost models 

(Input/Output, With and Without Programme, over a 20-year operating period) have been used. 

3.1.6 Thus, the financial analysis gave: (i) a financial impact of more than XOF 53 billion 

per year from the 7th year of operation over 20 years, in line with operations of the same type, 

depending on the life of the investments. This implies that the financial impact of the 

programme over the operating period exceeds the cost of investments required to finance it; (ii) 

a benefit/cost ratio of 1.49, with the benefits higher than the investment costs; (iii) an internal 

rate of return of 25.21%, which is higher than the opportunity cost of the capital (cost of capital 

investments under the programme) estimated at 12%. In light of these results, it could be 

concluded that the programme has a profitability profile that financially justifies the cost of the 

programme's investments. 

3.1.7 Economic Analysis: The economic analysis was conducted using the benchmark price 

method, i.e. prices under conditions of economic efficiency, in accordance with the "Pareto" 

optimum. It was also based on a comparison between the "no programme" and "programme" 

situations of the production models presented in the financial analysis. In this model, tradable 

goods are goods that are likely to be commercially traded beyond the country (FOB in port and 

CIF in Marseille Port). Under these conditions, the benchmark prices of the products (economic 

prices) are evaluated on the basis of ex-ante equilibrium of the products, making it possible to 

obtain export parity prices at the borders of the programme (Export-parity price at Farmgate).

Labour was economically valued at 65% of its financial value of USD 3 per day, to take into 

account the inelasticity of labour demand in the country in general, and in the programme area 

in particular. 

3.1.8 On the basis of realistically defined assumptions, the programme's economic rate of 

return (ERR) was estimated at 26.07%, with a C/B ratio of 1.58. Consequently, the 

programme’s overall rate of return could be deemed satisfactory in light of the results. 

IRR (baseline scenario) : 25.21% Amount NPV:  XOF 201.572 billion 

ERR (baseline scenario) : 26.07% Amount NPV:  XOF 219.03 billion 

3.1.9 Sensitivity Analysis: Sensitivity tests conducted on the basis of production price 

reductions helped to measure the stability of financial and economic performance indicators. The 

tests show that prices need to be reduced to 39.17% (break-even point or "switching value") to 

cancel the additional benefits generated at the financial and economic levels, with IRRs and ERRs 

equivalent to the opportunity cost of capital, i.e. 12%. The tests also show that the programme’s 

cost-effectiveness profile is robust, although it was not conducted on all endogenous values of the 

model. However, the price variable is very important; it is the only factor that eludes programme 

management and therefore operation of the programme. The summary of the sensitivity analysis 

is presented in the Technical Annexes on page 72 of Volume II of this report. 

Environmental and Social Impact 

3.2.1 Categorisation: In accordance with the Bank's environmental and social safeguards 

policies and procedures, the Development Programme for the Special Agro-Industrial 

Processing Zone in Koulikoro and Semi-Urban Bamako (PDZSTA-KB) was classified in 

Category 2 on 22 August 2019, since the potential negative environmental and social impacts, 

as well as the related risks, are of low to medium level, and existing technologies for their 

management are easily accessible to the country. Indeed, the studies show that the type of agro-

industrial units that will be operated on the IAP are not likely to generate very heavy, toxic and 

dangerous polluting substances that are difficult to manage and may have irreversible effects. 

Furthermore, heavy industry farms will be excluded from the site. In addition, the 

characteristics of the site do not allow for fear of significant loss of biodiversity (savannah 

vegetation, very poor in wildlife, and no watercourses nearby); there will be no physical 

resettlement (the site is in an industrial zone according to the master plan of the host 

municipality), but very few economic displacements, according to the feasibility study. At this 

stage of the appraisal process, an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) 

was prepared for the programme and posted on the link: 

https://www.afdb.org/en/documents/mali-projet-de-renforcement-de-la-securite-alimentaire-

et-nutritionnelle-de-la-region-koulikoro-p-ml-aag-004-rapport-cges on Monday, 28 October 

2019. 

 

3.2.2 Required environmental and social assessments: The programme will be 

implemented on a site that is certainly known, but whose exact boundaries have not yet been 

determined. Therefore, in accordance with Mali's national legislation, an Environmental and 

Social Management Framework (ESMF/ESMFP) and a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) 

are required. Of course, the ESMF, which will be used for the environmental and social review 

of the various sub-projects to be implemented under this operation, will provide the specific 

ESIAs/ESMPs required for the implementation of sub-projects, such as site development and 

establishment of agro-food processing infrastructure. It provides guidelines for the preparation 

of specific ESIAs/ESMPs. Similarly, the RPF, which defines guidelines for formulating a 

Substances Restoration and Improvement Programme, provides for a specific RAP for the 

https://www.afdb.org/en/documents/


 

13 

 

development works. In addition, it should be noted that the requirement for ESIAs and RAPs 

should be included in the contractors’ bidding documents. 

 

3.2.3 Programme Impacts: Potential Negative Impacts : During the works, the 

development activities of the agro-industrial park will mainly result in: (i) deforestation with 

the cutting of sparse woods such as néré (Parkia biglobosa), shea (Vitellaria paradoxa), zaban 

(Saba senegalensis), tamarin (Tamarindus indica), and (Cola cordifolia); (ii) disruption of 

economic activities with the destruction of farms, settlement on private land, incursion into 

private plots for quarries and borrowing pits; (ii) social tensions due to land problems with 

landowners and underutilisation of local labour; and (iii) involuntary economic resettlement. 

 

3.2.4 During the operational phase of the agro-industrial park (AIP), the operation of the 

agro-industrial units may generate fear of: (i) pollution of watercourses by direct discharges of 

liquid waste containing pollutant loads or scouring of rainwater causing pollutants to enter 

watercourses; (ii) air pollution by dust and odour discharges; (iii) reduction of soil fertility due 

to discharges containing chemicals and harmful substances; and (iv) accumulation of solid 

waste in the natural environment as a result of agricultural and industrial activity. 

 

3.2.5 Finally, the potential negative impacts will be as follows: (i) discharge of untreated 

and stagnant wastewater into the vicinity of the AIP may cause diseases such as malaria and 

bilharzia; (ii) the presence of foreign labourers may increase the risk of the spread of 

STI/HIV/AIDS; and (iii) the risk of uncontrolled influx of people seeking employment in the 

AIP, which may increase the risk of insecurity in the area. 

3.2.6 Potential Positive Impacts: The positive impacts of this agropole programme mainly 

concern the human and socio-economic environments. The major positive impacts of the 

agropole lie in the programme objectives, which consist in promoting the agricultural sector in 

semi-urban Bamako and developing the region's agricultural production to contribute to food 

and nutrition security and combat poverty and vulnerability. The positive impacts include: (i) 

reinforcement of transformative structures to bring water over long distances and thereby 

increase the value of land not yet used, given the scarcity of land. This will generate new 

activities and contribute to job creation; (ii) modernisation of family farms for market-oriented 

production; (iii) intensification, diversification and creation of inter-sector synergies in 

agricultural production basins for the promotion of agricultural enterprises to develop an 

agropole connected to sub-regional, regional, national and international markets; (iv) broader 

access to agricultural investment opportunities; (v) increased wealth for all stakeholders and 

links in the value chain (farmers, processors, etc.); (vi) reduction in post-harvest losses; (vii) 

reduced production shortfalls; (viii) broadening of the range of products; (ix) improved 

marketing conditions; (x) value-added for products through processing; (xi) significant 

contribution to restoration of optimal conditions to boost agricultural production (plant and 

animal) in semi-urban Bamako, as well as increase it on a sustainable basis; and (xii) efficient 

management of plant and animal production in the various production areas in semi-urban 

Bamako. 

3.2.1 Mitigation Measures: Measures that could be recommended by the ESMFP to mitigate, 

minimise or eliminate the negative impacts include: 

At environmental level: 

(i) Compensatory reforestation will be undertaken under the supervision of forestry 

services during the deforestation works, with particularly the same wood species, 

some of which have been obtained through scientific research that has had 



 

14 

 

spectacular results in reducing the adolescent age of the species (e.g. shea tree 

which can now start producing as from the 7th year). The reforestation will take 

place in the agropole, borrowing pits, quarries and village forests bordering on 

the agropole. 

(ii)  The AIP will have a wastewater treatment plant for all processing units before 

discharge into a developed site for its reuse. In addition, each processing unit 

will have a mini individual wastewater treatment plant before transfer to the site's 

large wastewater treatment plant. Since the groundwater in the area is of 

particularly high quality, measures will also be taken to protect it through proper 

management of AIP industrial wastewater, as well as prohibition of any activity 

that causes pollution around boreholes intended for human consumption. 

(iii)  With regard to solid waste, the AIP will have a transit dump for solid waste, 

which will subsequently be transferred to a final landfill site provided for in the 

development plan of Bancoumana municipality in which the AIP is located. In 

addition, efforts will be made to establish units for processing by-products of 

slaughtered cattle, sheep and poultry so as to reduce solid waste and landfill only 

the final waste. Furthermore, industrial units that cause heavy pollution will not 

be allowed in the AIP. All selected companies will also be required to undergo 

ESIA/ESMP assessments prior to establishment. 

(iv)  At the social level, economic assets and potentially affected persons will be 

identified and assessed in a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) and the persons 

concerned will be compensated.  

3.2.8 ESMF Cost: The ESMFP cost is estimated at XOF 650 million and comprises: (i) 

preparation and implementation of specific ESIA/ESMPs; (ii) preparation and implementation 

of RAPs; (iii) capacity building; (iv) training of all key stakeholders of the programme's major 

sectors; (v) information and sensitisation of the local population and associations; (vi) 

environmental and social surveillance; (vii) environmental and social monitoring; (viii) mid-

term assessment of environmental and social performance; and (ix) pre-closing audit of 

environmental and social performance. 

3.2.9 Climate Change: Located at the gateway to the Sahel, Mali is highly exposed to 

climate change. According to climate projections for the Sahel zone, temperatures will continue 

to increase throughout the country as in other Sahel countries. The rise in temperature will be 

accompanied by changes in the distribution and amount of rainfall. Forest resources are among 

the most vulnerable to climate change due to the impacts of human activities on forest 

ecosystems (carbonisation, excessive logging, transhumant stockbreeding, land clearing 

for agriculture, mining, uncontrolled harvesting, etc.). 

3.2.10 As regards greenhouse gas emissions, Mali remains a very low-emitting country, with 

per capita GHG emissions of 2.1 tCO2 per capita in 1994 and a share in global emissions of 

less than 0.1%. However, the emissions have been increasing quite rapidly. Between 1994 and 

2015, they increased by a factor of 21.5, representing an average annual growth rate of nearly 

10%, or doubling every 7.2 years or so. Mali's objective is to reduce its greenhouse gas 

emissions by 13% by 2030, compared to the 1994 levels. In the forestry sector, this commitment 

focuses on stabilising mangrove surface area by 2030, reforesting 10,000 ha per year, and 

preserving classified forests and protected areas. 

3.2.11 Gender: The project targets women as a priority beneficiary group. Several project 

activities will have a positive impact on women in terms of: (i) reducing labour hardship and 



 

15 

 

wasted time, with the availability of nearby fuelwood and introduction of improved stoves; (ii) 

management capacity building through training, sensitisation and education of women; and (iii) 

improving health status through community health centres and other basic services (schools, 

primary health centres, and rural roads). In addition, the promotion of agricultural value chains 

will offer new opportunities, particularly in market gardening and non-timber forest products 

(shea, néré, honey and many other wild fruits and vegetables) that women can process, and 

thereby increase their incomes and improve their living conditions. 

3.2.12 Women play a key role in the agricultural economy and are found throughout the entire 

agricultural value chain: production, processing and marketing. However, despite women’s 

impact in the agricultural production chain, they still face many challenges, namely: 

• Access to resources and factors of production, particularly land, inputs, and 
fertilisers: due to customs and traditions, women generally do not own the land they 

cultivate;  

• Decision-making: Women are less influential in decision-making and conflict 

management in the agricultural sector; 

• Financial resources: Lack of resources is a serious problem in the agricultural 

and other sectors (education, health, etc.); 

• Training needs: Training remains a cause for concern, particularly as regards 

capacity building, entrepreneurship, management, etc. Here too, some women's 

literacy levels constitute a barrier. 

3.2.13 To meet these challenges, the Development Programme for Special Agro-industrial 

Processing Zones proposes activities to promote gender and empower women during its 

implementation, namely: (i) Entrepreneurship, job creation for women and young people, and 

access to markets through business incubators for young people (youth employability 

programme) and women (AFAWA); (ii) Increasing agricultural production and strengthening 

market access capacity through digitalisation of agriculture; (iii) regular and systematic 

consultations between the Government and private sector actors; (iv) promotion of domestic 

and local enterprises in agro-industrial parks; (v) support for SME financing through levies on 

other sectors, including mining; and (vi) sensitisation on behaviour change in family planning 

and reproductive health, balanced nutrition, gender and prevention of gender-based violence, 

prevention of early marriage, HIV/AIDS control, healthy living, and environmental sanitation.  

3.2.14 The programme is classified in Category 2, in accordance with the Gender 

Categorisation System. The detailed gender analysis and gender action plan are provided in the 

Technical Annex on gender. The budget allocated to gender promotion and women's 

empowerment activities stands at UA 0.88 million.  

Involuntary Resettlement 

3.3.1 Operational Safeguard 2 (OS 2): Involuntary resettlement: land acquisition, 

population displacement and compensation: The risk of physical displacement or resettlement 

of the population, as well as loss of major assets during programme implementation are 

minimal. However, land tenure and transhumance are major issues that need to be taken into 

account. In the event of physical displacement or resettlement of the population, Resettlement 

Action Plans (RAPs) will be prepared and implemented in accordance with Bank OS2 

procedures.

IV. IMPLEMENTATION  

Implementation Arrangements 

4.1.1 The programme will be managed by the Ministry of Agriculture (Project Owner), 

which will have a Project Management Unit (PMU) for the programme implementation. The 

PMU will be mainly responsible for coordination, infrastructure development, partnership with 

the private sector, financial management, procurement, and monitoring and evaluation of 

programme activities. It will comprise: (i) a Programme Coordinator; (ii) an Infrastructure 

Specialist; (iii) a Private Sector Specialist; (iv) a Procurement Specialist; (vi) a Monitoring and 

Evaluation Specialist; (vii) an Administrative and Financial Officer; (ix) an Accountant; and 

(x) support staff (drivers, secretaries, cashiers, and messengers). 

4.1.2 The PMU will also be supported by technical assistance (international and national 

consultants) on an ad hoc basis. It will also be supported in the field by partner organisations, 

particularly structures of the Administration, the Rural Economy Institute (IER), the Private 

Investment Promotion Agency (API Mali), Industrial Zone Planning and Management Agency 

(AZI-SA), National Directorate of Forestry and Water Resources (DNEF), Centre for The 

Development of the Food Sector (CDA-EPA), and Ministries and Technical Agencies to be 

involved in the programme. The signing of agreements with these partner structures, including 

IRD, will be part of the loan and grant conditions, under other conditions. Documents of these 

agreements should be prepared before programme implementation, to facilitate the “no-

objection opinion” process during implementation. 

 

4.1.3 A Programme Steering Committee (PSC) will also be established to provide strategic 

direction for the implementation of the program. It will be chaired by the Minister of 

Agriculture. The Committee will comprise the Ministers in charge of Economy and Finance, 

Agriculture, Industry and Trade, Investment and PPPs, as well as representatives of local 

authorities, the Chairperson of the Permanent Assembly of the Mali Chamber of Agriculture, the 

private sector, civil society, and the PMU. The PSC will meet at least twice every year to: (i) 

Review and approve the annual work programme and budget ((AWPB); (ii) validate the results 

of the program's performance, and (iii) frame innovations and ensure the relevance of the major 

choices to be made during implementation. The PMU will be secretariat of the PSC. 

4.1.4 It will be chaired by the Secretary General of the Ministry of Agriculture or his/her 

representative. In addition to the representatives of the ministries within the COS and the 

National Chamber of Agriculture, the PSC will include representatives of Local Authorities, 

the private sector, and civil society. PSC secretarial services will be provided by the 

representative of the Ministry of Industry and Trade. The PSC will be responsible for: (i) 

reviewing and approving the annual work programme (AWP) and budget, (ii) validating the 

results of the programme's performance, and (iii) monitoring innovations and ensuring the 

relevance of major choices to be made during programme implementation. It will meet at least 

twice every year. 

Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements 

 

4.2.1 Procurement Arrangements: Procurement of goods (including non-consultant 

services), work and procurement of Bank-funded consulting services will be carried out in 

accordance with the Bank procurement Policy for Bank Group-funded operations ("AfDB 

Procurement Policy"), October 2015 edition and in accordance with the provisions of the 

Financing Agreement. In line with the implementation of that policy, and as a outcome of 

various assessment conducted, it was agreed that: 



 

17 

 

 

(i) Procurement of Goods and Works listed in paragraph B.5.2.1(a) of Technical Annex 
B.5 will be acquired in accordance with the country's procurement system ("Country 

System"); 

 

(ii) All other procurement financed by the Bank's resources and not mentioned in point (a) 
above will be made in accordance with the Bank's procurement system ("AfDB 

System"). 

 

4.2.2 The use of the National System for a group of transactions was considered appropriate 

because of a level of risk assessed as low for their procurement through the so-called system. 

Such a proposal has the advantage of improving efficiency in the implementation of the project 

through the following factors: (i) better ownership of the contracting system to be used by the 

enforcement agency; (ii) a time saving with the absence of a second control (after that of 

national entities) represented by the Bank's prior review. However, the Bank reserves the option 

of asking the borrower to return to the Bank System for the transactions concerned if: (a) Mali's 

legal procurement framework was changing to a system that was unsatisfactory for the Bank; 

(b) the PMU did not comply with by the requirements; (c) the special safeguards related to the 

use of the national system and described in Paragraph B.5.7.1 of the Technical Appendix were 

not used. 

 

4.2.3. Organization of the implementation of Procurement: The Ministry of Agriculture 

(MA) will be the Project Implementing Agency. The project's contracting will be implemented 

through a project management unit (PMU) that will be created and attached to the MA Cabinet. 

The experts of this CGP, including the contracting specialist, will be recruited on a competitive 

basis. 

 

4.2.4 Procurement Risk and Capacity Assessment (ERCA): In order to take into account 

the specifics of the programme, the Bank assessed: (i) risks at the national, sectoral and project 

levels; and (ii) the capabilities of the enforcement agency. The results of these evaluations 

concluded that there was a "substantial" level of risk for contracting and was used to guide the 

decision on the choice of the contracting system (Borrower, Bank,) used for specific activities 

and identified appropriate mitigation measures proposed at the level of the action plan in 

paragraph B.5.9 of Appendix B5. The resources needed to carry out these measures are already 

available or have been secured at the loan level. 

 

4.2.5 The Bank's resources to finance the project's activities come from the TSF and the ADF. 

As a result, the eligibility rules specific to the ADF window are those that will apply. Following 

the assessment of contracting risks and capabilities, it was decided to use the National 

Contracting System for part of this project. As the rules for eligibility for public contracts under 

Malian law are not the same as those of the ADF window, any practical incompatibility should 

be prevented. It was observed that Decree No. 2015-0604/P-RM of 25 September 2015, bearing 

the Code of Public Procurement and Public Service Delegations and its amendment to Decree 

No. 2016-0920/P-RM of 6 December 2016 Code of Markets and its implementing texts do not 

provide for any specific restrictions on participation in a Tender, except for the qualification 

and absence of sanction from the Public Procurement and Public Service Delegations 

Regulatory Authority (ARMDS-DSP), as stipulated Article 18 of Act No.08-023/ of 23 July 

2008 relating to the Public Procurement and Public Service Delegations Regulatory Authority. 

 

4.2.6 Consequently, the eligibility rules applicable for all contracts concluded under this 

project under the Malian public procurement system will be the national eligibility rules. 

However, in the case of the use of the national system, if the borrower's decision leads to 



 

18 

 

awarding a contract to an entity under the Bank's sanction or under United Nations Chapter VII 

sanction, the Bank's loan resources could not be used to finance such a contract. The list of 

companies under sanctions is available at http://www.afdb.org/debarred. 

 

4.2.7  Disbursement: The Bank's resources will be disbursed in accordance with its rules and 

procedures, in particular the disbursement manual. These will be done through the following 

three methods: (i) the special account method; (ii) the direct payments method; and (iii) the 

repayment method. As for the resources of the national counterparty, they will be disbursed in 

accordance with the national procedures in force. 

Financial Management  

4.1.1 Responsibility for the administrative, financial and accounting management of the 
Project will fall to the Ministry of Agriculture (MA), which will set up a Project Management 

Unit (PGC) whose members will be recruited, by call for applications and following the Bank's 

rules and procedures in this area. The PMC, consisting of at least (i) a Coordinator; (ii) an 

Infrastructure specialist; (iii) a private sector specialist; (iv) an Procurement Specialist; (v) a 

follow-up-assessment specialist; (vi) an Administrative and Financial Officer (RAF); (vii) an 

accountant; and (viii) a support staff (drivers, secretaries, cashier, courier), will have the tools 

of accounting and financial management, including accounting and financial management 

software, adapted to development projects and a manual of procedures administrative, 

accounting and financial matters. 

 

4.1.2 As a general principle, accounts will be kept on the basis of private commitment 
accounting and integrated software adapted to the management of development 

projects/programs. The accounting plan will be developed on the basis of the accounting law 

standards of the Uniform Act of the Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law 

(OHADA) in Africa in Mali. In addition, PDZSTA-BK will produce an annual work program 

and budget (PTBA), as well as quarterly financial monitoring reports, based on the 

implementation of the PTBA, attached to the Bank's quarterly business reports, in which a clear 

analysis of the budget forecasts and the quarter's achievements must be clearly made. Any 

discrepancies will have to be analyzed and explained. 

 

4.1.3 Audit: Audit of project accounts will be carried out by an independent external audit 
firm. This firm must be recruited on the basis of terms of reference previously agreed with the 

Bank and according to its rules and procedures, no later than three months after the financing 

agreement comes into force. The audit contract will be three years non-renewable and the 

auditor will be required to file his report no later than six months after the end of the year 

audited. 

Monitoring 

Internal monitoring and evaluation will be conducted by the Programme's Monitoring-

Evaluation Unit, while external monitoring and evaluation will be conducted by the Ministry 

of Planning and the Ministry of Finance. External monitoring and evaluation aims to assess the 

effectiveness and efficiency of the programme's outputs and their contribution to the 

achievement of the programme's development outcomes, i.e. its effects and impacts. It will be 

conducted with the involvement of other stakeholders, in addition to the two annual supervision 

missions organised by the Bank. The mid-term review will be conducted in Year 3. At the end 

of the programme, the Bank and the Government will produce a completion report within the 

required timeframe. 

Governance  

4.5.1 The State Authorities’ efforts towards good governance over the past five years have 

been positive, particularly in procurement. However, the results of these efforts are not yet 



 

19 

 

visible, as Mali's Corruption Perception Index (CPI) still remains at an average of 32 out of 

100, compared to a regional average of 34, with a ranking of 182nd out of 188 countries in the 

2019 Human Development Index. Political, economic and social governance indicators for Mali 

are still a cause for concern, despite the progress made over the past few years. The indicators 

mainly concern poor performance in governance and the fight against corruption, as a result of 

repeated political crises that weaken State institutions responsible for regularly monitoring the 

governance system in Mali. 

4.5.2 In light of the foregoing, the PDZSTA-KB design provides for support for stakeholder 

capacity building at the institutional level, including reduction of governance risks through the 

programme implementation. The support includes the preparation and implementation of 

financial management and monitoring and evaluation tools, as well as the use of recognised 

transparency and competitive methods in the recruitment of PMU staff. Furthermore, support 

will also include the implementation of a system to reduce delays in the procurement process, 

which is one of the main reasons for shortcomings in the performance of the development 

programmes portfolio in Mali. Despite the alignment of the public procurement system with 

regional guidelines, support will also focus on operational procurement arrangements to address 

identified shortcomings. 

Sustainability 

4.6.1 The Development Programme for the Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zone 

(PDZSTA-KB) was designed on the basis of a participatory approach, which was adopted 

following the SAPZ dialogue mission to Mali in March 2018 and used during all stages of the 

programme formulation, preparation and appraisal. The approach has made the population and 

Government aware of the economic importance of agricultural transformation through the 

processing of agricultural products (agro-industry) and technology innovations disseminated to 

farmers. In this regard, the capacity of key stakeholders in growth sectors will be adequately 

strengthened to guarantee regular supply of inputs based on a mechanism for long-term 

sustainability of jobs and incomes. The mechanism is expected to lead to the autonomy of this 

development model in which agro-industrial companies on the AIP operate with guaranteed 

supply of inputs and the Government is assured of revenue from corporate royalties and 

dividends generated by the Holding Company that will be established to manage the agro-

industrial park.  

4.6.2 The agro-industrial park management system will be formalised through a Holding 

Company with a clear legal status, including land ownership.  The agro-industrial park will be 

created and serviced, and subsequently placed under management in accordance with the 

current Investment Code and the special status of Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zones 

(SAPZs). 

Risk Management 

4.7.1 The achievement of PDZSTA outcomes carries a number of risks for which mitigation 

solutions are required to ensure the success of the programme. In addition to the risks already 

identified for the entire portfolio, specific risks have been identified and mitigation measures 

proposed:  

 

 



 

20 

 

No. POTENTIAL RISKS MITIGATION MEASURES 

1 Lack of commitment from the supervisory 

authorities to support the coordination team and 

prevent delays in programme implementation 

The programme is one of the Government’s 

priorities, and its design was based on regular 

consultations with stakeholders, including 

representatives of the administration and 

municipalities concerned. 

2 Risk of low private sector engagement The programme’s design is based on consultations 

with the private sector whose concerns are taken 

into account in the final programme formulation, 

thereby guaranteeing SME involvement and 

ownership of the operation. 

3 Delays in engagement by some stakeholders 

could lead to delays in the programme 

implementation  

The programme is based on sensitisation and 

regular consultations for its gradual ownership by 

all stakeholders 

4 The programme is not being implemented in 

accordance with the proposed implementation 

plan and schedule, with delays in procurement 

A Procurement Expert will be recruited to assist in 

effective conduct of the procurement process. 

Knowledge Building 
 

4.8.1 The Development Programme for the Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zone 

(PDZSTA-KB) is designed to reflect the approach and principles of the flagship programme 

for Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zones of the Bank's Feed Africa Strategy 2016-2022.  

This programme postulates that agricultural transformation will succeed if the private sector is 

involved in a leadership role, while the Government creates conditions for its implementation 

and success. To succeed, PDZSTA-KB was designed to develop knowledge on how to better 

work with the private sector, as a PPP, a non-sovereign operation (NSO), or a combination of 

both. Private sector involvement, along with public sector funding, is the primary knowledge 

that PDZSTA-KB will develop. 

4.8.2 The other knowledge generated by the programme implementation concerns: (i) the 

multi-sector approach, involving the intervention of sectors such as transport, energy, water and 

sanitation, agro-industry, agriculture, communication (NICT), education, health and nutrition, 

employment and trade.  In this regard, knowledge will be generated through pooling of efforts 

to rapidly produce agricultural transformation outcomes; (ii) the combination of: (a) two Bank 

Strategies, namely "Feed Africa" and “Skills Development”, especially for young people, and 

(b) at least four (4) flagship programmes, namely, Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zones 

(SAPZs), Technologies for African Agricultural Transformation (TAAT), Agricultural Value 

Chains (AVC), and Post-Harvest Loss Reduction and Youth Employability (Enable Youth). 

The combination of strategies and programmes is the third level of knowledge generated by 

PDZSTA-KB; (iii) produce processing is a major development issue for which solutions will 

be sought in this programme; this is the fourth level of knowledge generated by this operation; 

(iv) employment in general, and in the agricultural sector in particular, as a solution proposed 

in the programme; this is the fifth level of knowledge likely to be generated by this proposal;

COUNTRY FRAGILITY SITUATION  
 

REPUBLIC OF MALI 

DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME FOR THE SPECIAL AGRO-INDUSTRIAL PROCESSING ZONES (PDZSTA-KB)   

Fragility Factors Mainstreaming Matrix 
 

Fragility Factors Situation, challenges and resilience measures supported by the General State Policy with the support of Technical 

and Financial Partners (TFPs) 

Measures supported by AfDB intervention 

under PDZSTA-KB (2020-2025) 

Political inclusion Since independence, Mali has experienced four major rebellions. The rebellions have left Mali in perpetual political, 

humanitarian and social conflict. The most recent conflict, which occurred in 2012, is continuing today although the 

international community is continuously striving to find solutions to problems preventing Mali from achieving lasting 

peace. Indeed, Mali became a democratic country in 1990, but the democratic transition seemed to be just a sham 

because, after two decades of peaceful elections, the democratic process was no longer justified given that it was 

marred by corruption and political influence instead of engaging in organising really democratic elections. Such a 

turn eventually created a sense of unfair political representation for Malians. In addition, the laws passed on 

electoral districts portray the political leaders’ intention to exclude some minority groups from political influence. 

PDZSTA-KB activities will not have a direct 

impact on political inclusion, but community 

resilience created by the programme will 

bring a new perspective on representation 

and participation in the political process.  

Security Despite hopes for security, it must be said that complete elimination of insecurity remains illusory. While the 

Government, UNMISMA and the signatory parties have made efforts to stop the fighting for several months, jihadist 

fighters have become stronger, with more capacity for nuisance. Following a series of attacks, ambushes, mines, 

mortar fire and other attacks, they have made their way right to the capital. Even heavily armed foreign and Malian 

camps are attacked by the raging terrorists. Inter-community tensions with land disputes, cattle rustling and clashes 

have also resulted in several deaths and injuries, and demonstrate the fragility of the social fabric. It should be noted 

that delays in implementing the Algiers Agreement justify the reluctance of the population of some localities to 

reject jihadist rhetoric and continue refraining from cooperating in efforts to eliminate them. All these actions by 

Malian stakeholders and the international community do not augur well for the restoration and consolidation of 

peace and security throughout Mali. Security standards assess peace-building success by determining whether 

violence in total armed conflict has persisted in a country; they also consider the chances of a country with a history 

of intra-State conflict will experience it again. The standards give priority to the maintenance of internal peace and 

order, as well as prevention of civil conflict. With the long and frequent history of violence in Mali, it is likely that in 

its current stage the country will return to full armed conflict. 

PDZSTA-KB does not contribute directly to 

the security factor, but it does have activities 

for food security while mitigating some risks 

that could worsen the security situation. 

Justice Mali has a relatively structured judicial system with 1 Supreme Court, 3 Courts of Appeal, 16 Courts of First Instance, 

3 Commercial Courts, 3 Administrative Courts, 42 Extended Courts of Justice, 11 Labour Courts, 8 Juvenile Courts, 

and 3 Military Courts. However, despite this organisational structure, some of the courts are not operational, or 

when they are operational, they do not have adequate human resources in quantity and quality to meet the 

expectations of Malian citizens. Furthermore, despite efforts by public authorities to reform and increase the 

number of judges, the judge-to-inhabitant ratio remains well below international standards, with Mali having only 

PDZSTA-KB does not contribute directly to 

the justice system but addresses the issue of 

social and spatial inclusion, which is a source 

of social injustice, taking into account the 

vulnerable groups, particularly women and 

young people, in the project activities.

one judge per 7,000 inhabitants. Such shortage of staff, combined with their precarious working conditions, 

significantly help to make procedures more cumbersome and lengthy and, as a result, create mistrust among the 

population towards the institution. Malians' lack of trust and the judicial system’s restrictive access make it one of 

the institutions to which people resort as little as possible in the event of conflict. 

Economic and social 

inclusiveness 

Although the country has recovered, economic activity and natural resources are largely concentrated in the south 

of the country. Therefore, it is possible that the projected growth path may have only a minimal impact on the 

particularly troubled northern regions. Agriculture and industry account for 36.8% and 23.4% respectively in Mali's 

GDP. The main agricultural crops are cotton, millet and rice. Industrial production consists mainly of gold as a raw 

material. The growth of agriculture and gold mining industry sectors can only benefit the North if the Government 

reinvests its increasing revenue in these regions. The North should also benefit from the return of aid flows and the 

activities of international, humanitarian and non-governmental organisations. However, these two sources of 

secondary benefits do not directly address the main grievances of the northern populations: the lack of economic 

opportunities and the high unemployment rate. 

The various sectors selected for PDZSTA-KB, 

such as infrastructure development, youth 

employment and food security, have far-

reaching activities that are economically and 

socially inclusive.  

 Social Cohesion In addition to the issue of equity in access to economic resources and opportunities, the poor quality of public goods 

and services, particularly in justice, education, health and security, has been widely cited as one of the obstacles to 

peace in Mali. Indeed, structural deficiencies in health, education, security and justice services, which should be 

accessible to all and of acceptable quality throughout Mali, fuel people's deep feelings of inequality, particularly 

between the northern and southern regions, and between the regions and the capital, Bamako. Indeed, each of the 

regions feels that the others are more privileged in development financing by the Government and Technical and 

Financial Partners (TFPs), construction of infrastructure and, more generally, consolidation of the Government’s 

presence. The delivery of public services remains highly unequal and in short supply despite efforts made by the 

public authorities. These structural shortages are both in quality and quantity, with significant imbalances between 

urban and rural areas, as well as between Bamako and the rest of the country. Poverty indicator trends vary 

considerably across the regions, with progress in the West and South regions against persistence or even 

deterioration in the North. These inequalities were exacerbated by the 2011 food crisis, which negatively and 

disproportionately affected households. In the North, for example, there was a 41% increase in the proportion of 

people living in food-poor households as a result of the 2011 price and production shocks. Even though budget 

spending in the education and health sectors is in line with the averages of other WAMU countries, it remains very 

uneven and unfair: it does not benefit the most disadvantaged segments of the population. In addition, public 

spending on social safety nets to support the poor remains very low and is not always well targeted (a significant 

proportion of the resources do not reach the poorest households). 

The geographical location of PDZSTA-KB is a 

first step towards addressing the imbalance 

in the delivery of services between urban 

and rural areas.  As regards the programme 

activities, a number of the proposed 

components will help to establish public 

servitude required to ensure the successful 

socioeconomic integration of communities. 

External effects / 

regional ripple effects 

With the political and military crisis, Mali's capacity to diversify its economy fell to its lowest level as its exports fell 

from 13.9% to 1.9% between 2009 and 2017. However, this shortcoming is offset by Mali's strong capacity for 

regional integration and economic cooperation. Given this imbalance in terms of capacity, Mali continues to face 

enormous pressure from its geographical position in the Sahel-Saharan region. Regional and international diplomatic 

interference in Sahel’s political transformation seeks to advance their agenda at the expense of their neighbours. In 

addition to this external interference, there is also interference by jihadists - originally external since AQIM 

historically originated in Algeria - who are combining with a purely Sahelian jihad. Another external factor concerns 

the influence of market economic resources (control of cross-border traffic) which has triggered and is perpetuating 

PDZSTA-KB's support has no direct impact on 

external effects, but various interventions by 

the Bank and other TFPs are aimed at 

creating an environment conducive to the 

diversification of the Malian economy, more 

than 45% of whose export earnings come 

from the agricultural sector alone. To 

mitigate the effect of exogenous shocks,

the rebellion. Trafficking interests are the main source of rebel financing; they exacerbate inter-community relations 

and atomise armed groups. Far from being the preserve of the rebels alone, trafficking also causes competition with 

State actors. This makes the search for peace complicated.  

there are emergency social activities in areas 

with displaced people; this is a new 

opportunity to discourage young people 

from embarking on dangerous adventures 

such as terrorism and illegal immigration. 

Climatic/environmental 

impacts 

Although Mali has experienced accelerated deterioration of its environmental policy over two years (2015-2017) to 

the point where its score is below the African average, it has been able to strengthen its capacity in environmental 

protection to prepare for emergencies with Government resources allocated to natural disaster prevention and food 

price volatility. The humanitarian crisis has been a major challenge for peace-building in Mali because it is also 

environmental due to severe recurring drought that has made farming difficult and created a food crisis. The local 

economy, which is highly dependent on stockbreeding and agriculture, has forced Malian northerners to migrate to 

other countries where economic and living conditions could be better, but many of them have returned quickly due 

to the deteriorating situation in these other countries. In addition, UN reports in 2011 indicate that there are nearly 

200,000 displaced people in Mali, not to mention the more than 200,000 people who have fled Mali to countries 

such as Burkina Faso, Mauritania and Niger. Worse still, at least 4.6 million people in Mali have experienced severe 

food insecurity, which has prompted the UN to help mitigate the deterioration in living conditions. By 2013, the 

number of internally and externally displaced persons had increased significantly from about 410,000 to 475,000. 

PDZSTA-KB activities will implement the 

ESMFP measures recommended to avoid 

creating negative impacts on environmental 

protection.

Executive Summary 
 

I.  General Project Overview  

1.1  This project will support the upstream and downstream agricultural production subsectors in the 
Brakna-Ouest region. Its purpose is to improve food security and the living conditions of target 
communities through the inclusive and sustainable development of crop sectors. The Agricultural 
Transformation Support Project in Mauritania (PATAM) is fully consistent with the Accelerated Growth 
and Shared Prosperity Strategy (SCAPP) intended, among others, to consolidate the role of the agro-
pastoral sector and transform it into a source of economic diversification and growth. It is fully aligned 
with the Bank’s: (i) High 5s; (ii) the Ten-Year Strategy (2013-2022); (iii) the Feed Africa Strategy (2016-
2025); (iv) CSP 2016-2020 for Mauritania (Pillar 1 - Support for agricultural transformation); and (v) the 
Bank's flagship initiatives: Technologies for African Agricultural Transformation (TAAT), Young 
Entrepreneurs (Enable Youth), Risk Sharing Facility (RSF), and Agro-industrial Processing Zones 
(APZ). The project will focus on the Brakna-Ouest region, considered a zone afflicted by extreme 
poverty (12 points higher than the national poverty rate), and will affect Trarza and Nouakchott 
regions when it is scaled up to promote: (a) value chains (support for the establishment of agro-
industrial processing zones; (b) youth1 and women's entrepreneurship (support for the establishment 
of an incubation structure): and (c) the establishment of guarantee funds for agricultural sector 
financing. 

1.2  The project will finance: (i) the establishment of the main irrigation infrastructure (vegetable 
farming areas for women on 200 ha and flood-recession farming areas on 3,300 ha); (ii) the promotion 
of value chains and of youth and women's entrepreneurship as well as the establishment of inclusive and 
innovative agricultural sector financing mechanisms (guarantee funds, agricultural insurance, etc.); and 
(iii) institutional capacity-building and project coordination. It will affect 6,700 households, with an 
estimated target population of 42,600 inhabitants (52% being women), with a predominance of 
smallholders considered to be the Bank's main target group. The project will cost MRU 743.37 million 
(i.e., new Ouguiya), equivalent to UA 14.67 million, over a five-year period (2019-2023) and will be 
financed by an ADF loan of UA 7 million and an NTF loan of UA 6 million. It is an excellent climate 
change adaptation project and constitutes support for the transition to inclusive and sustainable growth. 

II. Needs Assessment 

Efficient natural resource management has become an imperative in Mauritania, given the country’s 
severe exposure to the effects of climate change. Consequently, economic diversification is necessary to: 
(i) get the country out of its undiversified and relatively fragile economy, which is dependent on 
extractive industries (particularly iron) that account for four-fifths of total exports on average and 30% 
of total budget revenue; and (ii) mitigate the risks associated with the reduction in iron prices and boost 
the competitiveness of the agro-pastoral sector through inclusive and sustainable development. The 
project was initiated based on the conclusions of the high-level “Feed Africa” conference held in Dakar 
in October 2015, which recommended that particular attention be paid to supporting agricultural 
transformation in African countries. The needs stem from the logic of consolidating and building on the 
significant achievements recorded by the West Brakna Irrigation Scheme Project (PAHABO) and 
strengthening the transformative dimension (promotion of value chains by focusing on two key sectors: 
rice cultivation and market gardening). It was designed through a concerted systemic method that 
involves stakeholders and emphasises a participatory and integrated approach (PIA). 

  

                                                
1  The National Youth Policy defines youth as the population of men and women aged 12 to 30 years. The beneficiaries are young people - 

(women and men aged 12 to 30 years), as well as women of any age.

III. Bank Value-added  

Cognisant of the successful results of PAHABO,1 the Government considers the African 
Development Bank Group as a multilateral donor capable of addressing sector issues related to the 
development of irrigation and agricultural production, value chain promotion, and advancement of 
youth and women's entrepreneurship, in addition to assisting the country to rally other development 
partners. This project is an extension of PAHABO. Moreover, it builds on the reforms initiated under 
Phases 1 and 2 of the Economic Reform and Diversification Support Programme (PAREDE-1 & 2) and 
complements the PAFEJ and PAMPEJ projects. Lastly, PAHABO was awarded the High-5 Award (Feed 
Africa) at the Bank's annual meetings held in India in May 2017. The best practice developed under this 
programme will be replicated and the lessons learned have been factored into PATAM’s design. 

IV. Knowledge Management  

The project will help to strengthen the Bank's innovative operations in the agricultural and rural sector. 
It will help to modernise irrigation systems, promote agricultural transformation and value chains, 
develop youth and women's entrepreneurship, set up innovative and inclusive financing, and disseminate 
the requisite technical and organisational knowledge (use of the various information systems to be set up, 
agricultural advisory, etc.) to its stakeholders. Hence, the contribution through the TAAT initiative will 
be highly useful. The dissemination of smart agricultural technologies and practices to adapt to climate 
change and the guidance of farmers to improve market access will equally be relevant. These operations 
will build the capacity of institutional stakeholders such as administrative entities as well as inter-
professional and beneficiary organisations (water users' associations, rice cooperatives, women's 
vegetable farming cooperatives, EIGs, etc.). The knowledge generated will be disseminated to Mauritania 
and Bank structures through their respective websites, monitoring/evaluation, supervision, midterm 
review and completion reports, etc. Interactions with the African Digital Financial Inclusion (ADFI) have 
also been initiated to achieve innovative solutions aimed at promoting smart agriculture. 

                                                
1  The return of more than 1500 households to the project area is one of the key indicators of the project's success.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF MANAGEMENT OF THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK 
GROUP TO THE BOARDS OF DIRECTORS REGARDING A PROPOSAL TO GRANT AN ADF LOAN AND AN 

NTF LOAN TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF MAURITANIA  
TO FUND THE AGRICULTURAL TRANSFORMATION SUPPORT PROJECT (PATAM) 

 

Management hereby submits this report and recommendations concerning a proposal to grant an ADF loan 
of UA 7 million and an NTF loan of UA 6 million to the Islamic Republic of Mauritania to finance the 
Agricultural Transformation Support Project (PATAM). 

I. Strategic Thrust and Rationale 

1.1 Project Linkage with Country Strategy and Objectives 

1.1.1 PATAM reflects efforts by Mauritanian authorities to move from a rent economy to a 
diversified one driven by promising productive sectors, excluding extractive industries.1 In recent 
years and with a view to diversifying the national economy, the Mauritanian Government has taken 
measures to promote an institutional framework conducive to agricultural sector development. Thus in 
2012, it adopted a Rural Sector Development Strategy (SDSR), accompanied by a Framework Law on 
Agriculture (LOA), an Institutional Review of the Agricultural and Livestock Sector (RISAP) and a 
National Livestock and Agriculture Development Plan (PNDEA). Furthermore, the Government adopted 
an investment code and an Accelerated Growth of Shared Prosperity Strategy by 2030 (SCAPP). The 
intention is to ensure that agricultural development, poverty reduction, food security and the improvement 
of community living conditions become top priorities. Hence, a National Agricultural Development Plan 
(PNDA) was drawn up based on the SDSR and the initial PNDEA. Approved by the Council of Ministers 
in October 2016, this PNDA is the main operational reference framework and reflects Government's desire 
to ensure better coordination of agricultural sector actions to promote modern, resilient and competitive 
agriculture by 2025 (see strategic framework in Annex 1). 

1.1.2 To optimise the potential for agricultural and rural development, the Ministry of Agricultural and 
Rural Development defined its development policy in 2012, through the design and adoption of a Rural 
Sector Development Strategy (SDSR) and an Agro-pastoral Framework Law (LOA), in harmony with the 
Poverty Reduction Strategic Framework (PRSF 2011-2015) and the National Food Security Strategy 
(SNSA - 2012). Five strategic areas have been defined by the SDSR, namely: (i) infrastructure; (ii) 
research; (iii) rural advisory services; (iv) funding; and (v) trade. SCAPP (2016-2030), which is the 
reference framework for Mauritania as regards development, poverty reduction and job creation, thus 
confirmed these orientations and adopted the following three pillars: (i) promotion of robust, inclusive and 
sustainable economic growth; (ii) human capital formation and access to basic services; and (iii) 
strengthening of governance in all its dimensions. The “Produire en Mauritanie” (“Made in Mauritania”) 
Initiative (IPM), adopted by the Council of Ministers in October 2016, has consolidated the instruments 
established to diversify the Mauritanian economy, and reflects Government's desire to capture value added 
locally and to promote value chains. All these strategies highlight the considerable potential of the 
agricultural sector to reduce poverty, improve food security and create sustainable jobs. 

1.1.3 The project is well aligned with the strategic guidelines presented above and is underpinned by 
the pillars and priorities set by the Government of Mauritania (see 1.1.2). It is an attempt to combine 
production support (support for the upstream agricultural subsector) with the enhancement of production 
value (support for the downstream agricultural subsector). The focus is on: (i) consolidating the significant 
impact of PAHABO; (ii) replicability and extension of recorded achievements; and (iii) targeted support 

                                                
1  These efforts are reflected in the country’s new strategic vision for development, which are intended to be sustainable, inclusive and fair, and which 

seek to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 2015-2030). 



 

 2 

to the transformative dimension that is compatible with available financing resources. The project as 
designed provides an opportunity to consolidate, extend and support transformation with a view to 
enhancing the linkages and continuity with PAHABO, and scaling up the pilot action. Therefore, it 
prepares a solid foundation for innovative and high value-added transformative agriculture in the second 
part of Mauritania's CSP that is consistent and fully compatible with the reform programme aimed at 
diversifying the economy and advocating support for the agro-pastoral sector. By adopting an inter-sector 
approach, the project strives to achieve complementarity and synergy with other sector strategies and 
initiatives, such as the Produire en Mauritanie Initiative (IPM); the National Employment Strategy; the 
Industrial Sector Development Strategy (2015-2019), especially for the agri-food and agro-industry 
component; the National Strategy for the Promotion of Micro- and Small-sized Enterprises (2015-2019), 
particularly the pillar relating to the integration of MSEs in sectors with high potential for value added and 
job creation; and the National Microfinance Strategy (2015-2019), with its fourth pillar related to the 
development of an inclusive supply of products. 

1.1.4 The agro-pastoral sector is strategic in Mauritania and contributed 23.4% to national GDP 
formation in 2017. Agriculture has considerable potential: nearly 500,000 ha of arable land, including 
about: (i) 365,000 ha for rain-fed crops; (ii) 135,000 ha for irrigated crops; (iii) 19,700 ha planted with 
palm trees; and (iv) 22,500 ha under dam-irrigated farming. There is also an undervalued irrigable potential 
along the Senegal River, with 46,100 ha of developed land. Livestock is another strategic sector. It 
contributed on average 20% of GDP over the 2014-2017 period, and accounted for 85% of rural value-
added and 78% of the national value added in the agricultural sector. Mauritania’s livestock population is 
significant and estimated at 21.05 million sheep and goats, 1.95 million cattle and 1.47 million camels 
(ONS, 2016). The agro-pastoral sector is the largest employer, despite the many obstacles that limit its 
development (access to finance, vocational training, new technologies, etc.). It has great potential that 
remains untapped in terms of mobilisation (intensification, productivity improvement, preservation, etc.) 
and enhancement to promote agricultural sector value chains. The institutional development of agricultural 
research, advisory and service structures, the reorganisation of professional structures, the structuring of 
strategic sectors and the upgrading of value chains are all challenges to overcome. 

1.1.5 The agro-pastoral sector is also a major employer in the country and accounts for 30% of 
the labour force. It provides income to approximately one (1) million inhabitants and plays a key role in 
food security and resilience. However, according to the latest ONS report on the poverty situation in 
Mauritania, households headed by persons working in the agriculture and livestock sectors are the poorest, 
with an incidence of 59.6% and 41.8%, respectively (2014). 

1.1.6 The lack of value-added in the agro-pastoral sector limits the country's prospects for 
diversification and job creation. The sector has great potential that remains untapped in terms of 
mobilisation (intensification, productivity improvement, preservation, etc.) and enhancement to promote 
agricultural sector value chains. Hence, the institutional development of agricultural research, advisory 
and service structures, the reorganisation of professional structures, the structuring of strategic sectors and 
the upgrading of value chains are all constraints to be addressed to ensure that Mauritania fully enjoys the 
economic potential of its agro-pastoral sector.  

1.2 Rationale for Bank Involvement 

1.2.1 The project needs stem from the logic of consolidating and extending the significant 
achievements of PAHABO and strengthening the transformative dimension (promotion of value chains by 
focusing on two key sectors that are crucial to the economy and to inclusive development, namely: rice 
farming and vegetable gardening). The project is consistent with the Bank's strategic guidelines and High 
5s, including the priorities “Feed Africa” and “Improve quality of life for the people of Africa”, food 
security enhancement and climate change adaptation measures. It is fully consistent with the Bank’s: (i) 
Ten-Year Strategy 2013-2022 (objectives of inclusive growth and transition to green growth); (ii) Pillar I 



 

 3 

of CSP 2016-2020 for Mauritania related to “Support for agricultural transformation”; (iii) agricultural 
strategy (Feed Africa [2016-2025]; (iv) Jobs for Youth in Africa Strategy (2016-2025) and (v) Investing 
in Gender Equality for Africa's Transformation (2014-2018), including Pillar II on “Economic 
Empowerment”. PATAM’s implementation requires significant investments and consistent technical 
support. Only the main multilateral donors, including the Bank, are considered by Mauritanian authorities 
as catalysts capable of helping to address such sector issues, and of involving other partners through their 
operations. The Bank has supported the agro-pastoral sector in the past and accumulated significant 
experience in the areas requested. In addition to its earlier funding of two agro-pastoral operations (PADEL 
and PAHABO) for UA 7.67 million and two phases of the Reform Support Programme (PAREDE), the 
Bank is currently engaged in a multinational agro-pastoral operation (P2RS), for which UA 11.5 million 
has already been allocated to Mauritania. It is also worth noting that Mauritania is engaged in transforming 
its economic model, which has so far been based on mining sector exports, into a sustainable dynamic 
economy characterised by diversification and job creation. In this regard, PATAM complements the 
reforms recommended by the PAREDE programme (1 & 2). 

Box 1: Towards a holistic, participatory and integrated approach oriented towards value chains 
The project is an attempt to adopt a holistic, participatory and integrated approach oriented towards the promotion of value chains. 
It is aimed at two levels of intervention: (i) upstream agricultural production to rationalise the use of natural resources (in particular 
water and soil), rehabilitate the natural environment and consolidate the socio-territorial unit; and (ii) downstream agricultural 
production to enhance the value of agricultural products (from farm to market) with particular emphasis on the promotion of public 
investments, improvement of the business environment, increase of the attractiveness of the private sector, promotion of PPPs , co-
responsibility of stakeholders and complementary synergy with other partners. The project also attempts to leverage the Bank's 
flagship initiatives: TAAT, Enable Youth, RSF, ZTAI, etc.  

 

1.2.2 Particular attention is paid to the synergy between various instruments adopted by the Bank in 
Mauritania, namely: investment support (PAHABO, PATAM), reform support (PAREDE 1 & 2) and 
technical support (PPF-PAHABO-2) to back reforms and investments, and increase their sustainability. In 
terms of comparative advantages, there are five basic arguments in favour of the AfDB Group's 
intervention in this project: (i) the Bank Group plays a strategic role in infrastructure development in 
Mauritania; (ii) the project builds on PAHABO and is in synergy with reform support (PAREDE-1 
completed and PAREDE-2 in progress), thus contributing to the establishment of an institutional and 
regulatory framework for economic diversification and support for the agro-pastoral sector; (iii) the project 
will boost agricultural transformation, combat poverty, and improve the conditions of young people and 
women through the promotion of entrepreneurship and job creation; (iv) the project will contribute to the 
improvement of food security in view of the projected additional agricultural output; and (v) the project is 
one of the measures relevant to climate change adaptation and support for the MDGs (end poverty in all

1.3 Aid Coordination 
Sector development is ensured by the Government with the support of a number of bilateral and 
multilateral donors. The main partners in agricultural sector development are the World Bank (WB), the 
European Union (EU), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the Islamic 
Development Bank (IsDB), the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development (AFESD), the African 
Development Bank (AfDB) and bilateral cooperation (Saudi Fund, AFD, GIZ, etc.). Coordination between 
the various donors is carried out through thematic groups, including the Agriculture Group chaired by the 
Directorate for Strategy, Planning and Monitoring and Evaluation (DSPSE) in the Ministry of  Rural 
Development.

II. Project Description 

2.1 Project Objectives: The project aims to achieve the inclusive and sustainable development of 
the agricultural sector. It will contribute to the improvement of food security and the living conditions of 
target communities. More specifically, it will support agricultural transformation in Mauritania by 
increasing the output and value of agricultural products.  

2.2 Project Components: To achieve its objectives, the project has identified the following three 
components: (i) transformative irrigation schemes; (ii) promotion of value chains, youth and women's 
entrepreneurship; and (iii) capacity building and project coordination. The first component, reserved for 
the development of transformative infrastructure, accounts for more than 65% of the total project cost.

2.2.1 Transformative Irrigation Schemes: The main achievements and activities planned under this 
component are: (i) Consolidation and rehabilitation of the dike track over a distance of 62 km: This will 
open up access to existing villages and farming areas, and speed up the development and operation of new 
areas included under the project. The dike will be consolidated by upgrading the technical characteristics 
of its dimensions (including structures) based on new hydraulic, geotechnical, pedological and 
topographical studies. The dike will also increase protection against floods and ensure steady water supply 
to the flood-recession areas to be developed (basins). Installation of equipment to regulate the N'Diorol 
backwaters and weir for the introduction of fish farming; (ii) Development of seven basins (3300 ha): 
recalibration of the backwaters and supply channels of the seven basins to ensure and develop flood-
recession farming; (iii) Development of 200 ha of vegetable farms for women: Development and equipment 
of 200 ha of irrigated vegetable farming areas for women along the river; (iv) Implementation of 
environmental and social actions: environmental and social works (reforestation, dune fixation, etc.) to be 
undertaken to ensure the sustainability of the transformative structures to be built: (v) Technical assistance: 
all works on the transformative irrigation infrastructure will be executed by a contractor, and controlled 
and supervised by a consultancy firm and a works quality control laboratory. All the technical studies on 
the irrigation project carried out by the PPF are available.  

2.2.2 Promotion of value chains and of youth and women’s entrepreneurship: The main activities 
planned under this component are: (i) the promotion of value chains, mainly through equipment of the 
market gardening product packaging centre, support for the Rural Producers' Training Centre (CFPR), 
support to IPM (support to the market gardening and rice clusters, and support for the establishment of 
agro-industrial processing areas in Rosso), promotion of PPP initiatives and agricultural marketing, etc.; 
(ii) the promotion of agricultural and women’s entrepreneurship, in particular through support for 
ANAPEJ to champion youth and women's entrepreneurship, and the establishment of start-ups to 
complement PAFEJ and PAMPEJ. In this regard, a regional ANAPEJ agency will be opened at Boghé to 
promote local services. (iii) the development of inclusive financing through support to BCM for the 
establishment of a Guarantee Fund, promotion of agricultural insurance and support for the certification 
and entrepreneurship mechanism, with the mobilisation and backing of CAM, NBM and the SNIM 
Foundation. 

2.2.3 Capacity-Building and Project Coordination: The project will support capacity building for 
its staff (DSCSE, DDFCA, CNRADA, PCU, etc.) and beneficiaries as well as the establishment of a 
Servicing and Maintenance Fund (SMF) for irrigation infrastructure.

2.3 Technical Solution Adopted and Alternatives Explored 

2.3.1 PATAM follows an integrated approach that links the upstream and downstream farming sectors 
to enhance value and promote value chains. It builds on PAHABO (2005-2014), which generated 
undeniable physical, human and institutional achievements that need to be consolidated and extended to 
surrounding areas. Consultation with stakeholders during project design missions made it possible to adopt 
the same technical solution implemented by PAHABO for transformative irrigation schemes. This 
technical solution has the advantage of: (i) setting up infrastructure to ensure adequate water collection 
and better use; (ii) opening up access to the area; and (iii) ensuring better optimisation of investment costs. 
The project will fund water supply right down to individual plots (farms). With regard to the promotion of 
value chains, two key sectors have been identified, namely rice cultivation and vegetable farming, which 
have tangible value margins and are aimed at differentiated target groups (male cooperatives for rice 
cultivation and female cooperatives for vegetable farming). Hence, PATAM seeks to build on these 
achievements by capturing value added at the local level and creating employment opportunities. It is also 
an appropriate solution for mitigating the effects of climate change. 

2.3.2 The technical design of the project took into account: (i) lessons from PAHABO; (ii) the 
availability of water and soil resources; (iii) consultation with irrigation water users and their approval of 
technical solutions for the choice of proposed works; and (iv) farmers’ capacity to master the techniques. 

Table 2.3: Project Alternatives Explored and Reasons for their Rejection1 
ALTERNATIVE 

EXPLORED 
BRIEF DESCRIPTION REASONS FOR REJECTION 

 Development and 
irrigation of the basins  

This entails building the necessary equipment 
to collect water for irrigation of the basins as 
well as land development to ensure sustainable 
irrigation. 

High cost of the investments and the transition 
towards flood-recession farming. 

 Regulation of the 
channels supplying 
water to the basins 

Regulation of the channels supplying water to 
the basins makes it possible to ensure flood-
recession farming. The solution considered is 
to carry out such regulation naturally without 
acting on the system. 

This option was abandoned because it does not 
guarantee proper regulation of flood recession. 
There are plans to install control structures to 
regulate the water level in the basin according to the 
flow rate of the backwaters that feed each basin. 

 Development of roads 
and bridges to open up 
access to the project 
area 

To ensure access, it is proposed that access 
roads be developed in the project area. 

Very high cost. Only the bridges for crossing the 
main backwaters have been retained and will be 
funded through an additional NTF loan.  

2.4 Type of Project 

This is a sector investment project that has the particularity of adopting a participatory and integrated 
approach to target investments and link up the upstream and downstream agricultural subsectors (see 
details in Technical Annex B.3, Volume 2). 

2.5 Project Cost and Financing Mechanisms 

2.5.1 The overall project cost, net of taxes and customs duties, is estimated at UA 14.67 million, 
equivalent to MRU 743.37 million. The foreign exchange share constitutes 73% of the total project cost. 
Customs duties and taxes will be defrayed by the State. Physical and financial contingencies, which total 
11% of the base cost, have been calculated based on detailed estimates presented by the Borrower. The 
Government contributes UA 1.67 million, equivalent to MRU 81.56 million, representing about 11.3% of 
the total project cost. The detailed project costs are presented in the technical annexes (C9). The ADF and 
NTF loans are valued at UA 7 million and UA 6 million, respectively.

2.6 Project Area and Beneficiaries  

2.6.1 The planned investments target historically poorly endowed areas where a large number of 
farmers are exposed to droughts and poverty and insecurity because they lack the resources to develop 
the existing potential (water and soil). These investments will promote shared prosperity and build the 
resilience of these target communities to future shocks, including those relating to climate change. 
The project will benefit a population of 42,600 (20,448 men, i.e. 48%, and 22,152 women, or 52%) 
from 6,700 households. The region is qualified because it is exposed to extreme poverty and is reputed 
for seasonal immigration; mainly men seeking informal employment.1 The main activities practised 
by the population and which constitute livelihoods within their local economy are (in descending

order): agriculture (43%), livestock (14.14%), trade (10.42%) and fishing (3.48%). Women are 
engaged in many activities: mainly agriculture (crops, vegetables), small livestock production, petty 
trading and handicraft. The project's support for job creation will be provided through ANAPEJ 
(promotion of YAE and innovative start-ups). Farmers in the rice and vegetable farming sectors and 
clusters are the main beneficiaries of IPM support. 

2.7 Participatory Approach to Project Design and Implementation 

2.7.1 PATAM was designed with the sustained involvement of the stakeholders concerned 
(various administrative entities, grassroots organisations, socio-professional structures, private 
operators, beneficiaries and development partners). The participatory approach was adopted prior to 
project design, from technical studies carried out under the PPF where the findings were submitted 
and validated with the relevant technical departments and representatives of the target communities. 
The process is fully participatory since the Local Consultation Council (LCC), the women's Economic 
Interest Group (EIG), representatives of women's cooperatives and user associations established since 
the implementation of PAHABO were involved in all the stages. As was the case in PAHABO-1, 
women's organisations, users' associations, the LCC and the EIG will also be involved in 
implementing this project. 

2.7.2 Furthermore, the Bank's various design missions also held numerous consultation meetings 
with the administrative entities concerned, professional structures, private operators likely to be 
involved in the project and beneficiary representatives (cooperatives, etc.). Moreover, the 
implementation of various proposed activities will be based on a participatory approach actively 
involving the LCC, the CNP and the organisations, to improve their governance and increase their 
accountability.  

2.8 Bank Group Experience and Lessons Reflected in Project Design 

2.8.1 The Bank’s portfolio in Mauritania (mid-November 2018) comprises 15 operations worth 
UA 239 million (see details in Annex 3). While the overall quality of the portfolio is deemed 
satisfactory, there are still some implementation problems, including: (i) start-up delays due to lack 
of project ownership on the Mauritanian side; (ii) procurement delays; and (iii) weak project 
implementation capacity. The measures designed to address these challenges include: (a) quality 
improvement at entry by setting up project management bodies prior to approval; (b) establishment 
of more rigorous procurement plans; and (c) assessment of implementation capacity problems and 
substantial capacity building. All these recommendations have been factored into PATAM. In 
particular, lessons from PAHABO are strategic guidelines that can further strengthen PATAM’s 
design and implementation. These include the need to: (1) ensure the availability of implementation 
studies and the finalisation of project BDs prior to project approval; (2) ensure geographic 
concentration and a particular interest in development to maximise value added at the local level and 
ensure better stakeholder mobilisation and beneficiary ownership; (3) strengthen the project 
monitoring, evaluation and coordination function, which are crucial to project implementation quality; 
(4) appoint a procurement manager and support procurement and disbursement procedures (provide 
capacity-building measures); (5) raise awareness among the client and target population on the role 
of servicing and maintenance to ensure better operation and sustainability of the facilities; and (6) 
improve the environment and business climate to ensure better private sector involvement.  

2.8.2 Based on these factors, project design focused on: (i) the availability of technical studies 
carried out under PPF-PAHABO-2 and which are highly useful for mobilising co-financing (IsDB, 
GCF, GEF, SF, EIB, etc.); (ii) the consolidation of results achieved, extension of PAHABO's 



 

 9 

outcomes to other areas and consideration of an entire component for the promotion of value chains 
as well as women's and youth entrepreneurship that are central to the project’s design and underpinned 
by a participatory and integrated process; (iii) measures to strengthen project monitoring, evaluation, 
steering and coordination have been planned to consolidate the quality of project implementation; (iv) 
crucial measures are planned to accelerate procurement: the appointment of a procurement officer 
from among the PCU staff, the use of advance contracting and the national system according to 
recommended thresholds, the implementation of capacity-building and support measures (support to 
the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority-ARMP), the conduct of procurement audits, the 
preparation of a procedures manual, the establishment of an accounting system for procurement, and 
the improvement of disbursements; (v) support for the establishment of a Servicing and Maintenance 
Fund (FEM), which will be provisioned from 2021 with a start-up allocation for more sustainable 
development; and (vi) innovative actions to strengthen the sustainability of the activities executed and 
private sector mobilisation: support for the establishment of a guarantee fund and a risk-sharing 
system, promotion of agricultural insurance, support for the establishment of an integrated logistics 
platform (agro-industrial processing area in Rosso in support of the “Produire en Mauritanie” 
Initiative (IPM), promotion of new concepts allowing the involvement of the private sector and the 
development of PPP initiatives (certification concept, agricultural entrepreneurship oriented towards 
high value-added services, supported and sponsored by the private sector: NBM, CAM, SNIM 
Foundation, etc. that have expressed interest in joining and backing these concepts). The Bank will 
seek technical support, through trust funds, to promote and ensure the implementation of these 
initiatives. 

2.8.3 PATAM has also benefited more from sector budget support (PAREDE-1 & 2) and technical 
support under PPF-PAHABO-2, which is still being implemented. One of the recorded achievements 
concerns the complementarity and synergy adopted between the Bank's three financing instruments 
(reform support, investment support and technical support) and the complementarity linkages with 
operations in a logic of convergence: 

 Bank Group: (i) PAREDE 1 & 2 (including support for PPPs and land reforms - 
agricultural and rural land is at the heart of this reform process and after significant 
progress in the Rosso region, agricultural and rural land regularisation is expected to 
start in the Brakna region; support for the establishment of a service and maintenance 
fund for agricultural infrastructure and structures, support for the establishment of 
innovative and inclusive mechanisms for financing the agro-pastoral sector); (ii) 
PAFEJ (technical and institutional support for ANAPEJ, support for the opening of 
local offices, support for the integration of young people); (iii) PAMPEJ ( 
establishment of the microfinance refinancing mechanism via the FOREMI fund 
hosted at the CDD); (iv) P2RS which intervenes partly in Brakna. 

 TFPs in Mauritania: The concentration on the agricultural sector is justified by the 
principle of complementarity with the operations of the World Bank (focused on core 
livestock sector projects such as the Regional Support Project for Pastoralism in the 
Sahel-PRAPS, USD 45 million), the EU (RIMRAP, RIMDIR and RIMFIL), GIZ 
(Promotion of Employment and Professional Integration in Rural Areas - PELIMIR) 
and AFD (CAP-Insertion).  

2.9 Key Performance Indicators  

The key project performance indicators are: (i) the total length (in km) of track dikes constructed or 
consolidated; (ii) the surface area (in ha) of basins developed; (ii) the surface area (in ha) of vegetable 



 

 10 

farming areas developed for women (FAW); (iii) the average yields obtained in basins and FAWs; 
(iv) additional agricultural output; (v) the number of farmers benefiting from the basins developed 
and the number of women farmers benefiting from FAWs; and (vi) the number of operational rice-
farming cooperatives for men and vegetable farming cooperatives for women as well as the respective 
memberships of both. The main impact indicators are: (a) improvement of the agricultural income of 
target communities; (b) contribution to poverty reduction; (c) contribution to the improvement of the 
nutritional status; (d) contribution to the reduction of food imports (in tons of cereals and vegetables); 
and (e) contribution to the creation of decent and sustainable jobs. The main data sources for 
monitoring these indicators are the PCU, DSCSE, ONS, CSA, BCM and ASYCUDA. This data will 
be supplemented by field surveys and targeted analyses, with occasional support from technical 
assistance, if necessary. The relevant data will be collected, processed and the results disseminated 
through the results-based monitoring and evaluation system set up by the project. 

III. Project Feasibility 

3.1 Economic and Financial Performance 

3.1.1 The transformative infrastructure to be constructed (irrigation schemes, access roads), the 
structures to be built in the basins (recalibration, cleaning) and women's vegetable farming areas will 
provide the population with newly cleared plots of irrigated good soil conducive to the development 
of the available potential (water, soil and labour force). This new situation, long awaited by the target 
communities, will stimulate the execution of vital activities that will help them to achieve poverty 
reduction, self-reliance, permanent employment, decent income and self-development. This will help 
to increase the added value of the irrigated areas concerned and to generate positive impacts that would 
be social (creation of local jobs, poverty reduction, improved nutritional status, reduction of rural 
exodus, etc.), economic (increased agricultural output, better use of irrigation water, enhanced 
regional balance, etc.), environmental (mitigation of the negative effects of climate change, rational 
exploitation of river water, substitution of water pumping by flood spreading and use of renewable 
energies vegetable-farming areas, which will lead to a reduction in energy demand, etc.) and 
institutional (consolidation of cooperatives, EIGs and water users' associations, institutional capacity 
building, organisation of farmers to improve market access, funding and service provision, etc.). The 
main benefits generated by the project are assessed through the following key indicators:

3.1.2 Financial profitability analysis yielded a FIRR of 18.8% and the sensitivity tests showed that 
profitability remains around the threshold of the opportunity cost of capital, even when there is a 10% 
decrease in output value and a concurrent 20% increase in investment costs, with the FIRR then being 
13%. Economic analysis was done based on the benchmark price method and comparison of the "no-
project" and "project" situations. The economic and financial performance was assessed based on an 



 

 11 

investment life of 30 years. The project costs relate to the investments made, including physical 
contingencies, repair and maintenance costs, production and renewal costs. The analysis focused on 
the seven basins (Afnia, Balla, Moi - Moi, Diayolé- Djoulé, Nevga, Regba), thanks to which the six 
creeks can be exploited (Lougué, Sidi Youkel, Koundi, Ngaleng, Ballabour, Regba) and a cluster of 
small vegetable farming areas developed along the river bank that will subsequently be allocated to 
women's cooperatives. The operation of this infrastructure will increase the average net income per 
farm in the flood-recession farming areas from MRU 18,923 in the current situation to nearly MRU 
70,409 in future, representing an increase of more than 3.5 times (3.62).  This income will directly 
benefit fragile rural households and contribute to poverty reduction among vulnerable groups 
(especially women and the youth).  

3.1.3 The project’s economic benefits stem from the increase in agricultural output during normal 
operation, with an additional annual output of 107,530 quintals of cereals produced from flood-
recession farming (sorghum and maize), 8,320 tons of rice, 4,000 tons of vegetable products, 5,100 
tons of fodder to be valued in terms of milk and meat, and value chain development for certain 
vegetable products (vegetable recycling and drying). Other project impacts such as opening up access 
to villages, facilitating access to farms, transporting products, developing marketing channels and 
improving access between farming areas, local (Boghé, Dar El Baraka, Ouled Biram, Dar El Avia, 
Aleg) and national markets (development of certification contracts and PPP initiatives) were not 
factored into the analysis.  

ERR (base-case scenario): 18.4 %  NPV (10%): MRU 462,125 

3.1.4 The sensitivity tests conducted show the profitability of the project: a 10% increase in 
investment costs reduces the ERR to 16.9%; a 10% decrease in production reduces the ERR to 15.0%; 
a 10% increase in investment costs combined with a 10% reduction in production yields an ERR of 
13.7%. 

3.2 Environmental and Social Impact 

Environment 

3.2.1 Based on the Bank's Environmental and Social Assessment Procedures (ESAPs), the project 
was classified under Category 2 due to the limited scale of the irrigation schemes that only concern 
200 ha, and the local and temporary scope of the expected impacts following the rehabilitation of the 
existing dike track. Decree No. 2007.105, which defines the content and procedure for conducting 
environmental impact assessment (EIA) and monitoring their implementation, classifies the project 
under the category of operations subject to an EIA. On this basis, an environmental impact assessment 
with an environmental and social management plan was prepared in accordance with the Bank's 
Integrated Safeguards System (ISS) and the national system. The study was validated and its summary 
submitted for publication for a period of 30 days prior to the Board of Directors' meeting. In 
accordance with Decree No. 2007.105, the consultation was organised with the target groups. The 
Decree stipulates and requires that any decision should be preceded by a public inquiry to seek public 
input and comment on the likely impacts of the project and the acceptability of alternative solutions 
or mitigation measures under consideration. 

3.2.2 From an environmental standpoint, the project will mainly lead to: (i) better management of 
water and soil resources, and development of the irrigation potential; (ii) a better understanding of 
rational water use for agricultural purposes; (iii) water and soil conservation; and (iii) the creation of 
favourable conditions for restoring the biodiversity in the backwaters. The positive impacts of project 



 

 12 

activities from the social standpoint essentially relate to: (i) improvement of agricultural production 
techniques and systems; (ii) improvement of income and marketing conditions; (iii) broadening of the 
product range and enhancement of output value through processing; and (iv) strengthening of the 
skills of the various agricultural sector stakeholders. In terms of impact on the community living 
environment, it will: contribute to food and nutritional security; famine control; and job creation. 
During the construction phase, the negative impacts will essentially be limited to the works area and 
generally be of low intensity. The ESMP prepared under this project includes a series of measures 
during the construction and operational phases aimed at mitigating negative impacts and ensuring the 
project's sustainability. In terms of job creation, the project provides technical guidance as well as 
innovative and inclusive financial support to the agricultural sector. Furthermore, with a view to 
promoting women's and youth entrepreneurship, the project seeks to combat women’s and youth 
marginalisation by setting up an inclusion mechanism to reduce cultural barriers that negatively affect 
these groups, and support financing for granting specific microcredit to this category of investors. 

Social 

3.2.3 The “Systematic Country Diagnostic” report prepared by the World Bank in May 2017, 
concludes that “the main driver of poverty reduction in rural areas has been the increase in the welfare 
of agricultural and livestock producers”. It also concludes that despite significant improvements, 
social indicators remain among the lowest in the world. Mauritania was ranked 153rd out of 186 
countries in the Human Development Index in 2014. Despite the progress made in reducing poverty, 
it remains a widespread phenomenon, mainly in rural areas, and is associated with unequal access to 
social services and productive capital. The qualitative data in this report indicates that land is unevenly 
distributed, particularly in the fertile Senegal River Valley, where the majority of poor agro-pastoral 
producers operate. Women are particularly affected; only 18.7% of them have land in the country. 
The highest poverty rates are recorded in households headed by persons who are illiterate or have not 
completed primary education. The “40 per cent poorest” have the lowest access to other basic services, 
such as health, water and sanitation. Limited access to land in rural areas and high food prices in urban 
areas prevent the poorest from accumulating assets. Very few poor small farmers hold formal land 
rights in the Senegal River Valley, while most of them depend on informal customary rights. This 
situation has caused land insecurity for land users and investors as well as social tensions.  The project 
responds to expressed needs and has taken into consideration the lessons from the previous PAHABO 
project. It addresses food shortages and malnutrition, inadequate access to agricultural inputs leading 
to low production, limited access to financial support and high youth (male and female) 
unemployment rates. All said, despite the relative socioeconomic progress, poverty remains high in 
Mauritania at 31% (EPCV, 2014) compared to 42% and 51% in 2008 and 2000, respectively. Poverty 
remains rural in nature (about one in two people in the rural areas is poor - 44.4%).  Brakna is among 
the four willayas with a worrying poverty rate that exceeds the national poverty threshold (43.3% in 
Brakna compared to 31% at the national level, i.e. 12.3 points above the average). The illiteracy rate 
is 52.5% (59% for women). With regard to income, the data indicates that the average annual income 
is estimated at MRU 224,800 for a “typical” well-off household and MRU 159,000 for an average 
household, while poor to very poor households have MRU 89,000 and MRU 51,400, respectively. 

3.2.4 The 2016 ONS data indicate that Brakna’s population is relatively young (the 15 to 39 
age group represents 35.2% of the total population). On the social level, the foreseeable negative 
impacts would affect farmers who are not project beneficiaries and whose competitiveness on the 
market would be relatively low, as well as rural women whose participation in project benefits remains 
limited due to cultural barriers. However, these impacts will be significantly reduced by the mitigation 
measures provided for in the ESMP, in particular the strengthening of women's participation in 



 

 13 

cooperatives and associations, and measures to support and finance income-generating activities for 
women and the youth who constitute the vulnerable segment of the population. 

Adaptation to Climate Change 

3.2.5 In terms of vulnerability to climate change risks, the project is classified in Category 2, which 
reflects medium vulnerability that requires the implementation of climate adaptation measures and 
their integration into the design of facilities planned. The following measures were considered to 
strengthen ecosystem and community resilience: (i) development of irrigated areas and reduction of 
extensive farming; (ii) introduction of innovative technologies for the optimal management of natural 
resources, particularly water; (iii) promotion of climate-friendly smart farming practices; (iv) 
promotion of small livestock farming, in particular goats and sheep, which also helps to fertilise the 
soil, etc.; and (v) programming of reforestation actions that reduce bank erosion and have a beneficial 
effect on carbon sequestration. An entire component is reserved for climate financing, on which a 
concept note has been submitted by the Bank to the Green Fund. 

Gender 

3.2.6 In Mauritania, efforts must be made to promote gender-sensitive human development. 
Women are among the prominent development stakeholders in rural areas (representing over 52% of 
the rural population in Mauritania). Agriculture is also the main economic activity of rural women 
and employs more than 90% of working women. About 90% of vegetable farmers are women. Indeed, 
almost the entire female labour force is engaged in this activity.  Apart from agricultural activities, 
rural women are involved in agricultural product processing and handicrafts, which is a key domain 
(weaving, wool processing, etc.). Furthermore, the agricultural model in Mauritania is based on cash 
crops and food crops farmed by men and women, respectively. Hence, farmers are organised into rice 
cooperatives (mainly men, with 30% women) and food crop cooperatives (mainly women). Two 
major challenges arise from this mode of organisation: access to land and financial assistance. 
Women's cooperatives specializing in food crops need small-sized farms and, consequently, the 
women cannot access financial assistance to increase their production. Furthermore, women have 
limited access to agricultural inputs because of their low level education and limited access to 
information. Since women also perform a triple function (childbearing, production and social 
responsibility), solutions must be found to reduce their workload. 

3.2.7 The project is intended to support women's cooperatives through: (i) improvement of 200 
hectares and expansion of the irrigation system of 90 women's cooperatives; (ii) increased access to 
financial support for women's cooperatives through the establishment of a gender-sensitive 
agricultural insurance guarantee fund (to reach 50% of women); (iii) development of a comprehensive 
training centre (incubation) equipped with the necessary demonstration equipment and a teaching 
model to improve agricultural products and agro-industry. Moreover, (iv) the operation of storage 
rooms and improved market access are expected to increase with the construction of the two bridges 
and the organisation of extension services.1

Forced Resettlement 

3.2.8 The Project does not involve the displacement or resettlement of people from the project area. 

IV. Project Implementation 

4.1 Implementation Arrangements 

4.1.1 Executing Agency: The project is placed under the technical supervision of the Directorate 
for Strategy, Cooperation and Monitoring/Evaluation (DSCSE) in the Ministry of Rural Development, 
which will entrust its management and coordination to an autonomous unit based in Boghé within the 
SONADER Regional Directorate. This will promote local supervision, the benefits of which were 
confirmed by PAHABO. The Project Coordination Unit (PCU) will comprise eight experienced 
managers,1 capable of executing the main project tasks:  (i) construction of infrastructure and 
development of flood-recession farmlands, land enhancement, farmers’ advisory, training, 
agricultural extension services, and support for project activities; (ii) project planning, programming, 
and administrative and financial management; and (iii) project coordination, monitoring/evaluation 
and control. Specifically, it will be responsible for the following tasks: (a) preparation and 
implementation of project work programmes and annual budgets (PTBAs); (b) preparation and 
monitoring of bidding documents, works execution, goods and services contracts and disbursement 
requests; (c) internal monitoring of the project; and (d) preparation of financial statements and 
progress reports. The PCU, the DSCSE and the SONADER regional management will work closely 
together to ensure the smooth implementation of project activities. Targeted technical assist ance 
missions (monitoring/evaluation, environmental monitoring) and certain technical departments 
(DDFCA, CNRADA, ENFVA-CFPR, DAR, ANAPEJ, IPM, DPN-MEDD, etc.) will periodically 
support the PCU. 

4.1.2 Institutional Arrangements: Based on the recommendations of the Paris Declaration and the 
conclusive lessons from PAHABO, particularly in terms of institutional arrangements, the project 
will recommend a light coordination and management structure, and will build on the State's 
sustainable structures through the signing of a coordination charter (between Ministry of Rural 
Development stakeholders) and specific partnership agreements with partners involved in its 
implementation (apart from the Ministry of Rural Development:  ANAPEJ, DPN-MEDD, etc.). (i) A 
National Steering Committee (CNP) will be set up at the start of the project to guide, orient and 
supervise its implementation. This committee will be chaired by the Secretary General of the Ministry 
of Agriculture and comprise representatives of stakeholders involved in the project: (MEF, DSCSE, 
DPN-MEDD, ANAPEJ), the PATAM Coordinator (Secretary) and two beneficiary representatives 
(including one woman). It will meet at least twice yearly to review the annual work and budget 
programme (AWBP), and assess project progress. (ii) A Local Consultation Committee (LCC), 
responsible for monitoring and organising activities within the area, will also be set up at project 
commencement. It will be chaired by the Hakem of Boghé, comprising representatives of NGOs and 
two representatives of beneficiaries per area (including one woman), and will meet at least four times 
a year. This Committee may be expanded as necessary to include other persons from the decentralised 
technical services and other structures present in the area (e.g. civil society, representatives of local 
authorities and beneficiaries). The project provides for the signing of a Project Coordination Charter 
(PCC), specific partnership agreements and performance contracts with members of the PCU team to 
ensure results-based management and promote a culture of performance.

administrative and financial officer (AFO), accountant (see organisation chart and job profiles in Annex C1). 



 

 15 

4.1.3 To preserve institutional integration, coherence and continuity, it was agreed to entrust the 
management of PATAM (ADF & NTF funding), the PATAM Project (IsDB funding) and the Climate 
Change Resilience Development Project (Green Fund financing) to the same coordination unit (PCU) 
by adopting the same implementation mechanism.  

Procurement Arrangements (Works, Goods and Services)  

4.1.4  Applicable Procurement Policy and Framework: All goods, works and services funded with 
Bank resources shall be procured in accordance with the Procurement Policy for Bank Group-funded 
Operations (“AfDB Procurement Policy”) October 2015 edition, and the provisions set out in the 
financing agreement. Pursuant to this policy and following various assessments conducted, it was 
agreed that all works, with the exception of irrigation works, and all goods shall be procured in 
accordance with the Borrower's procurement system ("National System") embodied in Law No. 2010-
044 of 22/07/2010 on the Public Procurement Code, its implementing decree No. 2017-216 and other 
statutory texts governing procurement in Mauritania, using national standard bidding documents as 
amended during the project negotiations.   

4.1.5 Irrigation works and all consultancy services will be procured in accordance with the Bank's 
procurement system ("AfDB System") and the Bank's relevant standard bidding documents (BD). The 
Borrower is expected to submit to the Bank a request to use advance contracting (AC), as defined in 
Article 11.2 of the Bank's Procurement Policy of October 2015. The activities targeted by such ACs 
are essentially those related to irrigation scheme works and ancillary control services. 

Special Conditions Stemming from Usage of the National System. 

4.1.6. Eligibility: The Bank's resources for financing project activities come from the joint ADF 
and NTF financing. Procurement financed by the NTF resources administered by AfDB is subject to 
compliance with the rule of origin. Following the assessment of procurement risks and capacities, it 
was decided that the National Procurement System be used for part of this project. All activities of 
this project, whose implementation is planned according to the national public procurement system,  
are financed exclusively from ADF resources. Therefore, no restrictions on the rule of origin will be 
applied to these activities. The only procurement co-financed by the NTF and the ADF, namely the 
consolidation of the track dyke and the development of 7 basins, will be subject to the Bank's 
procurement system and the Bank's rule of origin will be applied. 

4.1.7 Assessment of Procurement Risks and Capacity: Procurement provisions, including risk 
assessment, appropriate risk mitigation measures, procurement capabilities as well as procurement 
implementation details and associated control mechanisms are detailed in Annex B5.  

4.1.8 Advance Contracting: Considering the scheduling constraints related to the Borrower's 
agenda, a number of procurements may, at the Borrower's request, be implemented through advance 
contracting in accordance with the provisions of Article 11.2 of the AfDB Policy. The procedures and 
methods used for such advance contracting shall be identical to those adopted for the project. A 
reasoned request listing the procurements concerned together with a procurement plan shall be 
submitted to and accepted by the Bank.  

4.1.9 Financial Management: The financial management arrangements below are based on an 
assessment of the Executing Agency's financial management capabilities and fiduciary risks detailed 
in the technical annex. They will be redefined during the training to be provided when the project is 
launched. Responsibility for financial management shall rest with the Project Coordination Unit 



 

 16 

(PCU). The PCU will be created by the Ministry of Rural Development and placed under the technical 
supervision of the Directorate for Strategy, Planning and Monitoring/Evaluation (DSPSE). The 
financial management staff will include: a Coordinator, an administrative and financial officer, and 
an accountant. Their recruitment and performance contracts shall be subject to the Bank’s prior 
agreement. Before the beginning of each budget year, the PCU shall prepare an annual work 
programme and budget (AWPB) to be submitted to the Ministry of Rural Development for validation 
through the DSPSE, the Steering Committee and the Bank. It will produce the AWPB implementation 
reports that will serve as the basis for the analysis of variances between projections and actual figures 
(costs and timeframes), supplemented by corrective measures considered in the event of an 
unfavourable variance. These financial performance monitoring reports shall be annexed to the 
quarterly progress reports sent to the Bank latest 45 days after the end of the quarter. Although an 
administrative, financial and accounting procedures manual was prepared under the PPF, it will have 
to be revised and adapted to the final organisation chart of the PCU with a view to its harmonious 
integration within the Ministry of Rural Development, where it will collaborate with certain services. 
The internal control of the project will be based on this manual. 

Project accounting will be kept using the “Success” software procured with an advance from the 
Project Preparation Fund (PPF). The accounting will include all project sources of financing (ADF 
loan, NTF loan and counterpart contributions). The “Success” software will be configured to cover 
all project components and expenditure categories. It should be able to produce quarterly financial 
reports and annual financial statements. 

4.1.10 Disbursement Arrangements: The ADF and NTF loans will be disbursed in accordance with 
the rules and procedures of the Bank's Disbursement Manual, using the direct payment methods (ADF 
loan and NTF ) and the special account method (ADF loan for expenses related to recurrent activities 
and operations). A special account will be opened for this purpose in a bank acceptable to AfDB. 

4.1.11 Account Audit: project financial statements will be audited by an independent external auditor 
annually and at project completion in accordance with the terms of reference (TORs) for the audit of 
AfDB-funded projects. The first audit of the project will include an audit of the use of the Project 
Preparation Fund (PPF) advance in accordance with the Letter of Agreement. Project audit reports 
shall reach the Bank latest six months following the end of the audited fiscal year.  

4.2 Monitoring and Evaluation 

4.2.1 The project will adopt a results-based approach and impact-oriented monitoring (IOM). In 
this regard, a performance measurement framework (PMF) was prepared during the appraisal in 
consultation with the project team (see details in Appendix C.3 Volume 2). As regards this PMF, 
internal monitoring will be carried out by the M/E officer at the PCU level and will serve as a basis 
for evaluating project performance. Monitoring at the central level will be carried out jointly by the 
Directorate for Strategy, Cooperation and Monitoring/Evaluation (DSCSE) in the Ministry of 
Agriculture and MEF's General Directorate for Public Investments and Economic Cooperation 
(DG/IPCE). 

4.2.2 Activities scheduled under the project are summed up in the table below. These activities 
will be conducted following the project implementation schedule presented on Page (vi).

4.3 Governance 

4.3.1 The Mauritanian Government has made efforts over the past five years to increase 
transparency in public affairs management, adopt good governance practices and streamline 
public spending. Hence, it created the Monitoring Committee responsible for implementing the 
National Anti-Corruption Strategy (SNLC) to strengthen the powers and effectiveness of the 
supervisory authorities and the judiciary, and to enhance the key role of Parliament as an entity tasked 
with public expenditure control. This strategy gives civil society the opportunity to express itself, 
formulate opinions and take action with the authorities and the judiciary. The Government has also 
directed macroeconomic policy towards the elimination of extra-budgetary expenditure and budgetary 
financing by the Central Bank of Mauritania, as well as the reduction of recurrent expenditure. 
However, despite these efforts, governance reforms remain insufficient. In 2017, Mauritania was 
ranked 41st out of 54 African countries by the Ibrahim Index of African Governance (IIAG). 
According to the same report, the country's ranking deteriorated over the 2012-2016 period. Under 
Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI), Mauritania's score also deteriorated 
from 31/100 in 2015 to 28/100 in 2017, dropping 31 spots in world ranking (143rd in 2017 compared 
to 112th in 2015). Also, the 2016 Global Competitiveness Index identifies corruption as the third most 
problematic obstacle to doing business in Mauritania. 

4.3.2 In recent years, the Mauritanian Government, with the support of its technical and financial 
partners (TFPs), has initiated a sustained reform programme to improve the national public 
procurement system. This resulted in the adoption of Public Procurement Code 2010-040, which 
incorporates best practice in transparency and competition. To build on this regulatory environment 
for implementation of the provisions of the Paris Declaration on the use of national procedures for the 
execution of AfDB-funded projects, the Bank conducted a detailed review of Mauritania's 
procurement system in 2017. The review, which is currently being validated, concluded that the 
criteria of economy, equity, transparency and integrity are generally met by Mauritania's country 
procurement system. In terms of reforms, and with a view to improving the fiduciary framework for 
public expenditure and procurement efficiency, Mauritania adopted a new decree (No. 126-2017) in 
November 2017 repealing all the implementing decrees of Public Procurement Code 2010-040. This 
new implementing instrument ensures better consistency between the regulations and the public 
procurement code. In the area of financial management, the Government recently introduced a public 
budgetary and accounting management system, called Rashad. State expenditure on projects is 
executed through this system.

4.4. Sustainability  

4.4.1 In view of the high priority given by the Mauritanian authorities to the agricultural sector 
with a view to diversifying the national economy, major public expenditure has been planned to 
support the construction of the irrigation schemes. Therefore, this project will enjoy total ownership 
by government structures (MEF, Ministry of Rural Development, MEDD, etc.) that have the required 
qualifications in the field, and will receive adequate counterpart funding. Recurrent (additional) 
expenditure due to the project will be budgeted and borne by the (regular) operating budget of the 
Ministry of Rural Development, to which the Servicing and Maintenance Fund to be established will 
make a significant contribution mainly to cover the maintenance and servicing costs of the 
transformative irrigation schemes.  

4.4.2 The project seeks to revive flood-recession farming in seven basins totalling 3,300 ha, 
develop vegetable farming areas totalling 200 ha for women, guarantee and ensure the availability of 
water for flood-recession farming, protect against floods and open up access to these areas. Thus, 
through the activities planned, PATAM will have a strong impact to stimulate the social and economic 
development of the project area. It will be recalled that one of the significant impacts of PAHABO is 
the reverse exodus phenomenon that has resulted in the resettlement of more than 1,500 households 
in the project area from the big cities (Nouakchott, Rosso, Nouadhibou, etc). Thus, farmers’ 
involvement in ensuring project ownership and their participation in financing and executing works 
to rehabilitate the farming areas, as well as measures taken to train and organise beneficiaries to ensure 
proper infrastructure management and maintenance will increase project viability and sustainability. 

4.5. Risk Management 

4.5.1 The main risk factors that could compromise project implementation are: (i) insufficient 
interdepartmental coordination; (ii) climate hazards; (iii) limited stakeholder institutional capacity; 
(iv) lack of financial inclusion and insufficient access to finance and credit; (v) poor maintenance and 
servicing of the irrigation schemes that affects the sustainability of the system, crop production and 
profitability; and (vi) procurement delays and their impact on the disbursement rate. 

4.5.2 The main risk factors and appropriate mitigation measures are summarised in the table below: 

Potential Risks Mitigation Measures Level 
Insufficient capacity for inter-sector 
coordination at the national level and 
consultation at the local level 

Establishment of an inter-sector National Steering Committee and a 
Local Consultative Committee. ++ 

Recurrent climatic hazards/droughts Dissemination of resilient technology and seeds. ++ 
Limited stakeholder institutional capacity The programme provides for stakeholder capacity building. ++ 

Problem of financial inclusion and access to 
funding and credit 

The project provides for: (i) a guarantee fund to improve financial 
inclusion; (ii) a partnership convention with Crédit Agricole de 
Mauritanie (CAM); (iii) assistance in the organisation of the 
beneficiaries to facilitate access to credit; and (iv) promotion of 
agricultural insurance. 

+++ 

Poor servicing and maintenance of irrigation 
schemes 

Support for the organisation of water usage, socio-professional 
associations (SPAs) and the establishment of a Servicing and 
Maintenance Fund. 

+++ 

Procurement delays and impact on bid 
invitations and on the disbursement rate 

(i) Use of the national system (ref. applied thresholds); (ii) application 
of advance contracting (APA); (iii) development and implementation of 
necessary tools and capacity building: technical support in procurement, 
development and implementation of public procurement to improve 
upstream (procurement monitoring) and downstream expenditure 
(disbursement planning and monitoring).

4.6 Knowledge Building 

4.6.1 PATAM’s implementation will help to develop knowledge on new irrigation techniques, 
yield enhancement, promotion of the rice and market gardening sectors, farming of high value-added 
crops, management and saving of water resources, and mitigation of the effects of climate change. 
The TAAT initiative will provide support and contribute to: (i) the optimal exploitation of water 
resources; (ii) the adoption of participatory management of the irrigation scheme; and (iii) the use of 
various information systems established (monitoring/evaluation, mapping, agricultural insurance, 
guarantee system, etc.). The training and information sessions envisaged by the project for the 
provision of agricultural advice on irrigation techniques and farming practices to beneficiaries and 
technicians will provide another channel for enhancing and disseminating knowledge. The project 
will also run the Research and Development Programme sub-component, in addition to supporting 
Young Agricultural Entrepreneurs and their involvement in the priority subsector value chains 
retained. The main knowledge gained and lessons learned will be reflected in the project's periodic 
reports and completion report, filed in the Bank's archiving system and published on the websites of 
the ministries concerned (MEF, Ministry of Rural Development, MEDD and ANAPEJ, etc.); (iv) 
design production value models, value chain development in project areas and market access; and (v) 
promote a contractual framework between the stakeholders involved in project implementation. The 
training and information sessions envisaged by the project to promote research and development, and 
support farmers to master irrigation techniques and farming practices constitutes an ideal channel for 
knowledge dissemination. Furthermore, the institution building provided to grassroots organisations 
(rice cooperatives, women's vegetable-farming cooperatives, EIGs, water users' organisations, etc.) 
will give these structures the necessary capacity to serve more effectively as an interface with the 
Ministry of Rural Development. This knowledge will be systematically captured and documented in 
best practice manuals, monitoring and evaluation reports, supervision missions and periodic reports 
that will be shared at country and Bank level. The main knowledge gained and lessons learned will be

Bank Portfolio in Mauritania Major Constraints and Measures Considered 
2.8.1 The Bank’s portfolio in Mauritania at mid November 2018 comprised 15 operations worth UA 239 million; 
72.5% of Bank commitments are operations without a sovereign guarantee. There are 11 public sector operations, two 
of which are multinational (Programme to Build Resilience to Food and Nutrition Insecurity in the Sahel (P2RS - UA 
11.5 million) and the Rosso Bridge Construction Project (UA 25 million)), for a total UA 66.4 million. The portfolio 
covers seven sectors of intervention: industry and mining (67%), transport (11%), water and sanitation (6%), finance 
(5%), agriculture (5%), governance (4%) and social (2%). The configuration of the active portfolio reflects a 
preponderance of the mining and transport sectors, which represent 77% of the Bank's commitment in Mauritania. 
Overall, the performance of the Bank's portfolio in Mauritania is deemed satisfactory. The overall score of the portfolio 
based on the most recent supervision ratings is 3 on a scale of 4, the average score for progress indicators is 3 and the 
average score for development objectives (DO) is 3, which means that the portfolio's performance is satisfactory 
overall. The detailed status of the portfolio is shown in the table above. 

However, although the overall quality of the portfolio is deemed satisfactory, 
implementation problems persist: (i) start-up delays due to a lack of project 
ownership by the Mauritanian side; (ii) procurement delays; and (iii) weak project 
implementation capacity. Measures designed to address these challenges include: (i) 
quality improvement at entry by setting up project management bodies prior to 
approval; (ii) the establishment of more rigorous procurement plans; and (iii) the 
assessment of implementation capacity issues and substantial capacity building. All 
these recommendations were factored into PATAM.

Executive Summary 

A. Project Overview  

A1. The South Agro-Industrial Processing Zone Project (PZTA-Sud, or Agropole Sud) is among 

the flagship projects of Senegal’s Vision 2035 Emerging Senegal Plan (PSE), which raises the number 

of growth drivers from two (telecommunications and services) to six, the four new ones being 

agriculture and agribusiness, housing, mining and tourism. It forms part of Pillar I of the PSE on 

“Structural transformation of the economy and growth” and is an integral part of the industrial PSE 

component that provides for the establishment of three “integrated and competitive agricultural hubs”. 

Furthermore, PZTA-Sud is in line with the priorities of the Country Strategy Paper (CSP) for the 2016-

2020 period and the Bank's Ten-Year Strategy 2013-2022 through its High 5s “Feed Africa”, 

“Industrialise Africa” and “Improve the quality of life for the people of Africa”. 

A2. PZTA-Sud is a pilot project to be implemented over five years for a total cost (net of taxes) 

of approximately EUR 87.75 million, broken down as follows: (i) ADB loan: EUR 43.1 million; (ii) 

IsDB loan: EUR 27.85 million, and (iii) the State: EUR 16.8 million. The project comprises 3 

components: (a) Support for the establishment of a business ecosystem conducive to private investment 

in agribusiness; (b) Sustainable improvement of the capacity of agro-industrial producers; (c) 

Coordination, management and monitoring/evaluation. A Project Implementation Unit (PIU), attached 

to the Ministry of Industry (Executing Agency), will be responsible for: (i) coordinating investments 

in the agricultural hub; and (ii) implementing public sub-projects. It will be complemented by the 

Sovereign Fund for Strategic Investment (FONSIS), for the implementation of PPP sub-projects 

through a Construction and Operation Company (SCE). Lastly, private companies will be responsible 

for private sub-projects, in partnership with local financial institutions.  

A3. The project area is the natural region of Casamance, which has real agro-industrial potential 

in its three administrative districts of Ziguinchor, Sedhiou and Kolda. Thus, the project aims to 

contribute to the revival of this region’s economic activities to support the current peace and 

reconstruction momentum. In this regard, the project will have to mitigate the adverse effects of the 

independence crisis of these last decades through the establishment of an ecosystem conducive to 

private investment in the agro-industrial sectors with high nutritional and market (national and export) 

potential. The key expected outputs of the project are: (i) increase in the share of locally processed 

agricultural production from 2% to 20% for mango and from 5% to 30% for cashew nuts; (ii) reach a 

cumulative amount of catalysed private investment of more than USD 200 million (of which 20% for 

SMEs/SMIs); (iii) increase by at least 40% the agricultural production of key sectors (mango, cashew 

and maize); and (iv) create jobs and wealth, including for youth and women. The project was the subject 

of a comprehensive state-funded feasibility study conducted by a private firm and supported by the 

United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO).  

A4. The project will enable the creation and consolidation of about 14,500 direct jobs (of which 

50% women and 60% youth) and 35,000 indirect jobs (of which 50% women and 60% youth). The 

number of households that will be affected is estimated at 65,000, or about 365,000 people (of which 

50% women and 60% youth). The number of people who will be indirectly affected corresponds to the 

population of the natural region of Casamance estimated at 2 million in 2018. The expected outcomes 

concern improving the food and nutritional security of beneficiaries as well as their income through 

improved access to markets, agricultural inputs, and services. To this end, the project provides for (i) 

the increase in private investment thanks to the facilities provided (more favourable business 

ecosystem, construction of a central agro-industrial module (Adéane), three (3) regional modules 

(Bignona, Sédhiou and Kolda) and five (5) aggregation and service platforms; and (ii) capacity building 

of value chain actors in agro-industrial sectors (structuring/organisation of value chains, training, ease 

of access to finance, production by researching in-vitro mango, cashew, maize seedlings, etc.).  

 



vi 

B. Needs Assessment 

B.1  Despite efforts by the State, food security remains a challenge and food importation continues 

to weigh on the trade balance. Thus, imports of cereals and fruits/by-products amounted respectively 

to CFAF 329.7 billion and CFAF 37 billion in 2017. This is due to the limited private investment as a 

result of the unfavourable business environment (land, taxation, etc.), inadequate infrastructure 

(energy, transport, water, ICT, etc.) and poor structuring/organisation of agricultural value chains 

(which employ about 60% of the working population). Furthermore, there is a low level of processing 

of agricultural products based on quality industrial processes (barely 13% at national level), low 

agricultural productivity and high vulnerability to climate change. This situation is more pronounced 

in the project area where barely 2% and 5% of the mango and cashew nut productions are processed, 

respectively. Thus, the project aims to facilitate the mobilisation of private investment especially in the 

processing and marketing of key sectors (mango, cashew, corn, etc.).  

C. Bank’s Value-Added  

C.1  Through its initiative to support the development of Agro-Industrial Processing Zones 

(AIPZs), the Bank aims to increase private investment in the agro-industrial sector for a sustainable 

transformation of the rural economy particularly by providing quality basic infrastructure and a more 

attractive business environment in the agricultural production basins. The Bank has the requisite 

experience to support the preparation and implementation of this type of project (including in Togo, 

Ethiopia, Guinea, Côte d'Ivoire, etc.), which calls for an integrated approach encompassing the entire 

value chain. Lastly, lessons from similar projects supported by the Bank militate for such an 

intervention that will mobilise the public component (with ADB and IsDB public windows), PPP (with 

FONSIS) and private (with FONSIS and financial institutions).  

D. Knowledge Building 

D.1  As PZTA-Sud is a pilot operation under the PSE, a mechanism will be put in place for 

monitoring/evaluation (M & E) of outcomes and impacts. The project will set up a suitable internal 

monitoring system for project performance led by the Steering Committee, on the one hand, and 

external evaluation, on the other hand, supervised by the Operational and Monitoring Office (BOS) of 

the PSE under the oversight of the Presidency of the Republic. The project will support BOS to carry 

out baseline and end-of-project surveys and, if necessary, specific studies (incentives, private 

financing, public-private partnership, etc.).  Lastly, the results of the M&E mechanism will be 

leveraged and shared through the BOS e-platform, the analytical reports, the consultation and 

experience sharing meetings organised at the regional, national and international level.

BANK GROUP MANAGEMENT’S REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION TO THE BOARD OF 

DIRECTORS CONCERNING A LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL TO FINANCE THE 

SOUTH AGRO-INDUSTRIAL PROCESSING ZONE PROJECT (PZTA-SUD) 
 

Management hereby submits this report and its recommendation concerning a proposal to grant a loan of 

EUR 43,100,000 to the Republic of Senegal to finance the activities of the PZTA-Sud project, commonly 

known as “Agropole Sud”. 

I. STRATEGIC THRUST AND RATIONALE 

1.1 Project Linkages with Country Strategy and Objectives  

 

1.1.1 In 2014, the Government embarked on the implementation of the Emerging Senegal Plan (PSE), 

which aims to have “an emerging Senegal in 2035 with a society of solidarity in a nation of laws” through 

the structural transformation of the economic and social system. The strategic thrusts guiding the PSE are as 

follows: (i) Thrust 1: Structural transformation of the economy and Growth; (ii) Thrust 2: Human Capital, 
Social Protection and Sustainable Development; and (iii) Thrust 3: Governance, Institutions, Peace and 

Security. Thus, PZTA-Sud or ‘Agropole Sud’ falls within the framework of the PSE’s Thrust 1 and forms an 

integral part of the second Priority Action Plan (PAP) of PSE spanning the period 2019-2023. 

 

1.1.2 PZTA-Sud (or Agropole Sud) is one of PSE's three agro-processing hubs (or integrated agricultural 

hubs) through private investments in agribusiness. Thus, it is consistent with the Industrial Sector 

Development Policy Letter (LPSDI), which seeks to raise the industrial sector’s contribution to the GDP 

from 12 to 25% over the period 2014-35, by targeting the agricultural value chains with high potential (fruits 

and vegetables, oils, dairy products, cereals, and poultry). This will benefit the domestic market (import 

substitution) and the international market (fruits and vegetables, fishery products, etc.) as well. It is part of 

the guidelines of the Agricultural, Sylvicultural and Pastoral Policy Law (LOASP) 2004-24 aimed at 

reducing poverty and food security in rural areas. It also aligns with multisector strategies including the 

National Strategy for Food Security and Resilience (SNSAR 2015-35), the National Strategy for Social 

Protection (SNPS 2016-35) and the National Strategy for Equity and Gender Equality (SNEEG 2015-25).   

 Emerging Senegal Plan (PSE) 
  
PSE is the economic policy framework aimed at steering Senegal on the path of emergence by 2035. Pursuing the 
vision of "an emerging Senegal in 2035 with a society of solidarity in a nation of laws", it is structured around 3 thrusts 
targeting 6 priority sectors, 17 key reforms and 27 flagship projects. Thrust 1 aims at the structural transformation of the 
economy by strengthening the current drivers of growth and developing new sectors that create wealth and jobs. Thrust 2 
"Human Capital, Social Protection and Sustainable Development" aims to improve living conditions for the people while 
promoting the emergence of viable territories. Thrust 3 aims to modernise public administration and strengthen security, 
stability, governance, and consolidate the rule of law. 

The first priority action plan (PAP 1) over the 2014-2018 period has raised the GDP growth rate from an average of 
3.3% in 2009-2013 to more than 6% since 2015. Substantial progress has been made in key projects such as the Diass 
International Airport, the extension of the Dakar-Diamniadio motorway, the Thiès-Touba motorway, the Regional Express 
Train, the Diamniadio Industrial Park and the rehabilitation of the Dakar-Bamako railroad line. The agricultural sector has 
been strongly revitalised with the tripling of onion and groundnut production, the tenfold increase in potato production and 
the 141% increase in rice production. As regards energy, progress has been achieved in the installed capacity from 573 to 
1130 megawatts, but also in the generation of renewable energy (solar and wind) with 144 megawatts newly installed. The 
number of electrified villages over the period has increased from 1648 to 3864. The second Phase 2019-2023 (PAP II) 
seeks to remove or mitigate the potential constraints to this growth momentum, while promoting a better articulation 
between the development objectives (SDGs) and those of PSE. It emphasises improving the structuring and maturation of 
projects, and accelerating the implementation of reforms. 

Lastly, the PSE monitoring/evaluation system was strengthened with the implementation of the Harmonised 
Monitoring and Evaluation Framework (CASE) for Public Policy in 2015, comprising the Operational Monitoring Bureau 
(BOS), the Ministry of Economy and Planning and the Organisation and Methods Bureau (BOM). Thus, placed under the 
authority of the Minister in charge of monitoring the PSE, the role of BOS is to provide decision-making tools to the country’s 
highest authority on a weekly basis. It is also responsible for the organisation, coordination and management of 
maturation/structuring processes of projects or flagship reforms.

1.2 Rationale for the Bank’s Intervention 

 

1.2.1 Senegal’s economy continues to perform well, with average annual GDP growth of around 6.7% over 

the 2016-2018 period. This performance is attributable particularly to the dynamism of agriculture, 

construction, tourism, transport as well as financial and insurance service sectors. However, food imports 

continue to weigh on the trade balance and food security remains a challenge. Reasons identified include the 

low level of processing of agricultural products according to quality and competitive industrial processes, 

the low productivity of the agricultural sector and its high vulnerability to climate change. These constraints 

result from the limited private investment due to the business environment that remains unfavourable - 

despite jumping 18 spots in the Doing Business 2020 ranking, the poor quality of basic infrastructure (energy, 

transport, water, telecommunications, etc.) and the poor organisation of agricultural value chains (which 

employ about 60% of the labour force). 

1.2.2 The South Agro-Industrial Processing Zone Project (PZTA-Sud) aligns well with the priorities of 

the Bank's Country Strategy Paper 2016-2020 for Senegal, notably Pillar I on support for agricultural 

processing. Furthermore, it forms part of the Bank’s Regional Integration Strategy for West Africa (RISP 

2016-17, extended to 2019). It is in consonance with three (3) of the five (5) operational priorities of the 

Bank's Ten-Year Strategy 2013-2022, namely (i) the Feed Africa Strategy 2016-2025; (ii) the 

Industrialisation Strategy for Africa 2016-25; and (iii) the Strategy for Improving the Quality of Life for the 

People of Africa 2016-25. Furthermore, the project is in line with the Bank's Second Climate Change Action 

Plan (CCAP II 2016-2020). Lastly, the Bank's intervention forms part of the initiative launched in recent 

years for the development of "agro-industrial processing zones" in agricultural basins with high market 

(domestic and export) potential. Accordingly, Senegal has forged a strategic partnership with the Bank for 

the implementation of the three (3) "Competitive Integrated Agricultural Hubs" of the PSE. Therefore, the 

project will benefit from lessons learned from similar initiatives around the world, and from the Bank’s 

experience garnered in Africa (particularly in Togo, Ethiopia and Guinea), hence its comparative advantage. 

1.3 Donor Coordination  

 

1.3.1 Development assistance is coordinated by the Government through the Economic and Financial 

Cooperation Department (DCEF) of the Ministry of Economy, Planning and Cooperation (MEPC). 

Coordination is carried out by the Consultative Committee of Technical and Financial Partners (TFPs) 

through a three-tier consultation mechanism to which the Bank belongs: the G50, the G15 including a 15-

member Executive Committee (COMEX) and thematic groups. In the dialogues between the TFPs and the 

Government, the main issues addressed concern implementing the key PSE reforms, including land, portfolio 

performance, monitoring/evaluation of outcomes, strengthening of the road maintenance fund and resource 

mobilisation (including domestic resources) under the Ministry of Finance and the Budget (MFB). It is worth 

noting that for the "integrated competitive agro-industrial hubs" project, the agricultural sector TFPs 

participate in the meetings of the National Technical Working Group chaired by MDIPMI. 

1.3.2 Therefore, PZTA-Sud will make use of the results expected from the interventions of projects 

supporting increased agricultural productivity and the development of rural entrepreneurship, namely the 

Water Valorisation for Value Chains Development Project (PROVALE-CV), the Project to Open Up 

Production Areas in Support of the Local Development Programme (PDZP/PNDL-AfDB), the Support 

Project for Skills Development and Youth Entrepreneurship in Growth Sectors (PDCEJ-AfDB), the 

Multinational Programme to Build Resilience to Food and Nutrition Insecurity in the Sahel (P2RS-AfDB), 

and the Project to Develop Resilience to Recurrent Food Insecurity in Senegal (DRIARS-IsDB). 

1.3.3 Specifically, the project will work with the professional organisations engaged in these sub-sectors 

(producer organisations, aggregators/logisticians, agro-processing entities, and exporters) and synergize with 

similar ongoing projects, including Shelter for Life funded by the United States Development Agency

(USAID) and the Project to Support Investment and Competitiveness of Agribusiness in Senegal, focusing 

particularly on the mango industry in Casamance (also USAID-funded). Lastly, the following table shows

II. PROJECT DESCRIPTION    

2.0 Project Intervention Overview  

2.0.0  The project’s overall objective is to contribute towards improving living conditions for the people 

(including youth and women) through the creation of value-added on agricultural products and the 

sustainable increase of productivity of the priority agro-industrial subsectors (mango and cashew nut). The 

specific objectives of the project are (i) to create conditions conducive to private investment in the industrial 

processing of agricultural products, as well as in the provision of inputs and services; and (ii) enhance the 

capacity of priority sector actors to sustainably increase agricultural productivity. 

2.0.1 In terms of concept: the project was designed based on a feasibility study financed by the 

government with UNIDO support, as per the following principles: (i) the targeting of sectors with a domestic 

or international market potential, which led to the choice of two priority subsectors (mango and cashew) and 

three complementary subsectors (maize, banana and non-timber forest products); (ii) the presence of a high-

potential agricultural production basin; and (iii) private sector interest in investing, as confirmed during the 

consultation days (Labs) and with the creation of SOCAAS (Cooperative Society of Actors of the South 

Agricultural hub). The key expected results of mango processing are puree, nectar, dried mango and vinegar. 

For cashew, expected products are cashew nuts and cashew juice. 

2.0.2 At the physical level: PZTA-Sud (or Agropole Sud) will finance : (i) a central module for the 

industrial transformation of productions from the targeted sectors, their packaging and marketing, for a Phase 

1 surface area of 40 ha expandable to 85 ha; (ii) three regional modules for secondary packaging and primary 

processing (local and regional market) covering an area of 5 ha to be serviced, expandable to 10 ha; (iii) five 

division-level platforms for aggregation, cleaning, sorting and primary packaging with a unit area of 3 to 5 

ha; and (iv) collection points in villages (primary storage facilities). Furthermore, resources are earmarked to 

ensure access of modules and platforms to regional networks (roads, electricity, ICT, etc.). The land of the 

agricultural hub, which has been secured according to the requirements of national procedures and the Bank, 

will be registered in the name of SCE. 



 

4 

2.0.2 At the operational level:  three categories of sub-projects (SP) were deemed necessary to implement 

to ensure the success of the agricultural processing area (or Agricultural Hub), namely: 

 Public sub-projects (financed from AfDB and IsDB public windows) will be set up by the Project 
Executing Agency to facilitate private investment. These public sub-projects mainly concern the 

infrastructure of the central module (located in Adéane), regional modules (Kolda, Bignona and Kolda) 

and aggregation and service platforms for which the preliminary design studies (PDS) are in progress 

and those of detailed design (DD) are planned before end-2019. Thus, the project will finance the 

preparation of bidding documents (BD) as well as construction work. Capacity building of institutional 

structures (ministries, research centres, technical services, etc.) and actors of value chains (Banks/MFIs, 

POs, etc.) will be financed by the project to for performance enhancement. Partnership agreements, if 

needed, will be signed with the said structures. 

 

 The public-private sub-projects will be financed via the Sovereign Fund for Strategic Investments 
(FONSIS) to which this responsibility is entrusted under a MDIPMI-FONSIS-BOS tripartite agreement. 

Thus, FONSIS will set up a Construction and Operation Company (SCE), a public limited company 

whose majority capital will be held by the private sector (tenant companies, financial investors and 

members of inter-professional sectors), but will include public investors (FONSIS, local governments 

and the Central State). Alongside the relevant State entities, the SCE will be responsible for: (i) 

developing public-private sub-projects (about 5); (ii) promoting the arrival of private investors in the 

hub; and (iii) managing, recovering and maintaining the hub. SCE’s income will consist mainly of 

rentals, royalties and business services (see box 
 

South Agricultural Hub (Agropole Sud) Construction and Operation Company (SCE) 
 

The mobilisation of private investment is crucial for the success of Agropole Sud. The criteria influencing the investment 

decision include the country’s quality of life and stability, market size, existence of developed and competitive land for industrial units, 

quality of infrastructure (water, energy, wastewater treatment, etc.), connection to domestic and export markets, availability of 

qualified and affordable labour, and the existence of tax/non-tax incentives for targeted activities. 
 

In this regard, Agropole Sud has several strengths, among which: (i) the participatory structuring of the project, which has 

helped to obtain the commitment of producers of the targeted sectors and potential private sector interest; (ii) the upgrading of 

infrastructure thanks to the infrastructure provided for under the project (core module, regional modules, and aggregation and 

service platforms) and those planned by other actors (existence of the Trans-Gambia bridge, dredging of the Casamance River 

enabling the arrival of boats of 5500 tonnes, planned rehabilitation of the Senoba-Ziguinchor road, upgrading of the Ziguinchor 

airport, revival of tourism, etc.); and (iii) the facilitation of investments through the establishment by APIX of an Investment Platform 

in Ziguinchor and the future Agropole du Sud one-stop-shop, as well as the future implementation by FONSIS (Sovereign Fund for 

Strategic Investments) of the Agropole du Sud Construction and Operation Company (SCE). 
 

Thus, on the recommendation of the LAB (5-week participatory workshop organised by BOS, which brought together 96 structures 

for a total 10,500 working hours), a tripartite agreement (BOS-MDIPMI-FONSIS) was signed to entrust FONSIS with the creation 

of the SCE, as a founding shareholder. SCE will be a private company, majority owned by private companies including strategic 

investors (including tenant and inter-professional companies) and financial investors. The State (including FONSIS) and local 

authorities figure among the public shareholders. FONSIS will be responsible for developing and supporting the implementation of 

the future SCE business plan, with the possible involvement of a world-class strategic partner with expertise in the development, 

operation and promotion of private investments in the agricultural hub. The SCE will develop convincing business cases 

concerning specific investments expected in the modules (central and regional) and divisional -level platforms. In these efforts, SCE 

will synergize with the actors involved in investment promotion, including BOS, MDIPMI, APIX, and ASEPEX.

 Private sub-projects will be implemented by the interested companies that will be shareholders of the 
SCE. Among these are five (5) large companies and about 15 SMEs/SMIs. In this regard, this project 

will finance the intervention of the Upgrading Bureau (BMN) to provide non-financial support to about 

35 micro-enterprises and 15 SMEs. Access to financial services will be facilitated through local financial 

institutions (notably Banque Agricole, PAMECAS and ACEP), which have instruments tailored to the 

needs of short- and medium-term credit (“warrantage”, leasing, etc.). They will be supported by the 

Bank through a private sector-window operation under preparation (with PITD) to improve access to 

long-term resources, which is essential for the development of SMEs/ SMIs of the agricultural hub (see 

box). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 Facilitating Access to Financial Services for SMEs/SMIs 

The country's financial system comprises 29 credit institutions, but its banking penetration rate is 19%. Access to 
financial services remains a challenge, especially for SMEs/SMIs, which account for around 80% of enterprises, contribute 30% 
of GDP formation, and employ nearly 60% of the workforce. Furthermore, there is limited access to credit for the agricultural 
sector, perceived as risky by the banks and the SFDs (insufficient financial standing, weak organisational and management 
structures, unreliable financial information, lack of guarantees, and climatic and edaphic hazards) with total or partial crop losses: 
climate, price volatility, markets, health hazards, locust invasions, etc.). They have put in place various types of credit, mainly 
short-term, including: (i) credits for agricultural production; (ii) marketing credits for agricultural products; (iii) credits to breeders' 
organisations for fattening and marketing; (iv) working capital loans, notably through "warrantage"; and (v) medium-long-term 
agricultural equipment credits (tractors, tillers, motor pumps, etc.) via collateral. 

Thus, the project will provide support in the form of: (i) an upgrade of SMEs/SMIs operating in the targeted sectors through 
a technical assistance agreement to SME/SMI support structures (such as the Upgrading Bureau); (ii) a medium-to-long term 
line of credit (from the ADB's private window) to be set up with one or two well-established financial institutions; (iii) strengthening 

the capacity of FS/banks networks (based on a call for proposals) to help them develop financial products adapted to the 
needs of the agro-industrial sector (warrantage, leasing, etc.), staff training and equipment purchase.

2.2 Technical Solutions Adopted and Alternatives Explored 

2.2.1 PZTA-Sud aims to contribute to the transformation of the agro-industrial sector, with a view to 

inclusive agricultural growth reducing poverty and food imports and generating employment. Accordingly, 

PSE provides for the establishment of three "integrated competitive agro-industrial hubs or agricultural 

hubs", in public-private partnership. For Agropole Sud, the physical agro-industrial architecture planned for 

the targeted sectors (mango, cashew, corn, etc.) will include i) a centralised serviced module (external works, 

electricity, sanitation, one-stop shop, etc.) to accommodate the key industrial units and related services 

(logistics, services, etc.); ii) three serviced regional modules that will serve as storage, secondary packaging 

and primary processing areas for agricultural products; and iii) serviced aggregation and service platforms 

to facilitate interaction between value chain actors and to ease producers’ access to services, inputs and 

markets. With the support of the State services, this system will be complemented by improving the access 

of SMEs/SMIs and POs to technologies (quality plant material, inputs, etc.), knowledge (technical, 

organisational, management, etc.), physical infrastructure (access roads, shops, etc.) and soft infrastructure 

(ICT, digital platform, etc.). The system will be complemented by the establishment of the Construction and 

Operations Company by FONSIS. The company established will be in charge of agricultural hub construction 

and management, implementation of the PPP sub-projects (5) and support for private sector mobilisation (60 

enterprises of which 35 micro, 15 SMEs, 5 large), in conjunction with the other relevant State agencies 

(APIX, MDIPMI, ASEPEX, etc.). 

Table 2.2: Alternative Solutions Explored and Reasons for Rejection 
 

Alternative Solution Brief Description Reasons for Rejection  

Implement a classic project 

to support the improvement 

of agricultural production 

Finance the development of 

infrastructure and 

equipment for production, 

harvest and post-harvest 

 The State cannot afford to invest sustainably in the 

agricultural sector 

 Despite State efforts, food imports have remained on 

the rise   

Facilitate the establishment 

of private investors capable 

of investing in the entire 

value chain 

Secure sufficient land to 

woo private investors 

 Tens of thousands of families live on agriculture 

(mango, cashew nuts, etc.); it is unacceptable for 

private individuals to take the place of these 

families.

2.3 Project Type    

2.3.1 PZTA-Sud is a public investment project that aims to create the conditions for increased private 

investment in targeted value chains, particularly in the areas of agricultural processing, input supply and food 

services.  

2.4 Project Cost and Financing Arrangement 

2.4. Project Cost: The project’s overall cost is estimated at EUR 87.75 million (~ CFAF 57.6 billion), 

net of taxes and customs duties. This cost is broken down as follows: a portion in foreign exchange estimated 

at EUR 59.1 million (~ CFAF 38.8 billion) and a portion in local currency amounting to EUR 28.65 million 

(~ CFAF 18.8 billion). This cost includes provisions for physical and financial contingencies estimated at 

approximately 3% each. The estimate of the financial contingencies was made based on the current and 

projected annual rates of inflation of the local currency and foreign exchange estimated on average 

respectively at 2.5% and 1.5% per year. A summary of the estimated project cost by component and 

expenditure category is shown in Tables 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5 below, while the detailed tables are given as an

Senegal for the respective amounts of EUR 43.1 million (49%), EUR 27.85 million (32%), and EUR 16.8 

million (19%). Thus, it should be noted that the combined amount of the counterpart and IDB financing 

represents nearly 51% of the total, which indicates the Government's significant commitment. The 

government counterpart funding contribution, amounting to EUR 16.8 million, includes the seed money 

provided by FONSIS for implementing public-private sub-projects amounting to CFAF 1 billion, the 

compensation of affected persons, rehabilitation of some of the roads connecting the platforms/modules to 

the production areas and the social spending of the PIU. Details of expenditures by source of financing and

2.5. Project Area and Targeted Beneficiaries 

2.5.1 The project impact area covers the regions of Ziguinchor, Kolda and Sedhiou which constitute the 
natural region of Casamance and had a population of about 1,947,967 in 2018. The agricultural and socio-

economic environment of the rural population is characterised by a low access rate to rural roads, storage, 

processing and agricultural production infrastructure, particularly for youth and women. The area has the 

distinction of being among the country’s most productive in agriculture thanks to its good rainfall and soil 

quality. However, a large part of agricultural production is difficult to market owing to low value-added for 

agricultural products. 

2.5.2 The area of intervention has been the focus of attention by the State following the armed conflict of 
the 1980s and 1990s, thanks to the inclusive dialogue for peace and the implementation of multisector 

projects (PPDC, PACM, PARCES, PUDC, etc.), some financed by AfDB (PPDC, P2RS, PROVALE) and 

IsDB (DRIARS, PROMISE, RRVCP etc.). To date, Ziguinchor port and airport are functional, the bridge 

over the Gambia River was completed in 2019 and the road network expanded with the rehabilitation of the 

Sénoba-Ziguinchor road. Therefore, the project comes to consolidate these gains by financing the requisite 

actions to attract private investment in agribusiness. The project will create 14,500 direct jobs and 35,000 

indirect jobs. It will benefit approximately 65,000 households, or about 365,000 people (51% women). It 

will target farmers and the private sector (including SMEs/SMIs) that can invest in agricultural processing 

and service delivery. Specific actions will target the youth and women to integrate them into the agricultural 

value chains. The construction of the agricultural hub infrastructure will be based on local labour. Enterprises 

will receive advisory support to provide decent jobs with basic social security. 

2.6 Participatory Approach to Project Identification, Design and Implementation 

2.6.1 The project design is based on a participatory and inclusive approach involving all stakeholders: 

technical services, producer organisations, women/youth groups, civil society, private sector, TFPs and 

projects. These broad-based consultations took place at all stages, including pre-feasibility and feasibility 

studies, sub-project or 'LAB' structuring workshops, and project preparation and appraisal missions. Under 

the supervision of BOS, the PEMANDU Big Fast Results method (the equivalent of BOS in Malaysia) was 

applied to allow full stakeholder participation through the LAB, which brought 150 participants from 96 



 

11 

structures (private sector, financial institutions, public sector, civil society, etc.) for a total of 10,500 hours 

of work. 

2.6.2  The process helped to (i) delimit the Agropole Sud scheme, with a focus on the priority sectors (mango 

and cashew); (ii) structure the priority sub-projects (public, PPP, and private) to be retained in the agricultural 

hub; (iii) decide on the creation of a Construction and Operations Company (SCE) of the hub in the form of 

a company under private law, in particular to implement the PPP sub-projects; iv) adopt the principle of 

mandating FONSIS to create the SCE, through a tripartite protocol agreement duly signed by FONSIS, BOS 

and MDIPMI. Furthermore, the involvement of various stakeholders has served to identify private investment 

opportunities to be mobilised, with a view to generating wealth, employment & youth entrepreneurship. 

2.6.3 At the project area level, working sessions brought together the territorial administration, local 

elected officials, technical services (agriculture, livestock, water and forestry, etc.), research institutes (ISRA, 

ITA, etc.), financial institutions (Banque Agricole, PAMECAS, ACEP), representatives of producers, civil 

society and certain projects. These working sessions served to (i) present the project's intervention strategy; 

(ii) share the technical choices and channels chosen; (iii) discuss the role of the project actors, gather the 

opinions of the actors and measure the interest of the beneficiaries and their level of accountability in project 

formulation, implementation and sustainability. This participatory approach will be continued during project 

implementation. 

2.7 Bank Group Experience and Lessons Reflected in Project Design 

2.7.1 As of 30 September 2019, the Bank's portfolio comprised twenty-nine operations for a total net 

commitment of UA 1,030 million. This amount is broken down as follows: UA 864.29 million for the public 

sector and UA167.14 million for the private sector. The sector breakdown of national public sector projects 

is as follows: transport (54.0%); water and sanitation (15.1%); rural (17.5%); ICT (6.0%); social (2.1%); 

energy (3.5%) and governance (1.8%). The portfolio performance of national public sector projects remains 

satisfactory with 3 out of 4. The project effectiveness has decreased on average from 9.4 months to 5 months 

between 2011 and 2019 and the average time from approval to meeting the conditions precedent to first 

disbursement has improved from 9.6 months in 2013 to 7 months in 2019. The disbursement rate is 26% for 

an average portfolio age of 3.5 years. Lastly, the public sector portfolio comprises 4 regional operations for 

UA 83.52 million (Senegal) and a disbursement rate of around 35%. 

2.7.2 The mid-term review of the CSP 2016-2020, combined with the portfolio review provided lessons and 

recommendations as follows: (a) For the Bank : i) strengthen Bank support to the private sector to enhance its 

competitiveness and contribution to growth (including through PZTA); ii) improve the project preparation 

quality by using the Project Preparation Fund (PPF); iii) increase the role of the Bank's country office in 

Senegal in project supervision and assistance to reduce file processing times; iv) support agricultural hub 

development projects; vi) improve the country's absorptive capacity by removing bottlenecks during project 

implementation (procurement, disbursement, M&E, etc.); (b) For the Government : i) strengthen project 

monitoring (Ministries of Economy, Finance, Industry); and ii) raise the level of domestic resource 

mobilisation in a context where 50% of AfDB public project financing must be sourced from counterpart 

funding.  

2.8 Key Performance Indicators  

2.8.1 The key performance indicators of the project's logical framework are: Impact Indicators: (i) the 

rural poverty rate; (ii) the per capita value of food imports and exports; (iii) the share of the agro-industrial 

sector in GDP; Outcome Indicators: (i) modern installed capacity of agricultural product processing; (ii) the 

proportion of agricultural products processed according to the required standards (mango, cashew, maize, 

and banana); (iii) the cumulative amount in USD million of private investments catalysed by agribusiness 



 

12 

(including SMEs/SMIs); (iv) additional decent direct/indirect jobs created/consolidated (of which 50% 

women and 60% youth); (v) change in the average annual income level of agricultural households (headed 

by women); (vi) agricultural production of key sectors; (vii) the number of jobs created/reinforced in the 

agricultural sector (of which 50% women and 60% youth). 

III. PROJECT FEASIBILITY  

3.1 Economic and Financial Performance  

3.1.1 The project is designed to generate direct spin-offs in the processing of targeted crops, through 
private agribusiness investments in Agropole Sud (i.e. about 60 units), which can reach 90 by the end of ten 

(10) years. Besides the spin-offs on the private companies established in the agricultural hub, the farms will 

reap substantial income by supplying companies with raw materials for the targeted crops, namely: cashew 

(over 10,000 ha), mango (over 5,500 ha), maize (over 5,000 ha) and banana (over 1,500 ha). In addition 

to these benefits generated by the project and reflected in the economic and financial analysis, there will be 

several others in terms of: (i) creation of temporary and permanent jobs estimated at around 180 per 

processing unit (about 14,500 in total); (ii) improving and increasing the production of non-timber forest 

products (such as baobab, honey, seeds and wild fruits, oils and resins, infusions , etc.); (iii) improving 

the quality of nutrition as a result of capacity building in food fortification and hygiene; (iv) improving access 

to index insurance; and (v) improving the quality of natural resource management through the application of 

smart agriculture, climate change adaptation, biogas energy production and forest cover restoration.   

3.1.2 Financial analysis: the bulk of the above benefits are not tradable or even tangible items, and thus 
do not lend themselves to a financial performance analysis based on existing markets.  As a result, it has not 

been considered appropriate to include them in quantitative analysis, based on a production model or profit-

making activities approach. However, it has been possible to perform a cost/benefit analysis of agribusiness 

and other agricultural production models (FARMOD), as indicated above. 

3.1.3 For agribusiness enterprises, an assumption is proposed based on four (4) types of processing units, 
namely micro, small, medium and large enterprises, with respective investments of CFAF 7 million, 15 

million, 1.345 billion and 15 billion each, according to the average of investment profiles in these kinds of 

models. In this case, the annual turnover per company is CFAF 3.95 million, 11.48 million, 782.10 million 

and 8.88 billion, respectively, for micro, small, medium and large units, from the fifth year, on an operating 

life of approximately 20 years. For agricultural crops from farms and suppliers of agribusiness companies in 

the parks, FARMOD-type production cost/benefit models (Input/Output, Project and No Project) over a 20-

year operating life were used. 

3.1.4 Thus, the financial analysis gave: (i) a financial impact of over CFAF 70.54 billion per year from 
the fifth year of operations expected over 20 years, according to the same type of operations, according the 

life of the investments. This implies that the financial benefits of the project over the period of operation 

exceed the cost of the investments needed to finance it; (ii) a cost/benefit ratio of 1.60, which means that the 

benefits are higher than the cost of the investments; (iii) an internal rate of return of 19.44 %, which is higher 

than the opportunity cost of capital (the capital cost of financial resources for investments in the project) is 

estimated at 12%. Based on these results, it can be concluded that the project presents a profitability profile 

justifying the cost of the investments financially. 

3.1.5 Economic analysis: the economic analysis was carried out using the reference price method, 
namely the prices under conditions of economic efficiency, according to the "Pareto" optimum. It was 

conducted based on the comparison between the "no project" and "project" situation of the production models 

presented in the financial analysis. In this model, tradable goods, i.e. goods likely to be the subject of 

commercial transactions beyond the country (FOB at the port and CIF at the Port of Marseille), are 



 

13 

considered. In this case, the reference prices of these products (economic prices) are evaluated based on the 

ex-ante balance of these crops enabling to obtain export parity prices at farm gate. The labour force was 

economically valued at 65% of its financial value of CFAF 1,800/day, to take into account the inelasticity of 

the labour demand in the country in general and in the project in particular. Based on realistic assumptions, 

the economic rate of return (ERR) of the programme was estimated at 20.14%, with a B/C ratio of 1.62. In light 

of these results, the overall project profitability is deemed satisfactory. 

IRR (baseline scenario) : 19.44% NPV Amount:  CFAF 301.39 billion  

ERR (baseline scenario) : 20.14% NPV Amount:  CFAF 298.21 billion 

3.1.6 Sensitivity analysis: the sensitivity tests conducted based on the reduction in production prices were 
used to measure the stability of the financial and economic performance indicators. Thus, the tests show that 

prices should be lowered to 54.17% (break-even or " switching value") to cancel out the additional benefits 

generated respectively at the financial and economic level, with IRR and ERR equal to the opportunity cost of 

capital, i.e. 12 %. This test shows that the programme profitability profile is robust, although it has not been 

performed on all endogenous values of the model. However, the price variable is of paramount importance since 

it is the only one that is beyond the control of programme management and operation. The summary of the 

sensitivity analysis is presented in the Technical Annexes (Volume II). 

3.2 Environmental and Social Impact 

3.2.1 Environment  

3.2.1.1 PZTA-Sud (Agropole Sud) is classified in Category I. Its classification is justified by the activities 

likely to cause major environmental and social impacts to the natural and human environment conceived as 

an agro-industrial development hub. This approach led to the separation of the agricultural hub infrastructure 

on sites covering the three regions and networking actors of the targeted value chains (producers, processing 

firms, aggregators, etc.). This classification is also justified by the fact that it could trigger all five operational 

safeguards. The documents presented are the Strategic Environmental and Social Assessment (SESA) and 

the SESA summary, which were finalised and posted on 1 August 2019.  

3.2.1.2 Negative impacts: The key negative impacts expected from the project are: (i) risks of 

deforestation; (ii) disfigurement of the landscape; (iii) proliferation of disease vectors (malaria); (iv) 

degradation of ecosystems (soil, wildlife and water resources); (v) waste generation; (vi) dust and smoke 

emission; and (vii) traffic accidents, etc. The planned mitigation measures include: (a) tree planting; (b) 

application of appropriate pesticide management measures; (c) strict control of the pesticides used; (d) 

elimination of expired pesticides; (e) training in integrated pesticide management; (f) producer awareness 

and training; and (g) watering the site, waste collection, etc. The estimated cost of the measures to be 
included in the Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) and entirely financed by the Bank is 

about CFAF 665,000,000.  

3.2.1.3 Positive impacts: The key positive impacts are: (i) business development; (ii) improved mango, 

cashew and maize cultivation; (iii) linking farmers to processing industries; (iv) direct and indirect 

employment for youth; and (vi) increased municipal revenue. The cost of enhancing environmental benefits 

is included in the cost of environmental and social measures. 

3.2.2 Social 

3.2.2.1 PZTA-Sud will have a positive social impact in the construction phase in terms of increasing the 

people's income through the use of local materials (stone, sand, gravel, laterite) and the purchase of materials 

on the local market (cement, wood, iron, etc.). The work will inject fresh money into local markets, which 

will contribute to the development of socio-economic activities. The work will also lead to the development 

of retail trade around construction sites. The supply of construction equipment and materials should boost 



 

14 

transactions in the villages. In the operations phase, there will be a partnership between the agricultural hub 

and the farmers. The agricultural hub operation should generate around 14,500 direct jobs and 35,000 indirect 

jobs by 2024. The agricultural hub could be a means of creating jobs in agribusiness, transport, logistics and 

services (accommodation, catering, etc.), which will improve market access and farmers' income. Therefore, 

strengthening the skills of actors involved in the cashew and mango sectors (producers, traders, transporters, 

etc.) should facilitate access to salaried jobs and the creation of self-employment, thus contributing to the 

fight against poverty, rural exodus and illegal emigration.  

3.2.3 Environmental and Social Management Framework Plan (ESMFP)  

3.2.3.1 The following mitigation measures are included in the ESMFP: (i) development and reforestation 

of the agricultural hub module sites; (ii) application of adequate pesticide management measures; (iii) strict 

control of pesticides used by farmers; (iv) disposal of expired pesticides; (v) training in integrated pesticide 

management; (vi) sensitisation and training of producers; and (vii) application of the Laws on the Protection 

of Wildlife and Soil Degradation, etc. The SESA recommends conducting an Environmental and Social 

Impact Assessment (ESIA) that will: (a) describe the biophysical characteristics of the environment in which 

the project activities will take place, and highlight the major constraints that need to be taken into account 

when preparing the land, building, installing equipment, and operating; (b) assess the potential environmental 

and social impacts of project activities and recommend appropriate mitigation measures including cost 

estimates; (c) evaluate needs regarding the collection of solid and liquid wastes, their disposal and 

management, and make recommendations; (d) conduct a review of national environmental policies, 

legislation, and administrative and institutional frameworks and donor safeguard policies, indicate which of 

these policies are applicable to project activities, identify any gaps that could exist and make 

recommendations to fill them. 

3.2.4 Involuntary Resettlement 

3.2.4.1 Regarding involuntary resettlement, there are legal safeguards to protect the rights of potential 

project-affected persons. Section 31 of Law No. 64-46 of 17 June 1964 on National Land provides that: 

"After the declaration of public utility, the compensation to be paid to affected persons is evaluated on 

specified bases by a commission chaired by the prefect or his/her representative and composed of local 

representatives of the ministries in charge of public works, economy, lands, and those of the communities 

and associations including the mayor of the municipality. The compensations are established taking into 

account exclusively the existing constructions, developments, plantations and crops in the affected area 

undertaken by the affected persons (Section. 32). Displaced persons will be assisted and supported in their 

efforts to improve and rebuild their livelihoods and standard of living. The standard of living of resettlement 

populations will be more favourable than the original situation. Although not a tool offered by the AfDB 

ISS, the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) is required as a precaution, to clarify the process whereby land not 

currently concerned by the project will be developed subsequently. The projected amount to cover the 

displacement and resettlement of affected persons is CFAF 1 300 million (from the counterpart funding).   

3.2.5 Climate Change 

3.2.5.1 Senegal, in its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), agreed to unconditionally reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions by 3%, 4% and 5% respectively in 2020, 2025 and 2030, compared to “business 

as usual” (BAU) emissions for those years. The project will contribute to Senegal's climate change policies, 

particularly for the agricultural sector, with a view to adapting it and achieving the mitigation objectives set 

out in its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), particularly at regional level (Ziguinchor, Kolda and 

Sedhiou).  



 

15 

3.2.5.2  The project is vulnerable to climate risk (classified as Category 2). For this reason, risk 

management and adaptation options have been incorporated into the project design. The sizing of the 

structures will be done taking into account the geotechnical and climatic conditions specific to each site. This 

involves adaptation and mitigation measures in the agriculture, forestry and other land use sectors. In this 

way, the project will support measures that will enable farmers to mitigate and increase their climate change 

adaptation and resilience through, among others: (i) capacity building of state services (ISRA) to produce 

resilient and high-yielding varieties (cashew, mango and maize); (ii) supporting farmer organisations for 

better access to efficient and resilient technologies; (iii) strengthening the quality of advisory support services 

to farmers (climate information, digital platform, etc.); (iv) facilitating access to index insurance for farmers; 

(iv) improvement and adaptation of plant and forest production techniques; (v) changes in agroforestry 

practices to sustainably improve the production, yields and income of agro-foresters; (vi) addition of quality 

and value to agricultural production through post-harvest operations (storage and primary processing 

facilities); and (vii) access to more profitable markets through investment provided for in the agricultural 

processing modules (central and regional).  

3.2.6 Gender  

3.2.6.1 The project is classified under Category 3 according to the Bank's Gender Marker System. It will 

be implemented in a social environment where gender inequalities persist and are exacerbated by the 

migration of men. This situation reinforces the triple role of women with its corollaries of work overload and 

poverty. Thus, the project will take into account the specific needs of women and men as well as youths of 

both sexes. The aim is to reduce the inequalities of access for women and men of all social categories to the 

opportunities offered by the agricultural hub. Actions to be taken include: (i) promoting a gender-sensitive 

regulatory and institutional framework; (ii) equity in implementing project activities, including a quota of 

50% of agricultural project aggregation/primary processing of women-run cooperatives and SMEs (project 

selection, training, financing, etc.); (iii) development of gender-sensitive infrastructure (childcare facilities, 

separate showers and toilets, secure and equipped with water, etc.); (iv) support for women's cooperatives 

and SMEs through the structuring of their businesses and adapted training (including functional literacy, 

financial inclusion, processing, storage and conservation of agricultural products, leadership, natural resource 

management, etc.); (v) promoting women’s inclusion and leadership in the committees set up/consolidated 

under the project (50% women); (v) a campaign/sensitisation to fight and prevent malnutrition; and (v) the 

recruitment of a social development and gender specialist based on the South Branch. The budget allocated 
for specific and gender-sensitive activities is EUR 6.3 million, or about 14% of the total amount. 

3.2.7 Nutrition and Health  

3.2.7.1 The Rural Survey of Food Security and Nutrition (ERASAN 2014) shows that households in food-

insecure rural areas account for 30% of the total (153,728 households), of which 12% are in a severe 

situation and 18% in a moderate situation. The rate of food insecurity is higher for female-headed households 

at 40.4% compared to 29.4% for men-headed households. The regions of Ziguinchor (63%), Sédhiou (52%) 

and Kolda (52%) have the highest rates of households with food insecurity. The project will ensure that the 

modules and platforms take into account the establishment of medical services to support the safety of users. 

The agreements to be signed with the research institutes, particularly the ITA for the Centre of Excellence, 

will ensure that the nutritional quality of the processed products are acceptable to the local population and 

the market. At community level, to ensure resilience, awareness and communication sessions for behavioural 

change in nutrition, health and hygiene will be supported by the project. For vulnerable groups such as 

women, activities to support processing for the local or divisional (“département”) market will be funded, 

which will increase their income. For better social inclusion, the youth and women who will be selected for 

the labour-intensive works during the constructions on the agricultural hub sites will come largely from the 

poorest households. To this end, the project will use the single national registry targeting community-based 

activities. These activities will be supported by partners already on site such, for instance the Malnutrition 



 

16 

Control Unit. To ensure greater inclusion, the labour-intensive works will target the most vulnerable youth 

and women. Index insurance for producers is also a social protection measure for inclusion purposes. 

3.2.8 Youth Training and Employment 

3.2.8.1 The mapping of vocational training institutions in the project area indicates the existence of several 

Vocational and Technical Training and Handicraft (FPTA) structures, of which thirteen (13) in Ziguinchor, 

seven (7) in Kolda and three (3) in Sedhiou (one of the structures is being established). The project will work 

with these centres to ensure that agribusinesses moving into the region will have on-site skilled labour for 

the different trades. The project will help create around 1,400 direct and 35,000 indirect jobs for youth and 

women in the region, during the construction phase (which will use labour-intensive techniques) and in the 

operation phase by the 60 companies expected on the different sites. The project will also address the key 

challenges related to youth entrepreneurship, namely access to land and finance and the acquisition of 

technical skills for managing agro-industrial enterprises. At the agricultural hub, there are plans to build four 

training halls which will facilitate the upgrading of the salaried and self-employed workforce. Close 

collaboration will be established with at least three vocational training centres in the region, such as 

Goudomp, which is being developed, particularly for the processing of cashew nuts and fruits. The business 

incubator to be established at the Adéane central module will enable the incubation of youth-initiated 

projects. As regards access to finance for SMEs, the project will carry out capacity building of at least three 

financial institutions to develop services tailored to the needs of agro-industrial enterprises, particularly those 

of youth. Furthermore, the project will collaborate with the Mastercard Foundation, which supports the 

vocational training institutes in the project area as well as SMEs to strengthen youth employability. 

3.2.9 Fragility and Resilience  

3.2.9.1. The Casamance Natural Region, the project's impact area, experienced an armed conflict in the early 

1980s, whose victims lived mainly in Sedhiou and Ziguinchor regions. The induced fragility endured over 

nearly four decades slowed public and private investment in the region and has increased the social divide 

and the feeling of social and spatial exclusion. However, the State has made substantial efforts to develop 

infrastructure in the transport, energy and social sectors (drinking water, health, education, etc.), and this has 

contributed significantly towards strengthening social cohesion at inter-regional and national level. That 

notwithstanding, much effort remains to be made to mitigate the effects of regional disparity, gender 

inequality and youth underemployment. This peculiarity of the region has been reflected in the project design 

by taking into account existing resilience capacity in communities to address drivers of fragility. To reinforce 

this fragile cohesion, the project will support the agricultural potential of each region and organise the 

targeted sectors to provide economic opportunities for women, youth and vulnerable segments of the 

population. The sensitive land issue for this region of the country was also considered through the 

participatory approach undertaken for the project in terms of land tenure security. Areas with high production 

cashew and mango plantations located along the border strip south of Casamance pose a risk for producers 

due to the presence of mines in some places. This threat, already covered by the government’s partners 

specialising in this aspect, will be regularly monitored by the project at the National Demining Centre, to 

ensure that producers operating in the above-mentioned area are protected from this risk (see Annex).

IV. IMPLEMENTATION  

4.1. Implementation Arrangements  

4.1.1 Institutional Arrangements 

4.1.1.1 The Project Executing Agency (AGEX) will be the Ministry of Industry through a Project 

Implementation Unit (PIU). A Steering Committee (COPIL) chaired by AGEX will be set up to: (i) formulate 

the strategic thrusts of the agricultural hub programme; (ii) review and approve the AWPB; and (iii) analyse 

and adopt activity reports (including financial reports) and audit reports. It will include representatives of the 

ministries in charge of the following portfolios: Planning and Cooperation, Finance, Agriculture, Trade, 

Gender and Social Affairs, Environment, Regional Planning, Health and Nutrition; as well as representatives 

of the Private Sector, the Sovereign Fund for Strategic Investments (FONSIS), Federations of Farmers' 

Organisations, Local Authorities, Consular Chambers and BOS/PSE. The PIU Coordinator will provide 

secretarial support to COPIL. 

4.1.1.2 The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) will be responsible for project coordination, implementation 

and monitoring. The PIU will be based in Dakar and will ultimately be in charge of the 3 agricultural hub 

(PZTA) projects (it will have 3 regional agencies corresponding to the three (3) agricultural hubs (South, 

Centre and North). However, only the Agropole Sud agency will be set up under this project. Specifically, 

the composition of the PIU includes the following staff: (i) a national coordinator; (ii) an agribusiness 

engineer ; (iii) a monitoring/evaluation specialist; (iv) a procurement specialist; (v) an administrative and 

financial officer; (vi) an investment and finance specialist ; (vii) a regional coordinator; (viii) an infrastructure 

engineer (regional); (ix) an agronomist specialised in agricultural sectors (regional); (x) and environmental 

safeguards specialist; (xi) a social safeguards specialist; (xii) 3 accountants (including one regional); (xiii) 3 

assistants (procurement, administration, monitoring/evaluation); and (xiv) support staff. The baseline survey, 

midterm surveys and the final evaluation of project outcomes and impacts will be conducted by consultants 

to be recruited (in conjunction with MEPC, BOS and ANSD). 

4.1.2  Procurement Arrangements 

4.1.2.1 All Bank-financed procurement of works, goods and consultants services under this project shall be 

carried out in accordance with the Procurement Policy for Bank Group-Funded Operations ("AfDB 

Procurement Policy"), October 2015 edition, and the provisions of the financing agreement. Pursuant to this 

policy and following the various evaluations conducted, all procurement listed in paragraph B.6.3.1 will be 

carried out  in accordance with the country's procurement system ("National System") enshrined in Decree 

No. 2014-1212 of 22 September 2014 on the Public Procurement Code (CMP), while all other procurement 

listed in paragraph B.6.3.2 will be carried out in accordance with the Bank Procurement Methods and 

Procedures (BPM), October 2015 edition, using the Bank's bidding documents (BDs). The use of the National 

System improves efficiency through the following actions, among others: i) better ownership of the 

procurement system to be used by the executing agency; ii) time saving with the absence of a second audit 

(after that of the national entities), namely the Bank’s ex-ante review. However, the Bank reserves the right 

to request the Borrower to revert to the use of the Bank System if: a) the legal framework of Senegalese public 

procurement system changes and becomes unsatisfactory to the Bank; b) the provisions in force were not 

respected by the Executing Agency; or c) the appropriate risk mitigation measures featuring in the Risk 

Assessment Action Plan were not observed. 

4.1.2.3 Advance contracting (AC): during the appraisal mission, the Government informed the Bank of 

its intention to request authorisation to use advance contracting for the selection of: (i) a firm specialised in 

human resources to be charged with recruiting the project team staff; and (ii) a technical assistance firm to 

support PIU. A request accompanied with a procurement plan shall be submitted to the Bank for opinion 



 

18 

before the project is presented to the Bank’s Board of Directors. 

4.1.2.4 Procurement Risk and Capacity Assessment (PRCA): to take project specificities into account, the 

Bank assessed: (i) risks at the national, sector and project level; and (ii) the capacity of the executing agencies. 

The findings of these assessments led to the conclusion that the procurement risk level was moderate and 

determined, subject to the application of the mitigation measures proposed in paragraph 5.9 of Annex B.6, 

the group of procurement to be carried out according to the Bank’s system and that likely to be carried out, 

without major risk, according to the National System. The planned contracts for works amount to 

approximately UA 27.307 million, for the various goods UA 5.162 million, and for consultancy services UA 

8.355 million. Details of these procurement arrangements are available in Annex B.3 of the appraisal report.  

4.1.3  Financial Management Arrangements  

4.1.3.1  In accordance with the provisions of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, the Bank, like most 

other TFPs, has agreed to maximise the use of country systems for project and programme management as 

far as possible. An assessment of the existing country financial and accounting management system was 

made during the appraisal mission and the required mechanism specified for the project. Thus, the financial 

management of the project will be carried out by the Project Implementation Unit (PIU), to be put in place by 

the MDIMPI in its capacity as the Project Executing Agency. The PIU personnel, which will be recruited on 

a competitive basis, will include among others a coordinator, an administrative and financial manager, an 

accountant and an accounting assistant. The current accounting system is accrual accounting on software 

enabling the recording of project operations. The software has the potential to handle multiple projects with 

budgeting, analytics and general modules, up to the production of financial statements. The project’s internal 

control will be formalised in an administrative, financial and accounting procedures manual to be drawn up 

once the project is put into effect by a consultant. PZTA-Sud will produce quarterly project monitoring and 

annual financial statements and submit them to the Bank after approval by the Project Steering Committee. 

The project financial and accounting audit will be conducted by an independent firm registered on the role 

of a national or regional order of Bank member countries. The audit firm will be recruited by Project 

Coordination for three years based on terms of reference approved by the Bank, and paid out of AfDB funds.   

 

4.1.4 Disbursement Arrangements  

4.1.3.1 Disbursements will be made in accordance with Bank rules and procedures. A special account will 

be opened in the books of a commercial bank to keep a portion of the loan resources. Three disbursement 

methods will be used: (i) the special account method for training, operating and other minor project expenses; 

(ii) the direct payment method for settling contracts and agreements for goods, works and services; and (iii) 

the reimbursement method for expenses chargeable to AfDB but settled with the resources from counterpart 

funding, with the Bank’s prior approval. Bank advances in the Special Account will be made based on the 

Annual Work Programme and Budget (AWPB) previously approved by the Bank. The State’s counterpart 

funding will be provided for in the State budget. 

4.2 Project Monitoring/Evaluation  

4.2.1 Technical and financial monitoring: the PIU will be responsible for collecting, analysing and 

compiling information on physical achievements and financial execution. To this end, it will have a scorecard 

with technical and financial indicators on the progress of the project. Such monitoring will serve to obtain 

the following information for each activity and with a half-yearly periodicity: physical target, level of 

achievement, expected costs, actual costs, gaps and explanations of any gaps. This information will be used 

for preparing the half-yearly project progress reports. Furthermore, in addition to the review work of the 

Steering Committee, the Bank will field two supervision missions per year, to which should be added a mid-

term review mission. 



 

19 

 

4.2.2  Impact assessment: the project impact assessment will be conducted through participatory surveys 

under the supervision of BOS/PSE. The baseline survey will determine the level of the following indicators 

in project year zero: (i) current average household income; (ii) annual production of key crops; (iv) industrial 

processing rate; (v) access to inputs, agricultural services and farmer financing; (vi) marketing performance; 

and (vii) volume of financing mobilised by SMEs/SMIs. The same survey will be conducted at project 

completion. 

4.3  Governance  

4.3.1  Senegal has enjoyed long-standing political stability supported by solid democratic institutions and 

demonstrated by the three peaceful democratic regime changes. Senegal ranks 66th out of 180 countries on 

Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index 2018 and 8th in Africa in the indicators "Safety and Rule 

of Law", "Participation and Human Rights" and "Transparency and Accountability" of the Mo Ibrahim Index of 

African Governance (IIAG) 2017. This good performance reflects the efforts of the various regimes towards 

establishing or strengthening key institutions such as the Court of Auditors, the State General Inspectorate (IGIE), the 

National Financial Information Processing Unit (CENTIF), the National Bureau for the Fight against Fraud and 

Corruption (OFNAC) and the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (ARMP), and the introduction of a 

requirement that senior officials must declare assets (2014). The business environment has improved significantly as 

reflected by its 18-place jump in the Doing Business 2020 rankings. However, progress is needed in terms of 

registering property, paying taxes, trading across borders and ease of access to these facilities outside of the capital.  

4.3.2  In view of the project area’s sensitivity and the project’s complexity, the governance of the South Agricultural 

Hub is of special interest to the Bank and the Senegalese authorities, both in its design/ development and operation 

phases. While promoting private sector interest in the area, such sensitivity to the low-intensity conflict that has affected 

Casamance1 is important. Therefore, the project design adopted a highly participatory process in line with the strategic 

thrusts of PSE. Applying the Big Fast Results (BFR) methodology enabled the involvement of all project stakeholders, 

including private companies, financing institutions, research centres, civil society and the administration, to agree on 

partnership arrangements for successful its implementation. 

4.3.3  This process resulted in the selection of the following options (technical annex): 

 The management of the agricultural hub is entrusted to a dedicated company. After an in-depth analysis of different 

PPP approaches, it was decided that a mandate will be granted to FONSIS to create a Construction and Operation 

Company (SCE). The composition of the capital of SCE will unify the stakeholders’ commitment and will include 

a public sector minority (FONSIS, regional authorities, etc.), and a private sector majority (strategic and financial 

investors, including major agribusinesses and producer federations).  

 The establishment of an ecosystem enabling the agricultural hub to have access to all the administrative and 

facilitation services in the South zone. In this regard, the project will establish close collaboration with the 

Ziguinchor Regional Investment Platform (PRI) so that its services can meet the needs of the hub’s investors. The 

Adeane central module will also include a specific one-stop shop for the agricultural hub, offering high-end 

services, complementary to those of the South PRI.   

4.4  Sustainability  

4.4.1 The project was designed in a participatory and integrated manner to ensure sustainability, thanks 

to the active involvement of the relevant State services in project implementation (ISRA, ITA, ANCAR, 

DRDR, FNDASP, etc.). Besides, the sectors identified by an analysis of the market potential were confirmed 

during stakeholder consultations (surveys, missions, workshops, Labs, etc.) among which, the private sector, 

producer organisations (POs) and the technical services of the State. In addition, the project was designed to 

                                                 
1  Rather than exacerbating the underlying causes of conflict, this should contribute towards consolidating the factors that foster peace and the economic and 

social inclusion of all parties. 



 

20 

consolidate the State in its facilitation role, the private sector in investment and POs in sustainably increasing 

agricultural productivity. Lastly, the project’s design takes into account the requisite conditions to ensure its 

sustainability, through the following measures : (i) inclusion of measures to improve the agro-industrial 

sector’s business ecosystem at the project area level (one-stop shop, support services, quality control services, 

financial services, agricultural insurance, etc.); (ii) establishment of basic infrastructure (site development, 

administrative buildings, social services, common areas, etc.) in the central module (acting as an agro-

industrial park), the three (3) regional modules and the five (5) aggregation platforms and services; (iii) the 

involvement of the private sector (leader) once the project is formulated, thus ensuring easier access to 

markets (domestic, regional and international), technologies and financing (particularly for POs and SMEs); 

(iv) support for the structuring and professionalisation of agro-industrial sectors by strengthening the 

technical and business management capacity of beneficiary groups (including those run by women and 

youth); (v) facilitating access to efficient plant material for the sustainable increase in productivity and 

agricultural production of the main sectors (mango, cashew and maize). 

4.5  Risk Management  

4.5.1 Potential risks and mitigation measures have been identified and taken into consideration (see table 

and logical framework). They will be refined and finalised during the appraisal mission. 

Risks Risk Level Mitigation Measures/Actions  

Risk 1: Lack of interest by the 

private sector could limit 

investment  

  

High Mitigation 1: (i) the private sector will be regularly consulted; 

(ii) the PIU will put in place basic infrastructure (including one-

stop shop); (iii) SCE will facilitate the implementation of 

private sub-projects; (iv) access to credit facilities will be put 

in place; and (v) non-tariff barriers will be applied as needed.  

Risk 2: Climate change, discharges 

from industrial units and harmful 

practices of the population may 

degrade natural resources  

Moderate Mitigation 2: The use of resilient technologies, planned 

environmental and social safeguards, access to markets and 

agricultural insurance will mitigate climate change impacts and 

industrial risks. 

Risk 3: The expected benefits 

(including land) could be hijacked 

by a minority 

Moderate Mitigation 3: The measures included in the SESA (including 

the ESFMP), the ESFMP/RAP, and the project’s IEC 

programme should mitigate this risk. 

Risk 4: Delays in project 

implementation due to inadequate 

understanding of Bank procedures 

High Mitigation 4: Institutional support and regular training will be 

provided to the PIU, AGEX, and the Borrower (Ministries of 

Finance, Economy)  

 

4.6  Knowledge Building  

4.6.1 PZTA-Sud differs from the value chain projects usually financed by the Bank in the country, mainly 

in view of the following innovations: the targeting of value chains with market potential, the promotion of 

private investment in agribusiness (facilities, incentives, etc.), and support to actors in targeted sectors. These 

innovations will be subject to documented monitoring/evaluation and leveraged to determine the lessons 

learned by the State, the private sector and other priority sector actors. The State and the Bank will take into 

account the lessons learned during the exchange of experiences with regional member countries. The lessons 

learned will be consolidated in the project completion report.

Inclusive Policy Senegal has always enjoyed political stability since its independence in 1960, but in 1982 this 

was undermined by secessionist political demands in the country’s southern region, marked by 

a feeling of exclusion of the Casamance region from the national development programmes. 

The first two post-independence Presidents of Senegal did strive towards building one nation, 

making the use of the Wolof language the entry point of national identity. This political will for 

national unification was unfortunately met with resistance from the Casamance region given 

that the egalitarian set-up of the Diola ethnic group differs from that of the other ethnic groups 

in Senegal which are hierarchical in nature. These policies of unification of the people were 

perceived by the Casamance people as discriminating against their traditional customs which 

reject any conventional chieftaincy. Other sources of resentment of marginalisation and 

exclusion were the issuance of the 1964 Land Law relating to National Land, as supplemented 

by the 1972 reform of territorial administration excluding the recognition of customary land 

law. Additionally, the immigration of people from north to south in search of arable land was 

perceived by indigenous local communities as grabbing their land. In Diola culture, land is 

sacred and handed down from generation to generation. The Diola in particular have on multiple 

occasions been dispossessed and their lands allocated as migrant settlements, land for the 

construction of tourism infrastructure and agricultural land for orchard planting. The 

underinvestment and underdevelopment of Casamance also formed part of the problems that 

generated frustration among the Casamance people who for years often accused the central 

government of neglecting or even abandoning the country’s south. The lack of investment in 

Casamance has led to a slowdown in the South’s development and exacerbated the labour 

market problems of the local population. Faced with this challenge of an inclusive peace-

seeking policy, the governments of the third and fourth Presidents of Senegal have worked to 

restore national and regional stability and peace through inclusive dialogue with the people and 

the secessionists and there has been visible progress towards building more inclusive resilience 

for all sectors. 

Through the implementation of 

PZTA-Sud activities, the 

community resilience thus built will 

not have a direct impact on political 

inclusion but will usher in new 

prospects for political 

representativeness and participation 

in political activities.

Measures supported by the AfDB 

intervention under PZTA-Sud (2020-

2024) 

Security Due to the low prevalence of violent crime and armed conflict, Senegal has maintained a high 

capacity for law enforcement and defence institutions. With the acceptable military spending 

relative to GDP, the security institutions are well capacitated and helping to ensure the nation’s 

stability. While there is moderate pressure from violence and conflict, the public   remains 

highly confident in its defence institutions and has always relied on its security institutions to 

contain a moderately weak attack. However, the presence of anti-personnel mines remains a 

reality along the southern border strip of Casamance. 

PZTA-Sud does not directly 

contribute to the security factor, but 

it provides solutions to food security 

while mitigating the risks that could 

cause the security situation to 

deteriorate. 
 

Justice Senegal has a tradition of justice with renowned members of the judiciary even if between 2010 

and 2011 this renown was tainted by challenges pertaining to the independence of the judiciary, 

the transparency of the judicial process, more equitable access to justice and property rights. 

Since 2013, this situation has gradually improved and trust in the Senegalese justice system 

remains a reality. The independence of the judiciary, which was challenged in the recent past 

by certain magistrates who were using it to serve illegitimate interests, has returned to its good 

standards, namely to continue serving the citizens and the State including in the anti-corruption 

fight, even in its highest instances. The slowdown in of anti-corruption drive in some state 

structures could nevertheless pose a risk for investment and jeopardise the implementation of 

the Emerging Senegal Plan (PSE) given that legal and judicial security constitute two 

determining factors in wooing investors. 

The PZTA-Sud does not directly 

contribute to the justice system but 

it addresses the issue of social and 

spatial inclusion, a source of social 

injustice, taking into account the 

vulnerable groups, particularly 

women and youth in the project 

activities to be implemented. 
 

Economic and 

Social Inclusivity  

Senegal has often experienced periods of stable and moderate economic growth, driven both by 

political stability and the implementation of policies aimed at efficient management of the 

economy. Despite the country’s economic and social progress, the natural region of Casamance 

has always felt neglected by the central government compared to the rest of the national 

territory. One sticking point of the Casamance crisis was the issue of public services distribution 

and access thereto for local populations. This regional, economic and social disparity has 

generated income inequalities that have steadily widened over time. Furthermore, the increased 

and uncontrolled urbanisation of the regional capital has impacted rural populations and their 

ability to access public services, creating an economic and social gap between rural and urban 

areas marked by increased continuous poverty exerting great pressure on the Casamance and 

Various sectors selected under the 

PZTA-Sud such as access to roads/ 

tracks, rural electrification (health 

and training centres), technologies 

as well as the establishment of an e-

platform for access to services 

(inputs, finance, markets, etc.) are 

far-reaching inclusive social and 

economic actions.

Senegalese social fabric. The problem of unemployment of youth in Casamance and the rest of 

the country pushes them towards illegal immigration which could empty the regions of the 

workforce seeking decent jobs. 

 Social Cohesion   With an extremely high freedom of expression index, Senegal has a relatively high capacity to 

facilitate the creation of associations without government interference. However, the requisite 

infrastructure for the region’s development remains inadequate in Casamance. Despite the 

visible progress made in transport infrastructure linking the three regions of Casamance to one 

another, and between the Casamance and Dakar by sea and land, gender- and age-based 

inequality mean that women and youth are under-represented in the political, economic and 

social sphere in the Casamance region due to regional marginalisation given the centralisation 

of activities in Dakar and the other regions of the country. 

  

The geographical location of  

PZTA-Sud constitutes an initial 

response to the imbalance noted in 

the provision of services between 

urban and rural areas and 

Casamance compared to the rest of 

Senegal. Through the 

implementation of all project 

activities, a number of the planned 

components will contribute towards 

establishing the public utility 

easements required to initiate proper 

socio-economic integration of 

communities. 

External 

Outcomes/ 

Regional 

Multiplier Effects  

 

Casamance lies at the centre of the West African sub-regional area and constitutes a natural link 

between Senegal and Gambia and Guinea Bissau. Ziguinchor, this region’s main city is less 

than 150 km from two West African capitals, Banjul and Bissau. The geographical, agro-

ecological and socio-cultural continuity of Casamance also opens a corridor towards Kolda and 

Tambacounda towards Mali. Casamance is thus positioned to become an economic hub and a 

link between the Gambia, Senegal and Guinea Bissau. The implementation of development 

projects, particularly within the framework of the development hub launched by the State, will 

have to take into account the dynamics of sub-regional integration in West Africa as well as all 

the policies already adopted or in progress at the level of ECOWAS. Through a balanced 

development strategy between the national and the regional, Ziguinchor could become a 

regional city where Gambians, Bissau-Guineans and Senegalese will organise their commercial 

PZTA-Sud support does not have a 

direct impact on the external 

outcomes, but various interventions 

of the Bank and other TFPs are 

tending to contribute towards 

creating an environment conducive 

to the diversification of the local 

economy through agricultural sector 

development. To mitigate the effect 

of exogenous shocks, the 

establishment of AHs and the

and financial transactions capable of boosting the regional economy. Casamance's regional 

potential is facing cross-border challenges such as illicit trafficking of forest wood and drugs to 

neighbouring countries, cross-border crime, insecurity along borders and the challenge of 

management of water resources as a shared heritage. 

professionalisation of the 

agricultural sector offer new 

opportunities for the private sector, 

an engine of economic growth. 

Climatic / 

Environmental 

Impacts 

Senegal has a great capacity for environmental conservation and emergency preparedness 

thanks to government resources allocated to the prevention of natural disasters. Despite this 

capacity, the rainy seasons in Casamance most often leave the arable land flooded or without 

water thus worsening the vulnerability of the local populations as well as their social 

vulnerability to the volatility of food prices, agricultural inputs and producer prices. However, 

Senegal's vulnerability to food insecurity and natural disasters is mitigated by an efficient 

national environmental and social policy aimed at the sustainable use of available resources. 

By focusing on the development of 

regional and central platforms, 

PZTA-Sud plans to mitigate climate 

and environmental impacts as part 

of the implementation of all project 

activities. All these aspects are 

reflected in the project formulation.

Annex VII: General Presentation Plan of  the South Agricultural Hub (Agropole du Sud or PZTA-Sud) 
 

BACKGROUND 
 

The agro-industrial sectors are among the priority sectors 
of the Emerging Senegal Plan (PSE). Improving the 
performance of these sectors through the processing of 
agricultural products has been a strong decision of the 
State of Senegal. To this end, he has taken steps to : 

o Curb food dependency  
o Boost exports for sustained and sustainable 

growth 
o Control rural exodus for job creation  
o Stimulate the rural economy 

 

REGIONAL OCCUPANCY PLAN 
 

The SouthAgricultural Hub site is split in 3 regions according to 

the following regional occupancy plan: 

 1 central module (Adéane) 
 3 regional modules (Bignona, Sédhiou and Kolda) 
 5 divisional ("département") platforms  
 Collection points: number, locations and areas to be 

defined for: (i) Central Module; (ii) Each Regional 
Module; and (iii) divisional ("départment") aggregation 
and services platforms     

 
 

 

 Module Type  Region/ Division 
("Département") 

Municipality   Area   

GOALS 
 

To provide a viable and lasting solution to these issues, 

the decision was taken to create 3 AHs (or AIPZ). To 

each are assigned specific objectives relating to 

agricultural, pastoral or fisheries activities existing in the 

corresponding regions. 

- The North Agricultural Hub will cover the regions of 
Saint-Louis, Matam and Louga      

- The Centre Agricultural Hub will cover the regions of 
Kaolack, Fatick, Kaffrine, Diourbel      

- The South Agricultural Hub will cover the regions of 
Ziguinchor, Sedhiou, Kolda      

- The South zone was chosen as pilot for the 
establishment of the first agricultural hub in view off its 
under-tapped high potential      

  

Each agricultural hub is composed of :  

-  a Central module           
- Regional modules           
- Divisional (“Département”) platforms           
- Collection points          

Central Module   Ziguinchor Region Adeane 85 ha CENTRAL MODULE SITE 
 

The site of Agropole Sud is located in 

Adeane municipality, Bignona division 

("département"). It is in a heavily 

wooded area, but has no dwellings. Its 

landholding measures 85 ha made 

available to the project by the 

municipality and the people. It is 

relatively rectangular in shape. It is 

close to a high-voltage line, a paved 

road (less than 3 kilometres from the 

site) and agricultural production sites.

Project Executive Summary 

Overview: the Project to Develop and Promote Agricultural Sub-sectors (PDPFA) will be 

implemented in the Zaghouan Governorate, which covers a surface area of 282 000 hectares 

and has a population of 186 210 (INS, 2018). This region has an average poverty rate of 20% 

(15.2% nationwide), an illiteracy rate of 26.4% (18.8% nationwide) and a rural poverty rate of 

34.2%. The unemployment rate is 16.9% compared with 14.8% nationwide. Women are more 

vulnerable as they lack access to resources and formal employment. 

After the 2011 revolution, Tunisia adopted a Strategic Development Plan (PSD 2016-2020) to 

revive and enhance the attractiveness of its economy and incorporate it into global value chains 

in order to address the challenge of achieving sustainable and inclusive development. This 

vision is reflected in the country’s resolve to increase investments (25% of GDP by 2020) in 

specific niches with competitive advantages and where there is a growing international market 

that offers more opportunities for the generation of value-added. In this regard, agricultural 

subsectors have been identified according to agro-ecological zones and their potential to 

increase high value-added agricultural exports. The Project to Develop and Promote 

Agricultural Sub-sectors in Zaghouan Governorate (PDPFA-GZ) falls within this framework. 

It seeks to promote agricultural subsectors whose development requires significant public and 

private investments to enhance production and productivity, and increase opportunities in terms 

of product development (processing, packaging, certification, etc.). Besides improving their 

competitiveness, the subsectors selected will have an overall impact on economic recovery and 

the reduction of unemployment, poverty and inequalities. 

PDPFA-GZ was prepared under a UA 412 000 Middle-Income Countries Technical Assistance 

Fund (MIC-TAF) grant awarded by the Bank in 2014. The grant resources were used to design 

the related technical studies and evaluate the Integrated Agricultural Development Project 

(PDAI) in Tunisia. It complements the first phase of the Integrated Agricultural Development 

Programme in Zaghouan Governorate financed by the International Fund for Agricultural 

Development (IFAD) to the tune of USD 16.05 million. PDPFA-GZ, whose total estimated cost 

is EUR 43.86 million, of which EUR 25.21 million provided the African Development Bank 

(AfDB), aims to develop priority agricultural subsectors (olive oil, tomato, dairy and other local 

organic products) selected in conjunction with regional authorities based on their economic, 

social and environmental impact. The project comprising three components will be 

implemented over five years. The components are: (i) Rural Infrastructure Support; (ii) 

Sustainable Agricultural Development and Promotion of Agricultural Value Chains; and (iii) 

Project Coordination and Management. It will benefit more than 90 650 people (12 500 

directly), 50.2% of them women, in the project impact area (PIA). 

Needs Assessment: the financing needs of the agricultural sector in Tunisia for the 2016-2020 

period are estimated at about TND 9 000 million or UA 2 000 million (Strategic Development 

Plan 2016-2020). This investment will contribute to achieving the objectives of the Strategic 

Development Plan (SDP) in terms of reducing unemployment and social/regional inequalities. 

Agricultural investments during the first three years of the Plan amounted to TND 4 400 million 

(TND 1 870 million in public investments), representing a financing gap of more than TND 2 

500 million. AfDB resources of about TND 86.24 million will help to reduce the financing gap 

in Zaghouan Governorate. 

Value-added for the African Development Bank: the agricultural sector plays a vital role in 

the national economy and the Bank contributes to its development within the framework of the 

Country Strategy. The Bank’s active portfolio comprises seven operations (UA 69.804 million), 

representing 6% of the portfolio whose performance is deemed satisfactory with a score of 3.5 



 

vi 

 

on 4 (2017/2018 Country Portfolio Performance Review). The Bank has also acquired 

considerable experience in financing integrated agricultural development projects (IADPs) in 

similar areas such as Gafsa and Kairouan. The evaluation of IADPs conducted within the 

framework of the Middle-Income Countries Technical Assistance Fund (MIC-TAF) grant 

confirmed that the Bank has a strong comparative advantage by participating in financing the 

Project to Develop and Promote Agricultural Sub-sectors in Zaghouan Governorate (PDPFA-

GZ). It has developed skills and technical expertise in the design and formulation of agricultural 

projects, particularly the development of irrigation schemes and catchment ponds, the proper 

targeting of vulnerable areas and environmental and social protection. It has also acquired 

experience in Tunisia and other countries by promoting subsectors and value chains, youth and 

women’s entrepreneurship, and building national capacity for more effective official 

development aid  (ODA) in terms of alignment and ownership. 

Knowledge Management: a baseline situation based on field surveys (including value chains) 

was established during project preparation. The project will provide the agricultural map of 

Tunisia with geo-referenced data on the sites of the schemes and infrastructure developed. It 

will also support training and strengthen the knowledge of various local actors, particularly 

farmers in irrigation schemes and women involved in agri-food product marketing. The project 

will disseminate best practice, particularly in organic agricultural product certification and the 

development of local expertise. The same will apply to the socio-economic and environmental 

impacts of the organic production system (OPS) to be promoted by the project by ensuring that 

producers (upstream and downstream of subsectors) introduce and adopt good agricultural 

practices.

TUNISIA 

PROJECT TO DEVELOP AND PROMOTE AGRICULTURAL SUBSECTORS IN 

ZAGHOUAN GOVERNORATE  

APPRAISAL REPORT 

Management hereby submits the following appraisal report and recommendation concerning a proposal 

to grant a EUR 25.21 million AfDB loan to the Republic of Tunisia to finance the Project to Develop 

and Promote Agricultural Sub-sectors in Zaghouan Governorate (PDPFA-GZ). 

I. Strategic Thrust and Rationale 

1.1. Project Linkages with Country Strategy and Objectives 

1.1.1 The project is consistent with Tunisia’s Strategic Development Plan (PSD) 2016-2020, which 

hinges on five pillars: (i) public administrative reform and fight against corruption for improved 

governance; (ii) human development and social inclusion; (iii) higher value-added activities; (iv) reduction 

of regional disparities; and (v) development of a green economy. The PSD seeks to achieve a 5% growth 

rate to reduce the unemployment rate to 12.2% in 2020. In this regard, the strategy envisages an increase 

in the investment rate to 25% of GDP, driven by a significant growth in public investment and a build-up 

of public-private partnerships (PPPs). The overall objectives of the PSD in the agricultural sector are to 

promote competitive and sustainable farming by creating value added, ensuring the judicious and 

sustainable exploitation of natural resources, and securing decent income for farmers. 

1.1.2 The project will also contribute to the implementation of the Zaghouan Governorate Planning 

and Development Master Plan 2030. Besides making substantial investments in the development of 

irrigation and water-saving infrastructure, it will help to promote and enhance the competitiveness of 

priority agricultural subsectors (olive oil, tomato, milk and other local organic products). The project will 

promote the conservation and development of natural resources by ensuring their sustainability and 

minimising the effects of climate change; improving land tenure entities, combating the fragmentation of 

landholdings and developing farmlands; develop a regional green economy and promote gender-based 

human development and social inclusion by strengthening women’s empowerment. The project will help 

Tunisia to honour its low-carbon sustainable development commitments (nationally determined 

contribution target of reducing carbon intensity by 41% by 2030 compared with 2010) by launching a 

large-scale tree planting operation, water and soil conservation (WSC) works, and to achieve the 

sustainable development goals (SDOs), particularly poverty reduction, the elimination of inequalities, the 

promotion of gender equality, the empowerment of women, and the creation of decent jobs. 

1.2. Rationale for Bank Involvement 

1.2.1 The agricultural sector plays a major role in Tunisia’s economy. Over the last decade, the 

Tunisian olive oil sub-sector has been one of the country’s leading foreign exchange earners, generating 

TND 2 billion, i.e. 10% of all exports in 2017-2018 (ONH, 2018). Consequently, the country is the 

second olive oil producer after Spain and the world’s leading exporter of olive oil, with about 200 000 

tonnes of olive oil in 2017. Similarly, it ranks among the world’s ten largest tomato processing countries 

and is Africa’s leading exporter of organic products. Agriculture accounts for 10% of GDP, 16.9% of 

employment and about 10% of export earnings. Despite the progress made, the overall performance of 

the agricultural sector remains inadequate in view of its potential. Agricultural productivity remains low 

and the high inter-annual variability of production greatly impedes steady supply. Agricultural products 

are not sufficiently competitive and developed. Consequently, investment in the agricultural sector has 

dropped. The outcome has been a decline in farmers’ income, which does not exceed 50% of the national 

average income. As a result, the sector is increasingly less attractive to youths (43% of farmers are aged 

above 60).

1.2.2 The Bank’s intervention targets disadvantaged areas in Zaghouan Governorate, a region with a 

high agricultural potential and one eligible for various government investment incentives. In this region, 

the project will contribute to developing irrigation and water-saving infrastructure, promoting transition 

to organic agriculture and expanding agricultural entrepreneurship in order to boost the value chains of 

promising agricultural subsectors. Therefore, the Bank’s intervention will help to render the regional 

and national economy more attractive, thus contributing towards achieving inclusive growth, reducing 

unemployment, poverty and inequalities. It will also build the resilience of agro-ecological systems and 

improve the region’s agri-food positioning in local and global value chains.  

1.2.3 The subsectors targeted by the Bank’s intervention (see detailed analysis in Annex C3) were 

selected given their strategic importance in terms of food security, their potential to generate more value 

added and the constraints identified. In Tunisia, olive growing is the main agricultural activity and plays 

a key socio-economic role in terms of the area under cultivation (1.8 million hectares) and the number 

of farmers (309 000 farmers) employed in the different olive oil subsector chains (mechanisation, 

pruning, harvesting, transportation, crushing, storage, marketing, etc.). It is a source of direct or indirect 

income for more than one million people and generates 34 million days of work per annum, which is 

equivalent to more than 20% of employability in the agricultural sector. However, olive oil production 

fluctuates significantly from year to year due to the alternate bearing of olive trees and very irregular 

climatic conditions. In addition, 90% of olive oil exports consist of bulk oil, 70% of which is extra-

virgin olive oil. This provides the country with a significant head room in the packaging value chain to 

create more value added and ensure product traceability. In the tomato subsector, the dried product 

constitutes a growth niche in terms of employment and exports, and can generate foreign exchange 

earnings for the country. Exports could be better leveraged by shifting from the current stage of supplier 

of semi-finished bulk products to another stage as supplier of finished products delivered directly to the 

final consumer. In the dairy sub-sector, there is a deficit in the feed balance with limited quantity and 

quality of feed resources and a partial and inadequate use of agricultural and agro-industrial by-products 

upstream. There is a shortage of collection centres and chillers, as well as inadequate promotion of 

traditional dairy products downstream. Organic farming is now the engine of regional development in 

view of its linkages with agri-food industries, environmental tourism, handicrafts and renewable energy. 

However, the cumbersome process of converting and certifying organic products continues to impede 

its full development. 

1.2.4 The project plugs into the Bank’s Ten-year Strategy (2013-2022) by aligning with the High 5s. 

It is consistent with the Bank’s Strategy to Address Fragility and Build Resilience in Africa (2014-2019) 

since it strengthens the role of communities in building resilience and raising awareness among all 

stakeholders on inequality and fragility issues. It is in keeping with the main thrusts of the Bank’s 

Climate Change Action Plan and Gender Strategy for 2014-2018 (extended to 2019), by promoting 

women’s right to land and resources (in irrigation schemes) and economic empowerment through 

income-generating activities, management and entrepreneurship capacity building. At the national level, 

the project is consistent with Tunisia’s Country Strategy Paper (CSP) 2017-2021, particularly Pillar 2 

“Improve the quality of life for the people of the priority regions”. In this respect, the project will ensure 

the qualitative and quantitative transformation of regional agriculture by developing irrigation schemes 

(PIP); supporting targeted agricultural subsectors and certifying organic products to promote their 

export; supporting agricultural entrepreneurship (MSME), especially for women and youths; developing 

a regional green economy; and building local capacity and governance in land tenure and water resource 

management. By addressing the critical feeder road link under Pillar 1 “Industrialisation and local value 

chains development”, the project will ease the movement of people and goods in this region, which is a 

transitional space between the country’s coast and hinterland. 

1.3. Aid Coordination 

1.3.1 In Tunisia, official development aid reached USD 5.5 billion during the 2011-2017 period, 

representing an increase of 128% compared with the pre-revolution period (2004-2010) (WB, 2019;

oecd.org/dac/stats/idsonline). The Ministry of Development, Investment and International Cooperation 

(MDICI) is responsible for coordination. The African Development Bank is contributing to this process 

through the country dialogue spearheaded by its North Africa Regional Development and Business 

Delivery Office (RDGN). Therefore, the Bank harmonises its operations with the World Bank and the 

European Union within the framework of budget support based on the same matrix of measures and 

identical disbursement conditions. It has also concluded mutual trust and confidence agreements, 

particularly with the European Investment Bank, to use the procurement procedures of a single donor 

during co-financing. Lastly, it participates in the Agricultural Sector Working Group set up by Tunisia’s 

technical and financial partners. At State level, the Ministry of Agriculture, Water Resources and 

Fisheries (MARHP) is responsible for the technical coordination of agricultural projects. Similarly, the 

Ministry of Development, Investment and International Cooperation (MDICI) coordinates and monitors 

the activities of development partners. The table below presents the main amounts by source of financing

II. Project Description 

2.1 Project Components 

2.1.1 The overall objective of PDPFA-GZ is to contribute to reducing poverty, unemployment 

and inequalities (gender, socio-economic and rural/urban) in Zaghouan Governorate. The project’s 

specific objective is to create more value added by promoting priority1 agricultural sub-sectors such 

as “olive oil”, “tomato”, “dairy” and “other local organic products”, which are niches with a high 

potential in terms of employment, revenue generation and foreign exchange earnings for the 

country. In this regard, the project will carry out major irrigation, water resource mobilisation 

(boreholes, shallow wells and catchment ponds), and natural resource protection works (water, soil 

and forests) in order to improve production and productivity as part of efforts to accelerate transition 

to organic farming. An “agricultural value chains (AVCs)” approach will be used as guideline for 

the project to address the challenges of linking various chains in the targeted agricultural subsectors, 

                                                 
1 Priority subsectors were defined in a concerted manner based on environmental (soil conservation, water use and biodiversity), social (local job 

creation and improvement of the status of rural women) and economic criteria (level of value added, stability of income and adaptability to 

growth markets).

creating value added and building resilience of the people’s agro-ecological and socio-economic 

systems. The “aggregation2” model will be adopted to remove constraints on MSME financing, 

promote agricultural entrepreneurship especially for women and youths, and open access to markets 

at remunerative prices, while complying with new requirements regarding hygiene, food safety, the 

environment, and social equity. 

2.1.2 The project will be implemented over five years and will comprise three components: (A) 

Rural Infrastructure Support; (B) Sustainable Agricultural Development and Promotion of 

Agricultural Value Chains; and (C) Project Coordination and Management. The project activities 

are summarised in the table below.

2.2 Technical Solutions Adopted and Alternatives Explored 

2.2.1  The technical solutions adopted are based on lessons from the Bank and IFAD’s 

experience, particularly in financing integrated agricultural projects (IAPs) in Tunisia. The region’s 

technical services, local businesses and communities have acquired experience in the development 

of irrigation, water and soil conservation facilities that are easy to design. The subsectors to be 

supported were selected in consultation with the regional authorities and communities based on 

their potential to create more value added and ensure the sustainability of investments as well as 

agro-ecological considerations. Thus, the promotion of a watermelon sub-sector, which was 

initially envisaged, was abandoned because of its negative impact on water resources. Similarly, in 

the tomato subsector already established in the region, the project will ensure water saving on the 

parcels of land under cultivation in order to economise water, while intensifying production in a 

bid to improve the downstream production sub-sector, particularly tomato drying, packaging and 

export. Resilience measures are based on vulnerability analysis and strategies to reduce factors of 

fragility. Lastly, the “aggregator” approach has yielded positive results in other public-private 

partnership (PPP) operations, opening up access to financing and guaranteeing higher producer 

prices. 

Table 2.2: Alternatives Explored and Reasons for their Rejection 

Alternative Brief Description Reasons for Rejection 

Extension of the 

areas devoted to 

tomato cultivation 

and promotion of a 

watermelon 

subsector 

The option considered was 

to increase the areas 

devoted to tomato 

cultivation and to promote 

a watermelon subsector. 

The project will not promote a watermelon subsector in the 

region because of the high water consumption of these two 

plants. Concerning the tomato subsector already established and 

for which the regional authorities are requesting support, project 

activities will focus on measures to save water and improve the 

downstream sub-sector, particularly the drying, packaging and 

export of tomatoes. 

2.3 Project Type 

2.3.1. PDPFA-GZ is an investment project in a key sector of the Tunisian economy. Its approach 
guarantees the achievement of outcomes and the efficient use of the resources allocated. 

2.4 Project Cost and Financing Arrangements 

2.4.1 Project cost: the total project cost, taxes included, is estimated at TND 153.38 million 
(EUR 44.84 million). The cost was estimated based on the prices prevailing in April 2019. This 

cost includes the cost of land that will be occupied by the project for the construction of facilities 

planned. Provisions equivalent to 5% and 7% of the base cost have been made respectively for 

physical contingencies and price escalation, based on local and global inflation trends. Tables 2.3, 

2.4 and 2.5 below present a summary of the estimated project cost by component, expenditure 

category and year, while details are presented in Technical Annex B2 of the project appraisal report. 

 

Furthermore, the cost sharing (borne 56.2% by AfDB, 5.3% by the beneficiaries and 38.5% by the 

State) is in line with the financing parametres for Tunisia as approved by the Board in 2017, 

according to which the Bank could finance 60% of the cost of social projects (education, health, 

employment, gender, etc.), with limited and/or gradual economic benefits. The social nature of 

PDPFA is reflected in: (1) the importance of activities dedicated to women, especially the 

development of women’s entrepreneurship; and (2) the emphasis on the development of 

employment and self-employment in the project area by targeting youths and smallholders. 

Moreover, the gradual profitability of the project resides in the the very nature of tree cultivation 

(mostly olive trees), which requires nearly ten years to reach maturity.

2.5 Project Target Area and Beneficiaries 

2.5.1 The project impact area (PIA) covers Zaghouan Governorate, particularly the vulnerable 

areas of the 6 delegations (Zaghouan, Zriba, Saouef, Nadhour, El Fahs and Bir Mchargua), which 

make up 44 out of the 47 administrative sectors of the Governorate. Despite its enormous 

agricultural potential (272 000 hectares of arable land), the region’s agro-ecological systems are 

highly vulnerable to climate change: water resources are decreasing and soil erosion is severe, 

affecting nearly 52 000 hectares of arable land and taking various forms ranging from topsoil 

stripping to gullying of varying intensity. In addition, extreme weather events such as floods and 

droughts are increasing, resulting in an average poverty rate of 20% and an unemployment rate of 

16.9% compared with the national rate of 14.8%. Women are more affected by illiteracy (37% of 

rural women) and generally by precariousness since only 19% of them own resources. The 

Governorate is among the regions eligible for various investment incentives intended to reduce the 

factors of environmental and social fragility as well as intra-regional inequalities. Despite the 

fragility of its specific mountain ecosystems, this Governorate has a multitude of major agro-

environmental functions and a considerable ecotourism, cultural and local product production 

potential. 

2.5.2 PDPFA-GZ will benefit more than 90 650 people (12 500 directly), 50.2% of them women. 

The people will be supported to improve production and productivity through successful land 

consolidation and conversion to organic farming. Special attention will be paid to women 

(particularly women heads of households) and youths who constitute the bulk of vulnerable groups. 

They will benefit from about 40% to 45% of newly developed PIPs and 75% of actions related to 

product processing and marketing, particularly organic products. Direct beneficiaries will be 

selected in close collaboration with the CRDA, SMSAs, GDAs and UTAP through a participatory, 

inclusive and collaborative approach. Financing in the form of subsidies to agricultural cooperatives 

(SMSAs) will be based on eligibility criteria set out in the project procedures manual and validated 

by the National Coordination Committee (CNC). 

2.6 Participatory Approach for Project Identification, Design and Implementation 

2.6.1  The Bank adopted a participatory, inclusive and collaborative approach throughout the 

project preparation process, which helped to involve all stakeholders in the identification of major 

issues and appropriate solutions. The stakeholders are representatives of the population, the 



 

9 

 

decentralised technical services of the CRDA, other public institutions, producer organisations and 

civil society, including gender-focused organisations, the private sector and TFPs. This approach 

also made helped to achieve a broad consensus on the “agricultural value chains (AVCs)” approach 

to address the challenge of incorporating the different links of the subsectors selected. Furthermore, 

the “aggregation” model has been adopted to remove constraints on local financing, promote 

agricultural entrepreneurship and open access to remunerative markets amid increasingly strict 

quality, environmental, social, hygiene and food safety requirements. Against this backdrop, 

farmers underscored the need for them to switch to organic farming and for land consolidation with 

the issuance of titles for their plots. One of the challenges to be addressed is the improvement of 

access to land and financing by rural women and youths. This will promote their settlement as 

agripreneurs targeting growth markets. During project implementation, this participatory approach 

will be maintained to enable stakeholders to own project activities and ensure the sustainability of 

investments. For the various development and WSC works, the participatory development plans 

(PDPs) that are being prepared will underpin all project interventions in each territorial unit. 

2.7 Bank Group Experience and Lessons Reflected in Project Design 

2.7.1 In April 2019, the Bank’s portfolio in Tunisia comprised 43 operations, of which 19 loans 

and 24 grants totalling UA 1 057 million (EUR 1 148 million). The agricultural sector has seven 

(7) operations (UA 69.804 million or EUR 82.251 million), representing 6.8% of the portfolio, 

implemented in similar regions such as Gafsa and Gabès. The performance of the national public 

portfolio is deemed satisfactory with a score of 3.4 (3.5 for agriculture) on 4 (CPPR 2017/2018). 

However, specific weaknesses were noted in procurement, late submission of audit reports and 

difficulties in evaluating the impact of projects. In addition, the Bank has had a rich experience in 

financing integrated agricultural development projects (IADPs). The evaluation of this experience 

conducted in 2018 (January 2019 Summary Report) within the framework of the MIC-TAF grant 

highlighted the following points: (i) the need to better organise agricultural sub-sectors, particularly 

the downstream subsector; (ii) the need to build the institutional capacity of CRDAs and clarify 

partnerships; (iii) the need to define an exit strategy; and (iv) the need to strengthen ADPs and 

establish a baseline situation. In addition, there is lack of innovative mechanisms for financing 

agricultural entrepreneurship, particularly for rural women. 

2.7.2 PDAPF-GZ design took into account lessons from the Bank’s experiences and those of its 

key partners such as IFAD, IBRD, SFD and FAO. A Project Management Unit (PMU) set up within 

the Zaghouan CRDA will oversee the implementation of project activities. PMU staff will be 

selected from the CRDA and will be trained “in situ” by Bank experts on allotments to reduce the 

number of contracts and cut transaction and financial management costs, in order to accelerate the 

preparation of financial statements. The CRDA and the PMU will be provided with equipment, 

logistics and other teaching aids for technical training, agricultural advisory schemes and extension 

services. Similarly, clear agreements will be concluded with its key partners (AVFA, OEP, CTAB, 

INRAT, Mograne School, the Chott Mariem Horticulture and Organic Agriculture Research Centre 

- CRHAB). The project will promote agricultural subsectors that constitute important niches. It will 

finance training, stakeholder organisation, and product processing, packaging and marketing 

activities, thus helping to incorporate various subsector links, generate value added and create the 

desired jobs. The MIC grant mobilised by the Bank was tapped to conduct engineering studies (APS 

and APD), particularly those on irrigation schemes, collection ponds and rural roads, establish the 

project’s baseline situation and guarantee project quality at entry assessment. Support for the 

development of SMEs and income-generating activities as well as pursuit of the “aggregator” 

approach will help to fund training and incubation programmes in support of financial resource 

mobilisation for the development of agricultural entrepreneurship.

2.8 Key Performance Indicators 

2.8.1 The key performance indicators monitored based on the baseline situation are presented in 

the results-based logical framework. In terms of facilities, monitoring will concern the number and 

areas of PIPs developed or rehabilitated (and property owned by men and women, to track the 

gender gap), boreholes and collection ponds developed, acreage planted with fruit trees, fodder 

species, water and soil conservation works. The main production and marketing indicators relate to 

additional production (tonnes), yields (t/ha), the number of farmers by type of gender-disaggregated 

development works, increase in income, including those of men and women in order to monitor 

gender gaps, the number and quality of jobs for youths and women created through entrepreneurial 

initiatives, the number of producers, processors and traders trained and organised, as well as the 

number of producers who have adopted best agricultural and production practice that comply with 

environmental, hygienic and food safety rules and standards. The project will also monitor the level 

of women’s participation in decision-making bodies and access to land after development, the 

amount of rural financing mobilised and the rate of increase in gender-disaggregated gross margins. 

III. Project Feasibility 

3.1 Economic and Financial Performance 

3.1.1 Project financial and economic outcomes were determined based on an analysis of 

expected project costs and benefits over a 20-year investment lifespan using the reference pricing 

method, comparing the project and no project situations from the financial standpoint (impact on 

farmers and the various project direct beneficiaries) and from the community standpoint by 

considering socio-economic benefits generated by the project. The expected project benefits will 

stem from improved productivity of existing farm areas and additional production of crops, 

livestock, fodder and income-generating activities. At full development, the project will enable the 

production of 18 000 tonnes of olives, 4 000 tonnes of peaches, 6 000 tonnes of citrus fruits, 26 600 

tonnes of tomatoes, 1 000 tonnes of market garden products, 1 800 000 litres of milk, 21 000 bales 

of fodder, and the establishment of 200 micro and small projects. Profitability analysis was 

conducted based on investment costs plus physical contingencies, and covered irrigation facilities, 

boreholes, plantations, water and soil conservation (WSC) measures, value chains promotion, a 5-

year project implementation period and a 20-year service life. It took into account periodic 

replacement and regular maintenance of equipment. Calculation assumptions took into account 

recent agricultural product prices, yields and production costs. Financial profitability analysis was 

carried out for all types of farms and for each agricultural subsector and income-generating activity. 

Economic profitability was calculated using the elements of financial profitability after deducting 

financial transfers and assessing costs and benefits in relation to their economic value. Based on 

these assumptions, the financial and economic rates of return presented in detail as annex are 

summarised in Table 3.1 below. 

Table 3.1: Key Economic and Financial Data 

NPV (baseline scenario) TND 30.6 million 

IRR (baseline scenario) 15.6 % 

Economic NPV (baseline scenario) TND 47.9 million 

ERR (baseline scenario) 18.8 % 

3.1.2  Financial performance:  the financial rate of return is higher than project financing costs, 

which justifies the implementation of operations in various subsectors selected with variable 

margins according to the type of farm. Additional project income broken down by type of farm and 

activity will mainly come from improved yield of existing olive plantations, new plantations and 

other crops, livestock production and income-generating activities. Additional income in a peak 



 

11 

 

year are estimated by subsector and in TND million as follows: olive (22.9); peach (1.037); citrus 

fruit (1.170); tomato (1.29); dairy (0.486); market gardening (2.36); fodder (0.85); and income-

generating activities (1.00).  

3.1.3 Economic performance: based on a 12% opportunity cost of capital, the economic rate of 

return and the net present value stand at 18.8% and TND 47.9 million, respectively. These values 

would be higher if it were possible to quantify benefits such as improved standard and quality of 

life of the beneficiary population, impact on women and their integration into the development 

process, job creation, reduction of rural exodus, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions through 

new plantations, development of organic farming and building of the capacity of the units and 

bodies involved at various stages of project implementation and operation.    

3.1.4 Sensitivity analysis: an analysis of project sensitivity to potential risks of variation in 

yields, production costs and farm prices was carried out. Simulations based on a 10% increase in 

investment costs reduced the ERR to 17.2% and the NPV to TND 39.5 million. A 10% decrease in 

income reduced the ERR to 16.3% and the NPV to TND 29.4 million. A combination of the two 

events reduced the ERR to 14.2% and the NPV to TND 16.3 million. The outcomes of the financial 

and economic analysis show that the PDPFA-GZ is financially justified, and is viable socio-

economically and environmentally. 

3.2 Environmental and Social Impact 

3.2.1. Environment:  based on the Bank's Integrated Safeguards System (ISS), the PDPFA-GZ 
is classified under Environmental Category 2 because the negative environmental and social 

impacts were deemed moderate to low. Therefore, in accordance with national and Bank 

procedures, the Regional Office for Agricultural Development (CRDA) prepared and submitted an 

Environmental and Social Impact Notice (ESIN). The Environmental and Social Management Plan 

(ESMP) prepared in 2014 was also updated and submitted. The summary of the ESMP has been 

posted on the Bank's website.  

3.2.2. The main project positive environmental and social impacts identified include: (i) land 
consolidation in several irrigation schemes, which will allow for better agricultural development; 

(ii) promotion of income-generating activities (IGAs), which will diversify income sources and 

support small farms, especially those run by women and youths. This will also raise the income of 

rural dwellers, increase job supply and reduce rural exodus; (iii) facilitation of access to micro-

project financing through the assistance that the project will provide to beneficiaries (studying their 

projects, monitoring project implementation and training in the activities to be promoted); (iv) 

development of organic farming, which reduces the use of fertilisers compared with conventional 

farming techniques. Chemical pollution that affects the quality of groundwater will be mitigated 

through the implementation of organic farming projects; (v) study on sylvicultural and pastoral 

development, which will aim to improve the profitability of the livestock sub-sector, while ensuring 

better management of resources and preventing their degradation: (vi) enhancement of the role of 

the Zaghouan National Park in the dissemination and entrenchment of the environmental culture 

among the population and improvement of the living environment; and (vii) improvement of the 

service quality of the soil laboratory, which will contribute to preventing soil degradation to allow 

for optimal use of the soil.  

3.2.3. The negative impacts on biophysical environments are of various forms, including: (i) 
natural and anthropogenic degradation of irrigation schemes and their infrastructure; (ii) upsurge in 

the loss of water distributed in the canals; (iii) reduced fertility of farmland and agricultural 

production; (iv) sharp drop in groundwater level leading to reduced availability of irrigation water; 

(v) land degradation and erosion with silting, gullying and glacis formation, and appearance of crust 



 

12 

 

soils; (vi) gully slopes, shoreline erosion and silting of temporary streams and wadis; and (vii) 

relative pressure of livestock on crops, in the absence of open spaces and pasture areas. 

3.2.4. The ESMP submitted includes: (i) a waste management plan; (ii) a risk management 
programme; (iii) an environmental surveillance and monitoring programme; and (iv) an institution-

building plan. 

3.2.5. The main mitigation measures recommended for implementation by works contractors 
under the responsibility of CRDA are: (i) protection of soil and groundwater resources; (ii) 

preservation of soil stability, prevention of uncontrolled rainwater run-offs and protection of 

drainage networks; (iii) protection and restoration of existing infrastructure; (iv) protection of 

dwellings and other personal property; (v) protection of the archaeological heritage; (vi) solid waste 

management; (vii) prevention and reduction of atmospheric emissions of gaseous pollutants and 

dusts; (viii) prevention and reduction of sound levels and vibrations; and (ix) reduction of 

vegetation destruction areas and restoration of the landscape after works. The estimated overall cost 

of the ESMP (excluding the resettlement action plan) is USD 355 000. It will be fully funded by 

the project. 

3.2.6. The project will also protect and sustain water resources by: (i) mobilizing surface water 
through catchment ponds and the cleaning of river beds; (ii) ensuring the integrated recharge and 

management of groundwater; (iii) improving the water cycle through soil stabilization; and (iv) 

providing support for water saving through the development of drip irrigation and the improvement 

of on-farm management. In addition, it should be noted that the Bank, through the ongoing Water 

2050 Project, is involved in the improvement of water governance in Tunisia. This project will help 

to prepare a national strategy by 2020, the thrusts of which will be taken into account during the 

implementation of PDPFA-GZ activities.  

3.2.7. The environmental and social surveillance and monitoring programme will focus 
respectively on: (i) the monitoring of construction site activities during the construction phase by 

the Consulting Engineer; (ii) environmental monitoring, which will notably concern ambient air 

quality, groundwater and receiving environment water quality, as well as noise and vibration. 

Monitoring will cover the construction and operation phases.  

3.2.8. The recommendations and measures ensuing from the environmental and social 
assessment should be set out and inserted: (i) for contractors, in the bidding documents (BDs) 

through environmental clauses, obligations, responsibilities and penalties, in the Climate Change 

Action Plan (CCAP) as well as in the price schedule (PS) and the bill of quantities (BoQ); (ii) for 

the Consulting Engineer, who shall ensure the presence of two environmental and social/gender 

development experts. 

3.2.9. Climate change: the project is classified under Environmental Category 2 following the 
assessment of the Climate Safeguards System (CSS), in accordance with the Adaptation Review 

and Evaluation Procedures (AREP). In Zaghouan region, climate parameters are highly variable in 

time and space. Rainfall is moderate and very irregular (245 to 625 mm/year). Owing to torrential 

rains, exacerbated by extensive overgrazing, deforestation and poor conduct of agricultural works, 

water erosion is one of the major factors of soil degradation that has reached worrying levels. 

Climate change results in increased average annual temperature and a decrease in average rainfall, 

which affect water resources, ecosystems, agriculture, infrastructure and the occurrence of extreme 

weather events such as floods, snow and hailstorm. Thanks to its activities, PDPFA-GZ is a project 

for climate change adaptation and risk mitigation. It will enhance the climate change resilience of 

vulnerable groups, especially women and youths, as well as production systems. The project will 

significantly reduce water erosion, improve land production capacity and preserve biodiversity. It 

will confine farmers to the irrigation schemes developed, thus reducing their relocation from 



 

13 

 

farming areas in the south to the north of the Governorate. The PMU and CRDA will work to 

incorporate climate information into participatory development plans (PDPs) and encourage 

farmers to take into account climate information in the agricultural calendar. 

3.2.10. Gender issues: the project is classified under Category II of the Gender Marker (existence 
of gender effects and need for an action plan and budget to ensure gender action). In Zaghouan 

Governorate, women are massively involved in agricultural activities. They represent 46% to 51% 

of the family farm labour force, 25% of the permanent paid labour force and 51% of the casual paid 

labour force. They play a particularly important role in livestock production-related activities, 

especially milk production which employs 43% of working women. However, there are gender 

inequalities regarding decent and sustainable jobs, access to land and credit, and differences in 

wages. Women are also poorly represented in professional organisations and rarely access decision-

making bodies. The project will implement special measures for women (and other vulnerable 

groups) to ensure that they benefit from the positive impacts of the project in terms of developing 

their economic activities, creating jobs, reducing the workload and economic empowerment. Thus, 

the project will promote rural activities for which women have proven expertise (olive oil, market 

gardening, aromatic and medicinal plants, organic and local products, etc.) and from which they 

can earn decent income.  

3.2.11. Specifically, the project will ensure that women have access to 40% - 45% of plots with 
land titles in the new public irrigation schemes (PIPs), against 10% -15% currently. The training 

and coaching programme for agricultural entrepreneurship, viable business incubation and support 

for settlement in the new PIPs will concern at least 200 women entrepreneurs who will benefit from 

funding worth about TND 1.5 million set up. It will target women-owned micro-, small- and 

medium-size enterprises (MSMEs) with high growth potential organised within mutual agricultural 

service companies (SMSAs) and agricultural development groups (GDAs). In addition, there will 

be intermediation with local financing entities to enable the greatest number of women (at least 

60%) and vulnerable people to benefit from credit facilities to develop a business. Furthermore, the 

project will support the marketing and commercialisation of women’s products through the 

development of product sales points. In addition to this specific support, the project will closely 

monitor the inclusive and equitable participation of women and youths in implementing all 

activities, sharing the benefits and enhancing their economic empowerment and decision-making 

power. This will give women better social visibility and strengthen their socio-economic status. 

3.2.12. Social issues: one of the objectives of PDPFA-GZ is to reduce inequalities within 
Zaghouan Governorate and raise the region to align with the level of national economic and social 

development indicators. As a result, it will promote social cohesion in the Governorate. The 

strengthening of associations (GDAs) and cooperatives (SMSAs) promotes consultation and the 

development of a solidarity-based economy. There will be a remarkable impact on food and 

nutrition security. The expected outcomes in terms of employment are significant. The project will 

strengthen the employability of women and young people through vocational training. The 

combination of irrigation facility development works, technical training, access to means of 

production for the poorest, financing of IGAs and entrepreneurship, WSC works, promotion of 

local organic subsectors and products will generate additional income for the population (estimated 

to be at least 50% of current income). This will encourage the consumption of social services such 

as education and health, and thus enhance the value of social capital. 

3.2.13. Youth employment and promotion of agricultural entrepreneurship: access to credit 
is one of the major constraints facing rural MSMEs in the region. Investment in agriculture is a 

risky activity that requires risk sharing by all stakeholders in the value chain. The project will 

promote agricultural entrepreneurship among young people (men and women) and initiators of 

innovative projects by providing more flexible financing adapted to the constraints of each operator 



 

14 

 

involved in the value chain through the establishment of a strategic partnership with financial 

institutions. In this connection, 300 young people (girls and boys) will be trained in agricultural 

entrepreneurship and set up in all the lin ks of the value chain, namely: production in the developed 

PIPs, processing, trade and services. This initiative ultimately seeks to reach nearly 1500 people 

through its multiplier effect. In terms of support and to optimise project sustainability and the 

conquest of new markets, the project will build the capacity of promoters and enhance aspects 

related to the improvement of development and sales techniques, marketing conditions, required 

quality standards, facilitation of the “organic” certification process, visibility and access to 

profitable markets. Incubation centres (Mograne School Nursery, the Zaghouan Business Centre, 

etc.) will also be solicited for training in entrepreneurship and development of business plans to 

foster easy access to available financial resources. Lastly, the project will support the constitution 

of potential aggregators (SMSAs, private companies, etc.).  

3.2.14. Involuntary resettlement: considering that the engineering studies carried out with Bank 

financial support did not take into account the aspects related to the freeing of the rights-of-way for 

the execution of works planned and the possible risks of expropriation, the Bank requires the review 

of the said studies to take these aspects and risk mitigation into account (selecting the appropriate 

variant and clearly defining the indemnification/compensation measures envisaged in such a case). 

Meanwhile, the CRDA has with Bank assistance submitted a Comprehensive Resettlement Action 

Plan (CRAP) outlining the general principles that will guide all expropriation operations under 

PDPFA-GZ. It defines the procedures to be followed for prior recognition of expropriation and 

indemnification/compensation rights. It specifies the indemnification/compensation mechanism 

and the redress mechanism, and identifies the institutional arrangement and capacity building for 

the implementation of expropriation and complaint processing procedures. CRAP is a contractual 

document by which the Tunisian Government, in collaboration with the local authorities and in 

accordance with SO2 requirements and procedures, formally undertakes to respect the 

indemnification/compensation rights of any potential project affected person or entity. The cost of 

implementing CRAP (RAP implementation, indemnification/compensation, operation, capacity 

building, implementation monitoring, etc.) will be fully funded by the Borrower. 

3.2.15. CRAP will be set out as a resettlement action plan (RAP) latest prior to project launching, 
for implementation by the CRDA. The submission of the final RAP will be the subject of a specific 

disbursement condition precedent to financing the specified works. 

IV. Project Implementation 

4.1. Implementation Arrangements 

4.1.1. Implementation arrangements: the Zaghouan Regional Office for Agricultural 
Development (CRDA) will manage and coordinate the project. It will set up a Project Management 

Unit (PMU) comprising a Project Coordinator, an Administrative and Financial Officer assisted by 

an Accountant, a Procurement Specialist, a Monitoring and Evaluation Officer and a team of 

consultant facilitators. The PMU will be responsible for coordination and planning, monitoring and 

evaluation, preparation of annual programmes and budgets, financial management, procurement 

and preparation of project progress and audit reports. It will rely on the various technical 

directorates and sub-departments of the CRDA for technical supervision, extension services, works 

control/monitoring, and regular evaluation of ESMP implementation. It will also rely on dedicated 

facilitators to be deployed routinely at the local level closest to beneficiaries (GDAs, farmers, 

women and youths). In addition to equipment and logistics, the PMU will benefit from technical 

support, training and capacity building in environmental and social management and monitoring as 

provided for in the ESMP. 



 

15 

 

4.1.2. Based on agreements to be concluded for some activities, the PMU will use specialised 
institutions and NGOs, notably the Chott-Mariem Organic Agriculture Centre (CTAB) for organic 

agricultural support, the Chott-Mariem Horticulture and Organic Agriculture Research Centre 

(CRRHAB) for the development of rosehip cultivation, the Office of Livestock and Pasture (OEP) 

for the development of the dairy sub-sector, genetic improvement, creation of an insemination 

circuit, training and supervision of stock breeders, the National Institute of Agronomic Research, 

Tunis (INRAT) for the development of fodder crops and improvement of nutritive value, and the 

Mograne School and AVFA for the supervision of farmers, CRDA technicians and business 

incubation.  

4.1.3. The project will be coordinated at the national level by the National Projects Coordination 
Committee (CNC) chaired by the Minister of Agriculture, Water and Fishery Resources or his/her 

representative and comprising representatives of the general directorates of the Ministry of 

Agriculture, representatives of the Ministry of Development, Investment and International 

Cooperation, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Equipment and Housing, and the Ministry 

of Local Affairs and Environment, among others. Project activities will be coordinated at the 

regional level by the Regional Development Board (CRD) chaired by the Governor and comprising 

elected representatives of the region as well as regional government representatives.  

4.1.4. Procurement arrangements: all procurement of Bank-financed works, goods and 
consultancy services will be in accordance with the Procurement Framework for Bank Group-

Funded Operations (“AfDB Procurement Policy”), October 2015 edition, and with the provisions 

set forth in the Financing Agreement. Pursuant to this policy and considering the various 

assessments conducted, the following groups of transactions have been identified for 

implementation using the various systems below: 

(a) Bank Procurement Methods and Procedures (BPMPs): all selections of consultants will be 
in accordance with the Bank’s procurement system (AfDB System) using Bank bidding 

documents (BDs). The use of the Bank system for such procurement is attributable to the 

weaknesses identified in the national system, including the inappropriate mechanism for 

opening consultants’ bids, the absence of a minimum technical qualification score in some 

methods, etc. 

(b) Tunisia’s Procurement System (TPS):  the procurement of works and goods will be done in 
accordance with Tunisia’s procurement system (National System) embodied by Decree No. 

2014-1039 of 13 March 2014 regulating public procurement ("DMP"), via bidding 

documents (BDs) commonly used in Tunisia.  

4.1.5. Details on this procurement and related control mechanisms are presented in Annex B.5 

4.1.6. Procurement risk and capacity assessment: the country, sector and project procurement 
risks were assessed and the outcomes used to guide the selection of the procurement system 

(Borrower or Bank) to be used for specific activities or group of similar activities under the project. 

The assessment of the Executing Agency’s procurement capacity was carried out. Appropriate risk 

mitigation measures have been included in the action plan presented in paragraph B5.9 of Annex 

B5. 

4.1.7. Advance contracting:  considering the Borrower's tight schedule, and to address the issue 
of accelerating project implementation pursuant to PD 02/2015, studies prior to the procurement of 

works planned for the first year of the project may, at Government’s request, be implemented 

through advance contracting, in accordance with the provisions of Article 11.2 of the AfDB 

Procurement Policy. The procedures and methods to be used for these advance actions will be the 

same as those chosen for the project. In this regard, a request stating the reasons (indicating the 



 

16 

 

procurement concerned), together with a procurement plan, will be submitted to the Bank. In turn, 

the Bank will analyse the reasons mentioned and take a decision. 

4.1.8. Specific conditions arising from the use of the National Procurement System - Additional 
Waiver on Eligibility: 

(i) Eligibility-related waiver: the Bank’s resources for financing the project will come from the 
AfDB window. As a result, the eligibility rules specific to the window are a priori 

applicable. Following the assessment of procurement risks and capacity, it was decided that 

the National Procurement System will be used for part of this project. Given that the 

eligibility rules for public procurement under Tunisian law are not the same as those of the 

AfDB window, it is necessary to avoid any practical incompatibility. To this end, and for 

the component implemented using the national public procurement system, PDPFA-GZ will 

benefit from a partial waiver (only contracts of a specified size are concerned) granted by 

the Bank's Board of Directors (“the Board”) in March 2017 (see Document 

AfDB/BD/WP/2016/184/ Rev.(2) for the non-application of the rule of origin of the AfDB 

window (as provided for in Article 17.1.d: “Operational Principles” of the Agreement 

Establishing the African Development Bank (so-called Rule of Origin) for all goods 

contracts of up to UA 1 million, all consultancy contracts up to UA 300 000 and all works 

contracts below or equal to UA 6 million financed by AfDB window resources and 

concluded in accordance with a national procurement system. Given that no contract 

exceeding the above thresholds is provided for under PDPFA-GZ, no additional waiver will 

be required. Thus, the eligibility rules applicable to all contracts concluded under this project 

according to the Tunisian public procurement system will be the national eligibility rules, 

in addition to the provisions of paragraphs 5.2 to 5.10 of the AfDB Eligibility Policy. 

Consequently and for information purposes, even if the national system is used, Bank loan 

resources would not be used to finance a contract awarded to a bidder under AfDB Group 

sanctions. In the event where, these provisions notwithstanding, a contract is concluded with 

a bidder under Bank Group sanction, the contract will not be financed by AfDB loan 

resources. The list of companies under sanction can be consulted at 

http://www.afdb.org/debarred. 

(ii) Other specific conditions proposed: to be able to perform its fiduciary obligations in 
connection with the use of the National System, the Bank has agreed with the Borrower on 

a series of measures the reasons, objectives and details of which are presented in paragraph 

B.5.7.2 of Annex B5.  

4.1.9. Financial management:  the Zaghouan CRDA will ensure project financial management 
through the Project Management Unit (PMU) to be created within it. Financial execution will be 

based on the budgetary system, the public expenditure execution and control system in force at the 

CRDA governed by the Code of Public Accounts, and the circulars on public fund management. In 

this regard, the PMU will benefit from the technical support of the subdivisions of the 

Administrative and Financial Division, the collaboration of the subdivisions of CRDA’s Technical 

Divisions, the Pay Accountant (Comptable Payeur) under the authority of the Regional Treasurer, 

and the Regional Controller of Public Expenditure under the supervision of the Head of 

Government. The project's financial management staff will comprise a Project Manager and an 

Administrative and Financial Officer assisted by an Accountant, all appointed from among CRDA 

staff. The PMU will be responsible for preparing annual work programmes and budgets (AWPBs), 

implementing the AWPB and preparing interim financial reports and annual financial statements. 

To better incorporate the PMU into the CRDA management system, the duties of its members 

should be clearly defined. 



 

17 

 

4.1.10. Disbursements:  the loan will be disbursed in accordance with Bank rules and procedures. 
The special account method and the direct payment method defined in the disbursement manual 

will be used to withdraw loan funds. The use of the special account method will be subject to the 

opening of a special account in the name of the project at the Central Bank of Tunisia (BCT). This 

account will only receive loan resources. During negotiations, a draft disbursement letter will be 

presented and agreed upon by the Bank and the Borrower. It will be sent to the Borrower’s 

representative upon loan approval by the Bank’s Board of Directors. In accordance with the 

provisions of the disbursement manual, and subject to prior Bank approval, it is possible, during 

project implementation, to change the disbursement methods adopted.  

4.1.11.  Auditing: the General Finance Control (CGF) will conduct the external audit based on the 

terms of reference approved by the Bank. The Borrower will transmit the audit report to the Bank 

within six (6) months following the end of the financial year audited. The PMU will be responsible 

for implementing audit recommendations aimed at improving sound project financial execution. 

An annual procurement audit will be conducted for contracts awarded in accordance with the 

national system. 

4.2. Monitoring 

4.2.1. Monitoring mechanisms: the project monitoring and evaluation mechanism will be 
designed taking into consideration the specific project objectives and the expected outcomes of the 

Strategic Development Plan (SDP) for the agricultural sector, and aligned with the public projects 

monitoring system (“INJEZ”) currently used by the Ministry of Agriculture, Water Resources and 

Fishery (MARHP). A participatory monitoring and citizen control mechanism provided by the 

SMSA and GDA will also be set up in line with the principle of accountability now recommended 

within the context of results-based management.  

4.2.2. Internal monitoring and evaluation will be carried out by the PMU and will cover project 
physical (overall and component implementation rate) and financial (commitment rate and 

disbursement rate) monitoring, gender mainstreaming in activities and inputs, and their adequacy 

with projections.  The project monitoring/evaluation officer will collect and compile information 

on the physical and financial outcomes. This information will be used to prepare the project 

progress reports. The key reports that will be prepared during the project implementation phase 

are indicated in Table 4.1 below.

project outputs, and their contribution to achieving development outcomes (i.e. project outputs and 

impacts). It will be carried out by the National Coordination Committee (CNC) and the Regional 

Development Board (CRD), in addition to the two annual supervision missions fielded by the 

Bank. The mid-term review will be conducted in Year 3. At project closure, the Bank and the 

Government will produce a completion report within the prescribed deadline. The main project 

implementation phases are summarised below.

4.3. Governance 

4.3.1. Tunisia is making significant progress in governance. With a score of 63.5 against an 
African average of 49.9, the country occupies the 9th position out of 54 countries in the Mo Ibrahim 

Index of African Governance (IIAG-2018). Similarly, with Bank assistance, the country embarked 

on the implementation of a public procurement reform action plan that resulted in the adoption in 

2014 of a new decree on the regulation of more transparent public procurement. The country 

fiduciary risk assessment (CFRA) carried out showed that the internal public finance management 

control system is appropriate. Generally, economic governance has improved and competition 

enhanced. Under the PDPFA-GZ specifically, land tenure governance will be promoted through 

land consolidation support and the issuance of land titles to farmers (both men and women) in the 

new public irrigation schemes. Transparency measures will also be applied in the selection of 

beneficiaries with the full participation of farmers’ representatives. Likewise, a participatory 

monitoring and citizen control mechanism will be set up in line with the principle of accountability 

recommended within the context of results-based management. 

4.4. Sustainability  

4.4.1. The project has adopted the participatory approach, which enables greater ownership of 
development activities by project beneficiaries who will contribute significantly (about 30%) to 

infrastructure financing and management (PIPs, boreholes, catchment ponds, product development 

units, etc.). Sustainability also relies on water and soil conservation (WSC) and water-saving 

measures, including groundwater recharge, sealing of the entire water transport and drip irrigation 

system to save water and control flow rates recorded. The PMU will conclude collaboration 

agreements with specialised institutions for organic agricultural support, rosehip research and 

development, development of the diary sub-sector and genetic improvement, fodder crop 

development and supervision of farmers and CRDA technicians. To enable these entities to play 

their role fully, they will be supported through specific training in agricultural advisory schemes, 

farmers’ organisation, management, monitoring and evaluation. The use of the “value chain” 

approach with the mainstreaming of product processing, storage and marketing aspects will help to 

incorporate all subsector links and further connect production to markets. Thus, setting up small 

economically, financially and ecologically viable product processing units will guarantee the 

sustainability of project achievements. Furthermore, the project will ensure crosscutting integration 

and mainstreaming of environmental and social aspects, hygiene and food safety, in line with the 

Bank's environmental and social safeguards, and the standards and requirements of profitable 

markets. The sustainability of project operations will also be guaranteed through the effective 

involvement of the local private sector, financial institutions and enterprises in the “aggregation” 



 

19 

 

model to ensure the sustainable establishment of young agricultural entrepreneurs and their access 

to financing and markets. 

4.5. Risk Management 

Table 4.3: Risks and Mitigation Measures 

Risks Level Mitigation Measure 

Unclarified land and public property issues can 

create difficulties in improving the PIPs to be 

developed and compromise project objectives   

Moderate Improving local land governance through land 

consolidation, settlement of land tenure issues 

and the issuance of land titles, following an 

inclusive process, will mitigate this risk.  

Climatic hazards that can worsen the degradation 

of ecosystems and property, increase natural 

disasters and render the population more 

vulnerable 

Moderate Drip irrigation, protection of vulnerable areas, 

opening up of roads and incorporation of climate 

information into the design of facilities will 

mitigate this risk.  

Lack of transparency in the selection of 

beneficiaries, weak monitoring of technological 

innovations by the communities and weak 

capacity of technical services and companies 

Low The definition of beneficiary selection criteria 

with the active participation of farmers’ 

representatives, the adoption of a participatory, 

inclusive and collaborative approach, and the 

building of the capacity of all stakeholders will 

mitigate this risk 

Limited access of farmers to financial resources 

that can annihilate project efforts to create 

sustainable jobs and generate decent income 

Moderate Training in agricultural entrepreneurship and 

forging of partnerships with MFIs for rural 

financing will mitigate this risk. 

4.6. Knowledge Building  

4.6.1. The project will finance a study to update groundwater balances. It will support the 
strengthening of the piezometric measuring network for groundwater level monitoring and control. 

The findings of these studies and measurements will feed a database at the CRDA to enable 

appropriate programming of future agricultural development operations, especially irrigation. The 

project will also build CRDA's capacity to make an optimal use of all the knowledge acquired 

mainly from experts, and finance stakeholder exchange sessions for better sharing of information 

collected. The PMU and CRDA will work to incorporate climate information into participatory 

development plans (PDPs) and encourage farmers to include climate information in the agricultural 

calendar. Such information will also be shared with the weather monitoring networks to identify 

risks of natural disasters and contribute to the rational and predictive management of such risks. In 

addition, gender-based monitoring and evaluation will contribute to the development of knowledge 

in this sector and help to advance gender considerations in other bank operations in the agricultural 

sector. Lastly, the project will establish an integrated system for managing and sharing knowledge 

on project activities through regular dissemination on MARHP’s website, in order to build on and 

manage the knowledge and experience acquired.
