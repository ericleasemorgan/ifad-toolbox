B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 

The small and open countries of the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS)
1
 have 

traditionally encountered serious development challenges, coupled with low growth, high debt, and 
limited fiscal space to maneuver around these problems. Agricultural exports and tourism drove 
growth of roughly 6 percent per year on average in OECS economies the 1980s, but growth and external 
trade began to decline in the late 1990s, after the European Union (EU) withdrew preferential access for 
traditional OECS agricultural exports (bananas and sugar).

2
 Efforts to revive growth and offset 

exogenous shocks through increased public investment engendered a large public debt and stifled 
private investment. The global financial crisis in 2008 heavily curbed tourism, remittances, and financial 
sector activity, while sharply increasing public debt and fiscal imbalances. OECS countries recorded a 
cumulative drop in output of 6 percent during 2009–12; at the same time, periodic natural disasters 
continued to batter their infrastructure and economies. OECS economies started to recuperate recently 
through a steady recovery in tourism and the United States economy. The regional growth forecast for 
2017 is positive, based on improving performance in key sectors (tourism, construction, agriculture) and 
lower fuel prices. Over the medium term, average growth for the region is expected to accelerate to 
about 2.5 percent. 

OECS countries have not reduced poverty and unemployment rates to levels compatible with their per 
capita income levels. Official poverty rates are 30.2 percent in Saint Vincent & the Grenadines (SVG) and 
37.7 percent in Grenada; poverty is concentrated in rural areas.

3
 The financial crisis and reduced 

demand for OECS exports and services have aggravated unemployment, which was already high. 
Unemployment (now 10.2 percent in Grenada and 18.8 percent in SVG) is higher among youth, 
exceeding 30 percent in both countries. Female-headed households, which account for two-thirds of all 
households in the OECS, are more likely to be poor.  

                                                           
1
 Established in 1981, this inter-governmental organization promotes economic harmonization and integration, human and 

legal rights, and good governance. It has seven founding and full members (Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, 
Montserrat, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent & the Grenadines) and two associate members (Anguilla and the 
British Virgin Islands—British Overseas Territories). Martinique (France) joined in 2015 but is not represented by the OECS 
diplomatic mission.  
2
Governed by the Lomé Convention (1975) and its successor, the Cotonou Agreement, these trade arrangements included 

special protocols for EU imports of bananas and sugar. The EU initiated reforms for banana imports in 1999 and sugar in 2006.  
3
Specific figures on rural poverty are not readily available, but government studies and agricultural sector reviews reveal that 

most poor people in the OECS reside in rural areas.

Sectoral and Institutional Context 
Agriculture is a critical element for improving rural incomes, employment, and food security for OECS 
countries and farmers, however, it has not adapted rapidly to the changing trade regime. For example, 
SVG’s banana exports declined significantly; Grenada’s banana exports collapsed, and its nutmeg and 
cocoa production were devastated by Hurricanes Ivan (September 2004) and Emily (July 2005). 
Consequently, agriculture’s contribution to GDP, which was 13.4 percent in Grenada and 21.2 percent in 
SVG in 1990, was 5.4 percent in Grenada and 7.5 percent in SVG two decades later. The fact that 
agriculture remains a major contributor to employment, representing about 11 percent of the labor 
force in Grenada and 26 percent in SVG, indicates a persistent productivity problem.  

OECS agriculture could drive sustained gains in employment and income, while reducing dependence 
on imported food, if strategic investments are made to improve agricultural productivity and increase 
access to markets. Investment opportunities exist along the two main pathways for developing 
agriculture: import substitution and export expansion. For instance, Grenada produces nutmeg and 
cocoa of exceptional quality, in high demand internationally. Each product has only one principal 
exporter (public rather than private—the Grenada Cooperative Nutmeg Association and Grenada Cocoa 
Association), but the market for processing these products is open, and Grenada has two chocolate 
factories and a plant to produce medicines from nutmeg. Nutmeg and mace still lead Grenada’s 
agricultural exports, and it has also had success exporting soursop, citrus fruits, cloves, ginger, 
cinnamon, and fish, while agro-processing (pepper sauces, jams, juices) is becoming more important for 
the export market. SVG has started to export eddoes and dasheen (taro), arrowroot starch, roots and 
tubers, ginger, coconuts, spices, pineapples, and peppers, mostly to regional markets and the United 
Kingdom (UK). However, key investments are required to increase competitiveness to gain extended and 
sustainable access to regional and international markets. 

Local produce could potentially substitute for some imported produce in the tourism sector as well as 
in local and regional markets. Agricultural imports have increased in volume, variety, and value as 
tourism, supermarkets, and incomes have grown. The volume of OECS agricultural imports—mainly 
meat (especially poultry), cereals, and dairy products—is now about four times higher than the volume 
of agricultural exports. The World Bank estimates that 68 percent of food demand from the tourism 
sector is met through imports, representing around 20 percent of OECS agricultural imports. Locally 
produced fruits and vegetables appear to have the greatest import substitution potential, given high 
local demand, competitive production costs (in some cases), high perishability of these products, their 
ability to grow in most OECS countries, and their suitability for production even on small farms. Apart 
from hotels, the expanding yachting and supermarket sectors offer opportunities for local food 
producers. The freshness of local produce, as well as of fish and seafood, and better transport times and 
costs represent major advantages and opportunities for local farmers and fishermen where 
supermarkets and hotels will pay a premium for freshness. While for some locally grown products the 
cost of production is simply too high to compete with imported products, in some cases local fresh 
produce has the potential to be competitive.

A major consideration in this context is that the peak agricultural season is out of sync with the peak 
tourism season, impacting food demand, availability, and prices. Local demand for high-quality food 
peaks in mid-December to mid-April, the high season for tourism in the Caribbean, and falls 
precipitously afterward. On the other hand, agricultural production peaks in the wet season (June–

November, coinciding with the hurricane season), which is becoming less predictable and drier with 
climate change. During the December–May dry season, the absence of intensive irrigation to sustain 
horticultural production significantly reduces the consistent supply of local produce. Owing to the lack of 
storage facilities and farmers’ tendency to produce the same products at the same time, the oversupply 
of certain crops in the wet season leads to food losses, lower food prices, and declining farm revenue. 
Key strategic investments to ensure a sustained supply all through the year, to promote proper storage, 
and to diversify markets, seem to be essential for the sector to develop.  

In sum, the main barrier to purchasing more local produce is the limited ability of local farmers to 
deliver the required quantity and quality of produce in a timely, consistent, and competitive manner. 
Most farms are small and lack the inputs, equipment, infrastructure, and farm management skills 
(including production planning, crop management knowledge, and post-harvest handling capacity) to 
become reliable suppliers. Hotels belonging to large international chains prefer to purchase in bulk from 
Miami to get guaranteed quantities and volume discounts, rather than to deal with the uncertainty of 
sourcing large quantities locally from many small farmers. Recently established large hotels received 
government concessions to import duty free. Lacking such options, small and medium-sized hotels 
purchase from multiple local farmers and other sources to meet demand, which can be time consuming. 
They benefit from greater freshness (produce typically is picked and transported to hotels on the same 
day) and lower transport times and costs, but must cope with the inconsistent quantity and quality of 
produce, as well as the limited variety and overall quantity.  

The rudimentary market structure for fresh produce, including the lack of aggregation of smallholder 
supplies, results in suboptimal market performance. The limited aggregation of produce reduces 
smallholders’ access to assured and remunerative markets (and a more stable income), complicates 
buyers’ purchasing operations, and creates a disincentive to buy locally. Virtually all marketing of fresh 
local produce in OECS countries is done by individual farmers, and until they harvest, many do not know 
where or to whom they will sell. OECS countries have few producer or marketing organizations to 
remedy these problems, and such organizations generally suffer from financial problems, unstable and 
limited membership, side-selling, and mistrust. An added complication is that the public sector (typically 
ministries of agriculture) actively purchase and market produce through marketing boards that typically 
run at a loss, fail to provide remunerative prices to farmers, and crowd out private marketing activity. 
Poor communication and coordination between supply and demand complicate the planning of farm 
production and create uncertainty for buyers and sellers. 

The agro-processing industry is not well developed. Several small and medium enterprises (SMEs) 
produce a range of products, but difficulties in obtaining financing on affordable terms limit the 
investments in infrastructure, equipment, and inputs required to scale up and generate consistent 
profits. Many agribusiness entrepreneurs lack technical skills and knowledge to develop viable business 
plans, make the required investments, develop a network of reliable farmer-suppliers, and comply with 
the quality, food safety, and certification standards enabling them to penetrate profitable markets. The 
food processing industry cannot absorb all the produce offered, yet at the same time processors cannot 
obtain consistent supplies of quality produce. This mismatch between local production and industry 
demand, while partly related to seasonality, is mainly an organizational and marketing problem. As in 
marketing, in agro-processing public sector initiatives (largely unsuccessful) have crowded out the 
private sector.  

A combined production-marketing system, based on private sector aggregators of smallholder 
produce and agro-processors, could address most of these constraints and improve international

competitiveness. Promising models are based on aggregation by private sector actors, who purchase 
from small-scale producers and give them a market for their produce. Apart from aggregating, storing, 
and marketing produce, aggregators can add value to certain products through basic activities such as 
washing, packaging and cutting, and can potentially offer support and services for producers (planting 
material, agro-chemicals, technical advice). Some producer organizations in Grenada and SVG could 
possibly act as aggregators and should be supported to do so, but they cannot succeed alone. Private 
actors—traders, wholesalers, or even larger (lead) farmers—need to step in and assume the required 
organizational and aggregation roles. Agro-processors can adopt the same model, in which smallholder 
farmers produce in accord with a plan agreed with the processor and embodied in a written contract.  

The Productive Alliance (PA) methodology, successfully tested in several projects in the LAC region, 
could help to resolve major constraints on producers’ access to markets. The PA methodology, 
introduced during the early 2000s in Latin America and more recently to other regions, engages with the 
private sector to enable smallholders to meet market demand for produce in terms of quantity, quality, 
and timeliness. The traditional PA approach involves three core agents: a group of smallholder 
producers, one or more buyers, and the public sector, while more advanced versions include technical 
service providers and lenders. These agents are connected through a business plan, which describes 
producers’ needs for capital and services and proposes improvements—attained through productive 
investments, technical assistance (TA), and business development—to upgrade their production 
capacities and skills and strengthen their linkage with markets. Evidence shows that the PA approach 
increases productivity, market integration, production, sales volume, prices, and smallholders’ incomes; 
generates on-farm and non-farm employment; and facilitates the inclusion of vulnerable groups in 
commercial value chains.  

The proposed project is well aligned with the revised OECS Regional Plan of Action for Agriculture 
(2012–2022) and national development plans. The priority of the Regional Plan of Action is to promote 
a market-oriented agribusiness approach to alleviating poverty and food and nutrition insecurity, 
consistent with the proposed project. Another priority is to mainstream climate change mitigation and 
adaptation strategies in agricultural programs to protect food production systems and build resilience 
against tropical storms, heavy rains, and droughts in rural/farming communities, which the proposed 
project will do. At the national level, the project is aligned with the National Economic and Social 
Development Plan (2013–2025) of SVG, which among other objectives for agriculture seeks to increase 
productivity, efficiency, and competitiveness; increase market access for agricultural produce; and 
increase agricultural exports; as well as with the National Agricultural Plan (2015-2030) of Grenada. 

Finally, the project is well positioned to contribute to the climate change policies and measures of 
Grenada and SVG, outlined in their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs). The INDCs 
of both countries emphasize improving climate change adaptation in the priority sectors of tourism and 
agriculture. By taking climate change into consideration as an emerging risk and reflecting adaptation 
and mitigation in its design and implementation, the project provides a framework to achieve some of 
the INDC commitments.  The project includes strategic investments, both at the level of the public and 
the private sectors, to promote the development, dissemination and adoption of innovative 
technologies that would significantly contribute to decrease vulnerability to climate variability and, 
therefore, generate climate mitigation and adaptation co-benefits.

The proposed Project Development Objective (PDO) is to enhance access to markets and sales for 
competitively selected farmers and fishers, as well as their allied aggregators and agro-processors, in 
Grenada and St. Vincent and the Grenadines.  

 
The main beneficiaries of the proposed project include:  

(a) Small-scale individual or organized farmers and fishers (FFs). 
(b) Aggregators and agro-processors (AAs), including: (a) producer organizations (associations, 

cooperatives or similar formal organizations with legal standing); and (b) SMEs, such as 
wholesalers, traders, lead farmers (with legal standing to act as aggregator), and industrial 
agro-processors.  

(c) The respective ministries of agriculture, as well as their extension officers and staff, which 
will be strengthened by the Project.  

 

Detailed criteria for eligibility of FFs and AAs for receiving matching grants under the project will be 
defined in the Project Operational Manual (POM). The FFs and AAs will be eligible only if they are 
formally participating together in a strategic productive alliance approved by the project to pursue the 
stated objectives. It is expected that the Project will have 1,700 direct beneficiaries, of which at least 25 
percent will be female and 25 percent will be below the age of 40 years. 

Key Results 
 

The proposed PDO indicators are identical for both countries (with different quantitative targets for 
each country): 

(b) Market Access Compliance Score for participating FFs supplying products to their allied AAs 
in accordance with the agreed Business Plans per semester (this Score is a weighted average 
of the volume complying with the agreed terms of the business plans related to quantities, 
quality, and timeliness of delivery). 

(c) Market Access Compliance Score for sales from all participating AAs complying with buyers' 
specifications  as per their Business Plans per semester (weighted average of volume 
complying with quality, quantities, and timeliness of delivery). 

(d) Percentage increase in the average annual sales of FFs participating in strategic alliances 
under the project. 

(e) Percentage increase in the value of gross sales made by AAs participating in the project to 
their final buyers. 

(f) Direct project beneficiaries (number), of which female (%) and young (%). 

 
D. Project Description  

 

The scope of the proposed project is based on successful experiences with productive alliances (PA) in 
other operations supported by the World Bank in the region, adapted to the specific conditions of small 
island economies such as Grenada and SVG. As noted, the PA approach is intended to improve access to 
markets for AAs and small-size FFs, using the private sector as a vehicle to foster smallholder production

in accordance to market demand in terms of quantity, quality, and timeliness. The main components, 
apply to both recipient/borrowing countries and are based on the need for improving linkages between 
demand and supply in prioritized value chains. 

Component 1: Support for Preparation of Business Plans (Costs: Grenada IBRD: US$ 0.38m; 

SVG IDA: US$0.40m) 

The objective of this component is to: (i) promote an understanding of the Project’s scope and 
objectives through outreach to potential stakeholders and beneficiaries (such as individual and 
organized FFs, AAs, buyers, and lenders); (ii) identify potential business opportunities for prioritized 
value chains and their translation into viable and profitable business proposals; and (iii) prepare full 
business plans for selected proposals. 

This component will finance the provision of goods, consulting and non-consulting services, training and 
operating costs in support of implementing pre-investment activities, including:  

(a) development and implementation of a communication and information dissemination strategy 
to raise awareness of the Project and its activities;  

(b) organization of networking events, including business roundtables and local workshops for 
supporting the formation of strategic alliances between aggregators and agro-processors 
(“AAs”) and farmers and fishers (“FF”), buyers, and lenders;  

(c) provision of Training to AAs, FFs and buyers to identify business opportunities and to translate 
them into viable business proposals;  

(d) implementation of a country-wide call for interested parties to present business proposals;  
(e) evaluation of business proposals, and selection of those proposals to be developed into business 

plans; 
(f) provision of technical assistance for the preparation of sustainable and competitive business 

plans;  
(g) evaluation and selection of final business plans, and the preparation of Subproject Agreements 

for those selected plans; and 
(h) analysis of the qualifications of input suppliers eligible to participate in the voucher program 

under Component 2 of the Project. 

A Technical Assistance Agreement between the borrowing countries and the Food and Agriculture 
Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, financed by contributions from the credit proceeds of both 
countries, will include TA support for the implementation of activities described under (c), and (f) above.  

Component 2: Implementation of Business Plans (Grenada: IDA US$2.2m; IBRD US$ 0.22m; 

beneficiaries: US$ 0.64m; SVG: IDA US$2.95m; beneficiaries: US$ 0.72m) 

The objective of this component is to provide matching grants to co-finance the implementation of 
technically feasible, financially viable, economically profitable, socially responsible, and environmentally 
sustainable business plans, which, when implemented, will contribute to a consistent and timely supply 
of sufficient quantities of quality produce to buyers while providing a reliable income to allied FFs. The 
implementation of these Business Plans will make possible an increase in productivity and quality of the 
products, as well as reducing dependency on rainfall, thus reducing the constraints for increasing supply 
during peak season and enhancing vulnerability to climatic factors.  In addition, Component 2 is 
expected to provide climate change co-benefits derived from: (i) adaptation, by promoting innovative 
resource management practices to increase resilience, expanding the use of crops and crop

mixes/rotations less vulnerable to climate variability, and expanding the use of protected agriculture 
and drought/heat resistant varieties; and (ii) mitigation, by promoting agricultural intensification using 
higher yielding varieties, carbon sequestration species and cropping patterns, improving irrigation 
measures and replacing traditional sources of energy (see Annex 4). 

This component will finance:  

(a) The implementation of a matching grant and voucher program, including the provision of: 

(i) training for capacity building to AAs receiving matching grants (such as in logistics, 
storage, marketing, agronomy, accounting, financial literacy, food processing, good 
manufacturing practices, packaging, labelling, traceability, quality control, food safety 
and hygiene, legal and environmental aspects ) and FFs receiving vouchers (such as in 
good production practices, modern and improved technologies, climate-smart 
agriculture, post-harvest handling, and financial literacy); and 

(ii) support in supervising the implementation of the selected business plans, including 
assisting the PIUs to put in place a technical supervision and implementation support 
system, capable of following up the implementation of the Business Plans making sure 
they follow the approved Plans and detecting real or potential issues that could 
compromise the expected results of the Plans or their effectiveness. 

(b) Provision of matching grants to eligible AAs, and vouchers to eligible FFs, which are allied with 
the respective AAs, for the purpose of implementing the business plans selected under 
Component 1 of the Project, and co-financing investments under said plans, including:  

(i) for the selected AAs: (A) equipment (transport, office, ICT tools/mobile applications, 
cold storage, product processing, and so on), infrastructure (such as storage/warehouse 
and cold chain facilities) and other related inputs, and (B) technical assistance and 
specialized Training related to their respective business plans; and 

(ii) for the selected FFs: (A) farming equipment, infrastructure and other related inputs 
(such as equipment for land preparation and harvesting, irrigation infrastructure 
(including rainwater harvesting structures and pressured irrigation, greenhouses, 
tunnels, hydroponics, aquaponics, and so on), and (B) fishing equipment, infrastructure 
and other related inputs (such as boats and fishing implements, logistics, temporary cold 
storage) 

(c) Provision of (i) technical assistance and Training on procurement to AAs receiving Matching 
Grants, and (ii) specialized Training, in relation to the implementation of the relevant business 
plans, to FFs receiving Vouchers. 

The Technical Assistance Agreement to be signed between both countries and FAO to be financed under 
the Project will include necessary technical support for the implementation of activities described under 
(a) above, unless such activities constitute a conflict of interest with the services provided under this 
assignment. 

Each business plan will need co-financing from the AA (at least 20 percent of the AA investments for 
producer organizations and at least 50 percent for other private sector AAs). At least 10 percent of the 
AA costs of the subproject will have to be allocated upfront in cash by the beneficiary. The rest of the 
counterpart financing of the business plan will have to be covered by the beneficiaries from their own 



 

The World Bank  
OECS Regional Agriculture Competitiveness Project (P158958)

funds or through resources provided by other lenders (banks, credit unions, development banks, private 
sector, etc.). Proof of the availability of resources secured in advance from these sources will be a 
condition to start implementation of a subproject. Producer organizations with potential will be 
encouraged to participate as AA; however, to give them better opportunities to participate as AAs, they 
will not compete directly with other private sector AAs in the selection process.  Weaker producer 
groups will participate as FFs in alliance with an AA, and they will receive TA in organizational and 
institutional strengthening to help them become an AA in the future. 

The mechanisms to finance subprojects will be different for AAs and FFs:   

(a) For AAs: The procurement of investment items included in the Subproject will be undertaken 
by the AAs for small works, goods, and individual consulting and non-consulting services, 
under a threshold further defined in the POM. Above the specified threshold, and for all 
consulting services by firms regardless of value, all procurement for the benefit of the AAs will 
be undertaken by the PCU. The PCU will have a fiduciary control function of the procurement 
undertaken by the AAs and will provide TA and support to improve the procurement capacity 
of the AAs.  Under this proposed mechanism, each beneficiary AA will receive funds in a 
specific bank account opened by the AA for its exclusive use while implementing the 
subproject. The counterpart funds from the AA are expected to be deposited in the same 
specific account as a precondition for disbursing project funds, which will be sequenced in line 
with physical progress in accordance with the Subproject Agreement and the related schedule 
in the Subproject Procurement Plan. This matching-grants for the AAs would have a maximum 
of $120,000 for productive investments and a maximum of $20,000 for specific technical 
assistance for implementation. 

(b) For FFs: The project will implement a voucher mechanism to provide financial assistance to 
FFs. The investments to be supported by the sub-grants will be partially financed by vouchers 
issued by the PCU in the name of the benefitting FFs (in accordance with the terms of the 
respective business plans and the corresponding Subproject Agreement). The FFs will use 
these vouchers to complement their own funds in purchasing the specific approved items, as 
confirmed and approved by the PCU, from a local supplier selected by them from a list of 
suppliers approved beforehand by the PCU.  The maximum allowed for each individual 
beneficiary FF will be $8,000 and for a total of $120,000 for all the FFs in a single Subproject 
Agreement.  In addition, the FFs will receive free general training and extension services from 
FAO in collaboration with each Ministry of Agriculture and more specialized TA from other TA 
providers directly procured by the PCUs 

Component 3: General Agricultural Services and Enabling Environment (Grenada IBRD: US$0.54m; SVG 

IDA:  US$0.25m)  

The objective of this component is to strengthen general agricultural public services directly linked to 
the subprojects described in Component 2 and needed to enhance the probability of success. It will also 
support the strengthening of the overall enabling environment needed for the sustained development 
of the business enterprises with potential competitive advantages, locally and internationally. The 
project will finance goods, works, consulting and non-consulting services, training and operating costs 
(travel, per diem, etc.) to help implement the key activities under the component. This component will 
contribute to generate climate change co-benefits in two main areas: (i) promotion and incorporation of 
techniques more resilient to climate variability into public extension services practices; and

(ii) mitigation, by conducting basic research as well as introduce new technologies that reduce GHG 
emissions in crop production and fisheries, as well as promoting the adoption of new systems increasing 
carbon sequestration (see Annex 4). A TA Agreement to be signed with FAO will include technical 
support for the implementation of activities under (c), as described below. 

The main activities under this component are to:  

(a) improve the quality and availability of key inputs required for the adoption of more 

productive technology (such as quality seeds, seedlings, and planting materials) for products 

supported under Component 2 of the Project;  

(b) organize, and facilitate participation in, trade fairs and study tours;  

(c) strengthen agricultural public extension service providers’ knowledge and skills to effectively 

(i) support the selected AAs and FFs to adopt technology for the efficient implementation of 

their business plans under Component 2 of the Project, and (ii) communicate and disseminate 

information broadly across the agricultural sector; 

(d) carrying out technical studies to competition improve competitiveness, including market 

studies, analysis of new potential value chains, enabling environment, reforms, agro-food 

logistics, and food safety requirements and quality standards (including legal framework) and 

related technical skills; and  

(e) carrying out improvements to public infrastructure that are required for the promotion of 

adequate internal distribution of produce, reduction of post-harvest losses, establishment of 

modern food safety mechanisms, as well as cold storage at key exit points for perishable 

agricultural exports (e.g., airports/port terminals).  

Component 4: Project Management, Monitoring, and Evaluation (Grenada IBRD: US$0.66m; SVG IDA: 

US$0.70m)  

The objective of this component is to ensure effective project implementation, monitoring of activities 
and final project evaluation. The project will finance goods, consulting and non-consulting services, 
training and incremental operational costs to the PCU and the PIU for expenditures related to the 
project activities, including: (i) project coordination and management; (ii) monitoring, evaluation, and 
impact assessment; (iii) fiduciary administration, accounting and financial/technical audits; (iv) 
safeguards management; and (v) a citizens’ engagement mechanism. 

 
E. Implementation 
 
Institutional and Implementation Arrangements 

Overall implementation responsibility. In each country, a Steering Committee (SC) will be formed by 
representatives of government ministries and agencies considered relevant for a successful project 
implementation and the achievement of its objectives, as well as from the private sector, to provide 
overall guidance and support for project implementation and ensure proper inter-institutional 
coordination. This committee will approve the annual Project Operating Plans and requests for 
budgetary allocations, and it will provide opinions on possible restructuring or adjustments in the 
project’s approach, methodology, and focus. The final constitution of the SC will be defined in the POM. 



 

The World Bank  
OECS Regional Agriculture Competitiveness Project (P158958) 

 

 

  
Apr 03, 2017 Page 12 of 23  

 

Overall responsibility for financial management (FM), procurement, and safeguards for the proposed 
project will rest in the existing PCU in each country. In Grenada, the existing PCU is located in the 
Ministry of Finance and Energy (MoFE) and has been executing Bank-financed operations for several 
years. In SVG, the PCU is located in the Public Sector Investment Program Management Unit (PSIPMU), 
which is based in the Ministry of Economic Planning, Sustainable Development, Industry, Information 
and Labour (MoEP) and has also executed Bank-financed operations for several years. FM, procurement, 
and safeguards assessments of the PCUs were completed at appraisal to determine any needs for 
further strengthening of these functions under the project, either by providing additional staff or 
contracting consultants to efficiently implement the fiduciary and safeguard aspects of the proposed 
project.  

Overall responsibility for technical implementation will rest within the line ministries of agriculture 
(MoALFF in Grenada; MoAFFRT in SVG), through a small PIU in each country. In principle, each of these 
PIUs will consist of at least a Project Manager and an Agribusiness Monitoring and Evaluation Specialist. 
The PIU will be responsible for (i) coordinating and implementing all Project activities, including with 
relevant agencies and beneficiaries, as specified in the POM, (ii) ensuring that the requirements, criteria, 
policies, procedures and organizational arrangements set forth in the POM are applied in carrying out 
the Project, (iii) preparing all Project implementation documents, including Project reports, and (iv) 
monitoring and evaluating the Project. Very close collaboration between the PIU and the PCU will be 
crucial. 

Technical Assistance (TA). The main focus of this TA is to support the preparation and implementation 
of effective and sustainable business plans at the FF and AA levels and to strengthen the capacity of the 
respective ministries of agriculture to deliver the services needed to improve production and 
competitiveness. The TA services, together with the investments included in the business plans (for AAs 
and FFs), are the two main pillars of the project, complementing each other and aiming to achieving the 
development objectives. Grenada/SVG, through each PCU, will enter into a contractual agreement with 
a technical service provider to receive specific assistance and guidance in key aspects of project 
implementation. The two recipient governments have expressed their preference to engage a single 
service provider for covering the key phases of the business plan cycle (from identification/preparation 
of Business Plans to the supervision of implementation), ensuring a consistent approach and 
methodology. The two governments have requested that FAO serve as this main technical service 
provider, given the organization’s long engagement with both countries and its presence in the region, 
as well as its worldwide experience with agricultural competitiveness and technology development 
issues.  

 
 .    
F. Project location and Salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 
 

Environment Under Component 2, the Project would co-finance aggregators’ investments such as transport, 
storage, post-harvest, cold chain facilities, ICT tools and mobile applications, equipment, infrastructure, or 
energy-saving technologies; and for allied producers, investments such as equipment for land preparation 
and harvesting, irrigation infrastructure including rain water harvesting, greenhouses, tunnels, hydroponics, 
and aquaculture. Technical assistance, training, and extension services would also be provided for storage, 
marketing, agronomy, accounting, financial literacy, food processing, machinery, packaging, labeling,

traceability, quality control, or food safety and hygiene; and good agricultural practices, modern and 
improved technologies, climate smart agriculture, post-harvest handling or financial literacy. The 
investments could take place anywhere in Grenada or in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. While the prime 
agricultural lands are in relatively flat lying areas, fairly steep areas are routinely cultivated and therefore 
erosion control is of concern and was incorporated into the ESMF through extension services training for 
best management practice. Pest management is also being improved through other World Bank projects in 
the region and lessons learned will be applied to this Project. Processing or storage facilities could be 
located in non-agricultural lands, and will apply lessons learned in other projects in the region. Social The 
final design and location of sub-project sites will be defined during project implementation. Some of the 
physical characteristics of relevance to social safeguards analysis would include: population density, 
patterns of land ownership, livelihood activities, and presence of vulnerable populations. Once specific sub-
project sites are known, a screening of potential social risks and impacts will be conducted, where needed. 
Given that some investments under Component 2 may lead to involuntary resettlement impacts, a 
Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) was prepared to guide the application of the Operational Policy (OP) 
4.12 requirements. The RPF guides the resettlement objectives and principles, organizational arrangements 
and funding mechanisms for the preparation of the Resettlements Plans (RPs) to be carried out during 
Project implementation.

SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY 

 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

The World Bank Safeguard Policy OP 4.01 for 
Environmental Assessment (EA) is triggered, and 
after analysis of the Project and its components it 
was determined that it falls under Category B, due to 
minor to moderate potential negative impacts from 
agricultural production, food processing, 
aquaculture, livestock rearing, and other related 
activities.  The details of individual subprojects are 
not yet known, therefore an Environmental and 
Social Management Framework (ESMF) has been 
prepared for both recipient (Grenada and SVG), 
using examples from other World Bank OECS 
regional projects.  A consultation/workshop was 



 

The World Bank  
OECS Regional Agriculture Competitiveness Project (P158958) 

 

 

  
Apr 03, 2017 Page 14 of 23  

 

held during the pre-appraisal mission in late October 
and early November and the ESMF has been 
disclosed in country for comments. A final version 
has been disclosed on the World Bank's external 
website on January 24, 2017, and in country on 
February 22, 2017 in Grenada and on March 2, 2017 
in SVG. A revised version was disclosed in-country 
and in the World Bank external website on April 18, 
2017.  
 
The ESMF includes guidance for screening of simple 
subprojects (such as washing and sorting facilities) 
that can use standard mitigation measures already 
detailed in the ESMF, as well as identification of 
more complex subprojects (such as large agro-
processing facilities) or subprojects in sensitive areas 
(such as mariculture or seafloor harvesting projects) 
that would require additional assessment during 
implementation to prepare comprehensive 
environmental management plans as needed. For 
simple subprojects and small producers, the ESMF 
includes a condensation of World Bank Group 
Environment Health and Safety (EHS) Guidelines for 
reference as a generic environmental management 
plan.  Additional consideration is given to pest 
management, water supply, fertilizer use, mixed 
cropping (or rotation), soil conservation, and erosion 
control, since these are common issues in 
agricultural projects in the OECS.  Complex 
subprojects will require individual design reviews 
and due diligence for emissions and discharges, 
labor practice, and other environmental and safety 
aspects. 

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 Yes 

The Project will screen out and exclude any 
subproject works that would involve clearing of new 
land for agriculture; however, during Project 
preparation it was decided to trigger the policy as a 
precaution to ensure that any affected natural 
habitats are adequately protected, because some of 
the project sites may take place near parks or 
protected areas, or may potentially affect lands that 
meet the definition of natural habitat. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No 
The Project will categorically screen out and exclude 
any clearing or effects on forest lands. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes The Pest Management Policy (OP 4.09) was also 



 

The World Bank  
OECS Regional Agriculture Competitiveness Project (P158958) 

 

 

  
Apr 03, 2017 Page 15 of 23  

 

triggered as a precaution, because pesticide use is a 
necessity in agricultural activities in the region. The 
ESMF promotes Integrated Pest Management as 
standard practice, and a screening mechanism is 
included in the ESMF to determine if there are any 
subprojects with significant pest management 
issues; if so, then a separate Pest Management Plan 
will be required to ensure that these materials are 
well managed for those subprojects. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 Yes 

This policy was triggered as a precaution to ensure 
that any "chance finds" or other physical cultural 
resources during excavation or other earth-moving 
activities are adequately protected. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 No 

Policy OP/BP 4.10 is not triggered. In the context of 
preparation of other OECS regional projects in Saint 
Vincent and Grenada, screening, background 
research, and consultations were conducted by the 
World Bank to determine whether Indigenous 
Populations were present in the project area. These 
screening activities confirmed that while populations 
who claim historical indigenous heritage do exist in 
the OECS (in the area of Sandy Bay, Saint Vincent), 
these groups do not have distinctive customary 
cultural, economic, social or political institutions that 
are separate from the dominant society and culture. 
Nor do they have an indigenous language different 
from the official language of Saint Vincent (English). 
Therefore, it was concluded that this community 
does not retain the minimum characteristics 
necessary to claim indigenous group affiliation under 
Bank Policy OP/BP 4.10. 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

The designs of individual subprojects are not yet 
known, however, some investments for aggregators 
(for example: transport, storage, cold chain facilities, 
infrastructure) and allied producers under 
Component 2 may lead to involuntary 
resettlement/land acquisition, affecting land or 
livelihoods. Therefore, OP 4.12 is triggered and a 
Resettlement Policy framework (RPF) was developed 
to guide the application of the OP 4.12policy 
requirements. No project funds will be used for land 
acquisitions. In case land acquisition is needed, it 
would have to be entirely and directly financed by 
the concerned beneficiaries. Activities that could 
involve involuntary resettlement will be avoided, 



 

The World Bank  
OECS Regional Agriculture Competitiveness Project (P158958) 

 

 

  
Apr 03, 2017 Page 16 of 23  

 

nevertheless a RPF has been elaborated as a 
precautionary measure. The RPF clarified 
resettlement objectives and principles, 
organizational arrangements and funding 
mechanisms to be prepared and implemented if any 
safeguards tools (e.g. Resettlement Action Plans) are 
required during project implementation. The RPF 
was prepared and disclosed and consulted  prior to 
Project appraisal.  A revised version was disclosed in-
country and in the World Bank external website on 
April 18, 2017. 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 No 
Improvements of canals or water conveyance 
systems are not envisioned and will be excluded in 
the EMF screening criteria. 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

No 
This policy should not be triggered since the Project 
will not finance activities involving the use or 
potential pollution of international waterways. 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No 
The Project will categorically screen out and exclude 
any projects in disputed areas. 

 
 

KEY SAFEGUARD POLICY ISSUES AND THEIR MANAGEMENT 

 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential 
large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
Environment:   
 
Two of the main issues identified during Project preparation are the management of pesticides and the potential for 
soil erosion.  Both issues are prioritized in the Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) through the 
promotion of best management practices.  Another potential issue relates to discharge and permitting for large agro-
processing facilities; these are also identified in the ESMF and would require additional studies as needed during 
implementation. 
 
The long-term environmental impacts would largely be positive through improved agricultural practice, among small 
farmers and larger co-ops and agro-processors.  There are no large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts 
anticipated from the Project. 
 
Social:   
 
Social impacts addressed in the ESMF, are related to  potential  involuntary resettlement  which are not expected to 
be significant. Other project’s potential impacts are associated with aggravation of social exclusion among 
disadvantaged farmers and fishers. The ESMF provide guidelines for screening business plans and subproject sites and 
for undertaking full social assessments, if needed, to analyze social impacts and risks, including but not limited to land

acquisition/resettlement/economic displacement. Social assessment identifies population density, patterns of land 
ownership, and defines the establishment of mechanisms to screen for farm and rural larceny; determines the 
presence of vulnerable segments of the population in the Project area, including women, poorest smallholders, as well 
as young farmers under the age of 40, to ensure their participation and share in Project benefits (including in training 
and extensions services). 
 
Most works contemplated will involve temporary impacts, and potential land acquisition and/or resettlement 
associated with construction activities, as per the OP4.12. and estimated social impacts on affected people are 
estimated as low and temporary. The Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) ensures the mitigation and compensation 
of involuntary resettlement. The RPF guides the preparation of Resettlement Plans (RPs) during implementation. 
Regarding potential impacts on vulnerable population for assuring the inclusion of less advantage FFs and AAs, the 
Project’s PA participative approach will be implemented. 
 
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area: 
The long-term environmental impacts would largely be positive through improved agricultural practice, among small 
farmers and larger co-ops and agro-processors.  There are not  indirect or long term social impacts estimated in the 
Project area. 
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts. 
Environment:  
 
The ESMF includes guidance to avoid clearing new agricultural lands, and exclusions of effects on natural habitat or 
forests.  Otherwise the Project alternative analysis is not relevant with regards to environmental aspects. 
 
 
Social:  
 
In order to avoid and minimize land acquisition and define the mitigation and compensation measures needed when 
land acquisition is unavoidable, the Project has prepared an RPF that will guide the preparation RPs in the 
implementation phase. The RPs will define the specific alternatives for each sub-project to minimize and compensate 
social impacts. 
 
Fostering social inclusion will be addressed by a productive alliance (PA) tool that  aims at targeting established 
producer groups and value chains, supporting the inclusion of disadvantaged groups and building broader alliances 
with state agencies and/or municipalities. The proposed project approach is based on the PA methodology, adapted to 
the OECS context and reflecting lessons learned from similar projects, with the objective of improving the access of 
small farmers and fishers (FFs) to markets and increasing their productivity and income. Business plans developed 
under the Project will allow these individuals to upgrade their production, capacities, and skills. Project activities are 
defined to ensure access and opportunities for vulnerable beneficiaries, and capacity building under the Project will be 
tailored to the demands and interests of small producers, different age groups, and women.  
 
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower 
capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The Project Coordination Units (PCU)s will be responsible for oversight to ensure safeguards policies are followed, and 



 

The World Bank  
OECS Regional Agriculture Competitiveness Project (P158958) 

 

 

  
Apr 03, 2017 Page 18 of 23  

 

their capacity will be strengthened by sharing of PCU staff dedicated to environmental safeguard resources among 
other World Bank projects.  The Ministries of Agriculture will be responsible for technical project management 
through Project Implementation Units(PIU)s and will coordinate with the PCUs, as well as directing the liaison with 
beneficiaries on the field level with extension officers.  Finally, technical training including best environmental practice 
and business plan preparation will be provided by academic partners, NGOs, and/or consultants who will be 
contracted to support the Program. Safeguards assessments of the PCUs will be completed prior to appraisal to 
determine any needs for further strengthening these functions under the project, either by providing additional staff 
or contracting consultants to efficiently implement the safeguard aspects of the proposed Project. 
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, 
with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
Key stakeholders of the proposed project include: (i) small-scale farmers and fishers (FFs), either individually or 
organized in associations, cooperatives, or similar formal organizations with legal standing, or in the process of 
obtaining legal status, and (ii) aggregators and agro-processors (AAs), such as producer organizations, lead farmers, 
wholesalers, traders, and industrial agro-processors. Equally important, the project will support the participation of 
the rural private sector, including new suppliers. Workshops with key stakeholders were held in the pre-appraisal 
mission (Oct.-Nov. 2016) including the Ministries of Agriculture, the extension officers, other relevant government 
agencies, and potential beneficiaries (agro-processors, coops, and individual farmers). Disclosure of the draft ESMF 
was done by posting on the government website and targeted e-mailings to key stakeholders to solicit feedback.  
 
Comments were addressed and evidence of consultation and disclosure was included in the final ESMF.  If any 
sensitive or complex projects are identified during screening (such as large agro-processing facilities, mariculture or 
seafloor harvesting projects) which would require additional assessment and/or permitting, then the appropriate 
consultations would be done during implementation. A project-level Grievance Redress Mechanism has been 
developed by the Social Specialists at the PCUs to provide a way for project affected people and communities, as well 
as members of the public to lodge complaints and/or request information about the Project. Once subprojects’ sites 
are known, the social specialists will undertake community consultations to provide beneficiaries and stakeholder 
communities with information about the subproject and to elicit feedback on subproject activities and design.

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 
Sierra Leone, a low-income country with a population of 7.1 million people, has made good progress towards political 
stability and economic growth. The country has had three relatively peaceful national elections since the end of the 10 
year civil war in 2002 and recorded average annual growth of 7.8 percent from 2003-2014. Post-war economic growth 
continued to be robust, bolstered by the resumption of iron ore exports, increased inflows of foreign direct investment 
(FDI), and rising government revenues. These developments led to a surge in economic activity, manifested in GDP 
growth of 15.2 percent in 2012 and 13 percent in 2013. In spite of the impressive growth, 2015 GDP per capita was 
US$653.1, well below the Sub-Saharan Africa average of US$1588.5. Poverty levels remain high, even though the 
poverty headcount declined from 66.4 percent in 2003 to 52.9 percent in 2011.

1
 Strong growth in rural areas, where 

poverty declined from 78.7 percent in 2003 to 66.1 percent in 2011, explains much of overall reductions in poverty. 
However, rural poverty level is still higher than urban poverty. While about 62 percent of the working age-population is 
formally or informally employed, there is a dearth of good quality jobs, particularly among urban youth and in rural 
areas.

2
 The lack of sufficient technical and vocational skills needed for the labor market compounds the unemployment 

problem despite the potential offered by a growing workforce that is dominated by young people 
 
Sierra Leone has vast natural resources and the economy is heavily dependent on its land endowments; mineral 
resources including rutile, diamonds, gold, chromite and iron ore; water and tourism. Agriculture including forestry and 
fisheries still accounts for the largest GDP share but that share declined from 57percent in 2012 to 41percent in 2013. 
The mining sector’s contribution to GDP increased substantially from 8.5 percent in 2011 to 16.8 percent in 2012 and 
on to 27.2 percent in 2013 due to the expansion of large-scale iron ore operations. The service sector, led by banking, 
retail, transport and tourism, accounted for 28.8 percent of GDP in 2013, down from 35.5 percent in 2011, while the 
manufacturing sector, dominated by cement and light manufacturing, accounts for only 2percent of GDP.

Sectoral and Institutional Context 
 
The promotion of value addition and private sector-led growth in agriculture are essential elements in achieving its 
vision and goal of the AfP. The National Sustainable Agriculture Development Plan (NSADP) serves as the overarching 
sector strategy with a focus on: (i) Commodity Commercialization, (ii) Agriculture Infrastructure Development, (iii) 
Private Sector Promotion and (iv) Sector Coordination and Management. Through the NSDAP, The Smallholder 
Commercialization Program (SCP) 2010 -2015, helped organize smallholder farmers by establishing Farmer Based 
Organizations (FBOs) and Agribusiness Centers (ABCs), involving about 122,500 farmers, of which 30 percent were 
female-headed households. The ABCs were designed as farmer-owned multi-purpose facilities delivering a broad range 
of services, including micro-credit, sales of inputs and tools, rental of labour-saving equipment, storage of seeds and 
farm products, processing, transport, information on new technologies and markets and group marketing. The 
successor of the SCP, the Inclusive Comprehensive Agricultural Development Program (ICADEP), 2016-2020 focuses on 
private sector-led commercialization and agribusiness development as a basis for inclusive growth. Key tenets of the 
strategy emphasizes reduced government intervention with an emphasis on implementing evidence-based private

sector support policies and projects.  
 
Strengthening economic diversification is a policy priority for achieving strong and sustainable growth and reducing 
poverty in Sierra Leone. Currently, the economy is dominated by mining and agriculture but there is huge potential to 
diversify into other sectors such as fisheries, light manufacturing, and tourism. While mining has dimmed, there are 
bright prospects for agribusiness investments. The Sierra Leone Investment and Export Promotion Agency (SLIEPA), has 
prioritized increased investment inflows in agribusiness as a key objective in its Strategic Plan, 2016 – 2018. This strategy 
aims to attract domestic and foreign direct investments and to develop and diversify exports, particularly in the 
agricultural sector, given the sector’s contribution to GDP and livelihoods. In addition, SLIEPA supports SMEs to enhance 
their competitiveness and participation in trade. Both the investment Promotion and Export Development and 
Promotion Departments have developed strategies and activities that focus on enhancing competitiveness of 
agribusiness, SMEs and other segments in agribusiness value chains that have strong potential for creating jobs and 
income opportunities. 
 
Relationship to CPF 
 
The proposed project is aligned to Pillar 1 of the Bank’s Strategy for Africa, competitiveness and employment and 
consistent with the pillars on diversified economic growth and international competitiveness in GoSL’s Agenda for 
Prosperity, the Third Generation Poverty Reduction Strategy, 2013-2018. The AfP prioritizes agriculture and 
agribusiness as a key sector for promoting economic diversification because of its long term potential for inclusive 
sustainable growth and value addition. In addition, the proposed project is aligned to components 2 and 3 of the 
Inclusive Comprehensive Agricultural Development Project (ICADEP) that focus on commercialization and agribusiness 
development. Project interventions are also consistent with the Private Sector Recovery Priorities relating to creating 
jobs and supporting MSMEs to increase their competitiveness in key agricultural value chains.  
 

The proposed project will directly contribute to the Joint Country Assistance Strategy (JCAS) 2010-2013. Pillar 1 on 
promoting inclusive growth. The 2012 Country Assistance Strategy Progress Report (CASPR) recognized the potential of 
agriculture, agricultural value addition, and supporting services in driving an inclusive growth strategy. 
 
C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  

 

 
 
The project objective is to improve business environment in agribusiness sector and increase productivity of targeted 
agro-processing firms in Sierra Leone. 

 
Key Results (From PCN) 

 

 Lower unit cost of production for local agro-processing firms 
 

 Increased agro processing investment (from existing and new agro-processing firms) 
 

 Improved institutional framework for coordination of agro processing investments

D. Concept Description 
In Sierra Leone, productivity and growth of agro-processing firms is held back by key market failures and constraints, 
characterized by limited knowledge of FDI linkages and market opportunities, coordination externalities, weak supply 
chain linkages, lack of access to finance and technology, policy failures, and skills gap. Consequently, most local and 
foreign-owned agro-processing firms have installed modern plants and utilize state of the art technology but have low 
productivity and operate at less than 30 percent utilization 
 
The proposed project focuses on enhancing domestic value addition in agro-processing through strengthening vertical 
(forward and backward) linkages between local companies and foreign investors. Such linkages provide important 
channels for enhancing competitiveness of the sub-sector through flow of new technology, know-how, innovation, and 
skills. Interventions supporting domestic value addition in agro-processing will involve local and foreign actors that are 
operating in the sub-sector as well as those that provide goods and services to the industry. Project interventions will 
emphasize upgrading of local large enterprises and SMEs, enabling them to be competitive in domestic, regional, and 
international markets.  

 
Project interventions will address key market failures and constraints that limit competitiveness of agro-processing firms 
in domestic and international markets (see annex 1). Modalities for project support will include financing and technical 
assistance for targeted investment promotion and retention and connecting local companies to foreign investors in ways 
that enhance the benefits of agglomeration economies and networking effects

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

The proposed project categorization is B (partial 
assessment). The project will fund agro-processing 
equipment and other value chain enhancement 
activities, the impacts associated with these activities 
are expected to be site-specific and reversible in 
nature. An environmental and Social Management 
Framework (ESMF) will be prepared and disclosed 
prior to appraisal. The ESMF will outline measures for 
screening of sub-projects to determine any further 
environmental assessment that might be required 
during implementation. The ESMF will also provide a 
template for the preparation of an EMP based on the 
screening results of sub-projects. 

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 No 

The project is not expected to impact on any natural 
habitats because the proposed activities will be limited 
to existing agro processing firms. The project is also 
not expected to fund any expansions in agriculture 
production areas. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No Forests will not be impacted by the project 

Pest Management OP 4.09 No 
The project activities do not involve any pest 
management activities. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 No 
It is not expected that any physical cultural resources 
will be impacted. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 No 
The policy is not triggered because there are no 
indigenous people (as per definition) in the project 
area. 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 TBD 

Triggering OP4.12 will be determined during appraisal. 
The project will provide matching grant to support 
domestic value addition in agro-processing. The 
project still needs to clarify whether or not the 
activities funded under the matching grant will lead to 
construction of warehouses, agro-processing units or 
any activities that may require land acquisition.

below the poverty line and 34 percent fall below the extreme poverty line (CPF, 2016). The country is 
also beset with high unemployment rates and a high incidence of HIV/AIDS. This interaction of socio-
economic factors and environmental constraints results in low agricultural productivity with maize 
yields averaging only 800 kg/ha leading to food and nutrition insecurity.

Variations in the Kingdom’s topography and micro-climate shape its ecological zones—the lowlands, 
the foothills, the highlands, and the Senqu (Orange) River Valley. Annual precipitation is highly 
variable, both temporally and spatially, ranging from 500 mm to 760 mm. Temperatures are also 
highly variable, ranging from –10°C to 30°C. Agriculture accounts for less than 10 percent of the 
country’s gross domestic product, but it provides employment for as many as 63 percent of the 
country's population. The crop sector’s contribution to agriculture GDP declined by 17.2% in 2015, 
with the main crops of maize, sorghum, and wheat planted on more than 85 percent of the cultivated 
area.  Livestock contributes 30 percent of total agricultural output, including domestic production of 
pigs and poultry and extensive production of wool and mohair on rangelands in the hill and highland 
areas.
The IPCC categorizes Lesotho as one of the countries highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate 
change. The country has a temperate climate with subalpine characteristics, having four distinct 
seasons, and experiences regular droughts, floods, frosts, snow, hailstorms, and strong winds.  
Frequent droughts result in poor harvests and large livestock losses to rural farmers. Dry spells also 
create food shortages and can lead to an increase in invasive plants and destructive insects. Strong 
winds and floods also pose devastating threats to Lesotho’s agricultural sector; as a result, there are 
large swings in output, with maize yields ranging from a high of more than 1.5 t/ha in 1977 to only 
170 kg/ha in 2011.

The impact of climate change on crop and livestock production systems, and consequently livelihoods, 
may be severe if existing cropping and land use systems remain unchanged.  Lesotho is over-reliant on 
rain-fed agriculture for food production and has a large rural population engaged in undiversified 
subsistence farming. Climate change and increasing climate variability may be reflected in reduced 
crop yields and increased incidence of crop failure. There is also likely to be a decrease in forage 
production and a decline in the carrying capacity of the rangelands, which will have negative impacts 
on livestock production resulting from reduced animal vigor and fertility. As animal condition 
deteriorates, the quality of animal products, especially wool may decline. Furthermore, there may be a 
higher incidence of livestock pests and diseases which will have negative implications for animal 
production.

Less than 1 percent of crop production in Lesotho is under irrigation and almost all subsistence and 
smallholder farming is rain-fed. The development of medium to larger irrigation schemes is expensive 
and may not be suitable due to the demanding topography and geology, and lack of local scheme 
management skills and experience is a serious limitation. The fragile soils also demand very careful 
irrigation management. Thus, while water is available, it is being allocated for other purposes and 
farmers have yet to productively exploit their country’s water resources. Small-scale water harvesting 
schemes are seriously lacking and yet these remain viable adaption options for smallholders in the face 
of expected climate change impacts on water resources.

The commercial farming sector in Lesotho  remains underdeveloped. Full-time commercial farmers 
are still few in number, and specialized agribusiness firms are equally scarce. Lesotho stands in stark 
contrast with neighboring South Africa, where production, processing, and distribution of food is 
carried out by commercial producers and agribusiness firms.

Opportunities continue to exist in Lesotho for developing commercially viable smallholder agriculture. 



Demographic changes, compounded by rising incomes and accelerating urbanization, and improved 
access to South African markets, are fueling changes in consumption patterns that are creating new 
opportunities for agricultural producers and processors. Local and regional demand is projected to 
continue to strengthen in the coming years for fresh fruits and vegetables; for meat and processed 
livestock products (sold through local market stalls, small and medium-scale butcheries, and large-
scale meat wholesalers); for milk and dairy products; and, for processed foods and products (dried 
fruits, processed meat and animal feed).

Continued support to smallholders and close coordination at the national, district and community 
levels is still needed.  Strategies for strengthening smallholder capacity must take into account the 
communities’ stated needs and aspirations and align them with targeted innovations to create resilience 
and sustainability.  However, guidance is needed to help farmers gradually re-orientate their farming 
approaches to produce for markets and to be resilient to the imminent impacts of climate change in 
fragile and highly vulnerable production systems.

Two options for scaling-up the SADP were considered: (i) increase counterpart funding; and (ii) seek 
additional IDA 17 financing. Given fiscal restrictions, the Government of Lesotho is unable to 
increase counterpart funding for the SADP. Therefore, additional IDA 17 financing was identified as 
the most appropriate mechanism to enable expansion of the SADP’s activities to new districts. With 
the AF, the SADP’s objectives, which include increasing marketed output among project beneficiaries 
in Lesotho’s smallholder agriculture sector, can be expanded in more districts in the country, 
contributing to government efforts to develop smallholder agriculture. The proposed scale-up can be 
completed by February 28, 2020 – representing a cumulative implementation period of less than ten 
years. The original closing date is March 31, 2018.

The AF for the Smallholder Agricultural Development Project (SADP II) will continue to support 
smallholder farmers in targeted areas of Lesotho – Botha-Bothe, Leribe, Berea, and Mafeteng, rural 
Maseru, Mohale's Hoek, and Quthing – with the goal of helping them exploit opportunities to increase 
their productivity in a changing climate and diversify into market-oriented agriculture, and to improve 
the enabling environment for agribusiness activities.  Project support will continue to be driven by 
market opportunities and perceived commercial viability of enterprises and products.  These three 
additional border districts with good potential and accessibility to markets, have a rural population of 
almost 500,000 people (about 100,000 households); a cropped area of about 80,000 ha; and ready 
access to Maseru and South African markets due to their location along the border.  The addition of 
these three districts will result in all of the more productive lowlands and foothill areas being included 
in the project.  It is expected that at least an additional 18,000 beneficiaries will benefit from the AF in 
addition to the 55,000 already reached under SADP.

The overall zones of intervention for this project have been identified and prioritized to complement 
current activities supported under the Smallholder Agriculture Development Project (SADP) and to 
consolidate and support the achievements under SADP.  SADP supports smallholder farmers in 
targeted areas of Lesotho, with the goal of helping them exploit opportunities to diversify into market-
oriented agriculture. SADP is driven by market opportunities and perceived commercial viability of 
enterprises. The proposed Additional Financing will focus on continuing to increase the capacity of 
farmers in Lesotho, smallholder and commercial, to build more productive climate resilient 
commercial agricultural systems.

The incremental benefits of this AF are expected to be extensive. For example, by initiating the 
process of discussing food quality and safety standards in Lesotho, the GoL and the international 
community can begin to finance and provide the focused expertise and funds needed to undertake 



actions in setting standards and strengthen capacity to enforce them.

Sectoral and Institutional Context

Rural and agricultural sector. Manufacturing and mining contribute the largest shares to GDP in 
Lesotho, but agriculture remains important as a major provider of employment and source of food.  
About 70-80 percent of Lesotho’s people live in rural areas, and more than three-quarters of these are 
engaged in agriculture – mostly traditional, low input, low output, rain-fed cereal production and 
extensive animal grazing.  In the past, remittances from mineworkers were a major source of rural 
livelihoods, providing vital cash needed to purchase agricultural inputs and productive assets or to 
invest in household assets and housing, but remittances have declined steadily over the past decade as 
the number of Basotho employed in the South African mining sector has declined substantially from 
more than 100,000 20 years ago to less than 30,000 at present. Despite the economic growth that has 
been achieved in recent years, income-generating opportunities remain limited and are generally 
confined to urban areas and wage employment in the industrial sector especially in garment 
production.

Because the urban economy has limited ability to absorb new labor market entrants, the rural economy 
in general and agriculture in particular will continue to play a major role in Lesotho’s development 
strategy for the foreseeable future. Agricultural development faces a number of challenges; however, 
most significant are difficult agro-climatic conditions and limited availability of irrigable arable land. 
The country’s limited production potential is not fully exploited due to poor farming practices, limited 
use of quality seeds, inappropriate crop selection and lack of diversification. Agricultural productivity 
is further undermined by unsustainable land management practices that in many cases have led to 
declining soil fertility and severe soil erosion. If agriculture were commercially viable, these 
constraints could likely be overcome through well-targeted investments, but the development of 
market-oriented crop and livestock production enterprises faces a number of constraints such as 
limited small-scale irrigation, lack of access to finance, and limited supply of produce of the required 
quality.

Institutional Context:
The successful transformation of Lesotho’s smallholder agricultural sector will continue to depend on 
sustained support in the form of technical advisory services, improved technology, and investment 
capital, among other factors. This support has come from three main sources: (i) public service 
providers, (ii) producer organizations, trade associations, and other industry groups; (iii) NGOs and 
donor-funded programs. SADP II will continue to benefit from the current institutional arrangement of 
having the PMU embedded within the main service provider in this sector - MAFS, which has proven 
efficient as an implementation and communication strategy. The Ministry of Forestry, Range and Soil 
Conservation continue to be implementing partners in NRM projects along with the Ministry of Water 
Affairs.  Producer groups such as piggery and poultry associations, as well as wool and mohair 
grower’s associations are also important partners and can prove instrumental in setting standards, 
prices and spreading knowledge towards increasing marketed output; however, much still needs to be 
done for this to be realized.  NGOs and donors provide services in support of agricultural 
development.  Most technological innovations continue to be introduced by both national and 
international NGOs, donor-funded projects and programs, and by private entrepreneurs in some cases.

D. Project Description

The proposed AF offers a well performing vehicle to scale up smallholder agricultural productivity to 
other districts in Lesotho – reinforcing a key component of the CPF pillar on private sector jobs, in 
line with Lesotho’s National Strategic Development Plan.  The AF provides combined multi-faceted 
support in the form of technical advisory services, improved technology, and investment capital that 
are key to meeting the government’s goals in the new districts. The AF will be allocated to expand 
project activities to three additional border districts with good potential and accessibility to markets, 
namely rural Maseru, Mohale's Hoek and Quthing.  The addition of these three districts will result in 
all of the more productive lowlands and foothill areas being included in the project.  It is expected that 
at least an additional 18,000 beneficiaries will benefit from the AF in addition to the 55,000 already 
reached under SADP.

E. Project location and Salient physical characteristics            relevant to the safeguard analysis 
(if known)
The activities to be financed by the Additional Financing include small-scale gravity irrigation 
schemes, small-scale water harvesting structures such as weirs and tanks for households or community 
groups, small-scale investments in livestock operations (such as piggery), cultivation of high value 
crops, wool and mohair production, production of tree seedlings and horticulture, processing and 
storage, rangeland management, climate smart agriculture, gully reclamation and catchment 



conservation. Although a list of potential sub-projects is known, the specific sub-project locations are 
not yet known. The project is designed as demand driven and, therefore, the exact locations will only 
be known at the time when the applications are received by the PMU through the Competitive Grants 
Programme. This will take place during the implementation phase of the project.

The Additional Financing will be scaled up in three (3) additional districts which have been identified 
as suitable for agriculture and have good potential for accessing markets, namely (i) rural Maseru, (ii) 
Mohale's Hoek, and (iii) Quthing located in the southern lowlands agro-ecological zone. ..

Topographically, Lesotho is predominantly mountainous, with the mountain zone covering 
approximately 65% of the total land area. The land is mostly characterized by steep slopes with fragile 
soil formations which are extensively degraded. Only 9% of Lesotho’s land is arable and over 80% of 
this is found in the lowlands, where it is not only used for agriculture, but rather for other purposes 
such as housing. They typically have rich black soils or sandy loams in the valleys where the major 
agricultural activities occur. The southern lowlands, where the new districts are located, are 
characterized by poor soils and low rainfall and cover the western part of the country, occupying about 
2,700 km2 which is 9% of the total surface area. Generally, the lowland soils are the duplex type 
which are prone to erosion, and have poor moisture retention capacity. They are thus liable to rapid 
loss of top soil. The region forms the main livestock grazing area in the country. Although the soils are 
much less susceptible to erosion, inadequate grass cover combined with the steep slopes, and torrential 
rains result in massive erosion in this zone. It will be important to include sub-projects that will control 
runoff and control soil erosion such as sustainable landscape management, gully reclamation, 
catchment management and small-scale infrastructure such as gabions and check dams.

II. IMPLEMENTATION
The AF will benefit from the institutional arrangements established under Parent Project which 
established a Project Management Unit (PMU) However, the capacity of the existing Project 
Management Unit (PMU) to implement, monitor and report on environmental and social 
safeguard issues during the implementation of the Parent Project was inadequate. With the 
guidance of the World Bank, the PMU is currently in the process of recruiting a dedicated 
environmental and social specialist who will oversee the screening of sub-projects to determine 
the level and degree of risk and impacts, ensure that site-specific ESMPs are prepared and 
mitigation measures are implemented, monitored and reported on in the progress reports, and 
which will eventually strengthen the capacity of the PMU. Further safeguard training will be 
provided by the World Bank staff throughout the implementation phase to ensure adequate 
capacity is retained.
.

III. SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY
Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional)

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 
4.01

Yes The Additional Financing to the Lesotho 
Smallholder Agriculture Development 
Program will maintain the Environmental 
Category B classification of the Parent 



Project. Environmental risks and impacts 
inherent to the agriculture and agribusiness 
industry are largely related to effluent 
discharges from use of pesticides/herbicides in 
controlling weed infestation, use of fertilizer 
to increase crop productivity, pollution of soil 
and water resources from runoff, occupational 
health and safety of workers, efficient use of 
water and energy resources, and solid waste 
disposal. The review of the ESMF of the 
Parent Project indicates that the instrument is 
adequate for the Additional Financing in terms 
of identifying potential environmental impacts 
that will likely occur from implementing the 
project activities, the proposed measures to 
mitigate the impacts and monitor the 
implementation, the pest management 
approaches to be used to ensure sustainable 
use of fertilizers and pesticides, and 
community health and safety issues. The 
ESMF also contains adequate and very clear 
screening procedures and methodologies to 
guide the PIU in the screening, assessment, 
review, approval, implementation and 
reporting of environmental issues for the sub-
projects.

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 No The project will not support sub-projects that 
have the potential to adversely alter or impact 
natural or critical habitats as defined under OP 
4.04. Therefore, the policy is not triggered.

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No The project will not support sub-projects 
located within forested areas or plantations as 
defined under OP 4.36. Therefore, the policy 
is not triggered.

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes The Pest Management Policy is triggered to 
allow for the use of agrochemicals, as needed, 
using licensed professions and in a manner 
described in the Integrated Pest Management 
Plan (IPMP). The initial screening of the 
potential sub-projects to be funded under the 
AF, indicates that the risk of pesticides use is 
minor to moderate due to the small amounts of 
pesticides currently being used in the sub-
projects of the Parent Project. The ESMF 
prepared for the Parent Project, incorporates 
an Integrated Pest Management Plan (IPMP) 
which provides guidance on the sustainable 
application of fertilizers and pesticides taking 
into consideration the soil type and slope to 



ensure protection of watershed and 
groundwater. The use or purchase of 
significant amounts of pesticides will be 
excluded in the screening process described in 
the ESMF.

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 
4.11

No The AF will not support physical cultural 
resources but in some of the districts that the 
project will be implemented, artifacts from 
historical cultural resources have been found. 
The ESMF of the Parent Project have included 
Physical Cultural Resources Chance Find 
procedures for handling chance finds that 
might occur during the implementation of the 
sub-projects.

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 No OP 4.10 is not triggered as there are no 
indigenous people within the project area of 
influence.

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes It is not anticipated that there will be any land 
acquisitions as a direct result of the project. 
However, communities are expected to 
continue to pool their land or provide 
voluntary land donations of communal land. 
This potentially impact livelihood through 
affecting access, for example for grazing and 
water. The existing RPF will be applied to 
screen and guide implementation.

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 No OP 4.37 is not triggered as the project will not 
finance construction or rehabilitation of dams, 
nor will it rely on the performance of an 
existing dam or a dam under construction, as 
defined in the policy.

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50

No The project is not expected to affect 
international waterways and, therefore, OP 
7.50 is not triggered.

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 
7.60

No The project will not finance any activities 
located in any known areas under territorial 
dispute as defined in OP 7.60. Therefore, the 
policy is not triggered.

.

IV. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and 
describe any potential large scale,  significant and/or irreversible impacts:

The activities to be financed by the Additional Financing include small-scale gravity irrigation 
schemes, small-scale water harvesting structures such as weirs and tanks for households or 
community groups, small-scale investments in livestock operations (such as piggery), 



cultivation of high value crops, wool and mohair production, production of tree seedlings and 
horticulture, processing and storage, rangeland management, climate smart agriculture, gully 
reclamation and catchment conservation. The sub-projects are similar to those that are already 
being financed under the Parent Project, and therefore the AF will maintain the Environmental 
Category B classification of the Parent Project. Environmental risks and impacts inherent to 
the agriculture and agribusiness industry are largely related to effluent discharges from use of 
pesticides/herbicides in controlling weed infestation, use of fertilizer to increase crop 
productivity, pollution of soil and water resources from runoff, occupational health and safety 
of workers, efficient use of water and energy resources, and solid waste disposal. The 
anticipated risks and impacts are expected to be small-scale in nature and scope, limited to the 
project sites and can be addressed with known mitigation measures. Overall, there are no large 
scale, significant or irreversible impacts that have been identified.

The PMU will use the ESMF of the Parent Project – which describes the screening, 
reviewing, implementing and monitoring procedures – to assess the risks and impacts and 
prepare the appropriate mitigation measures during the implementation phase.  Review of the 
ESMF of the Parent Project indicates that the instrument is adequate for the Additional 
Financing in terms of identifying potential environmental impacts that will likely occur from 
implementing the project activities, the proposed measures to mitigate the impacts and 
monitor the implementation, the pest management approaches to be used to ensure sustainable 
use of fertilizers and pesticides, and community health and safety issues. The ESMF also 
contains adequate and very clear screening procedures and methodologies to guide the PIU in 
the screening, assessment, review, approval, implementation and reporting of environmental 
issues for the sub-projects.

Review of the environmental performance of the Parent Project:

The team has been continuously reviewing the environmental performance the Parent Project 
through regular missions to the sub-project sites, and the overall environmental performance 
of the Parent Project is moderately unsatisfactory. Some of the issues identified under the 
parent project relate to, for example, improper handling of solid and liquid waste, insufficient 
monitoring of water access, improper handling of agrochemicals. A detailed time bound 
action plan has been agreed with the Borrower to remedy any environmental issues and avoid 
them reoccurring in the future

Climate Vulnerability
There is a need for climate vulnerability to be considered particularly during the siting of 
subprojects.  One poultry subproject is located on a mountainside exposed to severe wind and 
cold, and consequently many of the chickens died. Recently, a number of horticulture tunnels 
were damaged due to strong winds, hail and rain, and although these conditions were 
reportedly a one-off event, tunnels that were located in less sheltered terrain were more 
severely damaged than those that were somewhat sheltered.   The siting of subprojects taking 
into account climatic factors is therefore important in ensuring sustainability of the 
investments.
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in 
the project area:



The sub-projects to be supported under the AF will not generate indirect and/or long term 
impacts in the sub-project areas. It is, however, anticipated that some of the sub-projects that 
entail landscape restoration and management, will result into long term positive and beneficial 
impacts.
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse 
impacts.

In accordance with the RPF, voluntary land contributions will only be permitted where the 
land is communal land. If private use the communal land contributed under the project exists, 
then the private users must either benefit directly from project activities or be provided 
suitable alternatives. Such arrangements must be fully documented and are subject to 
informed consent procedures.
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.

The Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) prepared for the Parent 
Project by the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security will serve as the key environmental 
safeguard instrument for the project. Review of the ESMF by the project team indicate that 
the instrument is adequate for the Additional Financing in terms of identifying potential 
environmental impacts that will likely occur from implementing the project activities, the 
proposed measures to mitigate the impacts and monitor the implementation, the pest 
management approaches to be used to ensure sustainable use of fertilizers and pesticides, and 
community health and safety issues. The ESMF also contains adequate and very clear 
screening procedures and methodologies to guide the PIU in the screening, assessment, 
review, approval, implementation and reporting of environmental issues for the sub-projects

With the guidance of the World Bank, the PMU is currently in the process of recruiting a 
dedicated environmental and social specialist who will oversee the screening of sub-projects 
to determine the level and degree of risk and impacts, site-specific ESMPs are prepared and 
mitigation measures are implemented, monitored and reported on in the progress reports, and 
which will eventually strengthen the capacity of the PMU. Further safeguard training will be 
provided by the World Bank staff throughout the implementation phase to ensure adequate 
capacity is retained. The first task to be carried out by the PMU environmental specialist will 
be to undertake an environmental audit for all ongoing sub-projects to assess the extent to 
which the World Bank Safeguard Polices are complied with and make recommendations on 
how environmental risks and impacts will be mitigated.

All other institutions that will be involved in implementing the AF have previously 
implemented World Bank funded projects or are currently involved in implementation of 
other World Bank programs. As such they are familiar with World Bank safeguard policies 
and have gained experience in the implementation and oversight of Bank projects.
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on 
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.

The safeguards documents (ESMF and RPF) were subject to discussions with various groups 
of stakeholders at district and national level, including relevant government agencies, national 
and international NGOs, and farmer associations during appraisal of the original project in 



2011. In addition, beneficiary farmers and communities will receive appropriate training, as 
they will participate in screening, verification and mitigation measures (as relevant).

Country Context
The Kingdom of Lesotho is a small, landlocked, lower-middle-income country with a per capita 
GNI of US$1,350. Lesotho is one of the poorest countries in Southern Africa, and has one of the 
highest income inequality in the world. Home to about 2 million people, Lesotho is surrounded by 
South Africa, the second largest and most industrialized economy in Africa. Lesotho generates 
income mainly by exporting textiles, water, and diamonds, and is a member of the Southern 
African Customs Union (SACU), the Southern African Development Community (SADC), and 
the Common Monetary Area (CMA). The national currency➢❨  the loti➢❨ is pegged to the South 
African rand. Lesotho➢❨ s main trading partners are South Africa and the United States. 
 
Several factors are concerning for Lesotho➢❨ s fiscal and economic outlook: in the short term, a 
projected sharp decline in SACU revenues and higher food prices caused by drought; in the 
medium term, insecurity in textile manufacturing given uncertainty of continued renewal of the 
African Growth and Opportunity Act, and risks caused by the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Lesotho 
now faces large fiscal and current account deficits, which will require substantial fiscal 
adjustment to restore macroeconomic stability and avert erosion of the exchange rate peg to the 
South African rand.  
 
The signs of fragility are exacerbated by other vulnerabilities, such as political instability, climatic 
vulnerability, including El NiÃ±o, and high rates of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis (TB), and maternal 
and infant mortality. The 2015/16 El NiÃ±o induced drought prompted authorities to declare a 
state of emergency in December 2015, with a high share of the rural population now expected to 
be food insecure through the March 2017 harvest. For Lesotho➢❨ s small and highly dependent 
subsistence farming economy, El NiÃ±o related stress factors risks further depressing household 
incomes, which had already dropped due to declining migrant remittances from South Africa➢❨ s 
mining sector. Lesotho➢❨ s poor historical record in addressing climatic vulnerabilities adds to 
the capacity risks. The burden of disease is disproportionately higher among HIV/AIDS affected 
households.
Sectoral and institutional Context
Several factors hinder Lesotho➢❨ s private-sector growth, affecting both Foreign Direct 
Investment (FDI) and the growth of the local micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). The 
Trans-Pacific partnership could cause FDI in textile manufacturing to fall over the medium term. 
All quantitative measures ➢❨  including the Global Trade Reports, Doing Business Indicators, 
and Enterprise Surveys ➢❨  suggest that business regulations seriously constrain growth. Despite 
making progress in streamlining business and property registration and in establishing and 
operating a credit bureau, Lesotho ranks low on key Doing Business Indicators ➢❨  such as 
dealing with construction permits, accessing finance, and the cost of capital. These are constraints 
on domestic entrepreneurship, suggesting that the domestic private sector remains dependent on 
the state and non-tradable sectors. Over the last two decades, Lesotho shifted its growth drivers 
from export-led development towards dependency on government spending. 
 
Increased public spending has further crowded out private sector investment. Limited job 
opportunities in the private sector have exacerbated poverty and inequality and led to a situation 
in which the public sector has become a de facto social safety by absorbing employment which 
has led to a bloated public sector and oversized public spending. This has led to a vicious cycle 
that simultaneously crowds out investment in the country.

C.  Proposed Development Objective(s)

Original Project Development Objective(s) - Parent
The development objective of the proposed project is to contribute to the development of selected 
non-textile sectors resulting in increased private sector investment, firm growth and job creation.

Proposed Project Development Objective(s) - Additional Financing
To improve the business environment for firms, strengthen select government institutions, and 
further diversify the economy.

Key Results 
The Additional Financing (AF) would seek to ensure that: (i) legislation supported by the Project 
is passed and implemented, (ii) automated systems supported by the Project are widely used, (iii) 
institutional changes supported by the Project are completed and institutional entities are fully 
operational, and (iv) deciduous fruit production, piloted by the Project, is supported by an 
enabling environment that facilitates investment in the sector. A new activity would include 
support for issues of trade facilitation and logistics given their cross-cutting importance to the 
economy.

D.  Project Description

The AF will provide additional support to the three original components, as well as support a new 
subcomponent on trade facilitation and logistics. Activities have been chosen for the following 
reasons: (i) those which can be completed during the time available for implementation of the AF; 
(ii) those with overall positive results during the current project; (iii) those where implementation 
needs to continue in order for benefits for firms to be realized and sustained; (iv) those with 
significant stakeholder buy-in and clear alignment with the country➢❨ s economic needs and 
policies, including the Vision 2020 and the NSDP for 2012➢❨ 2017; and (v) those 
complementary with other private sector development projects.  
 
Component 1: 
 
Project activities under this component will continue to support efforts to reduce the time and cost 
associated with doing business, and increase access to finance. Subcomponent 1A would be 
divided into two subcomponents, in order to properly reflect anticipated results against Doing 
Business indicators. A new subcomponent on trade facilitation and logistics aims to make trading 
across borders faster and cheaper for firms. 
 
In Subcomponent 1A, support would continue under the AF for the enactment of the business 
registration and licensing bill, and the implementation of automated business licensing and e-
payment gateway services at the One Stop Business Facilitation Centre (OBFC). The AF would 
additionally support: 
 
(i) Strengthening of the OBFC, which would include developing OBFC➢❨ s legal framework; 
integrating the Business Registration system with LRA➢❨ s system to issue tax identifier 
numbers; supporting OBFC management; designing and implementing a capacity building 
program; completing necessary technology upgrades; developing and deploying a reform 
communication strategy; and creating public access sites in various districts for OBFC and other 



Page 4 of 12

government-to-business services. 
 
(ii) Improving business inspections reform, through a careful review of the legal and regulatory 
framework, the training of inspectors, and the development of a business inspections policy and 
associated manuals, risk-assessment tools, and training modules for its implementation. 
 
In Subcomponent 1B (formerly part of 1A) support would continue for the automation of the 
construction permit system. The AF would additionally support the implementation of an e-
payment system, and system support and maintenance for two years.  
 
In Subcomponent 1C (formerly 1B), support would continue under the AF for access to finance 
activities. 
With regards to the establishment of the credit information bureau (CIB), the AF would 
additionally support: 
 
(i) Expanding CIB coverage to include businesses, which would require legal reforms since the 
current law only allows for collection of consumer (individual) data. 
  
(ii) Training to enable credit providers associations and microfinance institutions to upgrade 
systems and processes and use various new credit information tools being developed by the 
project. 
With regards to the establishment of a movable assets collateral registry, the AF would 
additionally support: (i) extensive campaigns to raise public awareness; (ii) development of a 
mobile application; (iii) development and implementation of a capacity building program for 
credit providers; (iv) continuous alignment and harmonization of associated laws. 
 
With regards to the establishment of a leasing industry, the AF would support technical assistance 
on financial leasing for credit providers.  
 
With regards to insolvency reform, the AF would additionally support: (i) extensive campaigns to 
raise public awareness; (ii) intensive training to prepare for the implementation of the new Bill, 
focused on the Office of the Master of the High Court, the judiciary, and insolvency practitioners; 
and (iii) the design and implementation of ICT systems to ensure efficiency in insolvency 
proceedings and for the Master of the High Court. 
 
Finally, in order to ensure the sustainability of ongoing reforms and to entrench capacity within 
Lesotho to generate further reforms as needed, an institutional assessment of the Office of 
Parliamentary Counsel (OPC) will be undertaken under the AF in the areas of technology, skills, 
and human resources, and a training and capacity building plan will be developed and deployed. 
 
Subcomponent 1D would be new, and it would support two trade facilitation and logistics 
activities. Importantly, the majority of the related technical assistance and training would be 
funded by the LICP. 
 
(i) Support for Customs operations. This would cover the upgrading of ASYCUDAWorld, 
including additional modules, and the provision of redundancy for the system: a disaster recovery 
site to secure and sustain the customs operation, a back-up server, a stand by generator and other 
equipment as required. 



Page 5 of 12

 
(ii) Support for preparing and developing a single window that would connect selected 
government agencies involved in trade. This would enable Lesotho to move towards a paperless 
environment for import/export related procedures and processes.  
 
This component would finance technical assistance, training, goods, works, and equipment. 
Indicatively, Subcomponent 1A would be US$ 1.3M, Subcomponent 1B (formerly part of 1A) 
would be US$ 0.03M, Subcomponent 1C (formerly 1B) would be US$ 1.7M, and Subcomponent 
1D would be US$ 2.3M. 
 
Component 2: 
 
This component will continue to support economic diversification activities. 
 
In Subcomponent 2A, support would continue under the AF for investment promotion and 
fostering increased linkages to the local economy. The AF would additionally support: (i) the 
reorganization of the LNDC, including implementation support for the resulting entity(ies); (ii) 
the development of a Private Sector Development Strategy; and (iii) the scaling up of a linkages 
program currently being piloted, including capacity building in the government to sustain the 
program.   
 
Subcomponent 2B will continue supporting the tourism sector, albeit in a different capacity given 
the complementarity with the AFDB project. Under the AF, support would be provided for: (i) the 
construction and management of the Tourism & Handicraft Information Center, which would 
provide information to tourists, offer retail space for fashion accessories and home decor 
products, and offer leisure and entertainment; and (ii) the development and implementation of a 
business plan for the handicrafts sector.  
Subcomponent 2C will continue supporting commercial horticulture by building out the value 
chain for fresh fruit produce and leveraging the private sector to scale-up production. The AF 
would additionally support:  
  
(i) Support for the existing commercial horticulture plots in order to render them commercially 
sustainable. 
 This includes upgrading the irrigation system; and developing and implementing a marketing and 
distribution strategy; among others.  
 
(ii) Development of a research and training center, to conduct applied research, including variety 
testing, and yield and performance monitoring, and to provide training on good farm practices, 
retail standards, and business skills to farmers in Lesotho. If adequately funded and governed, the 
research and training Center could take over many horticulture- related activities, currently 
managed by the PMU, when the Project ends. 
 
(iii) Development and implementation of a capacity building program for quality and standards, 
directed at farmers, trainers, auditors and GoL Officials.  
 
(iv) Integrate horticulture suitability maps with the master irrigation plans that are being 
developed for Lesotho.  
 



Page 6 of 12

(v) Support for financial institutions, to strengthen their capacity to effectively assess business 
plans, conduct due diligence, and gauge risks in the fresh fruit sector. After the initial assessment, 
support could be provided through LEAP. 
 
(vi) Support for a targeted investor attraction program, that clarifies at which levels of the value 
chain investors may seek to engage or invest, what the GoL expects from investors, and what 
potential investors can expect in return. This would include support for road shows in selected 
target markets, including South Africa and Kenya, among others. 
 
(vii) Support for agri-logistics, including a feasibility study for a packhouse, among others. LICP 
is embarking on an in-depth agri-logistics survey to identify technical and regulatory constraints 
from the field to domestic and international retailers, with a special emphasis on cross-border 
logistics and cold chains (storage and transport). The AF would consider supporting some of the 
recommendations, subject to financing availability. 
 
Subcomponent 2D will continue to support the management of the Lesotho Enterprise Assistance 
Program (LEAP) Program. A review of the systems and processes of LEAP will be carried out 
under the current project such that under the AF, the scope of the LEAP matching grants program 
can be expanded to include machinery and equipment. 
 
This component would primarily finance technical assistance, training, goods and works. 
Indicatively, Subcomponent 2A would be US$ 1.4M, Subcomponent 2B would be US$ 1.7M, 
Subcomponent 2C would be US$ 2.4M, and Subcomponent 2D would be US$ 0.5M. 
  
Component 3: 
 
This component will continue supporting the costs of the Project Management Unit, including the 
Monitoring and Evaluation system, and the management and implementation of the Environment 
and Social Management Plans (ESMP). To accommodate the larger scope of the PSCED-II 
Project under the AF, it is proposed that the PMU hire a Horticulture Coordinator, an Investment 
Climate / Business Environment officer, and a Communications Specialist. While the first of 
these is contemplated under the current project but has never been filled, the latter two positions 
would be new. A review of salaries is proposed to ensure PMU staff are paid competitively and 
according to their experience and performance.

II. Implementation
Institutional and Implementation Arrangements
Reflecting the multi-sector nature of the project, implementation arrangements are intended to offer a 
balance between the effective overall supervision and monitoring of the activities at the project level, 
as well as reinforcing the management and institutional responsibilities of individual sub-
components.  
 
Project Steering Committee (PSC): The PSC consists of members representing the agencies 
responsible for the project implementation i.e. the principal secretaries from the MTICM, MTEC, 
MAFS, MFLR, MoF, MDP, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank, Town Clerk of the MCC, the 
Parliamentary Counsel, Master of High Court and the CEOs from LNDC and LTDC. The committee 
meets every semester to monitor the implementation progress of the project and help to resolve 
technical and implementation problems affecting project progress. Meetings are chaired by the 
Principal Secretary of MTICM. 
 
Project Management Unit (PMU): The day-to-day operations of the project are overseen by a Project 
Management Unit that is headed by a qualified Project Manager. In addition, the PMU includes a 
Financial Manager and a Procurement Manager who oversee the Financial Management and 
Procurement issues respectively. The PMU provides for overall fiduciary management, monitoring 
and evaluation, project oversight, and coordination. The role and functions of the PMU have been 
detailed in the Project Implementation Manual (PIM). The Project Manager is responsible for: (i) 
overall day-today management of the project, including coordination of procurement, financial 
management and M&E; (ii) coordination with all the implementing agencies responsible for the 
implementation of the various sub-components; and (iii) coordination with other donors and relevant 
programs/projects. The Project Manager reports to the Project Steering Committee chaired by the 
Principal Secretary, MTICM. The project covers the operating costs of the PMU, necessary 
equipment purchase, training of staff and the costs of annual audits of project accounts.

III. Safeguard Policies that might apply

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional)



Page 8 of 12

Environmental Assessment 
OP/BP 4.01

Yes The Additional Financing to the Second Private 
Sector Competitiveness & Economic Diversification 
Project will maintain the Category B classification of 
the original loan. The environmental impacts of the 
AF are expected to derive mainly from the 
horticulture activities and the small-scale 
construction works related to the Tourism Handicraft 
Center which were assessed in the original loan. 
Potential minor to moderate adverse impacts are 
being managed and monitored through Global GAP 
certification for the horticulture sub-component, and 
through the provisions of the Environmental and 
Social Management Framework (ESMF) prepared 
for the horticulture sub-component and the 
Environmental and Social Management Plan 
(ESMP). Both instruments where prepared in 
anticipation that the project will scale up horticulture 
production in Lesotho, and was therefore designed 
for the Government of Lesotho to use post PSCED-II 
Project. Given the nature and scale of the project, the 
environmental impacts are expected to be generally 
limited to the sites and can be addressed with known 
mitigation measures included in the ESMF 
 
Environmental safeguard implementation 
arrangements will follow the arrangements that are 
already in place for the parent project. Activities to 
be carried out under the proposed Additional 
Financing (establishment of nurseries and a research 
center) are derived from continuity of the current 
project, and therefore the Additional Financing will 
not trigger additional safeguards policy.

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 No The project will not support activities that will affect 
natural or critical habitats.

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No The projects will not support activities located within 
forested areas or plantations as defined under OP 
4.36.

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes While the total land under the project is not 
substantial (only 30-35 hectares) and the risk of 
pesticides is minor to moderate due to the small 
amounts of pesticides being used, the ESMF 
incorporates an integrated pest management plan 
(IPMP). The application of fertilizers and pesticides 
will consider soil type and slope to ensure protection 
of watershed and groundwater. Application of 
pesticides and fertilizers will follow sustainable 



Page 9 of 12

approaches described in the Integrated Pest 
Management Plan (IPMP) for the parent project and 
monitored under the Global Gap framework. The 
subscription to Global Gap ensures that the project is 
compliant with international norms in the use and 
handling of agrochemicals. The horticulture 
coordinator will monitor erosion, water quality and 
soil nutrition, but with the 
Global Gap the project has enhanced inspection with 
an independent monitoring regime.

Physical Cultural Resources 
OP/BP 4.11

No While the project will finance minor construction 
works related to the Tourism Handicraft Center that 
will provide information on tourism sites, including 
physical cultural resources, the AF will not have 
direct impacts on physical cultural resources.

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 
4.10

No There are no Indigenous Peoples identified in the 
project areas.

Involuntary Resettlement OP/
BP 4.12

No The Tourism Information & Handicraft Center will 
be built on land on which there are no encroachers or 
squatters. A shortlist of potential sites has been 
developed for the tourism center and all shortlisted 
sites are held by public entities. Activities under the 
project will avoid any potential involuntary 
resettlement impacts and will ensure that if land 
acquisition is necessary, it will be carried out in a 
fully voluntary nature. Given that risk of involuntary 
resettlement impacts is low, the ESMP will include 
land acquisition screening criteria in order to ensure 
that involuntary resettlement impacts are avoided.

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 No The project will not finance construction or 
rehabilitation of dams, nor will it rely on the 
performance of an existing dam or a dam under 
construction, as defined in the policy.

Projects on International 
Waterways OP/BP 7.50

No The project will not affect international waterways.

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/
BP 7.60

No The project will not finance any activities located in 
any known areas under territorial dispute as defined 
in OP 7.60.

IV. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify 

and describe any potential large scale,  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
There are no large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts anticipated from the project since 
the project will mainly be providing technical assistance to the GoL in Maseru, and only sub-
components 2B and 2C will support the tourism sector and horticulture, respectively. Potential 



Page 10 of 12

minor to moderate potential adverse impacts are being managed through Global GAP certification 
for the horticulture subcomponent, and through the provisions of the ESMP and ESMF prepared 
for the sub-components, respectively.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities 
in the project area:
There are no potential indirect and/or long term impacts envisaged in the project area.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse 
impacts.
N/A

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
The AF will benefit from the institutional arrangements established under PSCED II Project. In 
anticipation of potential adverse impacts that could arise from construction of the Tourism 
Handicraft Centre, an ESMP has been prepared, and for implementation of the horticulture 
subcomponent, an ESMF has been prepared.  
 
All institutions that will be involved have implemented bank projects previously or are currently 
involved in implementation of other programs. As such they are familiar with World Bank 
safeguards and have gained experience in the implementation and oversight of Bank projects.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure 
on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The key stakeholders include: (i) the Ministry of Trade and Industry, which provides guidance to 
the PMU; (ii) The Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security, which provides support to the 
Ministry of Trade and Industry; (iii) The Ministry of Forestry, which provides guidance to the 
project on matters related to technical on-farm activities; (iv) The Project Steering Committee, 
which consists of the principal secretaries from the MTICM, MTEC, MAFS, MFLS, the Central 
Bank, Registrar General and CEOs from LNDC and LTDC; (v) The National Environmental 
Secretariat (NES), the environmental agency responsible for reviewing and clearing all safeguards 
documentation for the project; (vi) operators in the handicraft sector in Lesotho who were 
consulted during the preparation of the ESMP for the Tourism Handicraft Center to be constructed 
in Maseru; (vii) the current participating farmers in the horticulture industry who have been 
consulted during the preparation of PSCEDP II as well as ESMF preparation; and (viii) the 
Lesotho Revenue Authority (LRA), which will be the beneficiary of activities relating to the 
Project's new trade facilitation & logistics subcomponent.

Other Decision (as needed) 
 
 
B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 
 
Baseline and business as usual 
 

1. Haiti is a densely populated island state, the third largest nation by area and population (10.4 
million) in the Caribbean and benefits from a rich economic endowment. Assets include proximity 
and access to major markets, a young labor force, a dynamic diaspora, and substantial geographic, 
historical, and cultural assets. The country possesses untapped markets and unmet demand for the 
private sector to explore, including agribusiness, light manufacturing, and tourism. Yet Haiti remains 
the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere and one of the poorest countries in the world, with 
a GDP per capita of US$820. Almost 60 percent of the population lives below the national poverty 
line with marked differences between urban and rural areas

1
, inequality is high, with wealth and 

economic opportunity concentrated around Port-au-Prince. Access to basic services is limited, 
particularly in rural areas, which has translated into low human development indicators (Haiti ranks 
168th out of 187 countries in the Human Development Index). 

 
2. Agriculture continues to play a dominant role in the Haitian economy, contributing over 20 

percent of GDP and most rural Haitians rely on agricultural production as their primary livelihood 
strategy. The agriculture sector also accounts for around 50 percent of overall employment, 66 
percent of employment in rural areas, and 75 percent of employment in low income households. 
Agriculture is the sole economic activity for 55 percent of the rural households, and involves more 

                                                           
1
 75% fall below poverty line in rural areas compared to 40% in urban areas 



 

The World Bank  
Resilient Productive Landscapes in Haiti (P162908)

than 70 percent of them. This production is critical for food security
2
, in a context where more than 

half of the population is affected by undernutrition (2016, FAO); around a third of the production is 
being used for subsistence

3
, while the rest of productions is sold generating much needed income. 

 
3. Climate change is significantly impacting agriculture and will increasingly do so in the future. 

Climate change is projected to manifest itself in Haiti the following ways:  a) increases in 

temperatures: it is likely that temperatures will increase by 0.8-1°C by the year 2030 and by 1.5-

1.7°C by the year 2060, with the highest increases expected in the months of June or July; b) 
decreases in precipitation: precipitation is expected to decrease by 5.9-20 percent by 2030 and by 
10.6-35.8 percent by 2060, with the greatest decreases also expected in the months of June or July

4
. 

This will affect agriculture in general, and subsistence agriculture in particular, which is primarily 
rain-fed and therefore highly vulnerable to rainfall patterns. A combination of increasing 
temperatures and decreasing precipitation, especially in June and July, is likely to impose 
particularly severe stresses on agricultural systems, especially given the highly-degraded nature of 
soils and vegetation in the target sub-watersheds.  

 
4. Haiti’s population and territory are extremely vulnerable to natural disasters and exposure is 

expected to increase as climate change impact intensifies. Haiti has the highest index of 
vulnerability to hurricanes (12,9 on a scale of 13) among small Low Income Countries (LIC) Island 
States and is the third country hardest hit by climatic events in the world

5
. Ninety-six (96) percent of 

the population is considered at risk. Climate change predictions for 2050 and beyond suggest that 
more than 50 percent of the total area of Haiti will be in danger of desertification largely due to 
climate variability and change. Extreme weather events, according to the Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change (IPCC)

6
, indicate that the Caribbean region is likely to be exposed in the future to 

more intense and frequent extreme weather events. On average, each disaster costs two percent of 
GDP per year, and occasionally much more (in 2008, tropical storms’ economic impact reached 15 
percent of GDP), and significantly affects the agriculture sector

7
. The country is highly mountainous 

with more than half of Haiti’s territory having slopes over 20 degrees, that centuries of 
deforestation have rendered particularly vulnerable to climatic events. Exposed agricultural fields 
which are now commonly exploited on slopes

8
 further exacerbates the issues. Deforestation, and 

inappropriate agricultural practices have produced predictable interlinked environmental and social 
consequences: the loss of topsoil, decreasing soil fertility, rain water run-off and depletion of 
aquifers, droughts, agricultural productive capacity decline, farmers’ losses of incomes and rural 
out-migration. In a context of climate change, extreme weather events and their average intensity 
and frequency are expected to increase, and will further accelerate land and population 

                                                           
2
 Undernutrition concerns more than half of the population (FAO)  

3
 Traditionally, rural Haitians take advantage of seasonal, nutrient rich productions, to complement their diet (fruits, vegetables, 

legumes, small livestock), yet this diversity is at risk due to the deterioration of natural resources that decreases the availability 
of many of these sources of supplementation.

tropical storms/hurricanes.

 https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg2/   

7
 In the case of tropical storms, almost 50 % of damages and losses in productive sectors have been concentrated in the 

agriculture sector (PDNA, Feb 2017)  
8
 63% of agricultural land is on more than 20 degrees’ slopes, and 40% of cultivated land in mountains is on slope of more than 

50 degrees.

 : identified climate related hazards in Haiti include flash flooding, salt water 

intrusion, drought, intense rainfall, landslides, severe soil erosion, and hurricanes
10

.  
 

5. Addressing intertwined human and ecological vulnerabilities requires a holistic landscape-level 
“productive” approach. The above-mentioned context provides a rationale for integrating a 
landscape approach within watersheds (or sub-watershed) in Haiti to address major soil erosion and 
water retention capacity, prioritizing interventions helping to reduce downstream impacts. 
Improving the natural resource base through the promotion of climate-smart productions and 
practices best adapted to the agro-ecological context

11
, and, as importantly, the capacity to 

generate sustainable incomes out of these, is expected to have a significant positive impact on 
agriculture and the many people who derive their livelihoods and income from, together with the 
provision of nutritious food, and jobs. It will also contribute to protect in a sustainable way 
communities at large against the risks of flash flooding and landslides linked to soil erosion and 
water runoff.  

 
Sectoral and Institutional Context 

 
6. Agriculture in Haiti is beset with problems, despite its importance in local food security and 

contribution to GDP. Production is highly dependent on rainfall, with around five percent of farmers 
using irrigation. Most farmers have poor access to tools, machinery, and purchased inputs including 
improved seeds and fertilizer. Access to credit in rural areas is not a viable option either for poor 
farmers. In addition, there is little organization among producers and underdeveloped value chains, 
further compounded by a lack of rural infrastructure to access markets e.g. rural roads for 
connectivity with buyers, water storage and irrigation for production in dryer seasons and mitigation 
of drought impacts, food dryers and storage for reduction of vulnerability to prices volatility, 
reduction of post-harvest losses, , improved quality for better marketability as well as accessibility of 
nutritious food all year long. The lack of value addition along value chains, reliability and 
sustainability of sources of incomes for farmers generated from tree-crops and other types of 
resilient agricultural productions constitutes a major impediment to the maintenance and 
sustainable expansion of such systems. This also drives their choices towards higher demanded/less 
perishable productions, often at the expense of the environment (e.g. peanuts production on 
slopes, trees cutting for land expansion and/or cash generation with fire wood or charcoal 
production and sales), contributing to the vicious circle of land degradation and increasing 
population vulnerability. In addition, women play a major role in the post-harvest marketing of 
products in Haiti, and the improvement of these value chains is a critical factor for women’s 
economic empowerment, livelihoods and resilience, which offers opportunities for vulnerable 
population- such as women and youth- to increase rural income and jobs diversification.   
 

7. In a country that is already densely populated, steady population growth and land inheritance

 Based on available projections, major climatic changes expected to occur in Haiti include a reduction in rainfall of 6 to 20 

percent by 2030 and 11 to 36 percent by 2060. While annual precipitation is projected to decrease, the more limited rainfall 
events are expected to become more intense. Temperatures are also expected to increase by 0.8°C to 1.0°C by 2030, and by 
1.5°C to 1.7°C by 2060.

 These would seek to improve the stability and quality of the soil substrate through measures such as agroforestry, live fences, 
hedgerows intercropping, vegetative wind breaks, soil vegetative cover, conservation tillage, among others.

 continues to put pressure on land, and drives land use changes. Haiti has 961 inhabitants 
per square kilometer of arable land, the highest pressure density on arable land in the Western 
Hemisphere. Farm sizes have shrunk dramatically over time: 85 percent of farms now have less than 
1 hectare. The main food crops produced are rice (in lowlands), maize, bananas, yams, cassava, 
beans, and millet, and main export crops include coffee and mangoes. Diversification has commonly 
been practiced by farmers as a risk-mitigation strategy (70 percent of farmers produce more than 4 
crops and 75 percent raise some livestock) but is becoming harder to implement in increasingly 
smaller plots. In addition, the traditional practice of creole garden (or “jardin creole”

13
) 

corresponding to small but highly diversified agro-forestry systems, providing fresh and nutritious 
food throughout most of the year among other benefits (high biodiversity, higher productivity linked 
to species associations, soil protection and quality), have tended to decrease to give way to annual 
crops. Yet these resilient systems are particularly adapted to face harsh topographic and climatic 
conditions and are now recognized as a typical climate-smart/agro-ecological best practices. 
Restoring these agro-forestry systems is however not affordable for the vast majority of farmers.   
     

8. The natural resource base and agriculture are linked by a negative feedback loop. Unsustainable 
farming practices such as agriculture on slopes and marginal areas, lack of agriculture conservation 
technologies, are driven by land pressure, low farmers’ education level, and poor farmers’ economic 
conditions. These have contributed to the severe degradation of around 85 percent of watersheds

14
 

with wide ranging impacts, namely on (i) yields -the depletion of the natural resource base and high 
exposure and vulnerability to extreme weather events have driven an average rate of decline in 
yields of between .5 to 1.2 percent per annum (World Bank, 2005). Stagnating or shrinking yields in 
turn further exacerbate land pressure, causing more degradation and deforestation; and (ii) on 
critical habitats such as mangroves

15
 -run off from denuded slopes and gullies leading to soil washed 

away and settling into valleys, rivers and eventually into the sea. Soil erosion caused by water, either 
as direct rainfall on the soil surface, or indirectly through gullies and channels, causes an annual loss 
of land for the whole country estimated at about 37 million metric tons (MT). This corresponds to an 
average loss of about 15 MT/ha/yr across the country. Without trees’ complex root systems to hold 
Haiti’s mountainous terrain in place, protect gullies from serious erosion and prevent water 
resources depletion, vulnerability of landscapes and people living on them is doomed to increase. 
Reducing poverty and building system resilience will require an integrated management approach 
that considers the complex interactions between the environment and agriculture and turns the 
negative- into a positive feedback loop.  Climate change is expected to increase these negative 
feedback loops. 
 

9. The unique challenge to building resilience in the Haitian Agriculture sector arises from the 
combination of climate change adding further stress to a system already engaged in a negative 
feedback loop between the agriculture production and the natural resource base.  As described 
above, the depleting natural resource base and lack of landscape level management increase the 
sensitivity of agricultural production and ecosystems to weather and climate events. Climate change 

                                                           
12

 All land is inherited bilaterally and equally between siblings, with arable land being usually divided immediately. 
13

 A Creole garden is a multi-storied agro-forestry system including a mix of perennial and annual crops, i.e. woody perennials, 
tree crops (i.e. bread fruit, mango, avocado, bananas, citrus, coffee), vegetable and staple crops, playing multiple roles, 
including household’s food security and providing ecosystems benefits 
14

 According to Ministry of Agriculture, Natural Resources, and Rural Development (MARNDR), 2016  
15

 Mangroves are essential for maintaining fish nursing sites, protecting coasts against storms, and lowland crops from soil 
salinization (e.g. rice production) which are ultimately important for livelihoods

is expected to further amplify the exposure to such events. With both sensitivity and exposure set to 
increase, vulnerability will follow suit. The weather and climate events that today’s depleted natural 
resource base offers much reduced protection against are congruent with priority issues for 
resilience building in the climate change context: extreme events, drought, extreme rainfall events, 
etc. In each of these cases, the health of the natural resource base is a key determinant of farmer 
resilience. For example, the risk of drought is much reduced if the moisture retention capacity of 
soils is rehabilitated, micro-catchment areas include water storage facilities and water is being 
retained for longer periods in upstream forests. As a result, any effort to build resilience to climate 
change in Agriculture will need to take an integrated approach taking into account both sensitivity 
due to a diminished natural resource base and exposure due to climate change. 

 
Institutional context 
 
10. Ministry of Environment (MdE) and Ministry of Agriculture Natural Resources and Rural 

Development (MARNDR) recognize the interdependency between Natural Resources 
Management and Agriculture Production as well as the added stress imposed by climate change. 
In its policy framework 2010-2025, MARNDR identifies watersheds degradation as a major issue, and 
establishes the reduction of environmental vulnerability as a long-term objective requiring the 
protection of environment and natural resources. It also establishes the prevention and 
management of natural disasters as a priority

16
. In 2006, the Government submitted their National 

Adaptation Program of Action (NAPA, 2006) (Plan d’ Action National d’ Adaptation - PANA).  In this 
document, the Government lays out their most urgent risks from climate change and propose a way 
forward.  One of the key risks outlined is that of soil erosion

17
 and its relationship with the 

agriculture sector vulnerability. In a recent update of the National Action Plan against Desertification 
(2015), MdE establishes as one objective the collaborative development of management plans for 
the most vulnerable watersheds in the country. However, the operationalization of the Plans has yet 
to unfold. The need for stronger cross-sectoral collaboration is mutually recognized, but little 
concrete actions have taken place in a context of institutional weaknesses, absence of joint planning 
and insufficient budget to operationalize actions plans.  

 
11. In response to the country’s vulnerability to current climate variability and to climate change, there 

is a baseline of investments in this area: 

 World Bank (WB) financed Strengthening Hydro-Meteorological Services project (2015-2020, 
US$ 5 million), which aims to strengthen Haiti’s institutional capacity to provide hydro-
meteorological and climate information services customized to the needs of the civil protection 
and agriculture sectors, contributing to increasing disaster and climate resilience. The main 
counterpart agency is the Ministry of Agriculture, Natural Resources and Rural Development 

                                                           
16

 The MARNDR Triennial Plan for Relaunching Agriculture 2013-2016 also identifies as a strategic pillar the watershed 
integrated approach (ridge to reef). 
17

 “Haiti is a mountainous country whose peaks reach up to 2684 meters over altitude. Poor farming practices weaken the soil 
capital and weaken the productive capacity as they lead the arable land towards the sea Land erosion, under the effects of 
some natural factors. Drought, wind, rain and some anthropogenic factors: excessive deforestation and uncontrolled 
construction in urban areas leads to a country's land desertification processes. The vulnerability of the agricultural sector is 
closely linked to that of water and soil.  Climate change by acting on water resources also influence agricultural production. On 
the other hand, winds, floods, droughts have direct impacts on agriculture given the level of soil erosion leading to their 
aridity. In addition, a study conducted by the MOE (2000) argues that early in the second half of the 21st century, more than 
half of the area of land of Haiti will be at desertification risk due to climatic conditions.”

(MARNDR). 

 WB financed Relaunching Agriculture: Strengthening Agriculture Public Services Project Phase II - 
RESEPAG II  (2012-2019, US$ 85 million) which aims to  (a) reinforce the capacity of the Ministry 
of Agriculture, Natural Resources and Rural Development to provide or facilitate access to 
services in the agricultural sector; (b) increase market access to small producers and food 
security in Selected Areas; (c) improve livelihood in areas affected by Hurricane Matthew; and 
(d) enable the Government to respond promptly and effectively to an eligible emergency. The 
project finances interventions in the North/North East, Centre, and South departments. It 
supports in particular a Farmer Subsidy scheme using various technical packages and 
implemented through individual vouchers to improve the adoption of improved agriculture 
inputs/technologies (with a particular emphasis on climate resilient production and practices) ; 
finances Farmer Field Schools as a vehicle to promote best practices (extension services 
mechanism) ; and a Market Support Facility, using matching grants to allow group of producers 
to add value to their productions (value chain development).  

 Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) financed Natural Disaster Mitigation Program II (2016-
2020, US$ 42 million), which aims to reduce rural economic losses through the improvement of 
climate risk management in selected watersheds. Some specific objectives include to: (i) 
increase capacities for adaptation to climate change and disaster risk management (DRM) in the 
agriculture sector; (ii) improve water and sediment conservation in selected gullies of priority 
watersheds; and (iii) reduce the risk of rural economic losses due to floods in targeted 
watersheds. 

 United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Reforestation Project (2017-2021, 
US$ 40 million), which aim is to reduce the threat of deforestation, improve resilience to 
economic and natural shocks, increase tree cover in targeted areas, and improve environmental 
governance and coordination. It will be implemented in northern departments. 

 International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) financed Projet Small Irrigation and 
Market Access Development Project in the Nippes and Goavienne Region (PPI-3) (2012-2017, 
US$ 13.2 million), which aims to achieve a sustainable improvement in the livelihoods 
and incomes of rural poor households, especially those belonging to the most vulnerable 
groups. Its specific objectives include: (i) increasing agricultural production sustainably through 
efficient water management and the consolidation of both collective and individual irrigated 
agriculture; (ii) improving the value of irrigated agriculture production and increasing farmers' 
access to markets and financial services in order to raise the incomes of the poorest families; 
and (iii) strengthening the planning, organizational and management capacities of grass-roots 
organizations in order to facilitate their access to markets and financial services. 

 Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) implemented with LDCF co-financing of the 
Strengthening Climate Resilience and Reducing Disaster Risk in Agriculture to Improve Food 
Security in Haiti Post Earthquake project (2012-2017, US$ 12 million), which aims to increase the 
resilience of vulnerable farmers including their livelihoods and agro-ecosystems against the 
impacts of climate variability and in the post-earthquake crises through integration of disaster 
risk management and adaptation practices in the agricultural sector and replication of more 
hazard resilient crop varieties and cultivation technologies. 

 UNEP implemented with GEF co-financing Program Ecosystem approach on the South Coast of 
Haiti (2015-2020, US$ 6.2 million), aims to strengthen the resilience of ecosystems in 
communities vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. This program advocates an integrated 
strategy encompassing all ecosystems and agricultural production areas from the mountains to

the sea. The various components of the project will also try to address the whole issue of the 
destruction of the ecosystems of the Great South in a perspective of recovery and the fight 
against poverty. 

 French Development Agency (AFD) and European Union co-financed Project for Food Security 
(SECAL) (2013-2017, 15 million euros), which objective is to support agricultural sectors with 
high potential in southern Haiti, contribute to improving the food security of people in the South 
Department and generate additional revenue in the rural areas.  

 
12. Collaborative efforts are underway to boost the implementation of watershed approaches to 

strengthen the management of natural resources (wood, water, soil). In the context of the COP21 
process and resulting Paris Agreement, and in order to relieve the agriculture and population 
pressure on forests and landscapes, as well as adapt to the effects of climate change, a Haiti-based 
NGO, the J/P Haitian Relief Organization (J/P HRO), together with MdE and MARNDR, developed in 
2015 a proposal for a broad initiative – Haiti Takes Roots (HTR) – focused on watershed 
management and reforestation in key areas of Haiti

18
. Its objective is to facilitate engagement, 

coordination, learning, monitoring and synergies in a programmatic approach. This platform would 
be a conduit to operationalize Ministries’ plans, helping to bring key actors together around the 
issue, and establish long term strategies and mechanisms to sustain and implement its objectives. 
Supported by seed funding from J/P HRO and the French government, HTR has shaped its 
governance mechanisms

19
. The IDB and the WB participate in this initiative and more partners are 

expected to join. Two studies have been financed under the HTR umbrella by the WB together with 
J/P HRO to develop a participatory watershed management planning methodology and a post-
hurricane Charcoal and Arboreal Assessments

20
, contributing to the development of a body of 

knowledge and resources. The proposed Resilient Productive Landscapes Project (RPLP) is envisaged 
as a proof of concept under HTR aimed at being scaled-up in other (sub)watersheds of the country. 
For this reason, and in order to also benefit from the WB project management experience, J/P HRO 
has committed to provide a parallel financing of US$5 million to RPLP, which will be fully blended 
with IDA and the Global Environment Facility/Least Developed Countries Fund (GEF/LDCF) co-
financing. In this context, LDCF will leverage IDA and parallel financing resources to more 
systematically integrate the climate adaptation lens into productive-oriented interventions.  
 

13. RPLP builds on solid analytical work, as well as the lessons learned from other Global Environment 
Facility (GEF) funded and donor-funded project, including the World Bank’s own projects. Key 
lessons learned emphasize in particular the need for collaborative efforts including strong 
communities’ participatory engagement throughout a project process and continuous institutional 
commitment and support, as well as the necessary generation of revenues for farmers out of the 
supported investments. Since the 2010 Earthquake, the WB’s portfolio in Agriculture expanded with 
RESEPAG I and RESEPAG II,

21
 supporting MARNDR’s capacity to deliver public goods and piloting 

                                                           
18

 The mission of HTR is to contribute to a more rational management of Haiti’s natural, renewable through the management of 
watersheds, the restoration of soils, increasing forest cover, and the promotion of agroforestry – most notably in vulnerable 
watersheds – therefore breaking the vicious cycle of poverty and deforestation. 
19

 HTR shall be governed by a Steering committee chaired by the Prime Minister and supported by a Secretariat, a technical 
platform, a Monitoring and Evaluation Committee, a Geographical Platform, and a virtual Resource Centre; it will include 
members from concerned ministries, institutional partners, international organizations, civil society and private sector. 
20

  PROFOR-funded works to develop (i) a Resilient Productive Landscape Planning Methodology (P162352), and (ii) Haiti 
Arboreal Assessments - post- hurricane tree counting and charcoal assessment (P164024).

incentives schemes to support farmers’ improved productions through vouchers mechanisms and 
the strengthening of agricultural value chains through matching grants. RPLP would take advantage 
of the experience gained and use the same approaches, adjusted to the specificities of RPLP. On the 
environment side, the GEF co-funded several projects in Haiti and in the Caribbean, that focused on 
increasing the resilience of agriculture and ecosystems, and boosting food security through climate 
change adaptation. Several of these projects have also focused specifically on the Grand Sud 
(greater south area), given its increased vulnerability to climate shocks. While many of these 
projects were financially supported for the duration of the project, there was little effort to ensure 
that this financing was sustainable.     
 

14. In the context of Climate Change, sustainable financing over time is an important tool to address 
environmental and social vulnerability, and to support Climate adaptation and mitigate Climate 
Change impact. Ministries and other institutions in Haiti face significant financial resources 
constraints. Sustainability of short term programs have consistently been challenging. To address a 
similar problem faced by five other Caribbean islands, a GEF financed project, Sustainable financing 
and management of Eastern Caribbean Marine Ecosystem Project (P103470) (closed June 2016), set 
up and endowed a Caribbean Biodiversity Fund (CBF) mechanism to ensure sustainable financing 
over time to combat threats to biodiversity that arise through human, climate or other sources. 
Under the proposed Project, Haiti, which is an observer and has taken steps to become a full 
member of the CBF, would use LDCF financing (and co-financing from other donors) to join the CBF 
by contributing to the endowment, and establish a National Trust, which will enable Haiti to access 
long term sustainable financing for climate adaptation and biodiversity conservation into perpetuity. 
While the CBF has for various reasons retained this name, it will create a climate change adaptation 
window under RPLP to address climate change adaptation priority needs. This National Trust shall 
use the interests raised by the CBF from the LDCF funding to continue to fund sub-projects that 
would support primarily the sustainability of interventions financed under RPLP, and other future 
climate change adaptation related investments. The interest raised, however, will be off the total 
amount in the CBF (over US$34 million currently) to allow all the CBF countries to benefit from 
economies of scale. This longer-term source of predictable financing will mean that when a disaster 
strikes Haiti, the current practice of diverting government funding to address that crisis will not 
impact this fund. As such it presents a key long term stabilizing mechanism for addressing 
adaptation. 
 

15. The Project is consistent with the climate change action plan submitted to the UN Framework 
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), in the context of the Paris meetings in 2015 (Intended 
Nationally Determined Contribution – INDC)

22
. The Action Plan specifically names natural resource 

management within watersheds, use of agricultural technologies adapted to climate change, use of 
drought-resistant crops, soil conservation, reducing disaster risk in areas most vulnerable to 
drought, reforestation of upstream areas, as priorities for adaptation within the plan.  
 

16. It responds directly to strategic objectives laid out in the GEF Programming Strategy on 
Adaptation to Climate Change: Least Developed Countries Fund Special Climate Change Fund 
(June 11, 2014) and Haiti’s National Adaptation Program of Action (NAPA, 2006) by helping the 
country reduce its vulnerability to soil erosion, which are exacerbated through increasing volatile

climatic events (floods, cyclones, hurricanes) and human (agriculture) activity. The project will 
contribute to the LDCF strategy Objective 1 (Reduce the vulnerability of people, livelihoods, physical 
assets and natural systems to the adverse effects of climate change); Objective 2 (Strengthen 
institutional and technical capacities for effective climate change adaptation) ; and  Objective 3 
(Integrate climate change adaptation into relevant policies, plans and associated processes)

23
. The 

Project, using LDCF funds jointly with IDA financing and J/P HRO parallel financing, will (i) contribute 
towards building an increased awareness of climate change impacts, vulnerability and adaption, and 
directly reducing the vulnerability of farmers to climate change through investment in more resilient 
agricultural practices. These will occur in (sub)watersheds areas by financing climate-smart 
agricultural production practices (agroforestry, conservation agriculture, slope management, etc.) ; 
the project will also finance improvement of the product value chains to generate higher and more 
sustainable income, and reinforcement of climate resilient infrastructure assets ; (ii) support the 
enabling environment by strengthening institutional capacities to develop and implement sound 
cross-sectoral policies and action plans integrating climate change adaptation considerations in 
national and local level strategies ; access to and analyze geo-spatial and other climate related data 
to better address climate risks and inform decision processes ; and support a mechanism aimed at 
sustaining long term financing of adaptation technologies and practices; and (iii) it will provide 
extensive trainings programs to increase skills and knowledge tailored to the key stakeholders and 
audiences. RPLP will support the achievement of objectives set forth under the NAPA, which served 
as the basis for the plan submitted to the UNFCCC in 2015. The document weighted adaptation 
options based on their impact on vulnerable natural resources and groups, and ranked “watershed 
management and soil conservation” at the top (5 on a 1 to 5 scale).    
 

17. RPLP is consistent with the World Bank Group’s Haiti Country Partnerships Framework (CPF) 2016-
2019. Objective 1 of the CPF aims to enhance economic activities and income-generation 
opportunities, including in the agricultural sector through improving agricultural productivity by 
reinforcing the ability of farmer’s groups to bring quality products to market. RPLP will support value 
chains to access to new and better markets and reduce production risks while decreasing 
vulnerability to the effects of prices and climate shocks. The CPF’s Objective 2 targets improving 
disaster prevention and strengthening climate resilience through a number of avenues, including the 
analysis of land management practices and definition of entry points for investment in the 
promotion of resilient productive landscapes. RPLP will directly tackle the issue of improving disaster 
prevention, reducing the vulnerability to the adverse impacts of climate change, increase adaptive 
capacity to respond to the impacts of climate change, and strengthening climate resilience. It will 
target four sub-watersheds within hydrological zones hard-hit by Hurricane Matthew in the 
Department of Nippes, and help mitigate the impact of future extreme weather events.   

 
18. RPLP will work closely and coordinate actions with other development partners, especially 

through the HTR platform.  Given the challenges with fragmented donor contributions to all sectors 
in Haiti as identified by the CPF, the HTR platform will be important for the sector to bring all 
partners around critical development themes, and coordinate efforts for broader impact. In addition 
to ongoing projects mentioned above (see point 11) new projects with similar objectives are under 
development that RPLP will coordinate with. These include projects to be financed through IDB, 
AFD, and IFAD.

C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  
 
Development Objective(s) (From PAD)  
 

19. The Project Development Objectives are: (i) to improve the adoption of resilience-enhancing 
agricultural and landscape management practices in selected sub-watersheds; and (ii) to enable the 
Government to respond promptly and effectively to an eligible emergency. 

 
20. The crisis or emergency referred to in the PDO reflects a legal requirement that relates to the 

Contingency Emergency Response Component (component 4 of the Project).  
 

21. Selected areas for intervention. While Component 1 addressing institutional and organizational 
capacity would have a nationwide coverage, Component 2 would be implemented in selected sub-
watershed. In the process of selection of these sub-watersheds, specific aspects were considered: (i) 
Agro-ecological criteria; (ii) Socio-economic criteria; (iii) Environmental vulnerability criteria; and (iv) 
Institutional criteria. Using a ranking scale of 1 to 5 for each of these criteria to prioritize areas, and 
based on available funding from the Project, four sub-watersheds were selected. These are:  (i) Rivière 
Froide watershed; (ii) Petite Rivière de Nippes watershed; (iii) Piémont area and Baconnois Plain; and 
(iv) Bondeau sub-wastershed and its mangrove. They offer a diversity of agro-ecological conditions, 
yet geographically close, within the department of Nippes, under two municipalities.  

 
22. In the context of RPLP, resilience is defined as the ability of people, assets, and systems to resist, 

absorb, accommodate, and recover in a timely and efficient manner from climatic hazards without 
undermining its welfare, value, structure, and functioning, while also maintaining the capacity for 
adaptation, learning, and transformation in the long term. Resilient-enhancing agriculture and 
landscape management practices correspond to the group of technologies, practices and systemic 
approaches under the climate smart agriculture and landscapes framework of the Global Alliance for 
Climate Smart Agriculture. In the context of the RPLP, these include interlinked actions at diverse 
levels: at farm level; along food value chains; and, at landscape level.  

 
23. Landscape is defined as “an area large enough to produce vital ecosystem services, but small enough 

to be managed by the people using the land which produces those services” (FAO 2013). A landscape 
can contain various ecosystems, and human activities and institutions are viewed as an integral part of 
landscapes. Ecosystems services include soil health, essential for sustainable and productive 
agriculture; water retention; biodiversity conservation; carbon sequestration; renewable energy 
sources; among others. 

 

Project Beneficiaries 
 
24. Primary beneficiaries of RPLP will be smallholder farmers and communities living in the selected sub-

watersheds targeted by the Project that depend on agricultural production for their livelihoods. In a 
context of high poverty prevalence, extensive land use for agricultural production including on steep 
slopes including gullies, very small size plots, degraded or at risk for degradation, all farmers and 
communities can be considered vulnerable. They will benefit individually from improved agricultural 



 

The World Bank  
Resilient Productive Landscapes in Haiti (P162908)

production practices adapted to the agro-ecological context, improving soil conditions and becoming 
more resilient to extreme weather events, as well as from improved marketing conditions; and 
collectively from reduced soil erosion, improved water retention capacity, enhanced field level 
productivity linked to ecosystems services generated collectively and synergies created between 
differed production systems at the watershed level. 

 
25. Interventions will also benefit key actors along the agriculture value chains, including service and input 

providers, buyers, processors, and retailers. Lastly, it will benefit the national, regional and local 
institutions in providing with essential tools, knowledge, and management capacity of landscape level 
interventions. Direct beneficiaries would include: (i) producers who have benefited from the voucher 
mechanism (3,000 of which minimum 30% are female); (ii) Service Providers (100 of which minimum 
10% are female); (iii) members of producers’ groups that benefit from co-financing in selected value 
chains (800 of which minimum 50% are female); and, (iv) persons trained in Ministries and local / 
regional authorities (100). The total percentage of women is estimated on the basis of a weighted 
average.  In order to strengthen the role of women, they will receive preferential support to benefit 
from the Project’s interventions.  

 
26. Private sector. Investments of RPLP look at poor to extremely poor segments of the population. 

Access to rural credit is not an option for an already vulnerable population. In addition, changing 
practices, even if expected to provide longer term gains and reduction of vulnerability, involves an 
important level of risk in a context of frequent natural disasters, occurrence of pests, and markets 
uncertainties. No insurance mechanism exists either to cover for such types of high frequency, high 
impact types of risks. RPLP would therefore provide technical packages to producers (including 
knowledge/services and inputs on a one-off basis) required for them to move towards a less 
vulnerable category, and doing so in a concentrated manner in a determined area to produce the 
expected broader ecosystems benefits. The Project would strengthen the private sector actors related 
to agricultural production valorization, critical to develop economically viable and sustainable 
businesses as well as job opportunities; the voucher mechanism involves systematically private sector 
beneficiaries, which supply such inputs and services at market price. Matching grants for groups of 
producers or other actors along the value chains will also aim at filling access to finance gaps to 
increase agricultural production valorization. The Project will also work with the Ministries to 
strengthen their capacity to deliver on their public good mandates, and establish the enabling 
environment for supporting resilient landscapes management. 
 

27. Gender and Nutrition. RPLP acknowledges that women and men are not given the same opportunities 
towards climate adaption and raising of incomes. Women face supplementary constraints -such as less 
access to information, to assets, to credit, to inputs- that have to be taken into account. 
Mainstreaming gender and nutrition into the different investments and monitoring and evaluation 
(M&E) mechanisms will ensure that the Project will contribute to reduce gender gaps when building 
resilience and contribute toward improving food security. The Project will build on experience and 
knowledge developed through RESEPAG II Project, which will be facilitated by the fact that RPLP core 
actions to support climate smart practices adoption and value chains improvement will use similar 
instruments as RESEPAG II. Namely the design of selection mechanisms of beneficiaries and co-
financing rules for matching grants, the tailoring of participatory and training activities, including 
related to nutrition, and gender-disaggregated data collection in M&E and grievances, will be 
embedded into RPLP. In order to  address any possible outstanding  gender gaps in the areas of

interventions,  further  analysis and gender planning will be conducted prior to Project 
implementation by the RESEPAG II gender specialist.   
 

28. Food Security co-benefits. Food insecurity is an important problem in Haiti particularly in rural areas 
that the Project will tackle at different levels. First, the promotion of activities contributing to the 
restoration of degraded areas and improvement of current practices in the different watersheds will 
have a positive impact on overall agricultural productivity as well as on the production of food of high 
nutritional value (mostly fruits and vegetables). Second, the Project will contribute to improve food 
security through the promotion of crop quality and diversity induced with agroforestry investments, 
named traditionally “jardins creoles” in Haiti.  The project expects to promote several types of fruit 
trees, such as breadfruit, coconut, mango, guava, banana, citrus, as well as vegetables and yam. In 
addition, the combination of such investments combined with small infrastructure and support to 
commercialization (through groups of producers, intermediaries, or small enterprises) within the 
entire value chain will therefore contribute to their greater accessibility, availability and thus 
affordability of food, creating more resilience of households toward food insecurity. Investments 
could be related not only to private but also institutional markets. The government has already been 
discussing with school feeding program in the area of intervention. Such intervention would seek to 
help increase the accessibility of nutritious local food to Haitian students and guarantee a stable 
market access to institutional markets for producers and groups. 
 

29. Climate change adaptation co-benefits. RPLP activities are expected to yield significant adaptation co-
benefits (as well as mitigation co-benefits described below). An initial assessment at concept note 
stage indicated that >80 percent of RPLP financing would achieve climate co-benefits. The below table 
summarizes expected adaptation co-benefits: 
 
Table1 Climate change adaptation co-benefits  
 

Current situation Project interventions (selection) Adaptation co-benefits 

Increasing vulnerability to climate 
change driven by: 
- Increased exposure to climate 

change impacts such as: droughts, 
extreme heat, flash floods etc. 

- Increasing sensitivity of production 
to climatic phenomena due to 
reduced resilience driven by a 
degrading natural resource base 

- Increased sensitivity due to a lack of 
adaptive planning capacity at the 
micro-catchment level 

- Increased sensitivity due to lack of 
cross-sectoral adaptive institutional 
capacity to take informed decisions, 
guide, report, and monitor 
interventions on the ground in 
function of a changing climate 

Capacity building: 
- Development of Master Plan for 

Resilient Landscapes Development 
- Intensive technical trainings within key 

line Ministries, at national and local 
level and other relevant stakeholders 

- Capacity building in cartography, 
satellite imaging data collection and 
analysis for climate modeling, , 
development and application of spatial 
decision support tools, forecasting and 
early-warning systems 
 

Investments: 
- Development of “technical packages” 

(including inputs, such as tree 
seedlings, seeds, stakes, fences; and 
services, such as grafting, and technical 
assistance)” adapted to specific agro-
ecological zones 

- Development of participatory 
investments plans identifying priority 
investments and their geographical 

Strengthening of resilience through 
fortification of natural resource 
base at landscape level: 

- Soil quality improvement in 
areas with high risks of erosion 

- Increased water retention 
capacity 

 
Reduced sensitivity of agricultural 
production & livelihoods to climate 
impacts: 

- Increased coverage of resilient 
agricultural practices, adapted 
to the topography and agro-
ecological context 

- Improved adaptation capacity 
of agricultural production 
through increased 
diversification of productions 
practices to increase resilience 

- Improved livelihoods with 
additional and more diversified 
incomes

locations;  
- Development of participatory business 

plans based on specific vulnerability 
criteria (including ecosystems and 
livelihoods) to allow the 
implementation of climate smart 
productions and practices ; and  

- Set-up of Farmer-Field-Schools (FFS) for 
producers focusing on transferring 
knowledge and know-how on Climate 
resilient production systems and 
practices. 

 
Improved adaptive capacity: 

- Improved capacity for planning, 
implementing, monitoring, 
watershed-level interventions 
towards improved natural 
resources management and 
livelihoods. 

 
30. In terms of mitigation co-benefits, it is estimated that RPLP activities will lead to significant benefits 

compared to the baseline. A quantification of the Green House Gas (GHG) mitigation potential using 
the EX-ACT tool estimated that over a duration of 40 years (4 years for actual project implementation 
and 16 years for capitalization of its effects), the Project’s carbon emission reduction  is estimated at 
572,397 tons of CO2 equivalent (tCO2-eq), or 28,620 tCO2-eq per year. These benefits will principally be 
achieved through improved landscape management, in particular through the promotion of 
afforestation, agroforestry systems and perennial agriculture cultivars.

 D. Project Description  
 

32. RPLP is designed to restore ecosystem services at sub-watershed level to safeguard and enhance agricultural 
production, reduce vulnerability of economic and ecological systems to external shocks, and to strengthen 
capacities for the long-term sustainable management of those landscapes. The investment will result in the 
provision of environmental services, private and public goods, including enhanced watershed services 
encompassing soil conservation, hydrological services, and biomass supply.

33. The approach used by RPLP builds on a rich set of lessons learned from past projects and evidence from analytical 
work. The Project will take a landscape approach and operate at sub-watershed level, combining a socio-

economic and an ecological approach to landscape management.
24

 The Project’s interventions in the selected 
sub-watersheds will build on the results of two watershed management participatory planning exercises piloted 
within one of the selected sub-watersheds during Project preparation (Rivière Froide) that will be implemented in 
the entire area of the Project by effectiveness with the support of J/P HRO. The operationalization of these plans 
will consist in the development of sub-watersheds’ investments plans, that will be providing more detailed 
information related to each category of intervention offered by the Project with the volume of activities, types of 
instruments pre-identified during project preparation based on lessons learned and pilot participatory planning 
exercises (see Component 2), location and corresponding estimated budget.  

 
34. Resilience-enhancement from RPLP in the selected sub-watersheds will result from actions  to decrease the 

vulnerability of: (i) farmers linked to increasing soil degradation and subsequent continuous reduction of 
production capacity, and insufficient capacity to sell productions in a profitable and sustainable manner, including 
due to poor infrastructure condition; and (ii) landscapes, linked to the lack of holistic, participatory planning 
capacity, required to establish a common understanding of problems, propose solutions, prioritize actions 
expected to have the larger positive impact on ecosystems and populations in a defined sub-watershed, including 
interventions aimed at reducing soil erosion and enhancing water retention capacities in gullies as well as around 
natural springs, mostly through intensification of vegetative and tree cover, as well as small water harvesting 
infrastructure reducing water run-off.  
 

35. RPLP is designed to contribute to break the natural resources degradation/increasing populations’ vulnerability 
cycle in the selected sub-watersheds by taking an integrated approach. Based on geographic concentration, the 
Project will work at both farm- and community level to simultaneously raise production and productivity using 
more resilient, adapted agriculture practices to the hydro-geological context, which will directly contribute to 
rebuild the natural resource base; by protecting and restoring top soil cover in particular, the Project will improve 
water retention capacity, reduce erosion, enhance soil quality, which are required to counter the soil quality 
loss/productivity loss/increasing vulnerability cycle.  The Project will also work along the entire value chain from 
inputs via production to processing and marketing to ensure that the changes introduced result in income gains 
for farmers that are essential for Project sustainability. It will also support the construction or rehabilitation of 
small infrastructures considered critical to enhance landscape’s resilience (e.g. related to water management or 
improved access to markets), taking care of their quality to ensure the best possible resistance to adverse climatic 
conditions. 
 

36. It will also strengthen the institutional enabling environment and build capacity for landscape level governance 
and management at both national and local levels as well as delivering a proof of concept of the approach by 
investing into selected watersheds, to create the enabling conditions for subsequent scale-up. 
 

37. RPLP will include four components: (i) Strengthening of institutional and organizational capacity for landscape 
level resilience; (ii) Investments to strengthen the establishment of resilient agricultural production and practices; 
(iii) Project coordination, monitoring and evaluation; and (iv) Emergency Response Mechanism. The core of the 
investments and expected impact from RPLP shall be seen under Component 2 that will finance agricultural, value 
chains and infrastructure related activities to reduce land and farmers’ vulnerability in the four selected sub-
watersheds; while Component 1 shall establish the enabling environment for Component 2 to achieve its 
objectives and contribute to longer term implementation of sustainable productive landscapes approach by key 
institutions, in particular through the CBF mechanism to provide financing for climate adaptation into perpetuity.

Fig. 1: Theory of Change/Strategic Overview, Thematic Linkages and expected Achievements of  RPLP 

 
Component 1: Strengthening of institutional and organizational capacities for landscape level 
interventions (US$ 5.6 M total -US$ 1.4 M IDA and US$ 4.2 M LDCF- ; parallel financing of US$ 1.4 M 
from J/P HRO).  

38. This component will support national efforts to : create Agriculture/Environment joint landscapes policy and 
action plan towards resilient agriculture and ecosystems; fill skills and knowledge gaps required to implement 
respective mandates; foster partnerships and communication; strengthen institutional capacity to analyze climate 
related data for improved planning and climate related disaster risk prevention; fund the set-up of a National 
Trust Fund that will provide financing for climate adaptation into perpetuity through the CBF; and will also pave 
the way for Component 2 interventions that will rely on communities’ participatory planning exercises in all 
selected sub-watersheds. Specifically, the component will support:  
 

39. Sub-component 1.1. Institutional capacity building (US$ 2.6 M total -US$ 1.4 M IDA and US$ 0.8 M LDCF- ; parallel 
financing of US$ 0.4 M from J/P HRO). This sub-component would finance: (i) the development of a joint 
MdE/MARNDR Master Plan for Resilient Landscapes Development, building on respective policies and action 
plans

25
 and recent international commitments under Climate Change/Climate Adaptation global agendas 

(including NAPA and INDC implementation), establishing areas of synergies, joint action plan and related M&E, 
that will be field-tested under Component 2, and serve as a reference under HTR ; ii) intensive technical trainings

within key line Ministries, including MARNDR and MdE, at national and at local level with the branches of line 
ministries, as well as local governments and other relevant stakeholders (in the selected sub-watersheds), to carry 
out their mandate towards sustainable landscapes management; exchange visits in-country and abroad to share 
landscapes restoration and management experiences ; and students sponsorships for Masters degrees related to 
landscape /ecosystems /environmental fields ; iii) capacity building in cartography, satellite imaging data 
collection and analysis for climate modeling, , development and application of spatial decision support tools, 
forecasting and early-warning systems ; and establishing linkages with global networks of expertise in this field 
offering options to get high resolution Agro-Meteorological data. Informed by a background study supported by 
the WB, a set of dynamic decision support tools driven by geospatial and hydro-meteorological data were 
selected that would be supported by RPLP: soil health & erosion risk monitor; drought risk monitor. The creation 
of these tools would (a) help establish a baseline in project areas on critical variables and 2) inform project 
implementation at farm and landscape level. 

 
40. Sub-component 1.2. Support to national level sustainable landscape management approach to agriculture and 

watershed management (US$ 0.0 M total -US$ 0.0 M IDA and US$ 0.0 M LDCF- ; parallel financing of US$ 1.0 M 
from J/P HRO). Activities under this sub-component would be financed entirely through parallel financing from J/P 
HRO. They will aim at supporting (i) HTR, to develop/update its strategic and action plans, and operate its 
secretariat; (ii) the establishment, and operation of the National Committee for Climate Change in charge of 
steering, monitoring and reporting on activities to be implemented under the INDC; and (iii) the development of 
detailed participatory sub-watersheds management plans in the four selected sub-watersheds and their update. 
The development of these plans will follow the methodology piloted by J/P HRO, in close collaboration with 
MARNDR and MdE through the PROFOR study referred to in section I.B. They will serve as a basis for the 
development of detailed participatory business plans focused on RPLP interventions out of which the selection of 
investments financed under Component 2 will be made. The participatory sub-watersheds management plans will 
be completed by effectiveness of IDA and LDCF financing.     

 
41. Sub-component 1.3. Sustainable Financing of Resilient Productive Landscapes and Environmental Investments 

(US$ 3.4 M total - US$ 0.0 M IDA and US$ 3.4 M LDCF-). As indicated in section I.B, it would support the 
participation of Haiti in the CBF to benefit from financial resources towards climate adaptation and biodiversity 
conservation objectives into perpetuity. In the context of RPLP, it would specifically contribute to ensuring the 
long-term sustainability of interventions financed under Component 2. This sub-component would finance (i) 
remaining activities required to set up the National level Trust Fund to receive funds from the CBF on a yearly 
basis, complementing other donor’s contributions and (ii) an initial endowment of US$3 million to the CBF, 
earmarked for climate adaptation related interventions, complemented by a US$7 million endowment for 
biodiversity to be provided through the German Development Bank (KfW). It is estimated that the fund will take 
up to 3 years to establish and disburse funds. In the interim the other sources of project financing (IDA and J/P 
HRO parallel financing) will be used to support adaptation activities. Therefore, the establishment of the Trust 
Fund does not present delays to overall project implementation. 

 
Component 2: Investments to strengthen the establishment of resilient agricultural production and 
practices (US$ 12.1 M total -US$ 10.1 M IDA, US$ 2.0 M LDCF- and parallel financing of US$ 3.6 M from 
J/P HRO).  
 

42. This component will support individual farmers and communities within selected sub-watersheds to establish 
more resilient agricultural productions and practices, adapted to the agro-ecological contexts, and prioritized 
according to participatory planning exercises (under sub-component 1.2 and business plans under 2.2), supported

by scientific expertise, in order to provide individual, and, to the maximum extent possible, landscape-level 
collective co-benefits from increased soil quality, water retention capacity and biodiversity. It will also support 
actions aimed at improving the revenues and livelihoods from better market access and improved food availability 
and nutritional quality, required to reduce people and, consequently, ecosystems’ vulnerability; and support the 
establishment or rehabilitation of small infrastructures supporting (i) and (ii) for increased farmers and landscape 
level resilience.   

 
43. Sub-component 2.1. Investments in resilient, sustainable agriculture and ecosystems (US$ 8.55 M total -US$ 6.55 

M IDA and US$ 2.0 M LDCF). This sub-component will support investments at individual and community levels 
that focus on increasing climate resilience of agricultural production systems in the selected sub-watershed. 
Specifically, the sub-component will finance (i) the development of a limited menu of “technical packages” 
(including inputs, such as tree seedlings, seeds, stakes, fences; and services, such as grafting, and technical 
assistance)” adapted to specific agro-ecological zones, and priority issues to be addressed, building on 
participatory planning documents, and experts inputs; (ii) the development of participatory investments plans 
identifying priority investments and their geographical locations, and costs to be financed out of RPLP under 
Component 2; (iii) the selection of beneficiaries according to participatory business plans based on specific 
vulnerability criteria (including ecosystems and livelihoods) and their access to one of these technical package 
over the course of the Project to allow the implementation of climate smart productions and practices ; and (iv) 
the set-up of Farmer-Field-Schools (FFS) for producers focusing on transferring knowledge and know-how on 
Climate resilient productions and practices (such as planting following contour lines, improved tillage, 
boundary/live fences planting for wind and water erosion protection, soil coverage, inter-cropping, agroforestry 
systems management, soil and water conservation and so on)

26
, as well as organizational and marketing 

approaches to add value to these productions (related to sub-component 2.2). This sub-component will use 
RESEPAG II experience with its farmer’s incentive scheme using a voucher mechanism, and be implemented with 
the support of an operator (consulting firm). It will also benefit from the registry of farmers being developed with 
the support of RESEPAG II. 

 
44. Sub-component 2.2. Intensification, diversification and commercial agriculture (US$ 2.85 M total -US$ 2.85 M IDA 

and US$ 0.0 M LDCF- ; parallel financing of US$ 1.1 M from J/P HRO). This sub-component will improve access to 
inputs and services from farmers, as well as marketing capacities and options, considered essential to ensure the 
profitability of investments, improve livelihoods and thereby contribute to sustain resilient landscapes. Under this 
sub-component, the Project will also seek to facilitate the mobilization of commercial credit both during and after 
project implementation. Before RPLP effectiveness, a market/value chains analysis for productions likely to be 
supported under sub-component 2.1, as well as an analysis of relevant inputs and services suppliers, would be 
carried out through J/P HRO financing. J/P HRO would also contribute to support these latter in order to meet 
expected quality and quantity of such inputs and services. This sub-component will both support (i) groups of 
producers within the selected watersheds to develop basic business plans identifying key inputs 
(equipment/services) to be financed under RPLP aimed at improving the quality and quantity of products sold to 
intermediaries or directly placed on markets ; and (ii) more advanced constituted groups of producers or small 
enterprises to increase their capacity to generate additional value to climate smart productions produced in the 
selected sub-watersheds (e.g. addressing logistics, agro-processing, reduction of food losses aspects), through 
improved business/marketing skills, as well as improved infrastructures and equipment to be financed through a 
matching grant mechanism. For this activity, the experience of the “Market Support Facility (MSF)” implemented 

                                                           
26

 The Farmer-Field-Schools will also be a vehicle to promote food diet-nutrition education which will be built from (i) the 
material being compiled in the context of J/P HRO arboretum, where a women repertoire of traditional plants used for 
medicine and diets is being created, and (ii) also re-use the food practice diet training developed under RESEPAG II.

under RESEPAG II.  
 

45. The sub-component will also finance trainings that will provide more capacity in technical, financial as well as 
management and strategy, to improve market access -for inputs suppliers’ and services providers’ organizations, 
as well as producers and other actors along the value chains. The same operator as sub-component 2.1 would 
support the implementation of this sub-component to facilitate coordination between these complementary 
activities.  
 

46. Sub-component 2.3. Protection of infrastructure and watersheds (US$ 0.7 M total - US$ 0.7 M IDA and US$ 0.0 M 
LDCF- ; parallel financing of US$ 2.5 M from J/P HRO). This sub-component will finance works to: (i) protect 
/rehabilitate small public infrastructures (e.g. rural and access roads or tracks, river crossing structures) (ii) 
enhance water management in the selected areas (building small water harvesting infrastructures in gullies or 
slopes, rehabilitating small water catchments or small irrigation systems in plains). The activities to be carried out 
under this sub-component will be based on the investments plans developed in each of the selected areas. This 
stage would be followed by technical studies to inform the detailed scope and nature of works to be supported 
under the Project.  
 

47. Most of the works are expected to be simple, hence a community-based approach would be promoted using a 
labor-intensive workforce. This approach has been used various times by MARNDR successfully (including through 
RESEPAG II in response to Hurricane Matthew’s to restore some damaged infrastructures. A specific manual exists 
that would serve as a basis for RPLP. 

 
Component 3: Project Coordination and Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) (US$ 3.5 M total – 100% 
IDA).  
 

48. The objective of this component is to support Project coordination and M&E as well as all aspects of management 
(including fiduciary matters, knowledge management, communication, gender and citizen engagement as well as 
monitoring mitigation measures related to safeguards). It will finance staff costs, goods, equipment and vehicles, 
incremental operating costs, assessments and studies (including technical and financial audits), construction 
and/or rehabilitation of Project Implementation Unit offices and in general eligible expenses associated with the 
overall management of the Project implementation. It will also provide resources to monitor progress and 
evaluate results and impact. For this purpose, an impact evaluation baseline will be established by no later than 
year one of Project implementation. 

 
Component 4: Emergency Response Component (US$0 - only IDA if activated).  

49. A Contingency Emergency Response Component (CERC) with zero allocation will be created to allow the 
Government to respond quickly in case of an eligible emergency. If an eligible emergency occurs, the inclusion of 
this component would provide a conduit for the use of uncommitted funds from the unallocated expenditure 
category and/or allow the government to request the Bank to re-categorize and reallocate financing from other 
project components to partially cover emergency response via implementation of key activities by the appropriate 
agencies to respond to the emergency. The CERC could also be used to channel additional funds should they 
become available as a result of an eligible emergency. An Emergency Response Operational Manual, acceptable to 
the WB, will be prepared and adopted during the first year of project implementation and clearly outline the 
triggers, eligible expenditures and procedures for tapping into the CERC.

E. Implementation 
             Institutional and Implementation Arrangements 

50. Joint Implementation, Project Duration and Geographic Coverage. The Project will be implemented 
jointly by the MARNDR and the MdE, with an expected duration of five years. This proposed 
duration (expected over calendar years 2018-2023) is set to allow a realistic timeframe for 
implementation. In terms of geographic coverage, four (4) specific zones have been selected based 
on detailed criteria (environmental, socio-economic, vulnerability, institutional, budget availability 
as well as relevance in view of proposed interventions).  
 

51. MARNDR and MdE Experiences. The MARNDR began implementing the US$5M RESEPAG I project in 
2009.  Within MARNDR, the Project will leverage the existing capacity – specifically on safeguards 
and fiduciary aspects – of the coordination unit currently supporting RESEPAG II and other donor 
projects. Conversely, MdE has no experience in the implementation of Bank-funded projects, and 
would develop its capacity building on MARNDR experience. The Project will collaborate closely with 
other development partners and receive parallel financing from the NGO J/P HRO.  
 

52. Implementation arrangements. It was agreed that the Project will be jointly implemented by 
MARNDR/MdE through one Project Implementation Unit; this latter would report to both Ministries 
through focal points nominated by the respective Ministers. The PIU will be split in two locations: at 
the Central Level (PIU-C or Unité de Gestion de Projet Centrale) based at Port-Au-Prince and at the 
local level (PIU-L or Unité de Gestion de Projet Locale) based at the Agricultural Communal Office 
(Bureau Agricole Communal – BAC) Anse-à-Veau, close to the areas of intervention. The two units 
will be staffed as needed (i.e. staff hired and paid for by Project resources and appointed civil 
servants by MARNDR/MdE paid for by the Government) with appropriate skills, taking into account 
existing human resources and arrangements as well as existing staff from active World Bank 
operations when relevant (i.e. RESEPAG II). All staff paid using Project resources will be hired on a 
competitive basis under terms of reference and qualifications acceptable by the World Bank. 
 

53. The PIU-C and PIU-L will ensure timely and effective coordination of activities in order to monitor 
progress towards PDO. The implementation arrangements will allow a joint technical coordination 
by MARNDR/MdE as well as capitalizing on the MARNDR’s existing capacity and experience with 
World Bank projects’ management, especially on the fiduciary aspects. In addition, the PIU-L will 
allow to coordinate with the local offices of MARNDR and MdE at Departmental and Communal 
levels, as well with the other local stakeholders. The PIU-C will be responsible for: (i) managing the 
project at national level, including financial management, procurement in accordance with World 
Bank guidelines and procedures, and M&E; (ii) finalizing the Project Implementation Manuel (PIM) 
before effectiveness; (iii) producing project progress reports; and (iv) project communication.  
 

54. Staffing. The PIU-C will be located at Port-Au-Prince and headed by one (1) General Coordinator. 
He/She will also coordinate aspects related to Component 1. Other members of the PIU-C will 
include the fiduciary staff: one (1) principal accountant and one (1) procurement specialist, receiving 
support from existing fiduciary staff from RESEPAG II. All PIU-C staff, including the General 
Coordinator, will be hired on a competitive basis and paid for by Project resources. Support Staff will 
also be hired. All other staff will be based in the field at the PIU-L in the BAC Anse-à-Veau and hired 
on a competitive basis and paid for by Project resources. Staff will include one (1) Coordinator in 
charge of Component 2 as well as one (1) communication & grievance redress mechanism specialist,

one (1) environmental safeguards specialist, one (1) social safeguard/gender/citizen engagement 
specialist, one (1) M&E specialist. Support Staff will also be hired. In order not to delay the start of 
the Project, the recruitment processes of these specialists will be launched during the preparation 
phase with the preparation of Terms of References (TORs), and selection, using the existing 
RESEPAG II fiduciary team to manage the recruitment process according to WB rules. Under the 
LDCF Project Preparation Grant, a core team of two persons (technical and admin) should also be in 
place not later than February 2018 to support the MARNDR and MdE RPLP focal points carry out 
these tasks among others contributing to swift implementation post declaration of effectiveness.   
 

55. In terms of governance mechanisms, a Project Steering Committee – PSC will be created at national 
level and serve as a guidance and exchange body (Meeting Frequency: once a year) and endorse 
Annual Work Plan & Budget. The PSC will be co-chaired by MARDNR and MdE, and comprised of 
high level representatives of MARNDR, MdE, Ministry of Economy and Finance, Ministry of Interior, 
as well as co-financiers, Audubon Society, HTR, other key stakeholders including donors (with 
observer status). The detailed composition and mandate of the PSC will be provided in the PIM. PIU-
C General Coordinator will assure the role of PSC Secretariat. In addition, a Technical Committee – 
TC will be established and ensure regular follow-up on the implementation of RPL activities 
(Meeting Frequency: quarterly, in Nippes Department). The TC will be chaired by the General 
Coordinator of the PIU-C and comprised of local stakeholders and authorities (DDA, DDE, other 
relevant Directorates, Civil Protection Committees, Municipalities, CASEC, ASEC), selected sub-
watersheds communities’ representatives, private sector representatives, etc.).  
 

56. A detailed PIM will be adopted before Project effectiveness, which will incorporate all operational 
details at the national and local levels, including the implementation of technical activities, M&E, 
safeguard implementation and administrative and fiduciary procedures. It will include detailed TORs 
for key RPLP/PIU-C/PIU-L staff. A harmonized IRM Operational Manual for the management of the 
CERC will be prepared and validated no later than three months after the Project effectiveness. 
Detailed Project implementation arrangements are found in the PAD.

SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY 

 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

The project will have an overall positive impact on 
the environment. It will promote conservation 
agriculture, agroforestry, soil and water 
conservation, water harvesting, water stewardship, 
re-afforestation and sustainable livestock grazing. 
The negative environmental impacts will be small 
and highly localized.  Such impacts may be 
associated with the construction works that 
communes will be able to finance under the project 
(rural roads, small bridges, etc) and impacts may 
include noise, waste management, worker health 
and safety issues and so on.  Other negative impacts 
may be related to improper technology transfer (e.g. 
inadvertent propagation of exotic species, expansion 
of plantations in natural forests, water harvesting 
that impacts the water table) and so on. For these 
reasons, the project is a category B and all activities, 
including those that seem environmentally harmless 



 

The World Bank  
Resilient Productive Landscapes in Haiti (P162908) 

 

 

  
Oct 25, 2017 Page 25 of 33  

 

would need to be screened.  The completed ESMF 
provides a screening tool as well as a table of 
possible impacts and mitigation measures.  Proper 
and timely supervision from the Bank will also 
ensure that these activities are adequately 
monitored by the Environmental specialist in the 
PIU. 
 
For the sub component on planning and policy 
development, the intention is for the project to 
promote sustainability; however, the risk that a well-
intentioned plan or policy has negative impacts is 
possible, and therefore the ESMF that will be 
prepared, and the Operations Manual, will include 
measures to ensure that all plans and strategies 
prepared under the project are sustainable; support 
the preservation, maintenance and rehabilitation of 
the environment; are publicly consulted during their 
drafting process; take into account cumulative 
effects; and include measures to strengthen 
environmental management.  
 
For the CBF, for which activities are not yet clearly 
defined, and to ensure that the project does not 
indirectly finance activities with negative 
environmental impacts, the project ESMF will also 
apply. The Operation Manual will include a measure 
to ensure that the CBF adopts the ESMF as part of its 
screening mechanism.  
 
 
On the social side, no major safeguards risks are 
expected. A potential risk may include delays in 
compensation related to land acquisition. The 
project will avoid or minimize land acquisition based 
on the lessons learned. RPF will include measures to 
deal with such potential delays in payments should 
land acquisition be necessary. Another potential 
social risk may be perceived inequities in the 
selection of beneficiaries. The Project will mitigate 
this risk by focusing on citizen engagement 
measures and robust grievance redress measures.  
 
Risks linked to labor influx are expected to be 
limited. They will be mitigated by prioritizing local 
labor and ensuring clarity on where laborers coming

from outside will be hosted through their stay in the 
host community and ensuring that contracts are 
consistent with ESMF and RPF provisions. 

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 Yes 

This project will improve and support natural or 
critical habitat by increasing tree and ground cover 
with appropriate natural vegetation. It will operate 
in mangroves, forests, wetlands and other natural 
habitats and therefore the policy is triggered. Where 
infrastructure is being built, the project will ensure 
that it does not denude natural areas or remove 
cover that can expose the soil to erosional forces. 
The project will have an overall positive impact on 
natural habitats, but will ensure through applying 
the ESMF that negative impacts such as improper 
technology transfer, introduction of alien invasive 
species, etc., is not financed. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 Yes 

The project will finance activities related to forestry 
and improve, rather than cause destruction to forest 
cover.  Activities that involve conversion of natural 
forests or degradation of critical areas will not be 
financed. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

Given that the project involves significant 
interventions in agriculture, and that the 
improvement of crop production is an ultimate 
objective, it is likely that pesticides will be used.  The 
types of activities that may require pesticides 
include dissemination of technologies for 
sustainable agricultural intensification; forestry; 
agricultural storage programs; and livestock health 
programs. All pesticides that are disseminated or 
used under the project will comply with WHO's 
list/standards for acceptable pesticide use. An 
integrated pesticide management plan has been 
prepared by the project and the document will be 
disclosed prior to appraisal. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 Yes 

The project will not operate within or near known 
cultural or historical heritage sites. However, as a 
precaution, this OP is triggered in the event of 
chance finds of historical or cultural relics, which are 
numerous in Haiti, during works, soil sub-surface 
drilling or excavation. Chance finds language has 
been reflected in the ESMF. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 No 
The policy is not triggered because there are 
no groups in Haiti who meet the definition of 
IPs of OP 4.10. 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes The policy is triggered given that the project will be 



 

The World Bank  
Resilient Productive Landscapes in Haiti (P162908) 

 

 

  
Oct 25, 2017 Page 27 of 33  

 

funding the rehabilitation of existing rural 
roads/tracks, possibly new small infrastructures for 
water harvesting/storage which are usually placed 
along the roads or in gullies, as well as potential 
expansion of local offices of the Ministry of 
Agriculture. These construction works may require 
land acquisition leading to involuntary resettlement, 
including the loss of income sources and means of 
livelihood, such as the loss of fruit trees and crops. 
Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) will be 
prepared by the GOH with guidance from the Bank 
to address the triggering of OP 4.12. RPF will be 
consulted and disclosed by appraisal. Upon the 
identification of cases of involuntary resettlement, 
Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) or Abbreviated 
Resettlement Action Plans (Abbrev. RAPs) will be 
prepared, consulted and disclosed in accordance 
with the policy. 
 
Any activity that may potentially lead to changes in 
land-tenure agreements, result in the establishment 
of protected areas, or may cause restriction of 
access to natural resources will be excluded from 
the project. The environmental screening form, 
which will be part of the ESMF will also include 
questions on social risks and impacts. The PIU 
responsible staff received a training by the Bank on 
October 18 on how to screen OP 4.12 impacts. 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 No 
The project will not finance any activities related to 
dams or the operation of dams.  The ESMF will 
screen out any dam-related activity. 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

No 
The project will not be on international waters as 
defined under this policy. 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No 
The project does not take place in any Disputed 
Area. 

 
 

KEY SAFEGUARD POLICY ISSUES AND THEIR MANAGEMENT 

 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential 
large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
On the environmental side, there are no large scale, significant or irreversible impacts.  The interventions are largely 
soil conservation, tillage, tree planting and other soil enhancing activities.  Where there may be investments in 
infrastructure, these will be restricted to low impact public infrastructures such as rural and access roads, small 



 

The World Bank  
Resilient Productive Landscapes in Haiti (P162908) 

 

 

  
Oct 25, 2017 Page 28 of 33  

 

bridges for crossing rivers and water harvesting infrastructure.  Impacts will therefore be small and highly localized. 
Other negative impacts may be related to improper technology transfer (e.g. inadvertent propagation of exotic 
species, expansion of plantations in natural forests, water harvesting that impacts the water table) and so on.  These 
can be effectively screened out and monitored, reducing the risk associated with these activities. On the social side, 
there are no large scale, significant and irreversible impacts expected. 
 
The promotion of policy and plans under the project will promote sustainable development; however, the ESMF 
prepared for the project includes measures to ensure that policies and plans developed under the project do not have 
long term negative impacts.  
 
Also, activities undertaken by the Caribbean Biodiversity Fund, which will be capitalized by the project, will be subject 
to a screening mechanism derived from the Project ESMF in order to screen out any activities with considerable 
negative environmental impacts, or mitigate impacts to an acceptable level.  
 
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area: 
No potential indirect or long term environmental or social impacts are expected.  The environmental impacts will be 
small scale and limited in scope. The potential social impacts are described under OP 4.01 and OP 4.12. 
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts. 
In terms of the environment, the project focuses on improving the stability of slopes and enhancing the fertility of soils 
in Haiti by introducing trees, stabilizing vegetation and so on.  The types of vegetation to be considered will be 
carefully matched with the particular environment/climate related problem that is evident in a region. For example, 
one would plant deep rooted vegetation in some cases where slopes need to be stabilized.  These are the types of 
alternatives that have been discussed and will continue to be discussed throughout preparation.  In terms of financing 
infrastructure, the project focused on key infrastructure that would support climate resilience- for example, bridges to 
allow river crossings when the river level is high and so on. The chosen infrastructure (by the commune) will be 
screened to ensure that the type of infrastructure chosen does not have significant adverse impacts on the 
environment. 
 
On the social side, any activity that may potentially lead to changes in land-tenure agreements, result in the 
establishment of protected areas, or may cause restriction access to natural resources will be excluded from the 
project.  
 
Civil works to be financed under the project are expected to be mostly of small size, and efforts will be placed on 
minimizing any possible negative effect through solid preliminary studies  and screenings allowing to clearly identify 
areas of interventions, and ensuring the adequate design, use of appropriate construction materials, and construction 
techniques etc. 
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower 
capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The project team has prepared an ESMF, an IPMP and an RPF, which will be consulted and disclosed by appraisal.  The 
Ministry of Agriculture, MARNDR, the primary agency responsible for the implementation of the project, has managed 
other Bank-funded projects in the past and they have experience with Bank safeguards policies and instruments, 
especially on the environment side. MARNDR will be hiring a second safeguards specialist to monitor social risks and 
impacts under this project. The second ministry that will be involved in this project’s implementation, the Ministry of 



 

The World Bank  
Resilient Productive Landscapes in Haiti (P162908) 

 

 

  
Oct 25, 2017 Page 29 of 33  

 

Environment, does not have familiarity or capacity to implement social safeguards policies.   However, they have been 
closely involved in the preparation of the ESMF, IPMP and RPF. The safeguards implementation will be the 
responsibility of MARNDR, which will house the safeguards specialists.  
 
In the event that involuntary resettlement cannot be avoided by the necessary works, the Bank team will support the 
PIU to develop and implement Resettlement Action Plans. The project will develop a citizen engagement plan and a 
Grievance Redress Mechanism. The GRM ensures that complaints received are promptly reviewed in order to address 
project-related concerns. Additionally, communities and individuals who believe that they are adversely affected by a 
World Bank (WB) supported project may submit complaints to project-level grievance redress mechanism or the WB’s 
Grievance Redress Service (GRS). 
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, 
with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
The primary stakeholders of this project are smallholder farmers and families living in the selected watersheds 
targeted by the project, that depend on agricultural production for their livelihoods. Other key stakeholders along the 
agriculture value chains are service and input providers, buyers, and retailers.  The national, regional and local 
institutions that play a role in the landscape management and agriculture services are also important stakeholders for 
this project.  
 
The Project team will conduct consultations with a group of these stakeholders at the regions, that are tentatively 
identified at this stage. The ESMF and RPF will be consulted by appraisal. with key local actors (such as local 
government staff, farmers’ organizations, regional representatives of Ministry of Agriculture and Environment) in the 
tentatively identified municipalities.  Once the sites are identified, further detailed consultations that will take place 
with direct beneficiaries during project implementation.  People affected by involuntary resettlement will be 
consulted on compensation and resettlement policies in accordance with OP4.12.

Other Decision (as needed) 
 
 
B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 
 

1. Zambia is a lower-middle-income country with close to 16 million inhabitants. It had a Gross Domestic 
Product (GDP) of US$27.1 billion in 2015, equating to a per capita income of about US$1,300. Zambia 
has made significant socio-economic progress over the past two decades and achieved average growth 
of 7.4 percent between 2004 and 2014. However, since mid-2015 economic growth has slowed down 
considerably to 2.9% in 2015 and a forecasted 3.0 percent in 2016, as external headwinds and domestic 
pressures have intensified.  

2. In 2015, global economic conditions for growth deteriorated and the price of copper (typically 77 
percent of Zambia’s exports) fell further from its 2011 peak. This has put downward pressure on 
revenues, widening the fiscal deficit and reduced the value of exports, opening up a trade deficit. In 
addition, Zambia experienced domestic pressures in the form of: (i) repeat fiscal deficits (reducing 
confidence in the economy); (ii) reduced and delayed rainfall in 2015 (undermining agricultural incomes 
and lowering the water level in reservoirs); and (iii) increased power outages. Further, the strengthening 
of the US$ in 2015 put pressure on the Zambian Kwacha that combined with lower confidence so that 
the local currency lost 41% of its value against the US$. 

3. Close to the end of 2015 the government acted vigorously to contain the impact of ebbing confidence 
with monetary policy measures. These measures restored stability of the Kwacha, which appreciated by 
11.2 percent in the first 9 months of 2016, and helped curb inflation from its peak of 22.9 percent in 
February 2016 to 8.8 percent in November 2016. However, fiscal policy remained loose in 2016 and 
monetary policy has had to remain very tight, reducing liquidity, putting pressure on the financial sector, 
and causing a drag on growth.  

4. The August 2016 elections went in favor of the incumbent President and political party. After five 
elections in ten years the constitutional changes mean that a full five-year term is expected to be served, 
raising cautious optimism about the political space for reform in 2017 and over the medium-term. The 
Government has presented its economic recovery plan: “Zambia Plus” that provides a framework for 
restoring fiscal sustainability, closing the twin deficits and ensuring that structural reforms are carried 
out to boost the non-copper economy. The Government has requested the support of the World Bank, 
IMF and other partners to make it a success. Accordingly, GDP growth is forecast to rise to 4.0 percent in 
2017 and 4.2 percent in 2018. The forecasts are subject to upside and downside risks, but the return of 
investor confidence in the fourth quarter of 2016 (evidenced by over-subscribed bond auctions), bold 
measures by government (including the removal of fuel subsidies), and a rally in copper prices 
(November 2016), suggest that economic circumstances are improving.

5. The rapid and sustained growth achieved from the early 2000s to 2014 was insufficiently inclusive and 
despite the economy doubling in size, poverty remains widespread. As based on the 2015 Living 
Conditions Monitoring Survey Report of the Government’s Central Statistical Office, an estimated 54.4 
percent of Zambians live in extreme poverty (below US$1.90 per day, purchasing power parity terms) 
and poverty is higher among women. Rural poverty (at 76.6 percent) is more than three times the 23.4 
percent rate of urban poverty. The benefits of growth have accrued mainly to those already above the 
poverty line, inequality has remained high, and efforts are needed not only to restore the economy to 
faster growth, but ensure planned pro-poor policies are implemented and more inclusive growth 
follows. 

Sectoral and Institutional Context 
 

6. In Zambia’s Eastern Province (EP), the majority of the province’s 1.7 million people live in rural areas 
with livelihoods dependent on natural resources. As in Zambia as a whole, this rural population is 
characterized by high levels of poverty and addressing this challenge is the highest priority of the 
provincial administration. According to the World Bank’s Mapping Subnational Poverty in Zambia report, 
the Eastern Province is one of three poorest provinces in Zambia

1
. In addition, according to the Living 

Conditions and Monitoring Survey (2015), at 70 percent, the Eastern Province had the fourth highest 
proportion of population that was poor. The Zambian diet is mainly composed of cereals, predominantly 
maize, starchy roots and, to a lesser extent, fruit and vegetables. Cereals provide almost two-thirds of 
the dietary energy supply. According to the 2013-14 Zambia Demographic and Health Survey, the 
nutrition indicators for Eastern province stand at 43 percent for children under five who are stunted and 
20 percent of the women are overweight or obese (ZDHS, 2013-14).  Women and children are the most 
vulnerable to the problems related to nutrition because of their socioeconomic characteristics.  

7. Compounding the challenges of rural development in the EP is a changing climate, which models suggest 
will continue to change dramatically over the coming decades. The country is already experiencing 
climate-induced hazards. Droughts and floods have increased in frequency and intensity over the past 
few decades and have adversely impacted food and water security, water quality, energy generation, 
and livelihoods of people, especially in rural communities. Recent climate trends based on records from 
1960 to 2003 indicate that the mean annual temperature increased by 1.3 degrees Celsius, an average 
rate of 0.34 degrees Celsius per decade. Mean rainfall in Zambia has decreased by an average rate of 1.9 
mm/month (2.3 percent) per decade since 1960. The future trends in the country are towards a higher 
average temperature, a possible decrease in total rainfall, and some indication of more intense rainfall 
events. Zambia’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) report to the UNFCCC has estimated 
national GDP loss due to climate change over a 10-20 year mid-term planning horizon will be in the 
range of US$4,330-5,440 million with the following sector GDP losses: agriculture (US$2,200 – 3,130), 
energy-related (US$270 – 450), health (US$460), and natural resources (US$1,400).  
 

8. In addition to being subject to the impacts of climate change, Zambia contributes to global carbon 
emissions. According to the Second National Communication (SNC), the latest data available from the 
UNFCCC, annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Zambia have increased by 6.2 percent from 51.52 
million tons carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 1994 to 54.72 million tons CO2e in 2000. The largest 
contribution to GHG emissions in 2000 came from land use change and forestry, which accounted for

73.7 percent followed by agriculture at 18.9 percent. 
 

9. Addressing rural poverty and improving livelihoods, helping rural communities adapt to major impacts 
to be expected from climate change, and reducing national carbon emissions from the forest and land 
sector all require a carefully integrated landscape approach. Major sources of rural livelihoods in the EP 
are in agriculture, forestry, and wildlife, but all of these are inter-dependent and all are intertwined with 
climate change adaptation and mitigation. 

 
10. The Government of the Eastern Province is in the process of preparing a development vision in 

consultation with provincial stakeholders. The vision statement is “to improve rural livelihoods in Eastern 
Province by reducing deforestation and forest degradation using a low emission pathway through local 
community participation by 2030”. In order to address the challenges associated with the drivers of 
deforestation, local communities’ participation and commitments as well as private sector involvement 
will be critical in optimizing natural resources management at both communal and individual farmer 
levels. According to the vision, the targets for reducing drivers of deforestation include reducing the 
total annual area burnt from 16.7 percent to 5.0 percent by 2036 through forest fire management; 
establishment of a minimum of 3,000 hectares of plantations on deforested land by 2037; promoting 
ecotourism with community participation to combat poaching; and promoting soil fertility 
improvement, good agricultural practices, and land use planning among 40 percent of the farmers in the 
province to tackle food security and poverty at local level. The estimated financing investment to 
achieve these goals is US$140 million, part of which will be leveraging private sector investments and a 
significant part of which will be mobilization of additional financing for institutional strengthening and 
implementation of activities. The ZIFLP will contribute towards supporting activities for addressing the 
drivers of deforestation as stated in the vision. 
 

11. Institutionally, responsibilities for coordination of the national climate agenda falls to the Interim 
Climate Change Secretariat (ICCS), under the Ministry of National Development Planning (MNDP). The 
ICCS ensures coordination with the many other ministries and organizations which need to be engaged 
in a landscape-level livelihoods/climate change initiative such as this project. Responsibility for 
implementing projects is often with the line ministries. At the provincial level, the provincial 
administration of the Eastern Province exercises considerable control over activities in its jurisdiction, 
consistent with the recently adopted decentralization law of Zambia.

Key Results 
 

13. The achievement of the PDO will be measured using the following indicators i) Forest area brought 
under sustainable management practices as a result of the project (ha); ii) Land area under climate-
smart agricultural practices (ha); iii) Yield change for selected crops (%); and iv) People in targeted 
communities with increased monetary and non-monetary benefits (% share of which women). The 
project outcome and intermediate indicators are presented below in the Results Framework. 

 
D. Project Description  
 

14. The project aims to provide support to rural communities in the EP to allow them to better manage the 
resources of their landscapes so as to reduce deforestation and unsustainable agricultural expansion; 
enhance benefits they receive from forestry, agriculture, and wildlife; and reduce their vulnerability to 
climate change. The project must also invest in ensuring that enabling conditions are in place for these 
changes to happen – conditions such as tenure security, planning at different spatial scales, and capacity 
development. Simultaneously the project will create the enabling environment for emission reduction 
purchases to be made in a subsequent project. 

 
15. ZIFLP will promote the adoption of sustainable landscape management practices and climate-smart 

agriculture (CSA) as an alternative. Community empowerment, strengthening local and traditional 
governance and land use planning are the key to integrating, optimizing multiple land uses within the 
landscape. However, collective action is unlikely in the absence of rights to use, benefit from, and 
protect natural resources. Leverage for transforming the system will include village land use plans, 
improved governance, matching land use with land characteristics, and poverty reduction outcomes 
including emission reduction payments. This will require strong monitoring systems for 
livelihoods/economics, governance, the implementation of land use plans, and resources monitoring 
and protection. 

 
16. ZIFLP would finance activities under four components over a five-year period using funds from the 

BioCFplus-ISFL (US$8.0 million), GEF (US$8.05 million) and IDA (US$17.0 million). The project 
components include 1) Enabling Environment, 2) Livelihood and Low Carbon Investments, and 3) Project 
Management. A fourth component, with a zero budget, is included in the event funds need to be 
reallocated for an emergency response. 
 

17. Component 1: Enabling Environment. This first component is intended to help create conditions that 
will allow the livelihood investment of Component 2 to be successfully implemented. This entails 
supporting plans, partnerships, and regulatory conditions to help rural communities in the project area 
to have the capacity to adopt sustainable and low-carbon land management practices. The component 
would include support for (i) Developing integrated district development and local planning; and (ii) 
Establishing emissions reduction framework leading to an Emission Reduction Payment Agreement 
(ERPA) (for future results-based emissions reduction payments). Enabling environment interventions will 
be financed through grant support from the BioCarbon Fundplus-ISFL. 
 

18. Component 2: Livelihood and Low-Carbon Investments. Component 2 will finance on-the-ground 
activities that improve rural livelihoods, conserve ecosystems and reduce GHG emissions. It has 2 



 
The World Bank  
Zambia Integrated Forest Landscape Project (P161490) 

 

 

  
Dec 22, 2016 Page 7 of 18  

 

subcomponents: Agriculture and forestry management and Wildlife management. These activities will 
be financed by IDA, BioCFplus-ISFL and GEF resources. Although the subcomponents are sectoral in 
nature, the cross-sectoral and landscape approach of the planning activities that will underlie the 
activities will ensure a landscape approach is retained.  

 
19. Agriculture and forestry management. The objective of this subcomponent is to provide financing for 

interventions that increase agricultural productivity, enhance agro- and forest ecosystem resilience, 
reduce GHG emissions, and sequester carbon using a landscape approach. This subcomponent will cover 
the following activities: (i) scaling up of climate-smart agricultural practices; (ii) community forestry 
management; and (iii) land tenure and resource rights regularization, a pre-condition for the adoption of 
improved agriculture and forestry management. 

 
20. Climate smart agriculture. Interventions under climate smart agriculture will apply a train the trainers 

approach to introduce (i) conservation agriculture (CA) practices and integrated soil fertility 
management, (ii) agroforestry, and (iii) enhanced market access for smallholders and private sector 
engagement. In addition, the project supports community matching grants which can support livelihood 
interventions including climate-smart agriculture interventions, introducing small ruminants or poultry, 
supporting market access through agro-processing. Interventions will aim at enhancing the income and 
livelihood of the communities and farmer families through income generating and value added activities 
in the Eastern Province.  

 
21. Community forestry management. The objective of forestry management is to assist local communities 

and their organizations to improve the management and conservation of their natural resources, create 
income opportunities, and generate carbon benefits. This will be accomplished by developing and 
implementing participatory land and resource use planning and management–including fire control and 
prevention–and providing specialized technical assistance and training to identify viable investments 
from the sustainable production of timber and not-timber forest products. Activities to be supported 
will be consistent with the land and resource use plans developed at the village and district levels. The 
sub-component would finance specialized technical and extensions services, small works and 
equipment, operational costs and non-consultant services (e.g. workshops and study tours).  
 

22. Land tenure and resource rights regularization. The sub-component will provide analytical and 
technical assistance support to expand past and ongoing efforts at documenting land rights that could 
underpin adoption of sustainable low-carbon land management practices and private sector 
engagement.  Activities will feed into the National Land Titling Program, and will comprise (i) developing 
cost-effective systems to sustainably manage information on land rights and linking it to land use; (ii) 
identifying new possibilities of private sector engagement based on an assessment of the extent and 
impact of existing arrangements; (iii) documenting different types of land rights in ways that are 
supported by local stakeholders, and provide incentives for adoption of CSA, sustainable land use and 
intensification; and (iv) linking land rights to key parameters of land use (crop cover, soil moisture, soil 
carbon) using remotely sensed imagery.  

 
23. Wildlife management. This sub-component will have two major focus areas: i) improved management of 

the complex of protected areas centered on Lukusuzi National Park in the Eastern Province; and ii) 
adoption of improved management practices of wildlife at the community level, which can contribute to 



 
The World Bank  
Zambia Integrated Forest Landscape Project (P161490) 

 

 

  
Dec 22, 2016 Page 8 of 18  

 

improved livelihoods of targeted communities. The project will support (i) preparation of park 
management plans; (ii) investments in infrastructure such as guard houses or other park buildings, 
upgrading of existing roads and tracks to facilitate park management and ecotourism, provision of water 
holes, fencing (only in limited areas where judged necessary to minimize human-wildlife conflict, HWC); 
(iii) purchase of equipment such as radios for communication, park guard equipment, patrol equipment, 
etc.; and (iv) support to park patrols, with a particular focus on management of poaching. 

 
24. Component 3: Project management. This third component will finance activities related to national and 

provincial-level project coordination and management, including annual work planning and budgeting; 
fiduciary aspects (financial management and procurement); human resource management; safeguards 
compliance monitoring; M&E and impact assessment studies; and communication strategy and citizen 
engagement).   

 
25. Component 4: Contingent emergency response. This is a zero budget component which is included to 

facilitate the use of IDA funds in the event of a disaster and to be able to respond quickly to a potential 
government request to reallocate some funding from existing World Bank projects to provide 
emergency relief.  

 
E. Implementation 
 
Institutional and Implementation Arrangements 
 

26. The major investments of the ZIFLP will take place in the Eastern Province. However, there are activities 
such as those related to REDD+ policy, MRV, safeguards, etc. which are national in scope. 
Implementation of ZIFLP will therefore be at both the national and at the Eastern Province level. A 
National Project Unit (NPU) will be responsible for activities at the national level, and will be located 
within the Ministry of National Development Planning. At the provincial level, the Provincial 
Administration of the Eastern Province will be the executing agency of the project. This implementation 
arrangement aims to: (a) ensure sectoral mainstreaming of investment; (b) lessen the approval layers 
for faster decision-making, enabling more efficient project implementation; and (c) respect the 
constitutionally mandated decentralization process and governance structures at the national and 
provincial levels, to the extent possible.  

 
 

 
 
 .    
F. Project location and Salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 
 

Project location is the Eastern Province of Zambia. Wildlife conservation activities will focus on improved 
management of Lukusuzi National Park (and surrounding areas). The land planning, agriculture, and forestry 
investments will take place throughout the Province.

SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY 

 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

The policy is triggered as this is an integrated forest 
landscape project that will involve afforestation, 
reforestation, promotion of sustainable conservation 
farming methods as well as preservation of wildlife 
habitat in national parks and adjacent GMAs, all of 
which could have environmental or social impacts 
which must be assessed and managed. As a 
landscape management project its impacts are 
nonetheless expected to be overwhelmingly 
positive. 
 
The positive impacts of the program will be a 
reduction in greenhouse gas emissions with 
improved forest cover, rural livelihoods 
improvement, and wildlife conservation. The 
potential negative environmental impacts will be 
known with more specificity as project activities are 
identified during project implementation but are 
expected to be limited, localized, small-scale and not 
significant given that many of the on-the-ground 
project activities will be from community-driven 
development initiatives. An Environmental and 
Social Management Framework (ESMF) has been 
prepared to assess and guide the screening and 
mitigation of any negative impacts of the program. 
The project will monitor possible cumulative 
negative impacts and take action as needed. 

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 Yes 

The policy is triggered given the potential impacts on 
natural habitats either directly or indirectly, through 
REDD+ activities, conservation farming, and the 
management of wildlife habitats. The expected 
impact on habitats is overall positive. Changes in 
livelihoods of rural farmers, due to increased 
agriculture activities and the introduction of new 



 

The World Bank  
Zambia Integrated Forest Landscape Project (P161490) 

 

 

  
Dec 22, 2016 Page 10 of 18  

 

agricultural technologies, are likely to have limited 
negative impacts on natural habitats. The proposed 
avoidance and mitigation measures for these 
impacts are included in the project's ESMF. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 Yes 

The policy is triggered as the project forestry 
management activities seek to assist local 
communities and their organizations to improve the 
management and conservation of their forests. The 
project will have impacts on the health and quality 
of forests, will affect the rights and welfare of people 
and their level of dependence upon and interaction 
with forests, and aims to bring about changes in the 
management, protection, and utilization of natural 
forests. However, the project will not lead to 
significant conversion or degradation of critical 
forest areas or related critical natural habitats. There 
may be continuing intrusion of smallholder farming 
into natural forests in the project area but the 
overall purpose of the project investments is to limit 
such intrusions and never to promote them. The 
project's Environmental and Social Management 
Framework (ESMF) and Process Framework (PF) 
address the potential impact of the project on 
forests and/or the rights and welfare of local 
communities. 
Since the project potentially finances harvesting 
activities carried out by local communities under 
community or even possibly joint forest 
management, such communities will adhere to a 
time-bound phased action plan to achieve a 
standard of forest management developed with the 
meaningful participation of locally affected 
communities, consistent with the principles and 
criteria of responsible forest management as 
outlined in paragraph 10 of OP 4.36. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

The policy is triggered as increased agriculture 
activities and the adoption of new climate smart 
agriculture technologies could conceivably result in 
increased usage of agrochemicals by farmer 
beneficiaries. The project additionally will procure 
supplies and equipment for nurseries which may 
include pesticides. While a stand-alone Pest 
Management Plan (PMP) is not required for this 
project, the ESMF contains an abbreviated PMP to 
avoid usage of restricted pesticides, promote use of 



 

The World Bank  
Zambia Integrated Forest Landscape Project (P161490) 

 

 

  
Dec 22, 2016 Page 11 of 18  

 

personal protective equipment (PPE), training of 
producers in proper handling of agrochemicals, and 
to promote integrated pest management. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 Yes 

The policy is triggered as a preventative measure in 
the event of potential impacts on the known and 
currently unknown physical cultural resources (PCR) 
of the area. The ESMF contains measures for 
avoiding and managing impacts on known PCR in the 
project area as well as chance-find procedures in the 
event new resources are discovered in the course of 
project implementation. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 No 

The policy is not triggered as the proposed program 
activities in the Eastern Province of Zambia are in 
areas that do not include indigenous groups as 
defined by the policy. 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

OP 4.12 is triggered and applies mainly to certain 
activities relating to project interventions in 
protected areas. A Resettlement Policy Framework 
(RPF) was prepared in consultation with key 
stakeholders, consulted, and publicly disclosed. A 
Process Framework (PF) will also be required given 
that the project will support improved management 
of Lukusuzi National Park, adjacent GMAs and 
possibly other protected areas, thus potentially 
limiting access to resources. 
 
The PF is intended to avoid or minimize any adverse 
impacts upon local livelihoods and to support the 
development of alternative livelihoods as needed, 
on the lands already available to the affected 
households or communities. The project will support 
the preparation and implementation of follow-up 
action plans to provide livelihoods support where 
needed, following the criteria and procedures 
specified in the PF.  
 
The Zambian Government has recently resettled 
communities who encroached into Lukusuzi National 
park in the recent past. The Government has 
prepared and sent to the Bank a review of how the 
resettlements were carried out and an action plan to 
cover any remaining gaps that might remain. 
 
During the project, the Government could be 
required to continue to deal with those who have 



 

The World Bank  
Zambia Integrated Forest Landscape Project (P161490) 

 

 

  
Dec 22, 2016 Page 12 of 18  

 

already encroached into the park, or with new 
encroachers. If the project will in any way be 
associated with new resettlements, this would have 
to be done in strict accordance with the RFP. 
Additionally, the PF outlines the process of dealing 
with such situations following the Zambian laws, the 
provisions of the PF in accordance with OP 4.12, as 
well as international best practices.  
 
The Land tenure and resource rights regularization 
activities will be informed by and will be 
complementary to the PF and RPF as appropriate. 
 
All project-supported civil works (such as 
construction of office space, staff accommodations, 
and ranger posts) will be on government, public, or 
voluntarily donated community lands. This will be 
verified through the environmental and social 
screening mechanism specified in the ESMF, before 
any civil works commence. 
 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 No 

The policy on the Safety of Dams is not triggered as 
the project will not involve the construction of water 
retention structures that are likely to pose potential 
hazards to human or animal health and safety. The 
project will not fund any dams as defined in OP 4.37 
that would trigger the requirements of the policy. 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

No 

The policy for Projects on International Waterways is 
not triggered as the proposed activities will not 
potentially impact any shared international 
waterway. Any conceivable increase in water use 
and direct abstraction of water resources in the 
Luangwa watershed will be of low significance and of 
local impact only. 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No 
The Bank policy on Projects in Disputed Areas is not 
triggered by the project, as it is not located in any 
disputed territory of the country.

KEY SAFEGUARD POLICY ISSUES AND THEIR MANAGEMENT 

 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential 
large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
While there are environmental and social safeguard issues associated with the proposed project, no large-scale, 
significant, or irreversible negative impacts are foreseen. In general, the project is expected to generate positive, 
environmentally friendly land management practices including climate-smart agriculture and implementation of 
national park management plans. However, the project takes place in and could conceivably negatively impact natural 
habitats, protected areas, and forests. Additionally, as a project with an agricultural component, there are safeguard 
issues related to pesticide use. In all these cases, activities are largely community and demand-driven, and potential 
impacts are small-scale and localized. There may be cumulative impacts from these small-scale activities which will 
need monitoring. 
 
Zambia in the past has resettled persons illegally encroaching into national parks, including from Lukusuzi National 
Park, to be supported under the project. There could be possibilities of dealing with encroachment in the life of this 
project. The Government has conducted a review of how resettlement was carried out in the past in Lukusuzi NP as 
well as a gap analysis to identify any additional measures that may be needed to ensure compliance with both 
Zambian law and World Bank requirements. Any resettlement carried out during the project will be subject to the 
project's Resettlement Policy Framework. Additionally, the Process Framework (PF) outlines the process of dealing 
with limiting access to resources, following Zambian laws and the provisions of the PF in accordance with OP 4.12, as 
well as international best practices. 
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area: 
No negative long-term impacts are expected. As mentioned, a potentially indirect impact due to increased or new 
agricultural practices may be increased pesticide use but since such activities are largely community and demand-
driven, these issues are small scale and localized. The project will also support livelihood restoration activities and 
sustainable community forestry, which in turn is expected to be beneficial to the local communities. 
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts. 
In order to achieve the project objectives of promoting landscape management in the Eastern Province, in agricultural, 
forestry, and wildlife sectors, no project alternatives were identified that would further minimize environmental or 
social impacts and still allow for achievement of project objectives. 
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower 
capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The borrower has developed an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF), a Resettlement Policy 
Framework (RPF), and a Process Framework (PF) in order to address safeguard policy issues. Specifically for issues 
related to the resettlement of encroachers out of Lukusuzi National Park, the Government has prepared a review and 
action plan. Although not related to potential impacts of the project activities, it should also be noted that the project 
includes significant funding to support the preparation of the safeguard instruments that will be needed to advance 
toward signature of an Emissions Reduction Purchase Agreement, in the context of REDD+. 
 
The Interim Climate Change Secretariat, under the Ministry of National Development Planning is currently 



 

The World Bank  
Zambia Integrated Forest Landscape Project (P161490) 

 

 

  
Dec 22, 2016 Page 14 of 18  

 

implementing the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR) in the Western Province of Zambia. Hence, the 
implementation unit has good knowledge of safeguards and of implementation requirements. At present there is a 
knowledgeable Environmental and Social Safeguards Officer with proven experience with implementing management 
measures in line with World Bank safeguard policies. Safeguards capacity is much more limited or absent in the 
provincial administration unit; staff will need to be hired or training will need to be provided. Safeguards training 
needs have been identified in the ESMF, which would be provided through the technical assistance component of this 
project. 
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, 
with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
Citizen engagement and participation for the project’s implementation will build on the various multi-stakeholder 
consultations that have taken place in the Eastern province during project preparation, and will take account of 
existing communication structures.  
 
Specifically, the project collaborates with stakeholders regularly through the following channels: project preparation 
missions, Monthly REDD+ Working Group meetings organized by the Interim Climate Change Secretariat and Forestry 
Department and Chipata Round Table meetings. The Chipata Roundtable was established to provide a forum for 
government and non-governmental stakeholders to discuss major environmental threats to the Luangwa Valley 
ecosystem, and is chaired by the Permanent Secretary, with active participation of chiefs and civil society. The 
Roundtable will likely be expanded to cover the entire Eastern Province. The ICCS will also develop a clear consultation 
and participation plan and protocols to be operationalized during implementation of this project, to ensure that all 
relevant stakeholders are targeted by the project.

B.   Introduction and Context

Country Context
Maldives and eleven other countries border the waters of the South West Indian Ocean (SWIO) 
➢❨  the island nations of Comoros, Madagascar, Mauritius and Seychelles; and seven mainland 
countries: France, Kenya, Mozambique, Somalia, South Africa, Tanzania and Yemen. Together 
these countries are members of the South West Indian Ocean Fisheries Commission (SWIOFC), a 
regional fisheries body. The SWIO marine fisheries are part of a larger marine ecosystem shared 
by all countries of the region. They are a regional public good, whose health and sustainability 
require regional coordination to limit the negative and enhance the positive externalities yielded 
by national activities, especially on the migratory fish species, such as tuna. Conservation and 
sustainable harvesting of the regional public goods in particular, and the shared ecosystem in 
general are central to the economy of the island countries in SWIO region.  
 
Fisheries sector accounts for a substantial portion of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the SWIO 
countries. Seafood export from these countries was approximately US$2.7 billion in 2014. Local 
industrial fisheries (mainly shrimp) and tuna processing constitute a substantial part of 
employment, income and foreign exchange earnings. Aquaculture and recreational fishing (sport 
fishing and diving) are rapidly growing industries and growing source of revenues in several of 
these countries. Fisheries, especially small-scale and subsistence fisheries play an important role 
for the livelihoods of estimated 107 million people living within 100 kilometers of the coast in the 
SWIO countries. They are often among the most vulnerable communities with high exposure to 
climate change impacts. The fisheries sector is a major contributor to nutritional health and food 
security in the SWIO region, especially for poor coastal communities with limited alternatives to 
fish for animal protein, as well as essential nutrients, vitamins, minerals and trace elements. 
 
Maldives, comprising of 26 atolls of 1,190 small coral islands of which 188 are inhabited by a 
local population of 338,434, has successfully built on its extraordinary natural assets to promote 
growth and socio-economic development. This was achieved mainly by developing a successful 
high-end tourism sector, whose sizeable rents have been redistributed to the population to address 
its development challenges. GDP per capita increased from US$268 in 1980 to US$7,681 in 2014 
(highest in South Asia), mainly driven by tourism and non-tradable tourism related activities. 
Incidence of poverty in Maldives is in line with that of an upper middle-income country, and its 
human development index is second only to Sri Lanka among the countries in South Asia. The 
share of the population living with less than US$1.25 a day was 4.9 percent in 2010, whereas the 
corresponding share using the US$2 a day poverty line was 17.02 percent in 2010. 
  
Despite this outstanding performance, the pace of poverty reduction has been below potential; and 
the level of inequality remains a major challenge. Limited job opportunities and skill-
endowments, especially for women and youth might have played an important role in limiting 
contribution of growth to poverty reduction. In particular, lack of growth in fisheries is an 
important cause of the limited impact of growth to poverty reduction, especially in the atolls away 
from MalÃ©.   
 
The World Bank➢❨ s Systematic Country Diagnostic, 2015 (SCD) provides a snapshot of the 
inherent vulnerabilities of Maldives➢❨  development program including immediate concerns 
about the fiscal, environmental and social sustainability. Due to its macro-economic vulnerability, 
given the small size, it is important to look for economic diversification away from tourism and

heavy reliance on imports; and to promote an inclusive development of the labor market with 
particular opportunities for women and youth. There is a need to augment climate-proofing of the 
economy as climate change could cause annual economic losses of more than 12 percent of GDP 
by 2100. Emphasis on environment and natural resources management, especially preventing 
damage and pollution of the coral reefs is important to sustain and increase climate resilience of 
tourism and fisheries, the crucial components of the national economy.
Sectoral and institutional Context
An estimated 28 percent of the SWIO regional fish stocks are over-exploited or depleted 
(especially the high-value resources, such as shrimp, lobster, and sea cucumber). A further 40 
percent of stock are fully exploited (SWIOFC, 2011) from overfishing by industrial vessels and 
artisanal fishers, and widespread use of destructive equipment and techniques (such as dynamite 
or beach seines). Critical ecosystems, already weakened by land-based pollution are further 
endangered by loss of biodiversity, and destruction of coral reefs and mangroves; and 
consequently the coastal resource base is acutely threatened. As a result, it was estimated that 
SWIO coastal states incurred annual losses of US$225 million in 2008. Furthermore, a weak 
investment and business climate, coupled with limited or underperforming infrastructure and 
services, significantly constrain industrial and artisanal private sector development.  
 
As small-scale fisheries modernize, the limited potential of many coastal fisheries will require 
that fishing effort be reduced to become sustainable. This will generally translate into fewer 
vessels or jobs in harvesting operations, and require that attention be devoted to alternative 
livelihood opportunities in post-harvest value addition, aquaculture, and recreational fisheries or 
in other sectors. Reduction or elimination of destructive fishing is also a significant governance 
and social challenge.  
 
The fisheries sector in the SWIO is already largely regional, with each country➢❨ s decision 
affecting other countries➢❨  activities. In particular, large national investments, such as ports, 
fishing fleets, or processing plants, are competing against each other. Regional coordination is 
therefore needed to avoid conflicts and suboptimal sectoral investments, and to promote equitable 
distribution of wealth. Furthermore, several technical aspects of the sector are regional in nature 
(e.g., monitoring, control and surveillance, safety at sea), and their implementation, at the least, 
has to be coordinated at a regional level. The countries also face common constraints with regard 
to their fisheries sector: weak governance, weak human and institutional capacity, and a fragile 
business environment. The SWIO countries will therefore benefit from addressing these 
challenges jointly. They already use regional platforms to share their experience in implementing 
more sustainable and economically viable fisheries policies and practices, including the Indian 
Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) and SWIOFC. Greater regional cohesion will enhance the 
countries➢❨  voice in international fora as well as in negotiating fishing-related agreements, 
where decisions made have significant impacts on the fisheries sector of the SWIO countries. 
 
The SWIO countries have repeatedly called for attention to regional collaboration in the sector, 
recognizing the important contribution by the marine fisheries to regional and national goals: 
poverty reduction, food security, economic growth, balance of payments, and the value of natural 
capital. In response, major donors (the European Union, EU; France; the Global Environment 
Facility, GEF; and the World Wide Fund for Nature, WWF) and the World Bank have all 
supported regional fisheries programs in the recent past.  Consolidating and expanding past 
projects and analytical advice, the World Bank committed in-principle to finance the multiple

South West Indian Ocean Fisheries Governance and Shared Growth (SWIOFish) series of 
projects (SOP) in 2015. Three consecutive series of projects are expected: SWIOFish Phase 1 
during 2015-21 (hereafter referred as the SWIOFish SOP); SWIOFish Phase 2 during 2022-27; 
and SWIOFish Phase 3 during 2028-32. Under the first series, the First South West Indian Ocean 
Fisheries Governance and Shared Growth Project (SWIOFish1) was approved in 2015 (covering 
Comoros, Mozambique, Tanzania and the Indian Ocean Commission). The second project 
covering Madagascar and the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission) and the third project covering 
Seychelles are expected to be approved in 2017. Maldives is the fourth planned project in the 
SWIOFish, to be followed by similar country-level projects in Somalia, Mauritius and Kenya (all 
expected to be approved in FY18). 
 
At the national level, the fisheries sector is a critical contributor to the national economy and an 
important economic activity in all of Maldives➢❨  inhabited islands. In 2015, primary fisheries 
accounted directly for 1.4 percent of GDP {excluding manufacturing (3.5% of GDP); wholesale 
and retail trade (4.7%) and transport (8.7%) where fisheries has a major role} and 11 percent of 
employment. The sector generated US$140 million in export revenue in 2015 (and a high of US
$161 million 2013), which is amost all of Maldives physical exports. Although the relative 
importance of the fisheries sector has declined since the late 1970s (due to the rapid growth of 
tourism), its role in the economy remains significant, including in providing food and nutrition 
security and as a source of livelihood and employment in remote islands without a major tourism 
facility. In the atolls away from MalÃ©, 30 percent of the household heads work in fisheries.  
 
Although the country benefits from vast fishing resources spread over 923,000 square kilometer 
of exclusive economic zone (EEZ), the total fish catch has declined from 185,923 tons in 2005 to 
127,350 tons by 2015; and direct employment reduced from around 14,000 in 2001 to less than 
9,000 persons now. The bulk of fisheries catch (up to 95 percent) are skipjack and yellowfin tuna. 
The Maldivian tuna is considered a premium product due to high quality fish stocks, pristine 
water, and sustainable fishing methods. Reef fishes, which account for 5 (average) to 16 percent 
(in low ➢❨ tuna years➢❨ ) of catch are mainly used for domestic consumption and supply to 
resorts, but export is rising (especially for grouper, sea-cucumber and aquarium fish). The tuna 
fishery, especially the skipjack ➢❨ pole and line➢❨  fishery has been recognized as one of the 
most environmentally responsible fishery operations in the world (certified by the Marine 
Stewardship Council, MSC), a dimension that has helped maintain the higher than usual export 
prices in recent past. 
 
Sustainable and diversified development of the fisheries sector is part of the Government of 
Maldives➢❨  vision, which encourages economic growth based on a diversified economy and 
aims at increased job opportunities. The Ministry of Fisheries and Agriculture (MoFA), with 
support from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), is preparing a Master Plan for 
Sustainable Fisheries to: (a) update and implement fisheries management plans including 
diversification; (b) strengthen the country➢❨ s monitoring, control and surveillance systems; (c) 
establish a better knowledge of the impacts of climate change on the fisheries sector; (d) reduce 
the excessive use of live bait in tuna fishery; and (e) address the heavy exploitation of export-
oriented reef fishery.  
 
The business-as-usual (BAU) scenario suggests that the fishery sector is threatened, and the 
income and jobs from the sector is at risk. The challenges of the fisheries sector are threefold. 
First, given the dependence of so many island people on fisheries, sustenance of capture fishery at 



Page 5 of 18

about 120,000 tons and maintaining an export of about 60 percent of the catch are important for 
the national income and welfare of fishers and their families. Measures, such as compliance with 
the IOTC recommendations on improved surveillance and monitoring, or improved monitoring 
and generation of evidence to justify continuation of MSC certification, will be important to 
sustain exports and premium export prices. Operationalization of the Government of Maldives➢❨  
decision to focus on all value-added processing of tuna, and a quality control limit for tuna fishing 
are also required. Other challenges include inefficient use of infrastructure, inadequate 
distribution, and lack of access to finance to invest in fisheries value chains. 
 
Second, there is a need to ensure sustainability of live-bait and reef fishing. The high value tuna 
fisheries sector is dependent on live-baits and reef ecosystem. Excessive reef fishing as well as 
capture of live-baits (for tuna fisheries) is considered threats to coral reefs. Anecdotal evidence 
suggests that capture of groupers is already unsustainable. Diversification and consequent 
(partial) shift away from capture fishery is important on three accounts: (a) to minimize impacts 
on coral reefs, and to sustain the reef fish population, especially groupers; (b) ensure sustenance 
of the capture fishery to protect jobs and income of most of the households who are currently 
engaged in fisheries and associated vocations; and create alternatives for households who will not 
be able to continue in capture fishery; and, (c) to create dependable income and growth 
opportunities for communities and individuals who have gradually been excluded from the 
mainstay tuna fishing and related local processing operations, and who are involved in 
opportunistic reef fishing.  
 
The opportunities for diversification are, however, limited. Mariculture appears to be the only 
substantial opportunity, for benefiting the communities, reducing the excessive pressure from reef 
or bait fishing; and providing meaningful employment opportunities for individuals, including 
women and youth currently outside the gainfully employed workforce. Some initial mariculture 
works had been experimented so far: with pearl oysters, Maldivian clownfish, and brown marbled 
groupers. A private aquaculture farm is producing sea cucumbers, producing the larvae in 
hatcheries before growing them in lagoons. The future development of mariculture, however, is 
hindered by limited availability of fingerlings/juveniles, feed, financing and appropriate 
technology.  
 
Third, inclusive development of fisheries sector is important for substantive job creation. Towards 
this, mariculture, diversified capture of relatively deep-sea species and aquarium fishery appear to 
be ideal for Maldives. These have the potential to grow, and contribute to the reduction of 
unemployment among inhabitants of remote atolls. In implementing such a program, however, 
special attention needs to be given to the establishment of gender sensitive policy and regulatory 
framework, the establishment of benefit sharing mechanisms for the natural resources to be 
managed and, capacity building of atoll councils and small businesses. 
 
While Maldives➢❨  fisheries sector represents an undeniable engine of inclusive growth for the 
country, its sustainability and future will depend on three important and interrelated factors: (a) 
better and more transparent governance over fishing through all aspects of the value chain 
including post-harvest processing; (b) ensuring that greater value is captured across the value 
chain and that wealth generation opportunities are shared with marine resources dependent 
communities, especially youth and women; and (c) improved livelihoods and meaningful income 
opportunities for communities in the remote atolls, who should squarely be at the center of future 
sustainable mariculture development efforts.

Fisheries in Maldives is intricately connected with the wellbeing of the regional fishery stock. In 
spite of using sustainable fishing practices, the capture of tuna has come down from 184,000 tons 
to 127,000 tons ➢❨  arguably due to the diminishing stock in the Indian Ocean as a whole. In 
recent years, Maldives was focusing on yellowfin tuna as one way of offsetting the reducing catch 
of skipjack tuna. In spite of practicing sustainable fishing in the Maldivian waters, the yellowfin 
tuna population in the Indian Ocean Region has shrunk, and the IOTC has now specified reduced 
quota for yellowfin catch. It is evident that these regional level issues have had implication at the 
national level. The tuna stock in the Indian Ocean is somewhat at risk, and it is expected that tuna 
catch will reduce further in the coming years.  
 
The best option for Maldives is to work with other countries to ensure sustainable practices over 
all of the Indian Ocean Region. At the same time, Maldives needs to (a) augment its own systems, 
procedures, compliance mechanisms, and skills to retain the ➢❨ environmentally sustainable➢❨  
branding to capture premium price in international markets, and (b) offer to share the knowledge 
of its own systems, procedures, compliance mechanisms, and the ➢❨ environmentally 
sustainable➢❨  fishing technology to the other countries. By demonstrating higher capture of 
value and premium price, Maldives can demonstrate to the other countries that conservation 
indeed pays.  
 
Nevertheless, Maldives will need to grow, and this need threatens other parts of the ecosystem 
even if tuna fishing is at the current sustainable level. Maldives cannot afford to espouse the cause 
of conservation of tuna fishery (in its own waters and in the region) and at the same t ime destroy/
diminish reef fishery. Therefore, diversification into mariculture and consequent (partial) shift 
away from capture fishery (in particular for new entrants) is important on two accounts: (a) to 
minimize impacts on coral reefs, and to sustain the reef fish population, especially groupers; (b) to 
create dependable income and growth opportunities for communities and future generations, 
especially women who had been gradually excluded from the mainstay tuna fishing and related 
local processing operations, and youth who are involved in opportunistic reef fishing. The agenda 
of conservation of reef and waters, reef fishery, and development of mariculture as the best 
diversification option, therefore are closely linked to the regional conservation agenda.  
 
As discussed above, a Regional IDA investment in Maldives is a crucial part of the SWIOFish 
SOP. SWIOFish1 and SWIOFish2 mention specific investment in Maldives. Maldives is currently 
co-chairing (and will take over as chair in 2017) the SWIOFC, and is participating in the 
SWIOFish Bureau meetings, the Scientific Committee Meetings, meetings of the Working Group 
on Fisheries Data and Statistics, meetings of the Working Party on Cooperation and Coordination 
in Tuna Fisheries; and the overall SWIOFC meetings including annual SWIOFC Sessions ➢❨  all 
supported by SWIOFish1. Maldives also benefits from SWIOFish1 regional support to develop a 
National Observer Program, in line with the IOTC➢❨ s recommendations, to eventually be able to 
participate in the SWIOFC Countries➢❨  Regional Observers Program. Under SWIOFish2, 
Maldives will benefit from training by IOTC Secretariat➢❨ s technical teams to better implement 
Maldives➢❨  international fisheries obligations under the IOTC, such as the Port States➢❨  
Measures to combat Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated fishing. 
 
In essence, an investment in sustainable fisheries resources development in Maldives will be 
beneficial to the countries in South-West Indian Ocean region, due to (i) economies of scale from

shared infrastructure, technologies, and knowledge; (ii) positive externalities yielded by national 
activities to avoid the ➢❨ tragedy of the commons➢❨  scenario; (iii) addressing common 
constraints jointly through regional platforms and workshops; (iv) greater regional cohesion in the 
international fora as well as in negotiations of fishing-related agreements where decisions need to 
be collective and impacts are shared; and, (v) upgraded value-chain linkages by collectively 
helping their fisheries sector integrate into more competitive value chain.

C.  Proposed Development Objective(s)

Development Objective(s)
To improve management of fisheries at regional and national levels including support to establish 
mariculture in targeted atolls in the Maldives.

Key Results 
The project seeks to achieve the following key results: 
(a) Compliance rate of SWIO countries with IOTC resolutions (Regional-level Indicator; 
same as SWIOFish2 indicator)  
(b) Vessels complying with IOTC and European Union requirements on monitoring and 
reporting (Regional-level Indicator) 
(c) Value of production from mariculture 
(d) Direct project beneficiaries (of which share of female beneficiaries) 
(e) Share of target beneficiaries with rating ➢❨ satisfied➢❨  or above on project 
interventions.

D.  Project Description

The proposed project is the fourth in the SWIOFish SOP. As articulated in the SOP description, a 
central thrust of the SOP is that while the challenges are regional in nature, addressing them 
requires action at the national level, which will yield regional benefits, enhance ownership and 
efficiency, and strengthen national institutions to help enhance the overall health of fisheries in 
the region. The project components are directly linked to the wellbeing of the regional fishery 
stock. Other than ➢❨ Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation➢❨ , the project will 
consist of two components ➢❨  one will focus on improving the currently inadequately managed 
capture fishery, and the other one will support diversifying the fisheries economy so that 
sufficient jobs and income are created outside capture fishery to reduce stress on the regionally 
shared fish stock. Both components will build improved resilience in Maldives.  
 
Component A: Augmentation of Institutional Capacity for Marine Fisheries Management. This 
component seeks to enhance the Government➢❨ s capacity to implement a more effective 
monitoring of fisheries sector and internal control system of key marine fisheries value chains, 
and will focus on delivery of the Indian Ocean Regional agenda (as well as the intended 
adaptation agenda) of improving the overall fisheries management, marine zoning for long-term 
benefits, and a longer-term plan to establish and operationalize in-country skill and capacity 
building activities, essential for sustenance and growth of the fishery sector in Maldives. The four 
sub-components include: (A1) Development of key fisheries management and planning 
instruments including updating fisheries policy and legislative framework, zoning covering the 
entire Maldivian EEZ, and support to grouper fish management, coral reef and reef fishery 
management plans which are essential for regional conservation and improved compliance with

IOTC recommended conservation and management measures; (A2) Development and 
implementation of fisheries management activities to ensure  compliance with IOTC and EU 
requirements, including expanded MCS, vessel registration and monitoring systems, electronic 
observer systems and augmentation of related reporting systems for commercial marine fisheries; 
collaboration with the SWIO Sub-Regional Fisheries Monitoring Centers; and, support and 
facilitation to regional agencies and international actors on the common agenda of conservation 
and management measures; (A3) Support to long-term program for fisheries management 
including sampling programs for tuna and recreational fish species, stock assessments and 
conservation zone surveys which will contribute to regional assessments and subsequent actions; 
and preparation of protocols disease surveillance, and quality control of brood stocks and fish 
feed; (A4) Fisheries sector capacity building including short and medium-term training, 
development of curriculum and teaching aids, collaboration with National Geographic 
Information System (GIS), and development and operation of a fisheries management information 
system ➢❨  all focusing on strengthening local and national skills that will contribute to national 
and SWIO Region agenda related to fishery management and consequent diversification into 
mariculture.  
 
Component B: Support to Mariculture and Diversification of Fisheries. Potential economic 
growth from diversification of capture fishery and from mariculture are pre-requisites for 
sustenance of the capture fishery resources in the Maldivian EEZ. However, mariculture is 
nascent in Maldives; and to be able to develop this sector, research, demonstration and provision 
of extension services will play key roles in addition to the three primary inputs: seeds, feed and 
access to finance. The four sub-components, therefore, include:  (B1) Development and 
demonstration of mariculture production and technology package, including completion and 
operationalization of, and preparation of medium-term operations plans and service standards for 
the Maniyafushi research and development facility (MRDF) as a center of excellence for the 
entire SWIO region; development and demonstration of technology packages for mariculture 
species; and market studies in support of mariculture choices; (B2) Promotion of mariculture out-
grower schemes and seafood growth clusters, including assessment of carrying capacity and 
supporting community custodianship of the coral reef resources, start-up investments including 
training, advisory support and compliance monitoring in out-grower farms, technical support to 
small enterprises for establishing out-grower contractual arrangements between small producers 
and larger private sector aggregators, and studies to help develop gender actions in mariculture; 
(B3) Supporting design, construction and operation of a multi-species hatchery including breeder 
stock development programs and professional training plans; and, (B4) Scoping of long-term 
marine fisheries diversification studies including planning and scoping of studies related to 
technology packages and conservation plans for new marine species to be explored in future.  
 
 
Component C: Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation (US$2.15 million).  This 
component would provide equipment, technical assistance, training, and incremental operating 
cost to strengthen the overall administrative capacity and capability of the Ministry of Fisheries 
and Agriculture and its Project Management Unit (PMU) to manage, implement, and monitor and 
evaluate project activities. Specifically, support will include staffing and operation of the PMU; 
establishment of adequate financial management and procurement management systems; 
implementation of the communication plan and grievance redress activities; monitoring and 
evaluation (M&E) and third party audits; preparation and implementation of specific 
environmental impact assessments as per the national laws; coordination with other ministries

E.  Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis (if known)

Maldives is an island nation in the Indian Ocean oriented north-south off India's Lakshadweep 
Islands. The Maldives consists of 1,192 coral islands grouped in a double chain of 26 atolls. The 
country➢❨ s atolls encompass a territory spread over roughly 90,000 square km, making it one of 
the world's most geographically dispersed countries.  Of the 1,192 islands, 188 are inhabited by 
the country➢❨ s population, with an average of 5-10 islands in each atoll being inhabited islands 
that have infrastructure such as housing, roads and other facilities built in. The country➢❨ s total 
land area is estimated to approximately 300 square km, with islands varying in size from 0.5 to 
5.0 square km. A significant number of uninhabited islands in each atoll have also been converted 
to resorts and tourism facilities as well as house infrastructure such as industrial facilities and 
airports. 
 
The atolls are composed of live coral reefs and sand bars, situated atop a submerged ridge 960km 
long that rises abruptly from the depths of the Indian Ocean. Maldives is noted as the country 
placed at the lowest elevation in the world, with maximum and average natural ground levels of 
only 2.4 m and 1.5 m above sea level, respectively. More than 80 per cent of the country's land is 
composed of coral islands which rise less than one meter above sea level. The islands consist of 
coral, sea grass, seaweed, mangrove and sand dune ecosystems which are of great ecological and 
socio-economic significance. Maldives is home to a number ecologically sensitive marine habitats 
in shallow and intertidal zones which have been designated as protected areas by the Ministry of 
Environment and Energy (MEE) and these regions and any activities in their vicinity are 
stringently monitored and managed. 
 
Climatic conditions in the Maldives belong to the tropical-monsoon category with temperatures 
ranging between 24Â°C and 33Â°C throughout the year. Climatic conditions in the Maldives is

predominantly affected by the large landmass of South Asia situated to the north. The presence of 
this landmass causes differential heating of land and water. These factors set off a rush of 
moisture-rich air from the Indian Ocean over South Asia, resulting in the southwest monsoon. 
Two seasons dominate Maldives' weather: the dry season associated with the winter northeastern 
monsoon and the rainy season which brings strong winds and storms. The shift from the dry 
northeast monsoon to the moist southwest monsoon occurs during April and May and the 
southwest monsoon Maldives in the beginning of June and lasts until the end of August. Annual 
rainfall averages 254cm in the north and 381cm in the south, with the southern region 
experiencing more rain.  
 
The project focuses on the whole nation. The island of Maniyafushi where the project will finance 
the augmentation of the infrastructure of the Maniyafushi Research Centre, is an uninhabited 
island and the airport island located in South MalÃ© Atoll, where the physical infrastructure has 
already been set up. The establishment and subsequent operation of mariculture out grower farms 
(in the remote northern atolls, selected specifically to avoid any potential impacts corals and water 
quality).

II. Implementation
Institutional and Implementation Arrangements
The Ministry of Fisheries and Agriculture (MoFA) has the mandate, jurisdiction and experience in 
managing fisheries, and will lead project implementation. The MoFA has implemented or 
participated in implementation of Bank-financed projects several years ago, not in the recent past. 
While MoFA has a large mandate, it has limited staff. A dedicated Project Management Unit (PMU) 
has therefore been established within MoFA, with adequate number of technical staff, including 
expert staff on mariculture development, extension, research, and market studies; environmental and 
social management; financial management, procurement, communication, monitoring and evaluation. 
 
The responsibilities of MoFA including the Steering Committee include providing national policy 
and implementation framework; approval of the project and securing the required budget from the 
Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MoFT); approval of the project➢❨ s overall annual action plans 
and annual budgets; and overall implementation oversight. MoFA will ensure that most of the project 
activities are duly executed by its regular divisions and field offices. MoFA has also prepared a 
Project Implementation Plan (PIP), which describes the project activities and their estimated costs, 
allocation of implementation responsibilities, procurement and financial management arrangements 
and plans, to guide implementation. 
 
The PMU mimics the organizational structure of the MoFA. This is important because: (a) the actual 
execution of project activities will take place using the MoFA divisions and their field offices, and a 
clear coordination between the PMU and the relevant MoFA division is needed, as PMU staff will be 
deputed in those divisions and field offices; (b) an appropriate part of the additional expertise and 
staff recruited under the PMU will be absorbed in the respective MoFA divisions at closure of the 
project for long-term improvement of institutional capacity; (c) even if most of the staff will be

recruited from market (including expatriate consultants given the shortage of qualified fisheries 
experts in Maldives), the organizational structure of the PMU will allow MoFA to depute permanent 
staff of regular divisions to the PMU in a manner that staff can make career progressions and based 
on performance can return to their parent divisions when the deputation is over.  
 
The PMU will be responsible for project implementation, facilitating statutory clearances, including 
environmental permits; procurement of works, goods and services; and implementation of specific 
capacity building activities as per the PIP. PMU staff working on procurement, financial 
management, knowledge management, monitoring and evaluation will be located in MalÃ© while all 
other PMU functions, including fisheries management, fisheries compliance, marine research, and 
mariculture will be co-located with the MoFA divisions at MalÃ© or at the field (including at the 
offices of Island Councils) and/or the offices of MRC, MRDF, or the site of the multi-species 
hatchery. The PMU, through its marine research, fisheries management, and compliance cells, will 
support MoFA for its retained role in coordinating with IOC, IOTC, SWIO Region countries; and 
through its central cell, will provide research and logistics support to MoFA in its incoming role of 
chairing the SWIOFC. 
 
The PMU will collaborate with and seek support and partnerships with a range of other agencies to 
strengthen the capacity of the main implementing actors. These will include international knowledge 
centers, including the World Aquaculture Alliance; academic and research institutes including the 
Maldives National University; private sector business houses and industries including the Maldives 
National Chamber of Commerce and Industry; civil society groups, atoll level community 
organizations and other government departments responsible for development and protection of 
marine resources (such as the Ministry of Environment and Energy).

III. Safeguard Policies that might apply

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional)
Environmental 
Assessment OP/BP 
4.01

Yes The project was categorized as an Environmental Category B 
project, due to the potential, unless avoided, of direct and 
indirect impacts flowing from physical interventions such as 
(a) establishment of a multi-species hatchery; (b) augmentation 
of the infrastructure of the Maniyafushi Research and 
Development Facility (MRDF); and (c) establishment and 
operation of out grower farms for mariculture in different 
atolls. To avoid, mitigate and/or manage such potential 
environmental impacts, an Environmental and Social 
management Framework (ESMF) has been prepared, which 
provides detailed analysis of the scale of due diligence 
required (such as specific guidance site selection, preparation 
of environmental assessments, environmental management 
plans, etc.) as may be required, or generic but appropriate 
avoidance and environmental mitigation measures in the 
project. Specific standalone environmental impact assessments 
(and subsequent permits from the Ministry of Environment and 
Energy) will also be needed for the multi-species hatchery; 
augmentation of the infrastructure of the MRDF; and out 
grower farms for mariculture. The ESMF provides budgets to

prepare such environmental impact assessments (which contain 
the respective environmental management plans). A standalone 
EA (including the relevant environmental management plan) 
has already been prepared for the quality assurance, quarantine 
and disease control research laboratory of the MRDF (which a 
front-runner intervention) and has been annexed to the ESMF 
and disclosed accordingly.

Natural Habitats OP/
BP 4.04

Yes This policy was triggered as all of the islands in Maldives are 
surrounded by coral reefs, with some reefs, island and waters 
around being legally protected; and it is important to avoid any 
significant impacts on these natural resources. As per the 
criteria included in the ESMF, the project design avoids any 
activity in and around of the protected marine or terrestrial 
areas. The ESMF has in place the due diligence measures to 
avoid or reduce the impacts on coral reefs, marine ecosystems 
and associated fauna and flora during the establishment and 
subsequent operation of mariculture out grower farms (in the 
remote atolls, selected specifically to avoid impacts on corals 
and water quality). The project will not involve the 
introduction of any non-native/naturalized species for the 
purpose of mariculture.

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No There are no areas classified as forests in Maldives. Any 
potential impacts on island or sea vegetation (such as sea grass, 
seaweed) are covered through OP/BP 4.01.

Pest Management OP 
4.09

No This policy is not triggered as the project will not finance the 
purchase, use or promotion of any pesticides, herbicides or 
similar other synthetic chemicals.

Physical Cultural 
Resources OP/BP 
4.11

No No project-supported activities are expected in the vicinity of 
or will affect physical cultural resources, as defined by OP/
BP4.11. All sites of physical cultural resources value in the 
Maldives are already designated and mandated as protected 
areas where no physical interventions can take place. Measures 
for safeguard chance finds have been included as part of 
mitigation measures defined in the ESMF.

Indigenous Peoples 
OP/BP 4.10

No This policy is not triggered as there are no identifiable 
indigenous communities in the project locations (islands and 
atolls).

Involuntary 
Resettlement OP/BP 
4.12

No No involuntary resettlement from land, livelihood or access to 
livelihood is expected in the project. Project activities such as 
capacity-building, research, MRDF, quality control and disease 
surveillance, establishment of household-level mariculture out-
grower farms do not give rise to any involuntary resettlement 
from land, livelihood or access to natural resources. However, 
there remains a possibility of indirect impacts that could arise 
if the marine zoning, zoning plans, and conservation plans for 
reef fishes financed by the project proposes restrictions on

non-sustainable practices, establishment of new conservation 
areas if any, or increased level of enforcement of management 
regulations for existing conservation areas. In all such cases 
the short-term economic and/or livelihood interests of local 
communities currently engaged in activities that rapidly 
deplete resources including fish stock could be impacted. 
Although the OP4.12 explicitly provides exemption to actions 
such as natural resources management, or preparation of 
fisheries management plans, the ESMF contains a framework 
compliant with the principles of OP4.12, to specify that any 
activity which has the chance of adverse impact on citizens and 
communities, or any chance of restricting traditional access to 
natural resources will be excluded from the project (throughout 
during implementation), and the process of preparation of 
zoning and other fisheries sector conservation plans will 
employ participation and citizen engagement. The policies and 
priorities that drives preparation of any zoning plans and 
regulations, conservation plans and/or strategies in Maldives 
are to protect the rights, claims and access of Maldivian 
citizens to the territorial waters of Maldives. These principles 
are also be strictly adhered to by the project, and all such 
zoning plans and conservation regulations will require 
approval of the Atoll Councils. Therefore, it is not conceivable 
that any restriction of access to traditionally used natural 
resources will be restricted by zoning plans, regulations, 
conservation plans and enforcement supported by the project. 
Further, while the exact locations and potential impacts of all 
activities, especially the mariculture grow-out facilities, are not 
yet known, the ESMF and the site specific social assessments 
will guide these sets of activities.

Safety of Dams OP/
BP 4.37

No This policy is not triggered as there will be no activities that 
invest on dams or water retention structures.

Projects on 
International 
Waterways OP/BP 
7.50

No This policy is not triggered as there will be no activities in 
international waterways or activities that will have impacts on 
international waterways.

Projects in Disputed 
Areas OP/BP 7.60

No The policy is not applicable because there are no disputed 
areas in Maldives.

IV. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify 

and describe any potential large scale,  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
While the project is classified as environmental category B, the project is expected to bring 
positive environmental benefits to the project areas as the entire design of the project is based on 
the need to conserve the marine resources, avoid and stop unsustainable capture and yields,

comply with the best regional and international standards, and diversify into mariculture as an 
alternative to threatened reef fisheries. The project will not lead to potential large scale significant 
and/or irreversible impact as the impacts will be largely localized to project sites and can be 
managed via stringent due diligence and adherence to national and international sectoral standards. 
Specific standalone environmental impact assessments and subsequent permits from the Ministry 
of Environment will be needed for the (i) multi-species hatchery; (ii) augmentation of the 
infrastructure of the Maniyafushi Research Centre; and (iii) out grower farms for mariculture and 
it is through these assessments that site specific impacts will be identified. 
 
The project will support the establishment of infrastructure such as training and research centers 
and laboratories as well as infrastructure to conduct mariculture activities such as fish cadges and/
or pens. These could, unless carefully managed and mitigated, lead to localized environmental 
impacts typical to civil works, such as the generation of construction wastes, generation of dust, 
noise, etc., and occupational and safety impacts that will be managed accordingly. The civil works 
contracts may involve the use of expatriate/ migrant/ non-local labor but no influx related issues 
are expected - two out of the three islands involved are uninhabited (therefore, there is no host 
community), and the work at the Airport Island/ Hulumale will be expansion of an existing small 
building to create the required laboratory facility. 
 
The project will finance start-up investments into household-level aquaculture/mariculture 
production, for example, cage cultivation of native/naturalized fish species. Operations of the 
multi species hatchery, and the MRDF could also pose potential operational impacts. During 
mariculture operations, typical environmental impacts include eutrophication from feeds and 
effluents, release of antifouling chemicals and antibiotics, and impacts introduction of alien 
invasive species. The project, in conformity with the Maldivian national environmental regulations 
will support mariculture of native/naturalized species. Careful site selection of grow-out 
mariculture farms will avoid eutrophication, pollutant loading on undersea surfaces, and use or 
accumulation of synthetic pollutants. Other impacts include scenarios of fish escaping from farms 
may compete with wild stocks, or transfer of parasites and diseases, or genetic interaction between 
escaped farmed fish and wild fish stocks. However such site-specific impacts will be regulated, 
controlled and managed, especially through specific EA/EMP that will be undertaken, and 
incorporating stringent measures for mitigating and managing operational impacts in the design 
and operation of the grow-out mariculture farms. Mariculture is not entirely new to the Maldives; 
in the last decade two projects have been initiated in the islands, for which EAs were undertaken, 
and the recommended mitigation and management measures were undertaken. Similar EAs will be 
prepared for the grow-out mariculture farms, which will also comply with the requirements under 
Maldives➢❨  own regulatory framework.  
 
While the project does not envisage any adverse social impacts, some of the Component 1 
activities may lead to possible restrictions in access and increased cost to some fishers. Sub-
Components A1 and A3 in particular seek to improve the regulatory and management practices of 
the fishing industry but, in doing so, may restrict access to fisheries resources and could reduce 
income for some fishers. However, given that any fishery management plan will, by its 
characteristic intent, will try to curb overexploitation of fish stock without exception, the 
management plans (sub-components A1 and A3) will need to adopt a transparent and participatory 
process of agreement on the actions  to be included in the management plans. 
 
Overall, there is no potential large-scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts likely from the 
project.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities 
in the project area:
The social and environmental impacts of the proposed project is deemed to be positive and 
sustainable in the long term. The project is also expected to improve the overall socio-economic 
status of the communities, including youth and women, as a result of the potential opportunities 
via employment creation and livelihood activities.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse 
impacts.
No alternatives have been considered, predominantly as the fisheries sector, after tourism, is the 
main source of livelihood and income generation in the Maldives and the proposed project 
activities will provide the most environmentally sound management options of the sector in 
comparison to current practices.

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
An Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) in lieu of an overall project-
specific Environmental Assessment (EA) and a Social Assessment (SA) has been prepared as 
details of all specific sites and design of the project➢❨ s physical interventions are not known. A 
standalone EA has already been prepared for the quality assurance, quarantine and disease control 
research laboratory, which is a front runner intervention and is annexed to the ESMF and disclosed 
accordingly.  The ESMF outlines detailed guidelines of measures for environmental and social risk 
mitigation and institutional arrangements for conducting environmental and social assessment, 
instruction to the preparation of Environmental and Social Assessments (ESIAs), Environmental 
and Social Management Plans (ESMPs), and other such measures as well as implementation and 
monitoring. 
 
All interventions will be subject to an environmental and social screening with the objective to: (a) 
determine the anticipated environmental and social impacts, risks and opportunities of sub-project; 
and (ii) determine if the anticipated impacts and public concerns warrant further analysis, and if so 
to recommend the appropriate type and extent of Environmental and Social Assessments needed as 
per the criteria set in the ESMF. The ESMF also provides the screening and selection criteria for 
household-level mariculture out-grower farms. 
 
The ESMF takes the applicable safeguard policies into account as well as the national 
environmental requirements and World Bank environmental Health and Safety Guidelines, which 
serves as a guide to the level of environmental and social analysis and mitigation required for all 
interventions supported by the project that will have any potential to cause negative environmental 
and social impacts; and thereby ensure compliance with the World Bank➢❨ s safeguard policies 
and the relevant national regulations during implementation.  
 
The implementing agency of the project, the MoFA, has not led implementation of any World 
Bank-financed project the recent years. Capacity within MoFA to manage environmental and 
social risks within a project setting is be limited. Therefore, in the Project Management Unit 
(PMU) set up for implementation of this project, staffing includes an Environmental and Social 
Officer with relevant technical and sectoral expertise to take up the role of environmental and 
social coordinator.  S/he will report to the Project Director and will work closely with the assigned 
PMU team, the Ministry of Environment and Energy, the Island Councils, the Environmental 
Protection Agency, and will be responsible for ensuring the overall implementation of the ESMF.

S/he will liaise with other agencies, contractors and consultants at the activity levels to implement 
the required mitigation and management measures. The E&S Coordinator will be responsible for 
monitoring and evaluation of implementation of the environmental and social management plans, 
and will prepare regular reports on compliance and status of performance indicators. The Island 
Councils will be the first level of contact for any grievance/feedback for the community, and the 
E&S Coordinator will work closely with the Island Councils to redress any grievance. The E&S 
Coordinator will lead to orient PMU and MoFA staff, consultants and contractors on the ESMF 
and on operationalization of the ESMF for each of the project activities. 
 
The project will provide training in environmental and social management to improve institutional 
capacity. The cost for monitoring and supervising the implementation of environmental and social 
project regulations have been integrated into the overall project investment cost. In addition, the 
project will also provide capacity building to potential operators of out grower farms on 
maintaining a good mariculture environment, and mitigating and managing potential 
environmental impacts during the operation.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure 
on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The key stakeholders included fisherpersons, fishing vessel-owners, fisherpersons➢❨  
associations, exporters and transporters involved in export of capture tuna and reef fishes, and 
relevant government officials. The MoFA organized elaborate discussions and consultations with 
these key stakeholder groups during November 2015 ➢❨  September 2016. The ESMF has been 
developed based on suggestions and recommendations from these key stakeholder groups. The 
project activities do not lead to adverse social or involuntary resettlement impacts, and 
consequently, there is no adversely affected person. The ESMF document was disclosed prior to 
appraisal of the project. Specific consultations at national, atoll and island levels will continue 
during implementation of the project, including during preparation of activity-specific 
environmental and social assessments.

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 
 

Afghanistan is a landlocked country, surrounded by Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan in the north, 
Iran in the west, Pakistan in the south and southwest, and China in the northeast. The country is divided 
into thirty four provinces, each province consists of a number of districts. Within these districts, most 
families live in villages. Rural households make up around 80 percent of the population, which is estimated 
to be 32.5 million (World Bank, 2015), with one of the highest growth rates of population worldwide (3 
percent / year). The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Afghanistan is around $ 19.2 billion (World Bank, 
2015).  

 
Over the last several decades, the country went through wars, and internal conflicts, resulting in weak 
economy, and absence of some of the basic services in parts of the country. All economic activities, and the 
potential for economic growth in Afghanistan have been badly affected by the deteriorating security 
situation, and the uncertainty about its political future, with around 39 percent of the Afghans falling under 
the poverty line (World Bank, 2013). Recently, Statistics showed negative levels of consumers’ prices index 
reflecting the high unemployment rates, and the weak economic conditions. The security situation remains 
a serious challenge, it has even deteriorated recently in some areas of the country, with limited presence or 
control from the government. 
 
Agriculture is the main pillar of the Afghan economy, being the second contributor to the GDP, following 
the services sector, which primarily depends on the presence of the international community in 
Afghanistan. The agriculture sector employs around 40 percent of the working force of the country

1
, and 

provides support to approximately 80 percent of the population in their livelihood. Direct agriculture 
activities contribute 25 percent to the GDP of the country. The number would be much higher if other 
related activities such as food processing, logistic, and trade of food items, are included. Wheat and its 
related activities such as logistics, and milling represents around 6.5 percent of the national GDP on the 
country.  

 
Agriculture productivity per unit of land in Afghanistan is low compared to world standards and some of its 
neighboring countries for most of the crops. Arable land in Afghanistan is around 12 percent of its total 
area, with less than half of the cultivated land is irrigated, while the larger portion of crops is rain-fed. 
Along with the high annual growth rate of population, this makes the country import-dependent for a large 
number of major food products, including wheat.  
 
Malnutrition is another chronic challenge in Afghanistan. It is estimated that 33 percent of Afghans are 
food insecure. Access to basic food items is limited for many Afghans, with around 34.7 percent of rural

households suffering from caloric deficiency in normal condition. This become even worse during times of 
shortages of supply. 
 
Given the fact that the agriculture sector in Afghanistan is not yet developed, in terms of adopting modern 
technologies, especially those related to climate resilient seeds, water management, and improved farming 
practices, this makes its agriculture production highly volatile, and vulnerable to sudden shocks, resulting 
from any unforeseen situation. 
 
Agricultural production in Afghanistan consists mainly of wheat, horticulture, nuts, and poppy

2
. Due to the 

very high level of consumption per capita, and being major part of the Afghan diet, wheat accounts for 
more than 60 percent of total areas cultivated, with a total area of around 2.4 million hectares

3
, almost 

equally split between irrigated and rain-fed cultivation, which creates high level of volatility in production 
every year. This has resulted in a fluctuating supply of wheat for households’ consumption on annual basis. 
This deficit of supply is mainly addressed by imports.  
 
Additionally, the political relations between Afghanistan and its neighbors, affects to a large extent the flow 
of goods to the country, bearing in mind its position as a landlocked country, with limited access to 
international trade and supply routes.  
 
By nature, Afghanistan is also prone to other natural disasters such as earthquakes, which adds to the 
already weak situation in the country. When such incidents occur, supply of wheat through the regular 
channels become more challenging, and many Afghans especially the poor lack access to wheat for their 
daily diet.   
 
Altogether, these factors puts Afghanistan in a very fragile situation with regard to its ability to secure basic 
food requirements specially wheat, for the need of its citizens especially at times of shortages of supply due 
to unforeseen situations, and emphasizes the need to establish a strategic reserve of wheat to be utilized 
during possible deficits of supply.     

 
Sectoral and Institutional Context 
 

Wheat is the largest crop grown in Afghanistan, covering nearly 60 percent of all cultivated lands. 

Production of wheat in Afghanistan comes mainly from the northern regions, which is mostly rain-fed 

cultivations, this increases the risk of volatility of production on annual basis. Over the last ten years (2005 

– 2015), annual production of wheat fluctuated between 2.1 million tons in 2008, to slightly above 5 million 

tons in 2014. There are several factors resulting in this large variability, mainly adverse climate conditions- 

specifically drought. Afghanistan is affected by global climate change, which is resulting in less rains, and 

increase in temperature, which accordingly have negative impact on its agricultural production in terms of 

areas cultivated and productivity per unit of land, bearing in mind that more than half of its cultivated lands 

are rain-fed. Additionally, the poor quality of seeds, and the limited adoption of modern farming practices 

adds to the situation.  

The recent significant shortages of local production were observed in 2004, 2006, 2008, and 2011, with

the unfavorable weather conditions being
4
 the main reason.  During these years, supply of wheat for 

household consumption dropped sharply, it was also accompanied with ban on exports of wheat from 
some of the neighboring supplying countries facing the same unfavorable climate conditions. This 
resulted in limiting the access of many Afghans to wheat for their daily consumption.  
 
In Afghanistan, bread constitutes around 70 percent of the daily caloric intake

5
. Globally, the country 

has the highest annual rate of wheat consumption per capita (160kg)
6
. This makes the availability of the 

crop a significantly important factor for the social stability of Afghanistan. Each year large quantities of 

wheat are imported primarily by the private sector, which mainly serve the urban community, along 

with donations from other countries.  With the limited availability of data in Afghanistan, different 

sources have different estimates for the annual imports of wheat ranging between one to two million 

tons every year, which roughly represents 20 – 40 percent of the overall consumption of the country, 

depending on the size of domestic production. For the 2016 / 2017 crop season, MAIL estimates that 

import requirements will be around 1.25 million tons.  

Regularly, the government of Afghanistan receives grain donations from other countries (mainly India), 

over the period 2011 – 2014 the government received 250,000 tons from India, and in 2016 – 2017 

season only, India is planning to provide around 100,000 tons to Afghanistan. All these quantities are 

stored and distributed to the poorest in Afghanistan. Irregularly, the government purchases much 

smaller quantities from farmers for the same purpose, in 2015 MAIL purchased only 900 tons from 

Afghan farmers. 

 Imports of wheats by the private sector usually offsets the deficit of domestic production, however in 

some years, and due to various reasons including market forces, political issues, and the impact of 

climate conditions, the availability of wheat in neighboring exporting countries becomes quite limited. 

Coupled with the shortfalls of local production of wheat in the country, this results in strong shocks to 

the supply for Afghan households’ consumption, especially the poorest in the country. In 2008 with the 

global hike in price of commodities, along with the decline in production is many countries, Pakistan 

which is the main supplier of wheat and wheat flour to Afghanistan banned exports of wheat, although 

some quantities of wheat were illegally exported, Afghanistan witnessed a serious situation in this 

regard.  

In 2008, and as per the historical data from MAIL, price of one ton of wheat reached around $750 in 

Afghanistan, compared to around $250 in 2007, and around $350 in 2009, the situation was similar 

earlier in 2004, 2006, and then later again in 2011, however it was not as severe as it was in 2008. These 

hikes in wheat prices make it very hard for average households in Afghanistan to secure their needs of 

bread, considering the poverty rates in the country, and the high level of wheat consumption per capita. 

During all these circumstances the government of Afghanistan was not able to respond to these 

unforeseen situations, by providing support to its people, especially poor households, which were 

already struggling to earn their living.

Productivity levels per unit of land for both irrigated and rain-fed wheat in Afghanistan remains low, 

compared to neighboring countries. Additionally, the weak post-harvest practices, and value addition 

activities, such as threshing, handling, and milling, and also the poor condition of the storage facilities, 

results in losses in the harvested crop, and deterioration of quality.  

 The World Bank through other agriculture projects in Afghanistan, specifically the ARTF funded project; 

Afghanistan Agriculture Inputs Project (AAIP) is already providing support in areas of wheat productivity 

enhancement, through introducing high quality seeds, and providing support to farmers on the adoption 

of improved agricultural practices. The government of Afghanistan have an ambitious goal to be self-

sufficient of wheat by 2020 through increased productivity, and expansion of irrigated wheat 

cultivations. This represents a real challenge at least on the medium term, considering the limited 

resources of water, arable land, and the need to 

expand beyond the high growth rate of the 

population. However, the challenge is even 

higher with the supporting activities such as 

storage and handling, which are currently weak, 

and have large impact on the quality of wheat, 

and is a direct result for high post-harvest 

losses.  

 

The government owns five large silos located in 

the provinces of Kabul, Kandahar, Heart, 

Baghlan, and Balkh as spotted on the map of Afghanistan. These silos operate as State Owned 

Enterprises (SOEs), operating under supervision of MAIL, and they charge the government for the 

quanities of wheat stored. The five silos are concrete constructions, and were built during the Soviet 

presence in Afghanistan during the 1970’s. Combined together, the silos have a total theoretical storage 

capacity of 170,000 tons. There are a number of warehouses owned by the Ministry of Agriculture, 

Irrigation, and Livestock (MAIL), adjacent to the silos with a total storage capacity of approximately 

65,000 tons, additionally, fifty two small scale warehouses are owned and operated by MAIL, and are 

distributed over 17 provinces, and all facilities are used for the storage and distribution of wheat. 

However, none of five large silos are operating at capacity, it is estimated that the utilization of the silos 

storage capacities is around 25 percent of its original capacity. This is mainly due to the lack of 

maintenance, human skills, and spare parts, accordingly the actual available storage capacity is much 

less. More importantly, the poor condition of these storage facilities, and its outdated operating 

procedures negatively affects the quality of the wheat stored. Generally, skills of the technical team 

operating these facilities are weak, and their knowledge on modern practices in managing grain stocks 

are quite limited. Although there is no specific assessment, some officials and donors estimates storage 

losses to be around 20 percent.  

Although, there is a directorate under MAIL responsible for the management of the grain reserve of the 

country. However, this directorate has limited capacities, and lacks the required set of skills to engage in 

managing such program, and due to the implementation of the standard governmental procedures and

Feb 13, 2017 Page 7 of 21  

 

regulations, their ability to directly engage in the wheat market is limited. While operating in such a 

dynamic market requires certain level of flexibility, to make decisions and engage in the procurement 

process when there is a good market opportunity.  

 

These factors altogether, from the importance that wheat represents in the afghan diet, and the fact 

that the country is wheat import-dependency, along with the volatile ties with its main suppliers, make 

it significantly important to build up wheat reserve, that can be used in responding to any unforeseen 

situations that may occur similar to those which the country witnessed several times, over the last 

twelve years. This wheat reserve can also be utilized in addressing the malnutrition situation in 

Afghanistan, through including a fortification program to the wheat stored.  

However, building up such a reserve requires solid storage structures, by which wheat can be stored in 

compliance with international standards in storing, handling, and quality control of wheat. More 

importantly, there is a need to establish an entity to be responsible for managing this reserve, with the 

required highly skilled human capital. 

The government of Afghanistan represented by MAIL, have been prioritizing the establishment of a 

Strategic Grain Reserve, and have been engaged in discussion with the World Bank seeking support in 

this regard. Initially, the government was interested in developing the grain reserve to serve two 

purposes, firstly, responding to emergency situations, and secondly to be utilized in stabilizing the wheat 

market in Afghanistan for the benefit of the farmers, through setting up minimum guaranteed price. The 

Bank advice on this regard was that such a practice would result in crowding out the private sector from 

the market, and eventually harm the farmers themselves, as this would limit the market opportunities 

for them, especially that it would require the allocation of significantly large financial resources from the 

government side, which is not available. 

Recently, and following extensive discussions between the World Bank and the Government of 

Afghanistan (GoA), an agreement was reached that the objective of establishing a strategic grain reserve 

should only be to efficiently respond to emergency situations, enabling the government to be able to 

secure basic food supplies of wheat for at least two million people for one year.  

In preparation for the proposed engagement in building a grain reserve, the World Bank conducted an 
engineering assessment for the five silos and the warehouses adjacent to it. The findings of the 
assessment covered the condition of building, machinery, other equipment and supportive activities on 
site. All five facilities were found in need for extensive rehabilitation, with different level of work 
required according to the condition on each site, and accordingly different cost estimate for each 
location. The study also provided a brief cost estimate for establishing Greenfield silos using modern 
storage technologies. In parallel, MAIL, reached out to a number of international suppliers, and obtained 
tentative cost estimations for Greenfield silos.  

 

Also, during the preparation for this project, a vulnerability assessment was conducted to study the 
current status of the food security in Afghanistan, and access to basic food supplies, based on trends in 
wheat production and to identify the areas within the country that are highly vulnerable in case an

emergency situation occurs, based on previous incidents, and the current storage capacities. The 
objective of the assessment was to advise on the suitability of the locations of the existing storage 
facilities, and provide recommendation on other locations (if any), to ensure efficient coverage, and 
ability to respond to sudden shocks.  

 

The vulnerability assessment reviewed a range of food insecurity assessments undertaken by the Bank, 
the government of Afghanistan, World Food Program, and others.  The assessment used to the most in 
depth degree was the 2013/14 Afghanistan Living Conditions Survey (ALCS) as this data resource had the 
most in depth data set on food insecurity which could be effectively used to evaluate the spatial 
distribution of vulnerability in the country.   Two of the main findings of the vulnerability assessment 
were; a) food insecurity in the country is generally widely distributed around the country, and b) the 
existing placement of the silos infrastructure, in most cases, if improved can be relatively well placed to 
address problems of food insecurity for most of the population, with one exception for a specific region 
that showed a deficit on food security in relation to the available storage capacity. 
 
The table below uses data on populations of severely and moderately food insecure populations from 
the 2013/14 ALCS survey disaggregated by region to develop an estimate of potential grain storage 
needs to respond to problems of food insecurity.  The evaluation makes the assumption that severely 
food insecure populations would be provided a 100 percent ration of wheat though the three month 
winter lean season.  On a per capita consumption rate of 170kg/annum, this would be a ration of 42kg 
of wheat grain for the period per person.  For moderately food insecure populations, a ratio of 50 
percent of consumption would be provided for the same three month lean season.  This would be 
equivalent to 21kg of wheat grain per person

7
.   

The analysis revealed that those regions near already planned large storage facilities; Kabul, Mazar-e-
Sharif, and Herat, do not have wheat requirements larger than the scale of the existing storage facilities 
if improved.  Similarly, a centralized facility in Kandahar would be able to serve the southwest of the

country, or feasibly this region could also potentially be served from Herat.  The ALCS data show 
relatively low rates of food insecurity in the east of the country (estimated food requirement in this 
region is less than 10,000MT), this region could very likely be served out of Kabul.  In the Southeast 
region total estimated food requirements are also relatively modest, estimated at roughly 15,000MT.  
This region might also be served out of Kabul or if need be, the facility in Kandahar could also contribute 
to address needs in this area.      
 
The areas that present the most substantial challenges are the Central region and the Northeast regions 
of the country.  The Northeast, according to this analysis, has a wheat requirement of 53,000MT.  At this 
requirement level it is not likely that it would be feasible to service this area from the facility in Mazar-e-
Sharif.  In addition, the facility in Pul-e-Khumri is potentially too distant to be able to effectively address 
needs in this area.  As such it seems that it would be a reasonable approach to develop smaller 
decentralized facilities in this region able to address food insecurity problems in this area.  Government 
data show that there is an estimated storage capacity of 6,000MT in Badakhshan province.  This 
infrastructure could be built on and further developed.  ALCS data by province show that in the 
northeast the large bulk of food insecure populations are in Badakhshan more so than Kunduz or 
Takhar.  As such, infrastructure would need to be developed to respond to the structure of current 
needs.   

 
The Central region are also an area where the quantity needed is relatively substantial (30,118 MT).  
According to government data, there are 5,000MT facilities in each of Central region provinces of 
Bamyan, Ghor, and Daykundi that were built in the last 10 years.  This total storage level of 15,000 MT 
for this region would be a very good start in terms of having available local storage capacity in these 
provinces.  For needs over and above this, it is likely that the balance of required foods could be 
supplied from Mazar-e Sharif and Herat.   

 

Ultimately, the assessment confirmed that the enhancement of the current storage facilities or the 

consideration of a greenfield silos at the same locations, along with the sufficient stock of wheat 

available, can help the Government of Afghanistan be in a good position to respond to emergency 

situations, and be able to supply Afghans with wheat as the basic and main food item consumed, of 

course with the presence of other factors such as solid logistics, and distribution mechanism. However, 

the study also revealed that a need exists for an additional large storage facility in the northeast region 

of the country, where productivity rates of wheat are very low since wheat cultivations in this area are 

mainly rain-fed, in addition to the absence of large storage facilities for wheat, and the fact that this 

region is generally prone to natural disasters such as earthquakes, plus the difficulty in reaching out to 

some of the areas of the region especially during winter time.

Development Objective(s) (From PAD)  
The development objective of the project is “To establish a wheat strategic reserve to be available to Afghan 
households to meet their post-disaster needs and improve the efficiency of the grain storage management”.  

Key Results 
The achievement of the PDO would be measured by the following PDO results indicators:  
 
Increased availability of wheat stocks.  

Increased number of households whose wheat needs can be met immediately after the occurrence of 

an emergency situation affecting their access to wheat, and  

Reduced losses in wheat stored, as a result of the upgrade of the storage facilities, relative to pre-

project intervention.  

 
D. Project Description  
 

The project aims to support the Government of Afghanistan, in building up a reserve of wheat that can 

be utilized in responding to any emergency situation the country may face, which usually leads to 

shortages of supply of wheat, which is considered the most important food item for household 

consumption in the country.    

Emergency situations occurring in Afghanistan are generally due to unforeseen weather conditions such 

as severe drought resulting in share decline in the local wheat crop, natural disaster such as 

earthquakes, which is frequent in the country, and usually results in limiting people’s access to wheat.  

Declaration of an emergency situation is assigned to a ministerial committee. The entity that will be 

established by the project to manage the reserve will coordinate with this committee as part of its tasks 

in working closely with relevant stakeholders.  In this regard, the entity will be prepared to act on up the 

declaration of an emergency situation in the country, to do so, the new entity will have its own 

operational procedures for actions to be taken to respond accordingly.    

The objective of the project will be achieved through the establishment of an autonomous entity to 

manage the grain reserve. This entity will be responsible for obtaining and receiving wheat 

internationally and locally, from aid provided by other countries, and also the purchase of wheat from 

local and international markets, and managing the handling, storage, and distribution operations of 

wheat, while ensuring that quality is maintained through the adoption of global best practices in this 

regard. In order to enable the new entity in becoming well-positioned to help in responding to 

emergency situations, the project will work on building existing capacities under MAIL, and benefit from 

those have gained the required knowledge in the activities of the new entity, in addition to adding 

additional calibers as needed.  

The objective of the project will also be achieved through the improvement of the existing storage 

capacities through rehabilitation process, and also the establishment of Greenfield facilities. On this 

regard, the project will decide on the selection between different options of silos rehabilitation versus 

the establishment of Greenfield facilities. Currently, the proposed activities includes the rehabilitation of 

the two silos located in Mazar-e-Sharif, and Pul-e-Khumri, considering that both are in relatively good 

condition, while establishing three greenfield silos in Kabul, Kandahar, and Herat considering the level of

work required for rehabilitation is significant, and also the fact that one of these silos (Kabul), is now 

being in the center of the city, which may have negative impact on the surroundings if rehabilitated.   

The objective of establishing the grain reserve will remain only to respond to emergency situations in 

the country. However, in order to maintain the quality of the wheat stored, and as a common practices 

in managing grain stocks, a portion of the wheat will be offered for sale annually on basis of stock 

replenishment. The sale of wheat will be at the prevailing market prices, and will be in a manner that 

has no impact on market dynamics, and will not engage in price setting.  

The project will utilize new technologies in developing a wheat crop estimation tool, which will provide 

accurate forecasts for the locally grown wheat in Afghanistan, to assess the needs for imports based on 

local supply, and annual consumptions rates.  

The project will also seek to partially address the malnutrition situation in Afghanistan through the 

introduction of a fortification program for the wheat / wheat flour distributed under the project.  The 

fortification of wheat flour will be achieved in collaboration with the World Food Program, which enjoys 

solid on ground presence in Afghanistan, and have already established large network with hundreds of 

local wheat millers to ensure implementation of the fortification program during wheat milling.  

Both activities of the development of the crop estimation, and the nutrition support, will be 

subcomponents under the first component, which covers the establishment of the grain reserve 

management entity, and the related intuitional infrastructure development.  

Implementation will of project activities will be carried out by a transit Project Implementation Unit 
(PIU), until the entity that will be in charge of managing the grain reserve is established, then it will take 
over from the transit PIU.   

 
The project will be implemented over five years, and will consist of the following three main 

components: 

Component A: Institutional Infrastructure and Capacity Building: (US$ 3.9 million) 

This component will be focused on the establishment, and support the start-up activities of the 

proposed entity to be in charge of managing the grain reserve. Activities of the component will also 

include the development of the crop estimation system, and also include activities related to the 

nutrition, and wheat fortification.  

Component B: Physical Infrastructure: (US$ 23.1 million) 

The silos are located mostly in urban centers, except Kandahar. Kabul silo is located in a growing urban 

center, surrounded mostly by residential and commercial development. Pul-e-Khumri silo is also 

surrounded by residential areas on the north and south side of the facility and lies directly on the main 

road running through the town. Mazar Sharif silo is approximately 4 km from the city center, surrounded 

by residential and commercial development. Herat silo is also located in an urban area on a valuable 

land site. Kandahar silo is located on the outskirts of the city, but this silo is in a very poor condition.

This component will finance the required physical engineering work including the rehabilitation of the 

existing 2 silos, and also the establishment of 3 Greenfield Silos and a new warehouse facility in the 

northeast region of the country considering its high vulnerability.  Activities of the component are based 

on the outcome of the field assessment conducted during the project preparation process.  

Activities under this component will be implemented through a gradual work approach, so that the 

timeframe for the rehabilitation of the existing facilities, and the construction of new facilities allows the 

utilization of each of the storage facilities once completed, while maintaining sufficient storage capacity 

available at other facilities prior undergoing an upgrading process. The work schedule will be designed 

to ensure that by end of the fourth year of the project all five silos are fully operational, and the new 

warehouse facility in the north east region is fully functioning.  

Both the physical assessment of the silos which was undertaken recently as part of project preparation, 

and also the vulnerability assessment will guide the work under this component. From the results of the 

assessment and the cost effectiveness analysis, three new Greenfield silos will be constructed in Kabul, 

Kandahar and Herat as the cost of rehabilitating these facilities is more than new Greenfield 

construction.  The facilities on Mazar Sharif and Pul-e-Khumri will be rehabilitated as this is the most 

economical way to restore these facilities to full operational capacity, and considering that both are in 

relatively good condition.  For rehabilitation, substantial repairs will need to be made to the actual 

concrete silos as these have deteriorated over time.  In most cases the grounds around the facilities also 

need to be upgraded and rehabilitated to facilitate the movement of trucks into and around the facility.  

Truck weigh scales will also have to be replaced.  The mechanical equipment such as elevators, conveyor 

belts, cleaning and drying equipment, scales, and other machinery will need to be replaced in full as it 

has deteriorated from a long period of disuse.  In most instances, replacement of this mechanical 

equipment comprises roughly 50 percent or more of the total rehabilitation expenses.  In the cases of 

new Greenfield construction, new steel silos will be constructed on the grounds of the existing storage 

facilities.  The location of the existing facilities are sufficiently large that there should be more than 

sufficient room for this new construction.  .  Finally, a new laboratory along with testing equipment will 

be installed in all storage facilities.   

In addition, as recommended a new flat warehouse will be built in Badakhshan province to address food 

insecurity problems in this region of the country as was identified by the vulnerability assessment.  The 

activities of this subcomponent will commence by assessing different plots of land owned by MAIL in 

Badakhshan province, preferably close to the capital city of Faizabad. Criteria for land selection will 

include the topography of the land being flat, with no signs of elevation or slopes, with an area of 

around 5 - 6 hectares, and are connected to main roads for ease of access.  

Design and preparation work will be carried out to establish a modern warehouse, with steel 

construction, suitable for the storage of bagged and bulk wheat. The site should include a weight bridge 

scale, ventilation system, quality control laboratory, and pest and dust control systems. The site will 

include area for trucks’ movement and maneuvering.  

Component C: Project Management: (US$ 2.46 million)

This component will finance activities related to the establishment and operations of a Project 

Implementation Unit (PIU), to be in charge of managing all project activities. The PIU will be located at 

MAIL in Kabul, and will be responsible for all implementation activities including the finalization and 

development of the required institutional structure which will eventually be responsible for managing 

the grain reserve.  

The PIU will be transitional, so that once the new entity in charge of managing the strategic grain 

reserve is established and fully functioning, the PIU will be handing over all of its assignments and 

activities to it. It is anticipated that this step will take place by the end of the third year of the lifetime of 

the project. However, prior to the establishment of the grain reserve managing entity, the PIU will be in 

charge, and will coordinate all its activities with the SGR directorate and other units under MAIL.   

The PIU will be responsible from the start of the project for the rehabilitation of the 2 silos, and 
establishment of 3 Greenfield Silos, in addition to construction of a warehouse in the north east region, 
and in hiring of consultants, advisors, and carrying our all related procurement work. The PIU will be also 
responsible for coordination with other governmental agencies, and carrying our all related 
procurement work. The PIU will be also responsible for coordination with other governmental agencies.  
The PIU will include managerial, technical, and fiduciary staff, and will be also responsible identifying the 

areas where it will require international expertise, and will carry out all their hiring process in line with 

the World Bank guidelines.

E. Implementation 
 

Institutional and Implementation Arrangements 
 

The implementing agency for this project will be the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation, and Livestock (MAIL). 
Implementation of all project activities will be carried out by the Project Implementation Unit (PIU), which will 
be established under MAIL, and will be located at the ministry’s premises in Kabul.    
 
The PIU will be responsible for the managerial, financial, operational, and technical aspects related to the 
implementation of all components, and will be reporting regularly on progress of project activities to MAIL and 
the World Bank in relation to all project activities. The PIU will develop the project procurement plans, identify 
requirements for international expertise, and obtain the required resources accordingly.  
 

The PIU will coordinate its activities with relevant partners, and stakeholders including donors, governmental 
agencies, consultants, and private sector.  
 

With the establishment of the proposed entity that will be dedicated to manage the grain reserve, this new 
entity will take over the full responsibility of activities, and will seek to coordinate the work with the relevant 
stakeholders. The entity will be overseen by an inter-ministerial committee chaired by MAIL.  
 
 A Project Steering Committee (PSC) chaired by H.E. Minister of MAIL (or his delegates), will oversee project 
activities, and the implementation process carried out by the PIU, the committee will provide guidance and 
support, and will facilitate the interaction with other stakeholders. 

 
 
 

 
 
 .    
F. Project location and Salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 
 

The project is rehabilitating two silos in the cities of Mazar-e-Sharif, and Pul-e-Khumri, in addition to the 
construction of three new Silos in the cities of Kabul, Kandahar, and Herat, and also constructing an 
additional Greenfield warehouse in the northeast region of the country. This may have minor potential 
environmental, health and safety issues/impacts during construction and operation on site. Therefore, the 
World Bank OP 4.01 is triggered and MAIL has prepared an ESMF to be applied during the whole project 
cycle. Site specific ESMPs were prepared for the current two sites of rehabilitation operation, similar site 
specific ESMPs will be prepared based on guidelines and check lists provided by the project ESMF. The site 
specific ESMPs will be properly implemented by the Ministry and the relevant contractors. An 
implementation level Pest Management Plan (PMP) will also be prepared to for any environment health and 
safety issues that may raise from the fumigation process for preserving the quality of the wheat stored in 
the silos.

SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY 

 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

The WB OP/BP 4.01 is triggered because the project 
will rehabilitate two silos, and construct three new 
silos, and also a new storage facility at the northeast 
region. The rehabilitation and operation of the old 
facilities as well as selection, construction and 
operation of three new storage facilities may have 
minor potential environmental, health and safety 
issues and impacts on the operators and the labors 
as well as on the local environment.  Therefore, in 
order to mitigate such potential impacts an ESMF 
was prepared by MAIL and found acceptable by the 
Bank. Based on the direction and guidelines as well 
as check lists of the ESMF, two site specific ESMPs 
were also prepared for the existing silos that will 
undergo rehabilitation and will be implemented to 
avoid, minimize, and mitigate any potential impact. 
Once the location of the three new sites are 
identified, site specific ESMPs will also be prepared 
during implementation stage and will be applied on 
the new sites of the remaining three new silos. 
 

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 No 
 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No 
 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

The WB Pest Management Policy (OP/BP 4.09) is 
triggered as the silos will be using fumigation for 
maintaining the quality of wheat stored as a general 
practice in managing grain reserves. Use of 
fumigants should be according to the USEPA and 
WHO guidelines . Health and Safety measures should 
strictly be followed for Operation and Maintenance 
of silos to ensure the safety of the workers at the 
site of the silos . MAIL and the project with the help 
of WB safeguards team will prepare a Pest

Management Plan during the project 
implementation much in advance before the 
facilities are used for storing wheat which is not 
expected to be before the second year of the 
project. The plan will consider the current practices 
and knowledge about the issue, e.g., what 
technology is used for preservation of wheat and 
availability of fumigants in the market. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 No 
 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 No 
 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

OP/BP 4.12 is applicable since the project will 
support the construction of new three Silos, which 
may require land acquisition and involuntary 
resettlement. 
Since the scope and other details of all proposed 
activities, including the exact locations of the new 
silos are not yet determined, an ESMF and a 
Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) have been 
prepared by the client and the executive summary 
was disclosed both in-country and at the Bank’s 
external website prior to project appraisal on 
4/11/2017. 
The ESMF and RPF will guide preparation of the 
social safeguards studies, such as limited Social 
Impact Assessment (SIA), ESMPs and RAPs (where 
needed). The RPF includes the requisite Terms of 
Reference (TORs) for the RAP.  
ESMF and RPF consultations with stakeholders have 
been conducted and minutes from public 
consultation have been included.

KEY SAFEGUARD POLICY ISSUES AND THEIR MANAGEMENT 

 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential 
large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
The project will not have significant and/or irreversible impacts and might only have minor reversible impacts as the 
civil works would only be either rehabilitation of two existing silos, and construction of three new silos. When the 
ESMF tools and the ESMPs for the two locations under rehabilitation are properly applied during the implementation, 
this potential impact will be mitigated. ESMPs will carefully chalk out the sanitation and drinking water needs and their 
interaction and will give specific mitigation measures, and will also provide directions in sites of labor camps if any, 
selection and rehabilitation of specific areas, transportation routes, and the occupational health and safety measures 
for the labors and the local relevant communities. 
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area: 
The sub-projects will include rehabilitation of two silos in Mazar-e-Sharif, and Pul-e-Khumri and construction of three 
new silos in Kabul, Herat, and Kandahar in addition to the establishment of a new warehouse facility in Badakhsan. 
The project ESMF, the subprojects site specific ESMPs have been prepared, and an outline for the  Pest Management 
Plan (PMP) is also included in the project ESMF, and during project implementation, a full PMP will be developed. With 
these instruments, the project will be positioned to reduce and mitigate any potential impact. However, due to the 
nature of the Project compoentnts there will be no indirect and /or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities 
The project triggers OP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement, because the physical infrastructure activities under 
component B may  involve implications that could impact individuals and/or communities in different ways. Therefore, 
the preparation of the ESMF and the Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) will guide the preparation of any Social 
Impact Assessments (SIA) or Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) that may be needed. However, it is expected that all 
new constructions will be all on lands owned by MAIL, and free from any settlers.  
 
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts. 
The project aimed to use government owned land and environmental friendly technologies for establishing and/or 
renovating the Silos, and also for the construction of the new warehouse in the northeast region. 
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower 
capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The borrower will address all safeguards related issues under a framework approach. A project Environmental and 
Social Management Framework(ESMF) has been developed by the borrower and a safeguards specialist will be hired 
by the project in order to implement the ESMF and to comply with the world bank safeguard policies. The borrower, 
the implementing agency, MAIL has experience with the WB safeguards implementation and will hopefully implement 
the relevant project safeguards at a satisfactory level.  
For each of the subprojects a site specific Environmental and Social Safeguards Action Plan (ESMP) would be prepared 
based on the project ESMF. Already two ESMPs for the two locations that will undergo rehabilitation have been 
developed. The borrower will mainstream relevant clauses in the relevant contract documents and will follow the 
Occupational Health and Safety as well as sanitation issues in project sites as well as in the project labor camps. During 
the implementation stage a PMP would be prepared and the outline of the proposed PMP is included as an Annex to

Feb 13, 2017 Page 18 of 21  

 

the project ESMF.  
 
 
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, 
with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
The main stakeholders are government agencies, local populations residing close to the silos facilities, donors, 
consultants, and private sector. Relevant citizen engagement tools  were used during preparation of the ESMF, and 
the ESMPs for the two already identified sites (the two silos which will be rehabilitated), once the other four locations 
have been identified during project implementation, site specific ESMPs will be developed. The ESMF and the site 
specific ESMPs as well as the PMP will all be disclosed on the Ministry Website as well as in the Bank Intranet system. 
Consultation and disclosure procedure is also illustrated in the ESMF. Already the executive summary of the ESMF 
have been translated to local language, and published.

B.   Introduction and Context

Country Context
Over the past decade, Kosovo➢❨ s overall economic growth has been generally positive, 
averaging about 4-5 percent annually, driven mostly by massive donor-funded reconstruction 
efforts as well as remittances from its diaspora. The economy has demonstrated a considerable 
degree of resilience, with principal macro fiscal and financial indicators reflecting that the country 
has performed considerably better than any of its neighbors in the Western Balkans over the past 
decade. Kosovo is a potential EU candidate country and economic reforms are largely driven by 
the prospect of eventual EU accession. 
 
Despite the positive trend in growth and relatively stable and resilient economy, Kosovo remains 
one of the poorest countries in Europe. As of 2011, approximately 30 percent of its population of 
1.8 million lived below the national poverty line of ➢❪¬1.72 a day and about 10.2 percent were 
living in extreme poverty on less than ➢❪¬1.20 day. Unemployment is widespread, estimated at 
about 30 percent in 2013, the highest in South Eastern Europe. Unemployment among women is 
higher, estimated at 38.8 percent. Demographically, Kosovo is Europe➢❨ s youngest country, 
where the average age is estimated at 26 years.  Unemployment among the youth is especially 
high, estimated at 61.0 percent in 2014. 
 
The main driver of Kosovo➢❨ s economic growth has been consumption, fueled by remittances 
rather than income earned domestically. The steady consumption demand has been met mainly by 
imports given the country➢❨ s narrow, undiversified, and uncompetitive production base.  There 
is little export-orientation and imports remain large.  The current growth model based on large 
financial inflows is unsustainable and the main challenge for the country remains the 
establishment of conditions conducive to promoting self-sustained growth founded on increased 
domestic productivity and export competitiveness, within the framework of reducing high 
unemployment, improving human capital and building physical infrastructure. 
 
Kosovo➢❨ s location, EU membership prospects and free market access to the EU and Central 
European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) countries offer strong opportunities for sustained and 
rapid overall development. The government is committed to instituting reforms to promote 
sustainable economic development and is working to put in place the policies, institutions and 
investments that will help unleash the country➢❨ s growth and export potential. In this context, 
the National Development Strategy 2015-2020, adopted in January 2016, emphasizes four priority 
pillars: (a) human capital and employment; (b) good governance and rule of law; (c) competitive 
industries; and (d) infrastructure development.
Sectoral and institutional Context
Agriculture plays a significant role in Kosovo➢❨ s economy.  It is an important contributor to 
GDP, accounting for about 11.4 percent of GDP in 2014 (second only after wholesale and retail 
trade). Over 62 percent of the country➢❨ s population lives in rural areas and depends, directly or 
indirectly, on agriculture for its livelihood. The sector is the largest private employer, accounting 
for about 35 percent of total employment, although primarily on an informal basis.  Poverty in 
rural areas is especially high and over 40 percent of the rural population is unemployed. The lack 
of job perspective, especially among the rural young population is putting a strain on social 
cohesion and encouraging out-migration. Often, agriculture serves as a safety net for much of the 
population.

Despite a steady growth in the sector since independence, Kosovo is the largest importer of food 
per capita in Europe. The country is highly dependent on imports to meet its food demands and 
the export/import ratio has been steadily increasing over the past decade.  In 2011, the value of 
imports of agricultural products was approximately ➢❪¬561.4 million while the value of exports 
was ➢❪¬26.2 million. Exports of agricultural products thus generated revenues to pay for only 4.6 
per cent of the cost of importing such products. Agricultural products account for about 10 
percent of all imports; of this, 30 percent comprises food products. 
 
This is primarily because the sector faces several diverse and inter-related challenges that prevent 
it from meeting its productive potential and hinder commercialization. Before the 1990s, Kosovo 
was largely food self-sufficient with large quantities of agricultural products exported to the 
region. However, after the war, this trend was reversed so that today, agriculture is largely 
subsistent/semi-subsistent in nature. The sector is characterized by small, fragmented land 
holdings, with average land holding size ranging between 1.5 and 2.0 ha, often spread across an 
average of seven smaller plots. Lack of and/or limited access to, inter alia, modern technologies, 
good quality inputs, irrigation, post-harvest management and processing infrastructure, credit, and 
markets pose serious challenges to the development of the sector.  In its current state, agriculture 
attracts limited private investments which effectively inhibit commercialization of the sector and 
the realization of socio-economic gains thereof. 
 
Two areas that offer good opportunities for the development of Kosovo➢❨ s agricultural sector 
include the horticulture and livestock subsectors. Horticulture and livestock farming are 
traditional economic activities in Kosovo, representing a rural cultural identity and there is a 
strong preference among the farming communities to remain engaged in these subsectors for their 
livelihood. Over the past decade, demand for high value horticulture products has surged more 
than any other food category and there is a strong consumer preference for locally grown fruits 
and vegetables, both for fresh consumption and processing. Livestock farming is predominant in 
the mountainous and remote areas of Kosovo where it often serves as the primary source of rural 
livelihood. With increased productivity and production  there is good potential for: (i) promoting 
import substitution; (ii) boosting exports, especially to EU and CEFTA countries; (iii) generating 
employment in rural areas; (iv) creating economic opportunities for women in agriculture 
production and especially value-added processing activities; and (v) providing opportunities for 
young farmers to be gainfully employed in these remunerative value chains. 
 
To harness the potential of these subsectors, especially the horticulture subsector, there is a 
critical need for improving irrigation delivery and services. Rainfall patterns show high variability 
in Kosovo and there is a crucial need for supplementary irrigation, especially during drier spells. 
For fruits and vegetables, irrigation is essential for increasing yields and ensuring quality and 
timely production. It is expected that with irrigation small farmers would move to more high-
value crops and specialized markets, and away from near-subsistence agriculture. 
 
Ageing irrigation infrastructure and lack of maintenance are reducing the level of irrigation use 
and impacting development of agriculture.  Most of the irrigation schemes were built in the 1970s 
and are showing signs of ageing. Moreover, the war of the 1990s damaged or destroyed large 
sections of country➢❨ s irrigation infrastructure. This coupled with expansion of urban and 
industrial areas in recent years has sharply reduced actual irrigable area and jeopardized existing 
irrigation investments. The area equipped for irrigation fell from approximately 71,000 ha before 



Page 4 of 14

the war to approximately 43,900 ha in 2014.  The area of irrigation use is also far lower than in 
the past. Between 2006 and 2012, the average area irrigated was only about 12,000 ha - 4,000 ha 
in small schemes and 8,000 ha within the areas serviced by the country➢❨ s three regional 
irrigation companies in Kosovo: Iber-Lepenc, Radoniqi-Dukagjini and Drini i Bardhe. 
 
Recognizing the significant role of agriculture in Kosovo➢❨ s overall economic development, the 
government is undertaking critical measures to re-vitalize the sector. The objectives of the 
National Agricultural and Rural Development Plan (NARDP 2014-2020 are to undertake actions 
to overcome bottlenecks holding back sustainable rural development in the country and align 
Kosovo➢❨ s rural sector with the axes of the EU Instrument for Pre-accession for Rural 
Development (IPARD). The NARDP lays out several measures for implementation support over 
the next five years, including inter alia, investments in the physical assets of agricultural holdings 
as well as processing and marketing of agricultural and fishery products; agri-environmental 
measures and organic farming; farm diversification and business development; improvements in 
training, advisory services and vocational training; land consolidation; and  irrigation.  On the 
institutional front, the government is building the capacity of important institutional structures, 
such as the Managing Authority and Paying Agency, for improved performance of the agriculture 
sector as well as to approximate their functioning with EU requirements. These efforts are being 
carried out with assistance from several donors, including EU, DANIDA, Suisse Interco-
operation, USAID, Austrian Development Agency, GIZ and the World Bank (through the 
ongoing IDA-financed Agriculture and Rural Development Project).

C.  Proposed Development Objective(s)

Original Project Development Objective(s) - Parent
The development objective of the project is to assist the Recipient to promote competitiveness 
and growth in the livestock and horticulture sub-sectors over the next decade through 
implementation of selected measures of its agricultural strategy and institutionaldevelopment.

Proposed Project Development Objective(s) - Additional Financing
The development objective of the project is to improve productivity of and access to markets by 
project beneficiaries in the horticulture and livestock subsectors of Kosovo and strengthen 
institutional capacity of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Rural Development.

Key Results 
The PDO-level Results Indicators comprise the following: (i) increased yields of key crops 
supported by the project ➢❨  tons/ha; (ii) increased yields of milk production per animal on 
livestock farms supported by the project ➢❨  liters/cow; (iiiu) increased sale of milk to processing 
companies; (iv) increased sales of horticultural products from farmers supported by aggregators; 
(v) increased number of farmers adopting improved agricultural technologies; (vi) preparation of 
Rural Development Grant Program (RDGP) sub-measures for investment support in line with 
EU-IPARD Guidelines

D.  Project Description

The Additional Financing, a US$22.0 million IDA credit, to be implemented over four years, 
would support the following activities: 
 
Component 1: Transferring Knowledge to the Rural Sector.  The AF will continue support for the 



Page 5 of 14

following sub-components: (a) Rural Advisory Service (RAS) Contracts under which training 
would be provided to potential applicants for the Rural Development Grant Program (RDGP) as 
well as to municipal advisors to assist the farming community in the preparation of such grant 
proposals as well as to national extension staff on technical topics; (b) Regional Knowledge 
Exchange under which the project will support the organization of study tours/visits to countries 
in the region to enable farmers and processors in the horticulture and livestock subsectors to learn 
and benefit from the knowledge and experiences of other agri-food producers and processors in 
the region; and (c) Institutional Strengthening of Rural Advisory Services. The AF will continue 
to support the municipal advisory service centers in delivering effective services to the rural 
community through the provision of training, equipment and select operating costs. 
 
Component 2: Enhancing Investments to Promote Sustainable Rural Development. The AF will 
support the following activities: 
(a) Rural Development Grant Program (RDGP). RDGP support will be provided to farmers and 
processors in the livestock subsector.  As under KARDP, the RDGP will be implemented at the 
national level ➢❨  for potential beneficiaries in all municipalities of Kosovo.  The Call for 
Proposals would be open to all farmers and processors residing on the territory of Kosovo. 
Implementation of RDGP would follow the same processes and procedures as under the ongoing 
project, including extra points for women applicants and additional co-financing for beneficiaries 
(both men and women) under the age of 40 as well as for climate friendly agricultural practices.    
 
(b) Promoting Development of the Horticulture Subsector. The objective of this component is to 
promote the development of the horticulture subsector by strengthening backward and forward 
linkages in the value chain of the subsector. The aim is to improve productivity, quality, value 
addition, and ma rket linkages within the subsector to enhance its competitiveness towards 
increased exports and import substitution as well as job creation, improved beneficiary incomes 
and increased economic opportunities for women and youth in the rural sector.  It will target 
support to small holder farmers that dominate the rural landscape and provide them opportunities 
for assured markets and  improved livelihoods while assisting the commercial and semi-
commercial agro-enterprises to reach both domestic and export markets, create jobs and improve 
incomes.  
 
The entry point for project support will be the Aggregators, i.e. private Collection Centers (CCs) 
and Agro-processors, handling or procuring horticultural produce.  The project will provide 
matching grants to qualifying Aggregators, who will: (i) promote and strengthen backward 
integration strategies through the provision of supply contracts and extension services to small-
holder farmers, thereby guaranteeing farmers markets for their produce as well as enabling them 
to enhance their productivity while improving quality (including meeting Global GAP 
certification requirements); and (ii) exploit the value addition potential of the sector through 
improved postharvest management by increasing their capacity for handling and processing.  
Thus the project will enable Aggregators to increase the intake of fresh produce from farmers 
(upstream) and increase their supply of fresh produce and processed products to domestic and 
export markets (downstream).  By introducing upgrades in the value chain - quality checks, 
packaging, labeling, etc, the project will reorient firms towards more lucrative export markets. 
 
Potential aggregators will be invited to prepare business plans and submit applications to enhance 
and expand their operations.  Funding for selected subprojects would be allocated through a 
competitive bidding process. The maximum size of the grant would be Ã¢➢❨ Â¬200,000.  The 



Page 6 of 14

submitted business plans will be reviewed, evaluated and scored against clearly defined criteria 
by an independent Evaluation Committee. Eligibility criteria and detailed arrangements for 
implementation of the matching grants will be elaborated in the Horticulture Development Grant 
Manual. 
 
(s) Institutional Capacity Building. The AF will continue to support capacity building of the 
Managing Authority and Paying Agency through the provision of training, personnel and 
equipment as needed. Project support will assist in approximating their functioning to EU 
requirements and contribute to their efforts towards EU accreditation.   The project will also 
support capacity building within the Kosovo Institute of Agriculture (KIA) to enhance its ability 
to promote food safety and quality standards in the livestock and horticulture subsectors of 
Kosovo through the provision of select equipment to strengthen capacity of the food testing 
laboratory. 
 
Component 3: Support for Irrigation. The AF would support rehabilitation works in the Radoniqi-
Dukagjini Irrigation Scheme, located in an area of high agricultural productivity.  Horticulture is 
the dominant economic activity in the region and with improved irrigation delivery and services 
there is a high likelihood of improved productivity of high value crops. Specific rehabilitation 
investments in the scheme will focus on, inter alia, lining and repair of main canal sections, 
replacement of moving parts; pipes, where necessary, aqueduct crossing on the Drini river, and 
the restoration of irrigation delivery in two blocks, namely the Janosh scheme in the upstream part 
of the system; as well as the Doblibare scheme which is currently dysfunctional. Minor dam 
safety actions (non-structural), as identified by the dam safety assessments, will be supported as 
well. Modernization will include selective automation of scheme monitoring to increase water and 
energy use efficiency. A technical study is underway to further specify the technical requirements 
and prepare bidding documents for scheme construction works as well as identify equipment and 
spare part requirements. 
 
In providing rehabilitation support to the scheme, the project will take a broader modernization 
approach and integrate managerial upgrading with the technical rehabilitation to improve both 
resource utilization and water delivery service to users, optimizing resource utilization and 
ensuring institutional and financial sustainability. This includes the support for a Management 
Information System, SCADA for improved operations, support for maintaining a strategic supply 
of spare parts and maintenance equipment; harmonization of planning and budgeting with 
municipal plans as well as water users➢❨  demands. 
 
Component 4: Project Management, Coordination, Monitoring and Evaluation. The existing 
Project Implementation Unit (PIU) within MAFRD will be responsible for the daily management, 
administration and coordination of the project's activities in accordance with Bank requirements, 
including procurement, financial management, monitoring and evaluation, and audits.  Its 
capacity would be enhanced through the hiring of an irrigation specialist who will be responsible 
for the implementation of the irrigation activity as well as additional short-term technical 
specialists as needed.

II. Implementation
Institutional and Implementation Arrangements
The project will be implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Rural Development 
(MAFRD).  A dedicated Project Implementation Unit, headed by the General Secretary, has been 
established under the ongoing KARDP for overall management of the project, including the fiduciary 
(procurement, financial management), monitoring, evaluation, training and administration 
requirements as well as coordination with donors and other government units.  The Rural 
Development Grant Program (RDGP) will be implemented by the Managing Authority (MA) and 
Paying Agency (PA). The  MA is responsible for identifying the measures for support under the 
RDGP and prepares the procedures for implementation of the selected RDGP sub-measures.  
Towards this, it establishes Working Groups with representation from the private sector and civil 
society.  The PA is in charge of administering the RDGP, including the selection, awarding, 
monitoring and disbursement processes for the sub-projects.

III. Safeguard Policies that might apply

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional)
Environmental 
Assessment OP/BP 
4.01

Yes Potential environmental impacts are anticipated under 
Component 2: Enhancing Investments to Promote Sustainable 
Rural Development and Component 3: Support for Irrigation. 
The major portion of Component 2 remains the provision of 



Page 8 of 14

grants which were also administered under the original project. 
The grants were awarded based on a screening criteria set forth 
in the ESMF prepared for the project in October 2010 and 
subsequently revised in 2015. This revision solely dealt with 
changes in the Kosovo environmental legislation and did not in 
any form alter the overall screening procedure within the 
ESMF. The screening criteria as set forth in the ESMF helps to 
screen out project activities corresponding to a category A, and 
to provide adequate due diligence on a case-by-case basis for 
the rural grants. The ESMF had undergone a slight revision in 
January 2017, where the irrigation activities have also been 
added in the project description and small changes were made 
to ensure that all activities even beyond grants are covered 
through the process in the ESMF. The screening and due 
diligence mechanisms remain the same as within the original 
ESMF from 2010.  
The approach outlined in the ESMF from January 2017 will 
apply to the rural grants, matching grants, irrigation rehab and 
any activity that would be proposed to be financed within the 
project or the subsequent AFs. Furthermore, any strategic and 
planning documents to be produced under Component 3(b) 
will also incorporate adequate safeguards requirements within 
the Terms of Reference for any proposed study or plan.  
The environmental impacts associated with the grants program 
and irrigation rehab should be readily mitigated through sound 
construction practices (dust and noise, waste management, 
material sourcing) while the operational impacts can be 
mitigated through environmentally friendly farming 
approaches (manure management, waste disposal, emissions 
from food processing facilities, improved water resource use).  
Under Component 3, rehabilitation of the Radoniqi irrigation 
scheme is foreseen which would lead to better management of 
water resources. This activity will potentially cause minor 
construction related impacts (noise, dust, waste generation).   
A full and robust ESMP will be prepared to address risks and 
impacts of implementation of this scheme, including assessing 
impacts to other water users. 
➢❨❫

Natural Habitats OP/
BP 4.04

No There are no implications on natural habitats foreseen.

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No There are no implications on forested areas foreseen.
Pest Management OP 
4.09

Yes Due to the fact that the project would more than likely lead to 
increased agricultural production, it is safe to assume that there 
would be an increased need for pest management. As such, an 
Integrated Pest Management Plan was part of the original 
ESMF (2010) andalso the revised ESMF (2015 and 2017).



Page 9 of 14

Physical Cultural 
Resources OP/BP 
4.11

No There are no activities involving physical / cultural resources 
foreseen.

Indigenous Peoples 
OP/BP 4.10

No There are no implications for indigenous people.

Involuntary 
Resettlement OP/BP 
4.12

No This safeguards will not be triggered because the potential 
works proposed for the scheme rehabilitation are as follows: 
 
(i) Lining and repair of main canal sections, replacement 
of parts such as valves, etc.   
(ii) rehabilitation of of irrigation delivery in two secondary 
sub-schemes  
(iii) minor works related to dam safety and the Drini river 
aqueduct 
 
Given the nature of rehabilitation works, there will be no need 
for land take although there might be some crop damages for a 
temporary period of time while the works are ongoing. The 
protocol defined in the ESMF addresses the crop damage 
compensation which will be operationalized with concrete 
ESMPs .

Safety of Dams OP/
BP 4.37

Yes Although the project will not build any dams, the Radoniqi 
Irrigation scheme depends upon the existing Radoniqi Dam for 
its effective functioning as the scheme draws its raw water 
directly from the Radoniqi reservoir controlled by a 61 meter 
high clay-core embankment dam. Several  Dam Safety 
Assessments have been carried out in the recent past for 
Radoniqi Dam, including in 2000, 2002, and 2006 under the 
WB supported Pilot Water Supply Project, and most recently 
in 2012 by the Water Task Force as part of a countrywide Dam 
Safety Review. While none of these reviews raise any concerns 
on imminent dam safety they make recommendations for 
operation and maintenance procedures and safety-related 
measures that are required to ensure an acceptable standard of 
safety. More precisely, this includes the need for critical 
documentation and information on dam safety, including 
geotechnical information, an update on and improvement of 
status of control instruments (inclinometers and piezometers 
are reported as largely dysfunctional) and electrical 
installations. Also, it is observed that there is no dam safety 
(monitoring) plan, although a letter from the dam operator 
states that geodetic measurements have been carried out to 
some extent over the past years. Most of the recommendations 
have not been fully implemented since. The project proposes to 
adopt a composite of the 2005 and 2012 recommendations, to 
be confirmed by a dam safety panel to be established, and to 



Page 10 of 14

finance those under the project. The following activities are 
envisaged to be included under the program: updated safety 
analysis, including full geodetic survey, rehabilitation of dam 
safety instrumentation and an emergency preparedness plan.

Projects on 
International 
Waterways OP/BP 
7.50

Yes Component 3 includes works on rehabilitation of the Radoniqi 
irrigation scheme, which is part of the trans-boundary Drini 
river basin. However, considering that the works will focus on 
better use and management of the existing irrigation scheme 
the team does not foresee any issues on water quality or 
quantity to downstream users. As such, an Exception to 
Notification was granted on December 16, 2016 by ECA VP.

Projects in Disputed 
Areas OP/BP 7.60

No The project will not be implemented in any disputed areas.

IV. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify 

and describe any potential large scale,  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
Potential environmental impacts are anticipated under Component 2: Enhancing Investments to 
Promote Sustainable Rural Development and Component 3: Support for Irrigation. The major 
portion of Component 2 remains the provision of grants which were also administered under the 
original project.  The grants were awarded based on a screening criteria set forth in the ESMF 
prepared for the project in October 2010 and subsequently revised in 2015. This revision solely 
dealt with changes in the Kosovo environmental legislation and did not in any form alter the 
overall screening procedure within the ESMF. The screening criteria as set forth in the ESMF 
helps to screen out project activities corresponding to a category A, and to provide adequate due 
diligence on a case-by-case basis for the rural grants. The ESMF had undergone a slight revision 
in January 2017, where the irrigation activities have also been added in the project description and 
small changes were made to ensure that all activities even beyond grants are covered through the 
process in the ESMF. The screening and due diligence mechanisms remain the same as within the 
original ESMF from 2010.  
The approach outlined in the ESMF from January 2017 will apply to the rural grants, matching 
grants, irrigation rehab and any activity that would be proposed to be financed within the project 
or the subsequent AFs. Furthermore, any strategic and planning documents to be produced under 
Component 3(b) will also incorporate adequate safeguards requirements within the Terms of 
Reference for any proposed study or plan.  
The environmental impacts associated with the grants program and irrigation rehab should be 
readily mitigated through sound construction practices (dust and noise, waste management, 
material sourcing) while the operational impacts can be mitigated through environmentally 
friendly farming approaches (manure management, waste disposal, emissions from food 
processing facilities, improved water resource use).  
Under Component 3 rehabilitation of the Radoniqi irrigation scheme is foreseen which would lead 
to better management of water resources. This activity will potentially cause minor construction 
related impacts already described above that can be mitigated through a site-specific ESMP, while 
additional concerns include dam safety issues and also the potential for impacts on international 
waterways as the reservoir and the scheme are located within the Drini river basin. 
The overall project would lead to an increase in agricultural practices therefore having 



Page 11 of 14

implications on pest management, which should apply and follow the Integrated Pest Management 
Plan as prepared under the original ESMF.  There are no social safeguard related issues. The 
works proposed are rehabilitation of existing schemes. Rehabilitation of lining of open main canal 
and secondary pressurized (piped) schemes where necessary in two sections. There will be no need 
for neither land take nor establishment of right of way. Crop damages because of the rehabilitation 
works will be addressed in ESMFS and related ESMPS 
The Terms of Reference for Component 3(b): Strategy and Investment Framework for the 
Irrigation Sector, will incorporate safeguards requirements to ensure that there is due diligence of 
all potential safeguards aspects under the propsoed Strategy/Investment Framework.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities 
in the project area:
There are no long term or indirect impacts associated with the project, beyond the potential 
increase in agricultural production and therefore implications on pest management, where the  
Integrated Pest Management Plan as prepared under the original ESMF should apply.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse 
impacts.
There are no project alternatives considered. The screening mechanism for the grants would allow 
to either accept or deny a sub-project based on their associated impacts.

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
The Borrower has applied the ESMF screening in the later grant calls, while some issues remained 
in the first call and the due diligence was carried out by an independent consultant retroactively. 
The borrower has also provided educational trainings and seminars on ESMF compliance and 
sound environmental practices in 2014. The Borrower has a dedicated M&E staff that also 
provides support to the implementation of the ESMF, and as required can hire an external 
consultant to be engaged in the implementation of the ESMF policies. The site-specific ESMP for 
the Radoniqi irrigation scheme will more than likely be carried out by a company or consultant 
outside the Borrower's team and will try to streamline the WB requirements and those of the 
Kosovo environmental legislation into one process. As for the grants, one of the requirements is 
that no grant is awarded without the environmental and social due diligence in place. This 
requirement is strictly supervised by all of the PIU and also by the World Bank team.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure 
on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The key stakeholders include representatives of the Project Implementation Unit and the MAFRD, 
as well as the members of the local communities where projects will take place. As such, the 
ESMF was subject to public consultations and disclosure in 2010 (as documented in the original 
ESMF) while each of the subsequent ESMPs prepared for each specific project was subject to 
disclosure and public consultations. For small scale projects public consultations were replaced by 
consent forms signed by all of the neighbors. The revised ESMF (as of January 2017) will be 
disclosed through the MAFRD website and Bank's Infoshop prior to the Appraisal of the AF.

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 

 
1. Lao PDR has achieved good progress in economic growth and poverty reduction over the past decade. Average 
growth of the gross domestic product (GDP) in the past decade was around 8 percent per annum. Poverty declined from 
41.4 percent in 2002/03 to 28.8 percent in 2012/13. With a GDP per capita of around US$1,600 in 2014, Lao PDR has 
become a lower-middle income country.  
 
2. Despite impressive macroeconomic achievements, poverty still remains high, especially in rural areas and 
among ethnic groups. Over 80 percent of the poor are concentrated in rural areas. About 40 percent of Mon Khmer and 
Hmong ethnic groups are poor, compared to 15 percent of Lao-Tai people, and ethnic groups account for about two thirds 
of people having no access to formal education. Stunting is also pronounced among ethnic groups.   
 
3. In many rural areas of the country, a high prevalence of food insecurity and malnutrition is still a major problem. 
Rice shortage often takes place for about 3-4 months per year. Prevalent farming systems are largely subsistent and 
generally lack diversification. Although the country is able to achieve self-sufficiency in rice at the national level in the 
normal year, there are still challenges in addressing food security due to the instability of annual production resulted from 
poor farming practices, ineffective water management, and frequent natural disasters (i.e. floods and droughts). 
 

Sectoral and Institutional Context 
 
4. Agriculture is an important sector in Lao PDR, but it is currently underperforming. The sector employs two-thirds 
of the country’s labor force, but generates only 22 percent of the GDP. In the last decade, agricultural growth averaged 
3.7 percent, which is less than half of the overall GDP growth. Agricultural farming is largely subsistent, producing one 
crop a year, mainly paddy with low productivity. Currently, irrigated agricultural land accounts for less than 15 percent of 
cultivated land and the remaining 85 percent is rain-fed. Recently, there have been emerging signs of agricultural 
commercialization and diversification (i.e. crop rotation or aquaculture with rice cultivation in low land areas; commercial 
production of maize in Xayabury province, and vegetables in Vientiane province). In the bigger context, however, these 
developments are still relatively scattered and small. 
 
5. Lao PDR’s agriculture sector is constrained by subsistent farming and small scale production with low level of 
commercialization, limited processing capacity, underdeveloped supporting infrastructure, and weak public services. 
Value chains of rice, maize, and vegetables are currently underdeveloped. There are good opportunities and potentials 
for improving their performance substantially through improving farm productivity and enhancing value chains. While the 
former could be realized by adopting quality seed/ farm inputs, improved farming technologies, upgrades of irrigation and 
improved water management, improved extension services/applied research, enhanced farming mechanization, 
improved harvest/postharvest facilities, and better farming diversification/crop rotation, the latter could be achieved by 
improved regulatory framework to facilitate trade and monitor quality standards, market analysis/research, 
transportation/ logistics, strategic support to agribusinesses, contract farming, and product branding and marketing. The 
recently completed project “Engaging the Private Sector to Develop the Lao Rice Industry” (EMRIP) demonstrated the 
readiness of the growing number of rice mills to modernize their facilities, engage in contract farming and develop 
marketing strategies.  

 
6. There are concerns related to the quality and sustainability of agricultural growth. Rice is the most important 
crop in the agriculture sector of Lao PDR. Rice production dominates agricultural land use, occupying nearly 56 percent of 



 
The World Bank  
Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (P161473) 

 
 

  
Apr 13, 2017 Page 4 of 12  

     

the total harvested area of all crops. More than 80 percent of the Lao rice crop consists of various types of glutinous rice. 
Maize, which constitutes about 12 percent of the harvested area, is the next most important crop. No other single crop or 
category of crops takes up more than around 5 percent of the cultivated land. In terms of the tonnage of crops produced 
at the national level, rice represents 81 percent of total weight of crops produced. Lack of diversification and heavily 
reliance on rice while there is an increasingly fierce competition in global rice markets are the key challenges to 
competiveness and sustainability of the agricultural growth of Lao PDR in the future. 
 
7. Addressing the risks and shortcomings of the sector will require re-organization of agricultural production and 
greater commercialization to support strategic value chains. According to the findings of the Project Identification 
Mission jointly carried out by Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) and the World Bank in November 2016, three 
strategic value chains were identified, which include: (i) rice value chains in the selected low land provinces; (ii) maize 
value chains in Xayabury province; and (iii) vegetables value chains in Vientiane province and possibly Vientiane Capital. 
These value chains are currently operating far below their potentials due to: (1) weak agriculture knowledge and 
information system (i.e. weak research and extension and private sector linkages, inadequate/weak delivery of extension 
and training services, use of poor quality seeds, lack of agricultural diversification); (2) poor production infrastructure (i.e. 
lack/degraded irrigation canals, poor maintenance of irrigation infrastructure, poor feeder roads to facilitate in-scheme 
mechanization); (3) inadequate mechanization facilities and equipment (i.e. lack of mechanization for harvesting and post-
harvest drying and processing, lack of  equipment and facilities for quality testing and storage); (4) lack of access to finance 
(i.e. underdeveloped banking sector, low capacity of rice mills to prepare business plans and secure loans); (5) inadequate 
enabling environment (i.e. constraints to new business entry/ business licensing, quality control and certification, public 
services to promote trade); and (6) insecure agricultural land tenure (i.e. risks of conversion of agricultural land to other 
uses, reduced incentives to invest and manage land by farmers). These constraints not only result in low farm productivity 
but also are generic causes for the poor performance of the agriculture sector and slow process of agricultural 
commercialization. 

 
8. The Government has recognized the need to promote a substantial shift in the agriculture sector from 
subsistent farming to sustainable commercial agriculture following cluster development and value chain approaches. 
On November 18, 2016, the Government through Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) sent an Official Letter to the 
World Bank requesting the support on agricultural commercialization in order to improve the sector’s performance 
especially along the rice value chains. Yet, there is also an increasing attention of the Government to other crops such a 
maize, horticulture, beans and pulses, and aquaculture, to increase diversification and farm incomes, as well as to improve 
food security and reduce malnutrition. 
 

Relationship to CPF 
 

9. The proposed project is aligned with the National Agriculture Sector Plan to 2020 and Strategy to 2025, in which 
improving the commercialization and competiveness of the agriculture sector are the top priorities. The proposed 
project also supports several objectives of the Eighth National Socio-Economic Development Plan (NSEDP), namely 
Outcome 2.2 “Food security ensured and incidence of malnutrition reduced” and Outcome 3.3 “Reducing the instability 
of agricultural production caused by impacts of natural disasters.”  
 
10. The proposed project is consistent with the Systematic Country Diagnostic (2016), which placed an increase in 
agricultural productivity to support incomes among the top priorities to reduce poverty and boost shared prosperity in 
Lao PDR, and with the Country Partnership Framework (CPF) 2017-2021. It contributes to achieving its Objective 1.2 
“Making it easier to do business and create jobs” under the Focus Area 1 “Supporting Inclusive Growth” and Objective 2.1 
“Reducing the prevalence of malnutrition” under the Focus Area 2 “Investing in People.”

11. The proposed project is closely aligned with the twin goals of ending extreme poverty and boosting shared 
prosperity and with the global Sustainable Development Goals, including Zero Hunger (Goal 2) and Climate Action (Goal 
13).   The project would directly provide benefits to local farmers in four provinces, namely Xayabury (those associated 
with maize value chains), Vientiane Province (vegetables value chains), and Bolykhamxay and Khammouane Provinces and 
Vientiane Capital (rice value chains). Most farmers in these provinces are practicing subsistent agriculture with low/ 
unstable productivity and low incomes. Generally speaking, rural farmers among poor groups in Lao PDR and some of 
them are living under extreme poverty. 
 
C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  
 

12. The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to increase commercialization of selected value chains in the project 
areas. 
 
Key Results (From PCN) 

 
13. The proposed PDO-level results indicators are:  
 

(i) Number of project beneficiaries (men and women; core indicator);  

(ii) An increase in productivity from those farmers adopting new technologies; 

(iii) An increase in the sale volumes (percentage) from those farmers adopting new technologies; 

(iv) An increase in the quality of the produce sold to agribusinesses through production alliances. 
 
D. Concept Description 

 
14. The proposed Agriculture Commercialization Project (ACP) seeks to enhance the competitiveness and 
sustainability of Lao PDR’s agriculture sector through technical and financial support to increase in agricultural productivity 
and commercialization in selected strategic value chains. The project would focus on: (i) the geographical areas with high 
agricultural development potentials; (ii) the farming systems with high potentials for commercialization (i.e. paddy, maize, 
vegetables); (iii) promotion of good agricultural practices and climate smart agricultural technologies and farming system 
diversification to enhance food and nutritional security; (iv) building capacity for farmers’ organisations, agribusinesses, 
public and private service providers; and (v) building on and developing synergies with other government/donor programs.  
 
15. Proposed project areas: In line with the above strategy, the project would select Provinces and Districts with: (i) 
high potentials for agricultural production (farm land and production volume); (ii) high potentials for commercialization 
and value chain development; (iii) availability of basic public infrastructure (i.e. irrigation, roads,  etc.); (iv) public services 
in place to support commercialization and diversification; and (v) availability of agribusinesses interested in inclusive value 
chain development. The list of target provinces is provisionally set as Vientiane capital, Vientiane province, Bolikhamxay, 
Khammouane, and Xayabury. The Provinces will be confirmed and districts will be identified before pre-appraisal mission. 
Three selected value chains could be initially selected for project preparation purposes – namely high value commercial 
rice (not subsistence), maize, and vegetables -- while allowing flexibility to add other, high-value crops during the life of 
the project. 

 
16. It is envisage that the Project would have three components: (A) Enhancing Productivity of Farming Systems; (B) 
Support for Improved Value Chains; and (C) Project Management.

17. Component A: Enhancing Productivity of Farming Systems: This component would aim at enhancing productivity 
of farming systems and it would include the following activities:  

 
(i) Production organization and promotion of the use of good quality seeds;  
(ii) Research and extension to improve farming practices and farm machinery to promote good and 

sustainable agricultural production, diversification and commercialization;  

(iii) Upgrades of existing irrigation infrastructure and improvement of water management practices; 

(iv) Establishment and capacity building for farmer groups and their members; and  

(v) Mapping, demarcation, and registration of irrigation land/systems in the project area on a block basis (not 
for individual plots).  

 
18. Component B: Strengthening Agricultural Value Chains. This component would aim at strengthening and 
leveraging private sector investments in selected food value chains, and it would include the following activities:  
 

(i) Provision of matching grants to farmer groups and their members to promote investments in harvesting 
machines, drying and storage facilities to reduce pre/postharvest losses; 

(ii) Provision of matching grants and capacity building assistance to agribusinesses to strengthen their role in 
driving the value chain development; 

(iii) Upgrades of feeder access to production areas and farms;  

(iv) Training and consulting support to farmer groups and their members to build their management skills, 
business development and marketing of farm produce through adopting contract farming, value addition 
and product branding;  

(v) Support MAF, Ministry of Industry and Commerce (MOIC), their research institutes and technical agencies 
in conducting relevant market research, agricultural policy analyses, and improving intelligence and 
management skills; and  

(vi) Improving the enabling environment through strengthening capacity for quality control and standards 
certification (i.e. seeds, produce, mills, etc.) including improved inspection services, test kits and 
laboratory capacity to certify for clean and safe foods. 

 
19. Component C: Project Management. This component would provide equipment and incremental operating costs 
for project monitoring, financial management, and procurement activities, ensure compliance with the safeguards, 
support the short and long-term technical assistance to the project management team in selected areas, and support 
analysis and dissemination of findings related to the effectiveness and challenges associated with the different 
institutional and technical models being applied or piloted under the project.  
 
20. The project would establish and support linkages with ongoing and future interventions by other donors including 
ADB, IFC, NGOs, and government projects/programs. For instance, farmer groups and agribusinesses which received 
previous supports from the Netherlands Development Organization SNV’s Enhancing Milled Rice Production in Lao PDR 
(EMRIP) will be eligible for further support from this project in order to be more effective and efficient. The farmer groups 
and agribusinesses participating in this project would be well positioned to graduate and become potential clients of IFC 
in the future. This proposed project would seek to create complementary and enhance synergy of existing 
projects/programs in the areas.

  SAFEGUARDS 

 
A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 

 
The list of target provinces is provisionally set as Vientiane capital, Vientiane province, Bolikhamxay, Khammouane, and 

Xayabury. The Provinces will be confirmed and districts within identified before pre-appraisal mission.   
 
Component A (Enhancing Productivity of Farming Systems) would include production promotion of the use of good 

quality seeds, research and extension to improve farming practices and farm machinery to promote sustainable 
agricultural production, diversification and commercialization, upgrades of existing irrigation infrastructure and 
improvement of water management practices. Component B (Support for Improved Value Chains) would strengthen and 
leverage private sector investments in selected food chains. Component (Project Management) would support project 
management including monitoring and evaluation, financial management and procurement to ensure compliance with 
the fiduciary safeguards requirements. 
 
The project’s overall impacts are expected to be positive. Some negative impacts are envisaged to be limited, localized, 

manageable and reversible. It is anticipated that the following World Bank safeguard policies will be triggered: 
Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01), Pest Management (OP 4.09), Indigenous Peoples (OP/BP 4.10), Involuntary 
Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12), Safety of Dams (OP/BP 4.37), and International Water Ways (for irrigation rehabilitation). At 
present, there is insufficient information to determined if Natural Habitats (OP/BP 4.04) and Physical Culture Resources 
(OP/BP 4.11) are triggered, hence it is classed as TBD. Mapping, demarcation, and registration of irrigation land/systems 
are not expected to cause changes in land use types and land ownership as they will be carried out a block basis (not for 
individual plots). Forced child labor and labor influx are not anticipated from the project. The project would comply with 
the three gender tags proposed by the World Bank Standards. This is to ensure that the project will address gender in 
terms of (i) analysis; (ii) action; and (iii) monitoring and evaluation framework. During project preparation, the project will 
develop specific/tailored measures to enhance equal access/opportunities for women to benefit from the matching 
grants and other project activities. 
 

 
B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 

 
The project will be executed though the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) with its provincial and district offices 

(PAFOS and DAFOs) in collaboration with Provincial Industry and Commerce Offices (PICOs) to be responsible for actual 
implementation of day-to-day activities. The capacity of MAF is assessed to be adequate as they had extensive experience 
in managing and implementing donor-funding projects, including those from the WBG namely Agriculture Development 
Project (ADP), 2004-2008, Rice Productivity Improvement Project (RPIP), 2009-2012 and Lao Upland Food Security 
Improvement Project (LUFSIP), 2010-2014. Some of PAFOs and DAFO staff had have previous experience with the World 
Bank-financed projects but some are new especially to safeguard policies. To mitigate residual risks, technical assistance 
will be recruited and in place to provide specific technical capacity for the implementing agencies involved in safeguard 
preparation and implementation. A staff from MAF and each of PAFOs and DAFOs will be appointed as focal points for 
safeguards. These safeguard focal staff will be responsible for impact assessment, consultation, and preparation of 
safeguard instruments, implementation and compliance monitoring and reporting with technical support from the 
consultants. Safeguard training and assistance will be also provided by the Bank safeguard specialists and the National

Environmental and Social Project II (LENSII). 
 
C. Environmental and Social Safeguards Specialists on the Team 

 
 

 
D. Policies that might apply 

 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

The project will finance irrigation and drainage 
refurbishment and upgrades and water management 
practices. Investments in harvested machines and 
storage and training, and equipment provision.  
 
The envisaged investments are typical to similar 
agriculture development projects and are not 
expected to have adverse and unprecedented 
environmental and social impacts. Implementation of 
irrigation and drainage infrastructure and land 
improvements investments on farmer fields under 
Component 1 are mainly rehabilitation by their nature 
and not expected to have significant negative 
environment and social impacts.  
 
Given that the scope and targets of the project are still 
to be determined during the project preparation, an 
Environmental and Social Management Framework 
(ESMF) will be developed and applied by the project. 
ESMF will provide policy provisions, principles and 
process to address the environmental and social 
impacts. The policy framework will describe 
procedures for impact assessment, consultation, 
preparation of subsequent safeguard instruments and 
implementation arrangement. 

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 TBD 

It is expected that the project is only limited to areas 
of land already utilized for agriculture. NH will not 
likely be triggered as it is not anticipated at this stage. 
The project will have a ‘chance finds’ mechanism built 
into the ESMF to address the potential issues on NH. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No 

Forestry is not triggered as it is envisage that no 
project activities will take place on forest areas. The 
project would apply a screening process to eliminate 
subprojects which will impact on forests or involve 
forests in the early planning stage. 



 
The World Bank  
Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (P161473) 

 
 

  
Apr 13, 2017 Page 9 of 12  

     

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

The project will develop a Pest Management Plan in 
line with Lao legal regulations and World Bank Policies 
on pesticide uses. A negative list of chemicals will form 
be included. The Pest Management Plan will be the 
part of the ESMF. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 TBD 

The project may impact on physical cultural resources 
although it is expected to be limited to areas of land 
already utilized for agriculture. The project will have a 
‘chance finds’ mechanism built into the ESMF to 
address the potential issues on PCR. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 Yes 

Target beneficiaries and project areas will be identified 
during project preparation. It is likely that the project 
will operate in areas where there is a presence of 
ethnic groups, belonging to Mon-Khmer and Hmong- 
Hmong – lu Mien ethno-linguistic families, that meet 
the four characteristics specified as defining criteria 
for indigenous people in the World Bank Policy on 
Indigenous Peoples (OP/BP4.10). The project would 
conduct a Social Assessment to inform the preparation 
of the Ethnic Group Policy Framework (EGPF) to 
ensure that free, prior and informed consultations 
would be conducted with affected ethnic groups 
leading to their broad community support, and that 
they receive project benefits in a culturally 
appropriate manner. The EGPF will be prepared as a 
standalone document in line with OP 4.10 
requirements, and will be finalized before the project 
appraisal. 
 
Due attention will be given to ensure that ethnic 
groups do not suffer adverse impacts and that they 
receive culturally compatible social and economic 
benefits. Necessary steps and procedures will be 
included to ensure that the cultures of the multi-
ethnic society are respected and that gender 
dimension are integrated at all levels and cycles of 
project implementation. A feedback and grievance 
resolution mechanism will be developed and applied 
under the project to provide affected ethnic groups a 
legitimate platform for monitoring and reporting on 
the safeguard policy compliance as well as on project 
implementation. 
 
The project will provide training to its staff, 
consultants and their partners on the EGPF to ensure 
that they are aware of and able to comply the policy 



 
The World Bank  
Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (P161473)

requirements. Details of due diligence procedures will 
be described in the EGPF. 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

Under Component A of the project: Enhancing 
Productivity of Farming Systems aiming at enhancing 
productivity of farming systems, minor land 
acquisition are envisaged from the rehabilitation of 
existing irrigation schemes. The civil works may 
involve expansion of intake, local reservoirs and 
irrigation canals.  These potential impacts can be 
avoided or minimized through proper design, impact 
assessment, consultation and application of mitigation 
measures. Given that the irrigation subprojects and 
areas to be covered are still unknown and to be 
identified during the project preparation, a 
Compensation and Resettlement Policy Framework 
(CRPF) will be developed and applied by the project 
which is in compliance with OP/BP 4.12 requirements.  
The CRPF will complement the EGPF and ESMF, 
especially in terms of implementation arrangements.  
If land or asset loss are unavoidable, the principles and 
procedures described in the RPF will be applied to 
address negative impacts.  Project staff, consultants 
and its partners will be provided with training and 
support to enable them to comply the policy 
requirements. 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 Yes 

Although the project does not plan to include 
construction/rehabilitation of dams, it may include 
small scale irrigations which use or rely on dams. The 
project will prepare safeguard documents to comply 
with OP/BP 4.37 requirements. 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

Yes 

The policy is triggered as the proposed project 
investments are located in areas that are part of the 
Mekong River Basin. However, the project targets 
rehabilitation and improvements of existing irrigation 
systems and the rehabilitation works will not involve 
any adverse impacts on the quality and quantity of 
waters in the Mekong River. The team will prepare for 
a notification process for downstream riparian nation 
states. 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No The project will not be active in disputed areas.

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 
 

Moldova is a landlocked country between Romania to the west and Ukraine to the north, east and south; the country 

has a surface area of 33,840 km2, and is home to 3.6 million people. Moldova’s rich soils and mild climate are ideal 

for farming, and agriculture has traditionally been a key sector in Moldova’s economic structure. The sector 

represented about 13 percent of Moldova GDP in 2014 with a value of about 14.5 billion MDL (about US$1.05 

billion). Agriculture employs nearly a third (28 percent) of the country’s population, and agro-food exports account for 

roughly 50 percent of the country’s total exports. In spite of its large size and significant contribution to the economy, 

the average agricultural sector growth rate performance has been low at 3.6 percent per annum over the last 10 years, 

mainly due to the sector’s vulnerability to the weather.

In the context of overall economic growth, Moldova has made significant progress in reducing poverty and boosting 

shared prosperity. The economy was growing at 5 percent annually after 2000, and the national poverty rate (below $5 

per day) dropped from 68 to 11.4 percent between 2000 and 2014. Public and private transfers, namely pensions and 

remittances, as well as labor markets had an important role in reducing poverty. The Moldovan economy, however, 

moved into recession in 2015 (-0.5 percent growth in GDP) because of weaker external flows, large-scale banks fraud, 

and a drought. Economic troubles in Russia and Ukraine, together with Russia’s restrictions on agro-food imports from 

Moldova sharply reduced remittances from and halved Moldova’s exports to Russia. Further, a banking crisis brought 

on by massive fraud in three banks has lowered confidence in the banking sector, leading to significant interest rates 

and reduced credit to the private sector. The monetary and fiscal resolution of the three insolvent banks (12 percent of 

GDP) has led to higher public debt and lower foreign exchange reserves, damaged business confidence and reduced 

macroeconomic buffers to sustain economic shocks. 

 

Political instability became more marked between 2013 and 2015, manifesting itself as frequent changes of governing 

coalitions. There were seven prime ministers or acting prime ministers and three periods without a Government 

between September 2014 and January 2016. The November 2015 Public Opinion Barometer (bi-annual poll measuring 

political, social and economic sentiment) showed that 88 percent of Moldovans thought that the country was moving in 

the wrong direction. Corruption and governance indicators have also worsened markedly. Moldova fell from the 30th 

to the 20th percentile for Control of Corruption between 2012 and 2014 (2015 World Governance Indicators). The 

Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey shows a fourfold increase in the percentage of firms that 

rate the bribing of both officials and members of parliament during 2005-13 as negatively impacting the business 

environment. 

 

Moldova remains one of the poorest countries in Europe. Poverty is largely a rural phenomenon as rural national 

poverty stands at 19 percent compared to 5 percent for urban areas. With 57 percent of the population living in rural 

areas, 84 percent of the poor are concentrated there. Those in rural areas, poor and non-poor, rely more on agriculture 

and remittances for income sources than their urban counterparts who derive more income from non-agricultural 

employment. Therefore, rural areas felt the shock of the 2007 drought much more than urban areas, with poverty ($5 

per day) increasing from 31 percent in 2007 to a peak of 36 percent in 2009. Stocks of agricultural products vanished 

in many rural households, and prices and expenditure in households’ budgets for food and energy rapidly grew. A 

severe summer drought in 2015, along with lower remittances and higher inflation, has further pushed the poverty rate 

up to 41.9 percent. Climate change impacts, if not properly managed, could undermine progress made in poverty 

reduction, and adversely impact food security and economic growth in vulnerable rural areas.  

 
Sectoral and Institutional Context 
 

Despite being landlocked and therefore having no exposure to sea-level rise, the ND-GAIN  methodology ranks 

Moldova as the most climate vulnerable country in Europe, based on a range of social and economic indicators. 

Temperature and rainfall have increased in Moldova over the last century. Climate models predict future mean 

temperature rises exceeding 20 by mid-century, and a slight increase or significant decline in precipitation, depending 

on region. Extreme climatic events and other climate-related challenges are expected to worsen in the future, with 

important implications for economic growth, and especially for the rural poor, who are more dependent on natural 

resources and more vulnerable to climate-related shocks. 

 

In 2014, the Government of Moldova, through the Ministry of Environment and with support of UNDP and the 



 
The World Bank  
Moldova Climate Adaptation Project (P155968) 

 
 

  
Feb 01, 2017 Page 4 of 16  

     

Government of Austria, developed and approved a National Climate Change Adaptation Strategy, reviewing climate 

change vulnerabilities in the six sectors considered most vulnerable, agriculture, water resources, forestry, human 

health, energy and infrastructure. The strategy included an initial action plan to 2020, at an estimated budget of 

US$155 million, based on institutional and investment activities recommended within each sector. More recently, the 

Bank has supported the Government to carry out a more systematic analysis of the costs of inaction on within each of 

these sectors, and the potential volumes and cost-benefit of physical investments for climate adaptation. Given the 

importance of the sector, a parallel climate-smart agriculture profile was prepared through collaboration with CIAT. 

The studies identified key current investment needs in warning and response systems to extreme climate events, in 

resilient land management through improved agricultural practices and forestry, and in water resources management, 

and findings are summarized below (see annex 3 for more detail). 

 

Agriculture: For most crops, yields in Moldova are around a quarter to a third lower than other Eastern European 

countries. Only around 1% of land is irrigated, and droughts occur every few years, and results in estimated annualized 

costs of around $20 million. The most severe droughts, such as that of 2007, have significant impacts on GDP and 

food security. Crop losses are also incurred from flooding, late frosts, hail and windstorms. Climate change is expected 

to reduce the productivity of most current crops by 10-30%, as well as increasing the frequency and intensity of most 

extreme events, and presenting new pest and disease challenges. Annual crops will be more severely impacted than 

perennials, with typical conditions for fruit orchard and vineyards potentially even improving under climate change, 

but recent trends have seen an increase in annual cropping over perennials due to a lack of investment in rejuvenating 

orchards and vineyards when they reach the end of their productive lives. 

 

With rural finance only available at high interest rates, lack of investment is a general problem in the sector. Around 

43% of agricultural land and 80% of pasture land (which is mostly communally managed under local government 

authorities) is degraded to some degree, which makes the land even more vulnerable to climate variability and change. 

The productivity of pasture land has been estimated at 20-50% of its potential. The annual opportunity cost of inaction 

in the agriculture and livestock sectors is estimated to be around $240 - $480 million at present and to rise significantly 

over coming decades. Scaling up adoption of irrigation and a range of other climate-smart and sustainable agricultural 

technologies will be critical to the productivity and resilience of the sector. 

 

Forests: Moldova has the lowest forest cover in Europe at only 11.4 percent. Forests tend to occur in hilly areas with 

the majority of them located in the central part of Moldova, slightly less in the north and even fewer in the south. Tree 

species are mainly broad leafed - oak, ash, hornbeam, black locust and poplar being the most significant. Moldovan 

forests are already fragmented and stressed, and climate-related changes in species growth and composition are being 

observed. Climate change is expected to reduce the productivity of natural forests and change pathology patterns. 

Annual opportunity costs of inaction are estimated to be around $40 million, and to increase marginally over coming 

decades. Areas for immediate interventions are ecological reconstruction of the present forest estate and the expansion 

of forest vegetation, including the creation of new forest shelter belts, which play an important role in protecting crops 

from high winds, desiccation and uneven snow cover. 

 

Water Resources: Most of Moldovan territory lies between two main rivers (the Nistru and Prut) which originate 

outside its territory, but surface water resources are limited in much of the area in between. About 65 percent of the 

population use water abstracted from groundwater supplies. Utilization of water resources is already much lower than 

during Soviet times. Only around 6% of the previous area is currently under functional irrigation, and irrigation and 

potable water supply from ground water is a problem within many rural areas owing to decreased water level and its 

quality. Even with the potential for slightly increased rainfall in some areas, overall water availability is expected to 

decrease with climate change due to the combined changes in precipitation and temperature. Despite low levels of

current use, total water availability is expected to fall below total demand within a couple of decades, as demand grows 

but supply falls, and Moldova is among countries predicted to have high water stress in 2040. The most populated and 

economically important regions are the most vulnerable to expected climate change, and some regions are already 

facing water shortages. Addressing deficits in these regions will be critical for supporting a sustainable economic 

recovery. The costs of water shortages could be measured in the hundreds of millions or billions of US$ by the 2040s, 

and investments in improving the efficiency of water usage and additional storage will be needed to avert them. The 

current project would make its contribution reducing water deficit for farmers by providing access to irrigation 

schemes, by promoting better and more adapted to climate changes agricultural practices, as well as by conducting 

large-scale information dissemination and demonstrational activities in this regard. 

 

Climate knowledge and emergency response: Moldova suffers from a range of natural disasters, most of which are 

weather related. Current annualized costs of flooding are estimated to be around $60 million, and to increase to several 

times that over coming decades as flood frequency and the volume of assets at risk increase. The World Bank has 

already invested in disaster response management through the Disaster and Climate Risk Management Project, 

DCRMP (2010-16; US$12 million), which is assessed to have had a significant effect on reducing economic losses. 

Nevertheless, recent hail and rain storms (June 2016) showed that the country is not as well prepared for natural 

hazards as it aims to be. In particular, and as recently highlighted by the Prime Minister, local delivery and translation 

of early warning to early action, as well as effective response, need further strengthening. This requires not only 

bolstering of sub-national command structures and facilities/equipment, but also ensuring that local first responders, 

authorities, public services and businesses are better prepared.  

 
Relationship to CPF 
 

The proposed project is fully consistent with and anticipated in the FY14-17 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) that 

was approved on August 9, 2013. Specifically, the project combines two operations anticipated in the CPS - on 

sustainable forest management and climate adaptation - contributing to the third pillar on “promoting a green, clean 

and resilient Moldova.” Through the proposed project, the Bank will support the country in identifying and 

implementing interventions for improved environmental practices and natural resource management, and greater 

adaptation to the impact of climate change. The project also aims at ensuring that poverty reduction and shared 

prosperity are delivered in an environmentally sustainable manner, while also reducing the vulnerability of rural 

households, which represent a disproportionately high share of the bottom 40 percent and largely rely on self-produced 

foods, to the vagaries of extreme weather events. As described in the CPS, the project will assist in improving under-

developed weather mitigation instruments as part of adaptation efforts, which leave the rural population, farmers in 

particular, highly vulnerable to adverse weather events, thus compromising their food supply. All these efforts are 

expected to support the Bank’s major emphasis on increasing resilience to climate related risks and disasters.  

 
 

C. Proposed Development Objective(s)        
 
The PDO is to enhance adoption of climate-smart agriculture and forestry practices in targeted landscapes and 
strengthen national disaster management systems.

D. Concept Description 

 
The emerging findings of the Climate Adaptation Technical Assistance show that there are substantial needs for (i) pro-

poor and complementary adaptation investments across a range of sustainable land and water management activities and 

(ii) cross-cutting climate information and emergency response. Accordingly, the Moldova Climate Adaptation & Forestry 

Project (CAFP) is proposed to focus on a mutually reinforcing set of investments that help to address several key 

adaptation issues and target the most vulnerable through: 

 

i. An integrated approach to supporting resilient rural landscapes through investments in on-farm irrigation and other 

adaptation activities, and forest-based restoration of degraded lands. 

 

ii. Strengthening of climate knowledge and disaster-risk management systems to improve understanding of climate 

impacts, and preparedness and response mechanisms, that will benefit a range of sectors. 

 

Project structure and key activities: 

 

Component 1: Resilient rural landscapes [$32 million indicative] 

 

Rural productivity in Moldova is lower than regional standards, and agriculture, livestock and forest systems are 

vulnerable to climate pressures. Only around 6% of the area covered by soviet-era schemes and less than 1% of 

Moldova’s arable land is under functional irrigation, and crops are vulnerable to flooding, late frosts, hail, windstorms and 

snow accumulations, as well as droughts. Many forests and pasture lands are degraded, and faced with intensifying 

climate-related threats such as fire and pests/disease. Particularly lands managed by local public authorities are degraded  

due to weak management capacity of the LPAs. Improving the management of these systems in unison is mutually 

reinforcing as it will support diversified rural incomes (thereby increasing resilience to individual climate shocks) as well 

as reducing vulnerability and increasing productivity through synergistic ecological services- e.g. the role that forests play 

in sheltering fields and protecting soil and water sources. 

 

The component would rely on investments in the following complementary activities within one or more target 

landscapes. 

 

Subcomponent 1.1: Support to the Agricultural Sector [$10 million indicative] 

 

The project would support the up-scaling of activities that have been previously tested through donor-supported pilot 

projects and have demonstrated successful mitigation and adaptation measures with potential for larger scale 

interventions. A number of resilience practices have been tested, generating locally-tuned models, farmer experience, and 

implementation-service delivery capacity has been created. stimulated emulation by the neighboring farmers. Discussions 

with producers confirm that these programs have been well-received and that there is a degree of emulation by 

neighboring farmers, but there is still considerable scope and need for upscaling. 

 

While on-going analysis indicates that access to irrigation represents the highest-return option for increased resilience of

Moldovan agricultural production systems, the project will not focus on the rehabilitation of large-scale irrigation systems. 

These are not likely to be feasible in the context of the existing financing envelope for the project and current institutional 

constraints in the sector. Instead, the project would focus on building upon the results of the Millennium Challenge 

Corporation’s institutional and investment efforts in the rehabilitation of 10 large irrigation schemes, to provide further 

capacity building and/or investment resources to emerging water users associations/farmer groups for the sustainable use 

and expanded up-take of irrigation services. 

 

The project will provide financing for:   

 

a) Upscaling adoption of irrigation through assisting groups of farmers to access existing large-scale pumped systems 

rehabilitated by MCA, and by providing access to small-scale irrigation in the hinterlands through investments in shared 

equipment and infrastructure (e.g. rehabilitation of existing and construction of new water harvesting ponds). Both 

potential categories are likely to be located in the central and southern regions of the country. The potential ‘ready’ 

demand is assumed at around 15 percent of the potentially equipped irrigated area i.e., 30 000 hectares @ 15% = 4500 

hectares. The irrigated areas are used mostly for high value vegetable crops (tomato; cucumbers; onions; peppers; 
eggplants, etc.) and orchards. Based on the previous experience in the country the proposed activities do not 

cause any risks and impacts related to child and forced labor. 
 

b) Upscaling demonstration activities on climate smart agriculture technologies: i.e. integrated climate resilient practices 

and investments such as drip irrigation, greenhouses, minimum and no-till agriculture, UV/hail nets, etc. The project 

would aim to support around 100 producers, leading to at least 200 demonstration events and to around 3000 knowledge 

beneficiaries. 

 

c) Extension and knowledge dissemination on lower-cost on-farm adaptation practices: multi-cropping, inter-cropping, 

silage, climate smart herd management, introduction to organic farming, etc. The project would aim to support 

compilation of existing knowledge into publications and practical guidelines, with more on-hands delivery of knowledge 

to around 1000 farmers in dedicated workshops. 

 

The project would support the upscaling investments mentioned in (a) and (b) above with matching grant financing. 

Matching grants would not exceed 30% of the overall cost for any particular climate smart investment, as well as be under 

US$50,000, and would be provided on a competitive basis (in transparently held calls of proposals), against clearly 

established eligibility and performance implementation criteria, including a public good element, such as associative 

collaboration between farmers and/or a public demonstration element. Demonstration investments will be subject to 

commitments for inclusion in a demonstration plot circuit and allowing access by agri-consultants and interested farmers. 

 

Support for these activities is likely to be delivered to local communities and farmers through the country’s National Rural 

Development Agency (ACSA) for the proliferation of climate smart agriculture practices and technologies (through 

demonstration plots, farmer schools and climate-informed extension), and through the involvement of ACSA and of the 

Millennium Challenge Account Unit for irrigation activities. The spatial focus of these interventions, given the relatively 

uniform levels of vulnerability of agricultural production systems throughout the country, is likely to be widespread and 

responsive to local demand and proactivity, but the menu of interventions would be fine-tuned to local agro-climatic 

conditions. 

 

Subcomponent 1.2: Forest and pasture management [indicative US$22 million indicative] 

 

In forest and pasture land management, project activities will aim at supporting ecological reconstruction, new forest belts 

and riparian buffers and restoration of degraded land. The precise selection of activities will be conditioned on progress on 

institutional restructuring in the forest sector.

Specific activities are in line with national forestry plans and could include: 

 

Institutional strengthening ($0.5 million) to support the implementation of the Forest Institutional Reform Strategy of 

Moldova (FIRSM, prepared in 2012 with support from ENPI-FLEG I program) through building capacity (equipment, 

enhancing professional and institutional capacity, etc.). 

 

Ecological reconstruction and improving the genetic diversity of state forests ($12 million) are high priorities. The aim is 

to consolidate existing forest resources by focusing mainly on the Central region where most forests are concentrated and 

to a lesser extent in the South. The project would support ecological reconstruction in an area of 5,000 to 10,000 ha 

depending on the intensity of presumed intervention ($9.5 million).This includes investments in the forest agency 

Moldsilva’s afforestation capacity along with financing forest reconstruction activities such as sanitary cuttings and 

selective cutting/clearing of nonnative species, as well as afforestation activities. For all areas proposed for ecological 

reconstruction a specialized design institute/agency will design a concrete scheme for such activities which will be 

preliminary reviewed and approved by the State Ecological Inspectorate in order to avoid any potential impacts on critical 

or important natural habitats with high biodiversity values. This will be done during the initial stage of project 

implementation and before contracting implementing agencies for these activities. 

 

Provision of appropriate seeds and seedlings material to support regeneration of native forests (mainly comprising oak 

species) would be addressed by investment in the National Centre for Forest Genetics and Seeds (NCFGS) under 

Moldsilva. Native seedling production would be enhanced through investments in irrigation and capacity for containerized 

seedlings production at the NCFGS ($2.5 million). Knowledge gaps in ecological reconstruction of forests would be 

addressed through a training program on the ecological reconstruction for the Moldsilva staff ($0.25 million). 

 

Agricultural shelterbelts, riparian buffers and afforestation on Local Public Authorities’ land ($6.5 million). This would 

include reconstruction of degraded shelterbelts on 1,000 ha ($0.75 million), creation of new forest belts on 1,000 ha ($1.5 

million) and riparian buffers on 1,000 ha ($1.5 million), as well as afforestation of around 1,500 ha of degraded land ($3.0 

million). These interventions would mainly target land owned by Local Public Authorities (LPAs). 

 

Improved management of LPA forests and pastures ($4 million) would increase the capacity of LPAs for managing 

communal land resources (mainly forests and pastures) in a participatory, planned and integrated way. This will support 

management planning for all forests that belong to LPAs but which do not have management plans yet (appr. 40,000 ha). 

The project would also support rehabilitation of degraded communal land, through improved pasture (and livestock) 

management, and silvo-pastoral approaches. 

 

Feasibility of activities on state lands currently managed by Moldsilva depend on if and when the FIRSM is implemented. 

The reforms are expected to be launched in fall 2016. If, however, they are delayed, more project resources will be 

allocated to management of locally administered lands. This alternative allocation of investments is represented in the 

table below. 

 

Private landowners have not yet been active in re/afforestation or production of e.g. for wood energy. This is due to 

fragmentation of private land ownership (average private property is about 1.2 ha) and due to very few degraded lands 

being privately owned. If feasible, the project may look at options (e.g. incentives or extension services) to promote wood 

production on private lands. 

 

Component 2: Disaster preparedness [$15 million indicative] Strengthened disaster management systems are needed to 

support a wide range of sectors with risk management planning and response to extreme hydrometeorological events. The 

Emergency Situations and Civil Protection Service (ESCPS) of the Minister of Internal Affairs has identified three 

priority investment areas that the project will seek to support, building on advances achieved during the DCRMP: 

 



 
The World Bank  
Moldova Climate Adaptation Project (P155968) 

 
 

  
Feb 01, 2017 Page 9 of 16  

     

(i) Establishment of two regional Emergency Command Centers. The DCRMP successfully established a modern national 

Emergency Command Center (ECC) in Chisinau. DCRMP’s scoping and feasibility studies indicated that to deliver 

effective management of emergency situations and preparedness across the country, two regional ECCs are also needed in 

the north and south of the country, in Balti and Cahul respectively. The project will therefore complete the national 

integrated risk management technical strategy by establishing the two regional ECCs. This will ensure better quality of 

services nationally at the local level, improve efficiency of support for remote locations, better support tactical field 

operations, and increase redundancy for critical ESCPS infrastructure. Cost is estimated at US$4 million, to be 

implemented over 5 years. 

 

(ii) Improving preparedness and emergency response capacity. Much of the equipment that ESCPS deploys to respond to 

climate and disaster emergencies is outdated and inefficient. For example, 90% of fire response equipment, which is used 

to manage both property and wildfires, is over 20 years old. Older equipment is also not compliant with modern 

environmental management approaches, often leading to negative environmental impacts during deployment. The project 

will therefore improve ESCPS’ preparedness and response capacity through investments in modern equipment, including 

but not limited to fire and rescue vehicles, extreme winter conditions access capacity, temporary flood management 

modules, electricity and heat generation, and equipment to support preparedness activities during non-crisis times. Base 

cost is estimated at US$3 million to be implemented over 3 years, scalable depending on financing availability. 

 

(iii) Establishment of a national training center. Currently Moldova does not have a national training center properly 

equipped for capacity building in theoretical and practical management of emergency situations. This prevents the state 

institutions, local public institutions of level I and II, the private sector and the public to effectively understand and 

manage disaster risk. Such a national training center would help ensure state and public preparedness for disaster and 

climate risks, improving risk management and awareness. The project will establish an ESCPS national training center, 

equipped for capacity building in both theoretical disaster risk management and practical training through simulations of 

emergency situations. The center will train ESCPS staff and first responders, as well as local leaders/authorities, managers 

of critical infrastructure (hospitals, schools, etc.), private sector leaders and the public. A location has already been 

identified and secured, with the cost estimated at US$5 million to be implemented over 5 years. 

 

Component 3: Providing immediate response to an eligible crisis or emergency as needed. A zero-budget contingent 

emergency response component (CERC) will enable funds to be rapidly reallocated to disaster response in the event of an 

eligible climate-related incident during the lifetime of the project. A crisis or emergency is defined for CERC eligibility in 

the same way as it is defined in World Bank OP/BP 10.00: an event that has caused or is likely to imminently cause a 

major adverse economic and/or social impact associated with crises or disasters due, in the case of this project, to 

hydrometeorological hazards. While the World Bank provides the Immediate Response Mechanism (IRM) to consolidate 

CERCs across national IDA projects for potentially larger multi-sectoral response financing, the preference is currently 

for a standalone CERC limited to funds under this project. Global experience has shown that standalone CERCs are more 

flexible and quicker to trigger ex-post. An IRM would require restructuring of existing projects to add CERCs to them. 

The Republic of Moldova would need to adopt a CERC Operations Manuals (OM), describing the actions to be taken 

when a crisis or emergency occurs, as well as the monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements of the emergency 

response. 

 

Component 4: Project coordination and management [$3.5 million indicative] 

This component will support knowledge and project monitoring systems, as well as overall project administration, 

including coordination across implementing agencies. As a member of the Intergovernmental Board on Climate Services 

(IBCS), Moldova has endorsed the Global Framework for Climate Services (GFCS). The GFCS strives to develop and 

incorporate science-based climate information and prediction into planning, policy and practice through close partnership 

between providers and users of climate information. The GFCS Partner Advisory Committee (PAC) has identified 

Moldova as one of six pilot countries. While through separate mechanisms the Bank and other development partners aim 

to support overall pursuit of GFCS at the national level, the project will provide technical assistance to strengthen the

Feb 01, 2017 Page 10 of 16  

     

production and use of climate information as a tool for coordination and management within certain sectors: 

 

(i) Climate information services. The State Hydrometeorological Service (SHS) carries a national mandate to deliver 

information services specifically on weather, climate and water hazards. However considering complementary ongoing 

and planned support from the Bank and other development partners, the project will not directly invest in SHS. The 

project will provide technical assistance to support future climate investment, including: 

 

a. Supporting institutional reform processes (including vision, strategy, restructuring, etc) of Apele Moldovei (or any 

successor water resources management agency), informed by modelling of climate-related water resources challenges and 

investment needs, and analysis of constraints to irrigation development, for example land fragmentation and markets, rural 

finance, drought compensation, moral hazard and crop insurance. Costing approximately US$1 million, this will lay the 

basis for potential future irrigation (and storage) investments. (including potentially as a basis for discussion of future 

World Bank financing). 

 

b. Facility/challenge fund for additional analytical/modelling work on climate impacts, for example health effects, 

analysis of crop potentials, etc., estimated to cost US$1 million. 

 

(ii) Overall project administration. Includes coordination across implementing agencies and project monitoring systems, 

expected to cost approximately US$1.5 million. 

 
 

  SAFEGUARDS 

 
A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)       

 
While the project activities will be implemented country wide, the main focus of the sub-component 1.a and 1.b will be 
implemented in the most vulnerable Southern part of the country which is one of the most affected by climatic 
changes region. The proposed activities would not generate any significant environmental and social risks as no major 
civil works or large scale ecological reconstruction activities in the forests will be supported. Some adverse 
environmental impacts might occur during afforestation activities which might affect the biological diversity and 
existing natural habitats, as well as some environmental risks and issues related to construction of the regional 
Emergency Command Centers and of the Emergency Training Center (solid waste management; air and water 
pollution; labor safety). 

 
B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies       

 
The project activities will be coordinated by an inter-ministerial steering committee chaired by the State Minister. The 
Ministries of Environment (MoE), and of Agriculture and Water Resources, Moldsilva, State Hydro-meteorological 
Service, and Department of Emergency Situations will be part of the steering committee, and will be implementing the 
some components of the project. 
 
Fiduciary arrangements, incl. safeguards, will be managed by the Project Management Team (PMT) in MoE. The PMT 
supported implementation of the Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs), and is currently supporting implementation of 
the Disaster and Climate Risk Management Project. These projects have financed, to a large extent, similar activities as 
the proposed project, in particular agricultural climate adaptation. The PMT staff has substantial experience in 
implementing environmental and social safeguards and the PMT EA capacity have been qualified as satisfactory. In the

last AMs for the Disaster and Climate Risk Project the project environmental management is satisfactory. Civil works 
were in compliance with the EMP and EMP Checklists for hydro-meteorological stations and for Department for 
Emergency Situations Command Center. The PIU has integrated environmental clauses in the bidding and contract 
documents. The EMP environmental requirements are followed and there were no complaints from the HS and DESCP, 
or supervising Engineers. All construction and refurbishing activities are reported as being consistent with national 
environmental and construction requirements and permits. Under the pilot activities for the consolidation of the 
agricultural sector’s resilience to adverse weather effects the PIU has assessed from environmental point of view all 
selected grants and checked if they have relevant environmental permits and authorization, including approvals from 
environmental inspectorate.  It is expected the matching grant program of the Project will be implemented via Agency 
for Interventions and Payments in Agriculture (AIPA)  which has also experience in conducting environmental screening 
and assessment of the grants. Analysis of AIPA’s EA capacities and if needed, capacity building activities, will be done 
during the project design phase. 
 
For the project implementation the PMT will hire safeguards specialist responsible for both environmental and social 
safeguards; if needed, WB Environmental Specialist will provide adequate on the job training.

D. Policies that might apply       

 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

The proposed project activities (production of forest 
reproductive material for climate resilience; 
ecological reconstruction of priority degraded forests; 
rehabilitation and establishment of shelter belts to 
protect fields and riparian buffers to protect water 
bodies; afforestation of degraded land; community-
based pasture management; matching grant facility 
which would support investments in drainage of 
waterlogged areas, in irrigation infrastructure 
rehabilitation and modernization, in on-farm water-
harvesting structures and efficient small-scale 
irrigation, anti-hail net systems, agroforestry, soil and 
water conservation techniques; improving emergency 
prevention and preparedness training by constructing 
a training and/or two regional Emergency Command 
Centers; etc.) might generate a series of various 
environmental and social impacts related to the 
following: (a) biodiversity degradation; (b) increased 
pollution of ground and surface waters due to soil 
erosion; (c) health and environmental risks due to 
inappropriate pesticides handling; and (d) noise, dust,

Moldova Climate Adaptation Project (P155968) 

 
 

  
Feb 01, 2017 Page 12 of 16  

     

air and water pollution, health hazards and labor 
safety issues during the civil works; etc. The 
anticipated social impacts of such activities include 
issues around (a) labor and working conditions, (b) 
information disclosure and stakeholder engagement, 
(c) community health and safety, (d) land acquisition, 
physical and economic displacement, lost access to 
natural resources. All of identified adverse impacts 
are expected to be typical for afforestation, 
agricultural production and irrigation activities as well 
as for small scale construction/rehabilitation works, 
temporary by nature and site specific and can be 
easily mitigated by applying best agro-forestry and 
construction practices or relevant mitigation 
measures.  
To address these impacts the client will prepare an 
Environmental and Social Assessment Framework 
which will guide the project activities and matching 
grants EA once identified. The ESMF would be 
targeted at specifying the set of mitigation, 
monitoring measures, timeframes and institutional 
responsibility measures to be taken during the 
project activities and matching grants to eliminate 
adverse environmental and social impacts, offset, or 
reduce them to acceptable levels. The documents 
should cover the following: rules and procedures for 
environmental screening; guidance for conducting 
activities/matching grants EIA and/or preparing 
simple EMPs as well as the EMP Checklist; possible 
mitigation measures for different proposed activities 
and matching grants to be supported by the project; 
requirements for monitoring and supervision of 
implementing of EIA/EMPs requirements. The ESMF 
will also provide a brief assessment of the associated 
to the project recently rehabilitated under the US 
“Compact Program” large irrigation pumping stations 
and schemes, in particular in terms of their 
compliance with the WB OPs. The project will require 
a framework for public consultation and information 
disclosure identifying all relevant, affected and 
interested stakeholders and will develop inclusive 
and meaningful ways of their involvement in the 
project design and implementation. This Public 
Consultation and Information Disclosure Plan or 
Stakeholder Engagement Plan will contain a section 
planning for continuous engagement, outreach to 



 
The World Bank  
Moldova Climate Adaptation Project (P155968) 

 
 

  
Feb 01, 2017 Page 13 of 16  

     

communities and stakeholder and information 
disclosure with respect to the project timelines and 
implementation. The PCID or SEP will be designed to 
reach out for both male and female audiences and 
provide opportunities for them to voice their opinion, 
concerns or comments about the project and its 
implementation. 

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 TBD 

At this stage of project design it is not known if this 
OP will be triggered. The NHs might be triggered first 
of all in the case of implementing ecological 
reconstruction activities. If the project will support 
such activities then the ESMF will provide detailed 
guidance for EA of such activities and areas. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 Yes 

While the project will not support any commercial 
wood harvesting this OP is triggered as the project 
will support afforestation activities along with the 
forest reconstruction activities in the degraded 
forests.  In order to make sure the project activities 
will not affect natural habitats and biodiversity 
conservation the ESMF will specify the rules and 
procedure for environmental screening and 
assessment of land plots given for afforestation or for 
creating forest shelterbelts as well as of the degraded 
forests selected for reconstruction activities. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

While the project will not finance purchasing and/or 
application of pesticides, it might support purchasing 
special equipment and would provide training on pest 
management in the forestry sector and thus the 
project triggers this OP. To address these issues the 
ESMF will include measures to raise awareness and 
educate foresters regarding safe pesticide handling 
and use of Integrated Pest Management to enhance 
sustainability and reduce human and environmental 
exposure to pesticides. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 No 
The project will be implemented on agricultural lands 
and in forest areas and will not generate impacts on 
PCRs. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 No N/A for Moldova 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

The OP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement is also 
triggered. Although it is expected all 
activities/subproject will be implemented on public 
lands, in some cases the proposed activities might 
affect private households or restrict access of the 
local population to the afforested lands or to 
pastures to be improved. To address the involuntary 
resettlement issues including impacts on livelihoods

on protected lands, and   restriction to access to 
natural resources, the client will prepare separate 
Resettlement Policy Framework that also includes a 
Process Framework.  For that the client will conduct a 
Social Impact Assessment (SIA) and a Gender 
Assessment that, based on what will be designed the 
RPF. 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 No N/A 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

Yes 

The proposed upscaling irrigation through assisting 
groups of farmers to access existing large-scale 
pumped systems rehabilitated by MCA, and by 
providing access to small-scale irrigation in the 
hinterlands through investments in shared 
equipment and infrastructure (e.g. rehabilitation of 
existing and construction of new water harvesting 
ponds) will not change the volume of 
extraction/discharge water or quality of water of the 
Prut and Dniester Rivers (which are international 
rivers) and its tributaries, but rather will lead to more 
efficient irrigation and drainage. Based on that the 
project team will seek a waiver from VP on not 
required notification of riparian parties. 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No N/A 

 
E. Safeguard Preparation Plan

Dec 12, 2016 
 
Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed. The specific studies and 
their timing should be specified in the Appraisal Stage PID/ISDS 
 
By end of October, 2016, the client will hire a local Consultant who will draft of the ESMF. By mid -December, 2016 the 
draft ESMF will be reviewed and accepted by the MoE and WB Environmental Specialist, and then disclosed on the 
MoE website. The RPF or PF, the SIA framework, Gender Assessment and the SEP will be developed by mid-October 
parallel to the ESMF. These will be reviewed and accepted by the MoE and WB Social Specialist and disclosed on the 
MoE website. In the end of December, 2016 the EA, RPF or PF, Gender Assessment and SIA document will be consulted  
with all key stakeholders (MoE; MoA; Ministry of Interior; State Agency Moldsilva) and all interested parties and then 
finalized, disclosed in the country on the MoE website and submitted to the WB for its disclosure in the Infoshop. The 
SEP or PCID document will govern consultation and disclosure requirements of such project documentation and will be 
made available on the MoE website as well.

B. Introduction and Context  
 
Moldova’s recent macro-economic performance has been characterized by consumption-led growth and low fiscal 



 
The World Bank  
Moldova Economic Governance Development Policy Operation (P156963) 

 
 

  
April 17, 2018 Page 3 of 5  

     

 

deficits. In 2016-17, GDP growth resumed reaching 4.5 percent on account of strong agricultural output and robust 
private consumption growth largely driven by remittances and public and private wage increases. At the same time, 
credit growth remains negative reflecting the limited pass-through of the monetary policy stance to commercial 
interest rates and tighter prudential standards in the banking sector.  The fiscal deficit is estimated to reach 0.8 
percent in 2017, lower than the deficit forecasted at budget stage and public debt remains sustainable under 
different stress-test scenarios. In 2018, growth is expected to remain robust and reach 3.8 percent but to moderate 
over the medium term. The inflation rate is expected to re-enter the target corridor due to base effects and lower 
regulated prices. Fiscal deficits are projected to remain under control.  
 
In a context of slowing growth over the medium term, addressing the structural impediments to efficient public and 
private sector governance is paramount for igniting new sources of growth. As a large share of the population is 
already living and working abroad, and the attachment of subsequent-generation migrants to Moldova declines along 
time, Moldova needs to search for new drivers of growth reliant on higher private sector investments and in this 
context, remove barriers to private sector access to and use of resources. Moreover, governance challenges undermine 
the efficiency of public resource use and constrain competition among businesses.  

 
 
 

Relationship to CPF 
 

In line with the World Bank FY18-21 Country Partnership Framework and the Moldova National Development 
Strategy, the proposed Economic Governance Development Policy Operation (EGDPO) supports Moldova’s transition 
towards a more sustainable and inclusive growth model. It builds on the progress achieved under the previous DPO by 
supporting actions to enhance the transparency of the banking sector and recent analytical work, which identifies 
strengthening the rule of law and the accountability of economic institutions as one of the top three constraints that are 
holding back economic growth and prosperity in the country.  
 
C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  

 

This operation supports reforms to strengthen economic governance in Moldova linked to the management of fiscal 

risks (Pillar A) and private sector development (Pillar B).  

D. Program Description   
 

This stand-alone Economic Governance Development Policy Operation (EGDPO) supports reforms to reduced fiscal risks 

and level the playing field for private sector development. The authorities are committed to restore investors’ and 

citizen’s trust in the integrity of the public sector by developing transparent and stable economic institutions and 

improving equity in access and use of resources. Reforms under the first pillar focus on reducing fiscal risks by reforming 

the pensions system, strengthening tax collection form tobacco taxation, pre-empting potential conflicts of interest of 

high level officials, and improving the reliability of SOEs and municipal enterprises’ financial information.    Reforms under 

the second pillar aim at removing bottlenecks in obtaining licenses, authorizations, and certificates and in accessing key 

agriculture inputs (seeds, seedlings, fertilizers, and pesticides), and at improving the governance regime in the banking 

and energy sector.

E. Implementation  
 

The Ministry of Finance will steer the administration of this operation, as the main body responsible for financial aid 

coordination and management. The Ministry of Finance has recently assumed this role and will be responsible for the 

supervision for the monitoring of progress in the policy areas supported by the operation.  

 
F.  Poverty and Social Impacts and Environment Aspects 
 

The operation is not expected to have adverse impacts along poverty, social, gender or environmental dimensions. 
Some of prior actions could have positive impacts on poverty and equity. The pension and tax related reforms promote 
social sustainability, reduce privileges that do not benefit large segments of population, especially poor, and incentivize 
healthier lifestyle. The pension reform and higher tobacco taxation contribute to the reduction of gender gaps in income 
and non-communicable diseases.  
 
G.  Risks and Mitigation 
 
Risks to the program implementation are moderate to substantial. Macro, sector strategies and technical design risks 
are considered substantial and are partially mitigated by the reforms supported by this operation, the recent record of 
Moldova’s prudent fiscal policy, the IMF program which serves as a macro-fiscal stability anchor, and the technical 
assistance (TA) provided by the World Bank Group (WBG) which will help continue the reform agenda.

Other Decision (as needed) 
 
 
B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 
 
Montenegro, a small, upper middle-income country, gained its independence in 2006 and is making big strides 
towards negotiating its accession to the European Union (EU). With a population of only 0.6 million, and a 
Gross National Income (GNI) per capita of US$7,320, Montenegro is the smallest country in the Western 
Balkans. It started negotiations with the EU in June 2012 and strives to join by 2020 ahead of the other countries 
in the Western Balkans. Of the 35 negotiations chapters, three have been provisionally closed and twenty-four 
have been opened. Good progress towards EU alignment has been made in areas such as free movements of 
goods, agriculture and rural development, food safety, veterinary and phytosanitary policy, energy, employment 
and social policy, regional policy and preparation for structural instruments. In the latest Progress Report on 
Montenegro (November 2016), the European Commission (EC) notes that the country is at early stages of 
preparation regarding budgetary and financial provisions, environment and climate change, and more needs to 
be done to improve competitiveness, as well as economic and monetary policy. Strengthening the 
administrative capacity for ensuring the application of the acquis communautaire remains a substantial 
challenge for Montenegro. 

 

Montenegro has followed a steady path of economic growth, but not without challenges. The economic boom, 
from 2000 to 2008, was triggered by a large inflow of capital that stimulated aggregate demand, led to a steady 
increase in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth, and a fall in the unemployment rate. During the boom, there 
was a steady decline in the percentage of households below the poverty line and an increase in the income of 
households in the bottom 40 percent, most of them in rural areas. After experiencing a double-dip recession due 
to the 2008 global financial and the 2012 Eurozone debt crises, Montenegro’s economy slowed down to 1.8 
percent in 2014 and recovered to 2.5 percent in 2016, continuing its recovery path (with 3.2 percent in 2017) 
due to investments in road infrastructure and robust tourism activity. However, the unemployment rate remains 
high at 17.3 percent in early 2017. Large fiscal deficit and growing fiscal debt have prompted the Government of 
Montenegro to adopt a set of fiscal consolidation measures aimed at reducing public spending.   

 

Montenegro’s overarching development goal is to achieve smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. Montenegro’s 
development plan is outlined in three separate, but complimentary strategies: the EU Accession Program 2014-2018, 
the Montenegro Development Directions (MDD) 2015-2018, and the Montenegro Economic Reform Program (ERP) 
2016-2018. Montenegro’s EU Accession Program was adopted in December 2013 and represents the main strategic 
document regarding European integration. It focuses on measures required for completing alignment with the acquis 
communautaire. The MDD, aligned with the Europe 2020 strategy, was adopted by the Government in July 2015. The 
MDD identifies four driving sectors, namely tourism, energy, agriculture and rural development, and manufacturing,

towards achieving the objective of “smart, sustainable and inclusive growth.” The ERP complements these efforts by 
tightening fiscal spending and reducing public debt. 
 
Sectoral and Institutional Context 
 
Agriculture is an important sector for the economic development of Montenegro. In this predominantly 
mountainous country, agricultural land represents 38 percent of total land area, two thirds of which is covered 
by pastures. Agriculture and food production play an important role in the economy, contributing 12 percent of 
GDP (with the primary sector contributing 10 percent, and agro-food processing and fisheries contributing 
around two percent). With agricultural exports increasing by around four percent annually during the last eight 
years, agricultural imports have been increasing much faster (around 16 percent annually) leading to the 
worsening of agricultural trade deficit from US$166 million in 2005 to quadrupling by 2014.  

 

Agriculture contributes to income and job creation, but much of it is not accounted for. Agriculture is the 
largest economic activity in rural Montenegro; close to 50,000 families (roughly a quarter of the country’s 
population), with an average holding of 4.5 hectares, derive their income partly or entirely from agriculture. 
Despite its small size, the agro-climate and landscape varies dramatically from the north to the south and coastal 
areas of Montenegro. Olive and citrus fruit production dominate in the coastal region; early vegetable 
production and vineyards - in the center and in proximity of the larger agglomerations of Nikšić and Podgorica; 
and, extensive livestock production - in the north. According to MONSTAT, in 2010 there were 2,347 people 
formally employed in agriculture. Yet according to the 2010 Agricultural Census, the equivalent of 46,473 Annual 
Work Units were employed in agriculture, suggesting that only around five percent of agricultural employment is 
formal.  

 

Montenegro agriculture is characterized by constraints similar to those that prevail in Southeast Europe. 
Among them: (i) inability of agricultural producers to adopt modern technologies due to limited access to 
finance; (ii) small average farm size and an incomplete land use planning; (iii) slow uptake in development of 
aggregators that could improve collecting, storage, packaging and marketing of produce; and (iv) the effects of 
climate change, especially increased weather-related natural disasters such as droughts and floods that have a 
major negative impact on productivity, water supply and land erosion. 

 

With an extensive coastline, the fisheries sector of Montenegro has an enormous potential that has not yet 
been capitalized on. The fisheries sector has not yet developed to its full potential. According to recent stock 
assessments, marine living resources are currently under-exploited by the domestic fleet, which could safely 
increase in size. Today Montenegro is a net importer of fish products. In 2014, for example, 3,316 tons of 
fisheries products were imported into Montenegro, of which 2,000 tons of fresh, frozen and fileted products, 
whereas a mere 11 tons of fisheries products were exported. With current marine catch estimated at around 
900 tons a year, Montenegro has the potential to substantially increase its production to meet domestic 
demand (leading to an ultimate phase-out of imports), a large share of which will be absorbed by the growing 
tourism sector. The capacity of the fisheries sector, however, is currently constrained by outdated equipment, 
lack of adequate infrastructure (landing sites and dedicated access in existing ports) and an underdeveloped 
value chain.   

 

The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) has a cross-cutting mandate that covers not only 
agriculture, rural development, and the food system, but also encompasses water, forestry and fisheries.

While the focus of the past 10 years has primarily been on agricultural production and to a lesser extent on food 
safety, the Ministry recognizes the need to strengthen the performance of other sub-sectors, i.e. food safety and 
fisheries, for which little policy orientation or support has been provided. The MARD has recently taken 
important steps to address this matter by adopting legislation that provides a new framework for food safety 
and establishes the Administration for Food Safety, Veterinary and Phytosanitary Affairs (AFSVPA). Further, it 
has functionally separated the Directorate for Agriculture and Fisheries into two Directorates to focus on 
supporting each sub-sector individually.  

 

Agriculture is an important sector in the EU accession agenda of Montenegro. Montenegro has made 
significant progress in establishing the required institutions and systems, and has developed capacity to 
implement the EU Instrument for Pre-Accession and Assistance for Rural Development (IPARD). However, 
further work is required as the country has committed to align its national agricultural policy to the Common 
Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the EU by the date of accession. To this end, the country is required to have all the 
necessary systems in place in order to manage and receive funding from the EU and to make payments to 
Montenegrin beneficiaries in accordance with EU rules and procedures. An Integrated Administration and 
Control System (IACS), along with other tools, are necessary for the efficient utilization and monitoring of 
support funds, and for the harmonization of the national direct payment measures with those currently 
implemented in the EU. EU membership brings important benefits to the country both at the macro and micro 
levels. It has been found to increase GDP per capita by approximately 12 percent. Trade liberalization has 
increased the flow of goods and services and has put competitiveness at the forefront of market integration. In 
agriculture, EU membership unlocks significant assistance and direct payments to farmers under the EU’s CAP, 
yet it also imposes stricter food safety and other trade-related requirements to agricultural production. 
 

Montenegro is making good progress towards alignment to EU food safety legislation.  A number of rulebooks, 
decrees and bylaws have been adopted. A new AFSVPA has been established under the oversight of the MARD, 
which also incorporates inspection services that previously operated autonomously. Several advances have been 
made in veterinary policy. The Animal Identification and Registration system, which already included large and 
small ruminants, was extended to pigs, and it has been completed. The multiannual program for the eradication 
of rabies has continued and routine monitoring and testing of ruminants for transmissible spongiform 
encephalopathies (TSEs) are being introduced. The implementing legislation on food safety rules was adopted in 
various fields but enforcement remains a challenge mainly due to shortage of human and material resources. As 
the country moves towards EU accession, the MARD would need to continue improving its administrative 
capacity, in particular for inspection services and laboratories, as well as upgrading food safety establishments. 

 

Montenegro’s preparations for the fisheries sector are at an early stage, but important progress has been 
made. The country’s Fisheries Strategy of 2015-2020 provides an overall guidance for the development of the 
Montenegrin sector and its administration in line with the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), including steps 
required to fully align and harmonize the national fisheries policy with the EU acquis communautaire. Steps 
must be taken to inform fishermen, traders and processors about the requirements they will face prior to and 
upon accession of Montenegro to the EU. The strategy identifies some of the sub-sector’s key areas for potential 
growth, including improved resource exploitation and connecting production from capture fisheries to the 
tourism sector and processing, thus ultimately increasing the added value of fish products. To reach this 
potential, adequate support will be required to increase fisheries production – including number of boats, 
improvement of fisheries coastal infrastructure, and enhancement of the control and surveillance system to 
address illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing. It is important to note that after EU accession,

production capacity will be capped because of overall EU policy for the preservation of marine living resources. 
As a new EU member, Montenegro’s vessel capacity will be frozen as to the date of entry, without possibility of 
future expansion of the fleet.  

 

Since the early stages of Montenegro’s EU accession process, the EC and the World Bank (WB) have closely 
coordinated their activities to support Montenegro’s authorities and the agricultural sector towards unlocking 
access to the IPARD. Funded by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the 
Global Environment Facility (GEF), the Montenegro Institutional Development and Agriculture Strengthening 
Project (MIDAS) was launched in July 2009

1
 and has made important contributions to compliance with the IPARD 

requirements. The country’s authorities have put considerable efforts into setting up the required legal and 
institutional framework to meet EU pre-accession requirements. To this end, the MIDAS project has contributed 
towards (i) the establishment and capacity building of the Directorate for Rural Development (future Managing 
Authority) and preparation of the IPARD 2014-2020 Program and of the Code of Good Agricultural Practices; (ii) 
the establishment of the Directorate for Payments (future Paying Agency), including setting up its infrastructure 
that meets accreditation’s requirements, and establishment of the Farm Registry and of the Reference Price 
Database; (iii) provision of grants to agriculture holdings to promote their development and modernization 
along with familiarization of both farmers and Montenegrin authorities with the IPARD rules and principles; and 
(iv) enhancing food safety through investments in the national reference laboratories (Veterinary Lab and 
Institute of Marine Biology), as well as building and equipping the first Border Inspection Post (BIP) in Bar and 
strengthening the sector’s legal and regulatory framework.  
 

Montenegro received the EU’s “Entrustment of budget implementation tasks for EU IPARD funds.” 
Specifically, the entrustment was received in October 2017 for Measure 1 (Investments in physical assets of 
agricultural holdings) and Measure 3 (Investments in physical assets concerning processing and marketing of 
agricultural and fishery products) of the IPARD II Program. To this end, Montenegro’s IPARD II Program for 2014-
2020 (approved by the EU and adopted by the Government of Montenegro in September 2015) is conceived as a 
multi-annual development program for rural areas and proposes seven measures to be co-financed by EU and 
implemented by the Government, for which the Sectoral Agreement between Montenegro and the EU has been 
signed and ratified.  

 

Montenegro has opened negotiations with the EU on Chapter 11 (Agriculture and Rural Development) in 
December 2016, while negotiations for Chapter 12 (Food Safety), and Chapter 13 (Fisheries) were opened in 
June 2016. The opening benchmarks for these chapters have all been met and negotiations positions adopted by 
the Montenegrin Government. MIDAS activities have actively contributed in supporting the country in reaching 
the EU pre-accession negotiation opening benchmarks for Chapters 11 and 12. In this context, the MARD has 
requested the Bank to continue its support to the Ministry with meeting the closing benchmarks of these two 
chapters and provide additional support towards meeting the closing benchmarks for Chapter 13. 
 
 
C. Proposed Development Objective(s)

Key Results 
 
 
D. Project Description  
 

The project will include the following components: 
 

Component 1: Strengthening MARD agriculture, rural development and fisheries program (EUR20 million). 

The component will: (i) increase and diversify income generation opportunities for productive units, and 

contribute to the creation of jobs, and (ii) support Montenegro for meeting Chapter 11 closing benchmarks. 

The grant program is expected to address most of the constraints faced by the country’s agricultural sector, 

including: (i) enabling access to finance to grant beneficiaries to adopt modern technologies; (ii) development 

of aggregators to improve collection, storage, packaging and marketing of produce; and (iii) implementation of 

agro-environmental measures to improve resilience to climatic pressures. 

 

Sub-component 1.1: Increasing and diversifying income opportunities through grants for agriculture, rural 

development and fisheries. This sub-component will support the development of agriculture, rural 

development and fisheries through the provision of grants. The design of the grant program will follow the 

implementation experience gained through the MIDAS project, where “the learning by doing” approach has 

been successfully tested with the core principle of IPARD. Investments are pre-financed by the beneficiaries, 

with reimbursement received upon successful completion and on-spot verification of the investment, and 

according to the share of support to total cost of investment (normally between 50 and 65 percent of the total 

investment); four-eye principle both for administrative control and on-spot control, coordination with 

Technical Bodies as appointed for verification of compliance with relevant national legislation. 

 

The grant program will be targeted at: (i) piloting further IPARD-like measures, including farm diversification 
and on-farm processing, that have not been previously implemented in order to develop the capacity of both 
institutions and beneficiaries while stimulating economic growth in rural areas; (ii) implementing direct 
support for rural development measures, including agro-environment measures, that will support MARD’s 
policy objectives towards harmonization with the CAP; (iii) support to production and processing 
associations/collections centers (including for milk, fruit and vegetables, etc.); and (iv) fisheries grants to 
enhance the capacity of the sector in preparation for the implementation of the European Maritime Fisheries 
Fund. The grant program is expected to leverage private sector investment and beneficiaries’ contribution, as 
well complement public sector investment in the modernization of the fisheries sector under Component 3. 
Detailed criteria, procedures, and related safeguards requirements of the grant program will be described in 
the Grant Operational Manual (GOM), satisfactory to the Bank, which will be prepared during project 
implementation prior to each call. 
 

Sub-component 1.2: Strengthening the MARD toward fulfilling EU accession requirements.  This sub-

component will provide investments to strengthen the DfP (future Paying Agency) management capacity 

through the development of the IACS components required for the management and control of payments to 

productive units, as well as the implementation of the European Agriculture Guarantee Fund, functionality of

which constitute one of the closing benchmark of Chapter 11. The project will support the development of 

several modules necessary for the operational system of integrated controls, strengthen the regional offices 

for Advisory Services, and build the Paying Agency system at the regional level, which will be part of the final 

structure of a fully functional Paying Agency.  For logistical and accessibility purposes, the two services could 

be hosted in the same building but in different offices, however, the roles and responsibilities of the Advisory 

Services and Paying Agency will be well defined and fully separated from each other. To this end the project 

will finance refurbishing and equipping of existing offices, and purchasing the required hardware and software 

infrastructure. The project will also strengthen capacity of the DfRD, DfA, and DfP through provision of 

technical assistance (TA), training and study tours to assist with the policy design towards the EU CAP, and to 

assist with the design required to finalize the IACS and its various applications.  

 

Component 2: Support for the Food Safety, Veterinary and Phytosanitary Services (EUR3 million). This 

component will develop capacity for food safety, veterinary and phytosanitary services as part of the creation 

of an integrated food quality system which is consistent with EU requirements. Promoting safer agricultural 

products, including the prevention and control of animal and plant diseases are essential for improving the 

competitiveness of Montenegro’s agricultural production both domestically and abroad. It will also help 

producers to introduce cross-compliance requirements to receive IPARD funds. This component will support: 

(i) the establishment of an official, comprehensive control system for the safe disposal and/or processing of 

animal by-products (ABPs); (ii) strengthening of the diagnostic capacity of the phytosanitary laboratory; and 

(iii) strengthening of the capacity of the inspection services. The following set of activities will be financed 

under this component: 

 

Sub-component 2.1: Safe management of animal by-products (APBs). The project will support the 

establishment of a comprehensive system for the processing and/or disposal for ABPs which will be identified 

and documented in the National Strategy and Action Plan for the Management of ABPs scheduled to be 

adopted by the MARD in late-2017 or early-2018. Specifically, the project will provide TA for the design of a 

control system for the safe management of ABPs. The design will include a business plan for a disposal facility, 

detailed technical specifications and cost estimates for a housing facility. The project will also support the 

gradual operationalization of the official control system for ABPs along the entire chain (production, 

separation, storage, transport, and disposal and/or processing), including training of inspectors and business 

operators, establishing documented procedures and check lists for the approval of establishments and 

inspection thereof, aligning and completing the legal and regulatory framework in line with the current and 

relevant EU acquis and launching a public information and awareness campaign addressed to the associated 

food production/processing industry.  

 

Sub-component 2.2: Strengthening the diagnostic capacity of the phytosanitary laboratory. The project will 

assist the NRL housed at the Bio-Technical Faculty of the University of Montenegro with construction of new 

laboratory facilities (vertically extending an existing site), procurement of laboratory equipment and fixed 

laboratory furniture to support official controls. The project will also provide targeted TA aiming to ensure 

efficient inter-agency collaboration between the AFSVPA and the NRL by means of a Memorandum of 

Understanding, and pave the way towards accreditation of priority tests and methods as per ISO standard 

17025.

Sub-component 2.3: Support to inspection services. To enable the inspectors of the unified AFSVPA to 

implement effectively the enhanced official control regime arising from alignment of national legislation with 

EU legislation, and the risk-based annual official control and sampling plan, the project will provide new 

vehicles and equipment for collection, cold storage and transport of samples, IT equipment, protective 

clothing, official uniforms, and other items.  

 

Component 3: Modernization of the Fisheries Sector (EUR6 million).  This component will finance public 

sector investment aimed at achieving two objectives: (i) enhancing the productive capacity of the sector with 

investments in basic infrastructure and equipment that will provide fishermen regulated safe, and sanitary 

landing facilities and access to port, and (ii) strengthening the institutional capacity in the sector to apply the 

CFP upon EU accession, as well as substantially strengthen administrative, inspection, and control capacity. 

This component will finance the following interventions: 

 

Sub-component 3.1: Development of a network of landing sites (both in ports and other locations) with 

enhanced access to auxiliary services. Sub-component. A national coastal urban planning strategy is currently 

being elaborated at various levels of government (both national and local), though it is not expected to be fully 

finalized before 2019. This planning process incorporates the designation of several locations for landing sites, 

including in the country’s six coastal cities, where accommodations can be designed for fishing activities in 

existing ports and in new landing sites to be developed. The port towns of Bar (in the far South of the 

country’s coastline), Herceg Novi (the far North of the country’s coastline) and a network of other sites along 

the coastline will be subject to infrastructure improvements and specific sites for construction and 

reconstruction activities will be identified by the Government. The project will finance TA for the preparation 

of designs and technical specifications required for equipment and infrastructure. The project will also finance 

civil works, including construction of facilities for landing, catch data collection, weighing and access to market 

for landed catches in sites that comply with World Bank norms. In addition, and where appropriate, 

improvements will be made in certain locations for access to water and fuel, and operational support (boat 

and gear maintenance).   

   

Sub-Component 3.2: Capacity Building for the Directorate for Fisheries, and support to Associations of 

Fishermen. The MARD Directorate for Fisheries already benefits from the various regional programs 

supporting the sustainable management of marine living resources. Scientific support is provided mainly by 

the Institute of Marine Biology in Kotor, while the Directorate itself is receiving support in the development of 

rules and regulations pertaining to the sector converging towards the full application of the CFP. The project 

will support training and equipment for fisheries inspectors to enable them to meet EU requirements.  

Significant TA support will be provided to Associations of Fishermen, which will be the direct beneficiaries of 

resources from the European Maritime Fisheries Fund (EMFF) designed mainly to cover the added expenses 

incurred by fishermen in application of CFP rules and regulations.  

 

Component 4: Project Management (EUR1 million). This component will cover the costs for project management 
related to staffing, consultancies, and equipment costs, as well as implementation of the Environmental and Social 
Management Framework (ESMF), monitoring and evaluation of all project activities in line with the Results Framework,

adequate fiduciary (procurement and financial management), audits and accountability mechanisms for oversight, 
including a grievance redress mechanism.   
 
E. Implementation 
 
Institutional and Implementation Arrangements 
 

The MARD will be the lead Implementing Agency and will have overall responsibility for project management 
and implementation. Following the project implementation structure established under the ongoing MIDAS 
Project, relevant Directorates and Administrations within the MARD will be responsible for the technical 
implementation (i.e. preparing terms of reference and technical specifications, preparing training programs, 
supervising consultants and advisors, participating in procurement evaluation committees, etc.) of project 
activities. Specifically, given the extensive experience on implementation of Bank-funded projects, the General 
Director of the Directorate for Payments (DfP) will be appointed as a Project Coordinator. The Director for 
Rural Development (DfRD) will be responsible for the implementation of Component 1; the Director for the 
AFSVPA will be responsible for the implementation of Component 2; and the General Director of the 
Directorate for Fisheries will oversee Component 3 of the project.  

 

An existing, experienced and well-performing Project Management Team (PMT) established to implement the 
MIDAS Project, will also manage MIDAS2. The PMT is currently housed in the DfP premises, and consists of the 
Project Coordinator (General Director of DfP, civil servant), Project Manager, Civil Engineer, IT specialist and 
Safeguards Specialist. Up to the closing date of the MIDAS Project, i.e. March 30, 2019, the proposed Project 
will continue to be supported by the current PMT staff. Thereafter, sufficient resources will be allocated to 
retain a Project Manager and other staff as required. The project implementation team will also continue to 
rely on a part-time environmental and social specialist, who will take active participation in the screening of 
the grants and direct payments as per the ESMF. The specialist’s tasks will include desk reviews, training and 
guidance of the applicants, and site visits to review compliance with both the World Bank safeguards policies 
and relevant Montenegrin laws. In addition, a Monitoring and Evaluation Specialist and other specialists in the 
field of fisheries and civil engineering will be recruited to support MIDAS2. Details of the above-mentioned 
arrangements will be provided in the Project Operational Manual (POM). 
 

A Project Steering Committee (PSC) will be established and maintained throughout the life of the Project to 
ensure overall coordination and strategic guidance functions. The PSC will be chaired by the Minister of 
Agriculture and Rural Development and will include the Project Coordinator (DfP General Director); General 
Directors of Directorate for Rural Development (DfRD), Directorate for Agriculture (DfA), and Directorate for 
Fisheries (DfF); Director of  the Administration for Food Safety, Veterinary and Phytosanitary Affairs, Advisory 
Services, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Transport and Maritime Affairs, Morsko Dobro, Biotechnical 
Faculty/Phytosanitary Laboratory Director; and representatives of beneficiaries (civil society, local institutions, 
private sector).  

 

Fiduciary responsibilities, including procurement and financial management and disbursement, will be carried 
out by the existing central Technical Services Unit (TSU) under the Ministry of Finance. The TSU will be 
responsible for the preparation of quarterly unaudited financial reports and annual audited financial 
statements. Expenses incurred by the TSU will be financed out of the loan on a pro rata basis with other World 
Bank-financed projects in Montenegro.

F. Project location and Salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 
 

The project will be implemented throughout Montenegro, including the activities targeting the fisheries 
under Component 3 in the coastal part of Montenegro. The activities on grants and direct payments will 
follow the well established screening procedure from the original MIDAS project, and will help screen out 
activities that may have additional safeguards implications.

SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY 

 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

The project activities on direct payments and grants 
under Component 1 will finance a diverse series of 
activities aimed at improving the agricultural 
practices in country. However, some of these 
activities, as evident from the support provided 
under the original MIDAS project, could have 
environmental impacts and implications. This 
includes, but is not limited to, small scale 
construction of barns, farm facilities, manure 
management platforms, traditional katuni huts, etc. 
The environmental screening procedure has been 
implemented for the original project and will 
continue to be applicable to these activities; the 
procedure has been slightly revised to reflect the 
envisaged project activities including support to the 
fisheries sector, in the form of an ESMF.  
 Furthermore, the ESMF addresses the construction

and reconstruction activities under Component 3, 
aimed at improving the pier facilities for the 
fisheries.  There are no major environmental impacts 
anticipated at this stage except for the dust and 
noise, material sourcing, and waste management 
with regards to Components 1 and 3. For 
Component 2, the technical assistance provided will 
help establish a sound management system of the 
animal byproducts as a follow on to the strategic 
planning documents to be developed by the client 
towards the end of 2017. These activities will be 
supplemented by adequate due diligence 
documentation prepared based on the final 
management solution of ABPs.  
 

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 No 
The activities will be carried out on already 
established farms on agricultural land and there will 
be no activities involving natural habitats. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No 
There are no activities involving forests foreseen 
under the project. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

The project will support increase and improvement 
in agricultural practices, and may indirectly lead to 
an increase in the pest management practices. The 
project will not support directly purchasing or 
supplying of pest management materials, but the 
project’s ESMF includes a precautionary section on 
PMP. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 No 
There are no activities involving cultural resources 
foreseen under the project. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 No 
There are no activities involving indigenous peoples 
foreseen under the project. 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 No 

The original project triggered the Bank’s Policy OP 
4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement as it was expected 
that the project would finance the construction of 
the Paying Agency building and that land may be 
required to be expropriated for that purpose. The 
Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) document was 
developed, approved and disclosed in November 
2008. However, the implementing Ministry of 
Agriculture and Rural Development decided not to 
construct a new building but rather opted to use the 
existing state-owned building. To date, no land 
acquisition took place under the MIDAS and 
associated IPARD-like grants. As stated in the Grant 
Operational Manual (GOM), only activities that do 



 

The World Bank  
Montenegro Second Institutional Development and Agriculture Strengthening Project (P164424) 

 

 

  
Nov 15, 2017 Page 13 of 18  

 

not trigger the application of Bank’s OP 4.12 policy 
on Involuntary Resettlement are eligible for grant 
funding. The Grant scheme support program under 
the proposed project will follow the same eligibility 
criteria which clearly state that the activities which  
may result in displacement of any third party 
formally or informally occupying or using the land on 
which the activity is to be implemented will be 
excluded from financing. Only activities that are 
located on the farmer’s own land or on land for 
which the grant applicant has written consent from 
the owner to use the land will be eligible for funding. 
Additionally, no land acquisition will take place 
under the sub-component on development of the 
landing places (piers) and their auxiliary services in 
the ports of Bar and Herceg Novi as the civil works 
will be carried out in public maritime domain. In 
brief, project will not support any activities which 
might involve involuntary taking of land or physical 
or economic displacement of squatters, scavengers, 
or any other third party formally or informally 
occupying or using the land. 
 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 No 
There are no activities involving dams foreseen 
under the project. 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

No 

The activities under Component 3 aimed at 
supporting and improving the docking facilities for 
fisheries may pose a risk to international waterways, 
i.e. the Adriatic Sea. However, due to the scope of 
works there is very little potential to impact the 
quantity and quality of water to riparians.In 
consultations with LEGEN it was determined that the 
activities are not of such scope or scale that would 
require triggering of this policy. 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No 
 

 
 

KEY SAFEGUARD POLICY ISSUES AND THEIR MANAGEMENT 

 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential 
large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
The potential environmental and social impacts that are foreseen for the activities financed under the project are not 
large scale, significant or irreversible. The activities financed under the project can be broadly grouped into three 



 

The World Bank

Nov 15, 2017 Page 14 of 18  

 

groups, per project components: the grants and direct payments scheme, the support to the fisheries sector through 
small scale infrastructure interventions and the technical assistance towards establishment of a management system 
of animal byproducts (ABPs). The grant scheme activities will be screened using an ESMF and a mechanism established 
under the original MIDAS 1 project. The procedure will screen out activities that correspond to a Category A or that 
trigger additional safeguards policies. For activities that correspond to a World Bank Category B adequate due 
diligence will be prepared. The ESMF also sets up the monitoring and follow up activities that the PMT will undertake. 
The activities supporting the fisheries component will be subject to a Checklist EMP for simple infrastructure works, 
since all of the works anticipated are of a limited scope and to be carried out within the existing marine areas 
designated for reception of the fisheries fleet. Support provided under the animal byproducts Technical Assistance, 
will be supplemented with the adequate environmental and social due dilligence documentation, that would be 
adapted to the final selection of the methods and treatment chosen for safe management of ABPs. 
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area: 
There are no indirect or long term impacts anticipated in the project area due to the project financed activities. All of 
the activities are limited in scope and localized to a given location. 
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts. 
No alternatives have been considered. The ESMF will screen out activities based on the associated impact and 
activities corresponding to a Category A or triggering additional safeguards policies will not be financed. 
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower 
capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The Client has a well established PMT with a part time environmental and social specialist in place. The key staff have 
attended multiple World Bank environmental safeguards trainings and have a good track record along with the 
experience of implementing multiple rounds of grant calls and screening of all received applications. The PMT has 
strong ownership over the screening process and have used each subsequent call to additionally fine-tune the 
screening procedures, and to also conduct environmental awareness raising trainings for all applicants. The Client has 
prepared a revised ESMF coupled with the Checklist EMP for the fisheries component and a precautionary Integrated 
Pest Management Plan and has disclosed this document with the public consultations held on November 10, 2017 in 
Podgorica. 
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, 
with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
The key stakeholders are the project beneficiaries, that is the farmers and agricultural and fisheries workers, along 
with the neighbors and adjacent plots that could be impacted by the supported activities. Additionally, the 
stakeholders that may be involved include the different institutions supporting the development and operations of the 
agricultural sector in country, including government institutions, academia and  non-governmental institutions. The 
client has publically disclosed the ESMF with an announcement made on their website and through the local media for 
the public consultations that were held on November 10, 2017in Podgorica. In addition to the public consultations of 
the ESMF, each of the ESMPs that will be produced under the ESMF procedure will also be subject to public disclosure 
and consultations, as well as the Checklist EMPs for the fisheries infrastructure. Overall, the project has an established 
grieveance redress mechanism where each of the affected parties can communicate directly with the designated 
contact person through established email and telephone contacts.

 Country Context 

 

Haiti’s geography, people, and history provide it with many opportunities.  The third largest Caribbean 

nation by area and population (10.4 million), Haiti shares the island of Hispaniola with the Dominican 

Republic. In addition to an illustrious early history, as the first independent nation in the region and the 

first nation in the world to be led to independence by former slaves, Haiti benefits from proximity and 

access to major markets, a young labor force, a dynamic diaspora, and substantial geographic, 

historical, and cultural assets. The country possesses untapped markets and a pent-up demand for the 

private sector to explore, including agribusiness, light manufacturing, and tourism. 

 

However, almost 60 percent of Haiti’s population, or 6.3 million people, remain poor, and 24 percent 

or 2.5 million, extremely poor, with poverty highest in rural areas.  The poorest regions, which are also 

the furthest from the capital, show extreme poverty rates exceeding 40 percent and very limited access 

to basic services. Like poverty, inequality is high with a Gini of 0.6 (highest in the Americas). 

 

Natural disasters have hindered the country’s ability to overcome these poverty levels. On January 12, 

2010 a magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck Haiti, causing the death of 230,000, displacing 1.5 million 

people, and resulting in damages and losses equivalent to 120 percent of its GDP.  In the months 

following the earthquake, cholera spread throughout the country infecting 800,000 people and cusing 

9,500 deaths. Nevertheless, in the aftermath of the earthquake, Government, Partners and private 

actors together invested approximately US$3 billion in Official Development Assistance and much 

more from private flows. Over 1.2 million people returned to more permanent housing. Collapsed 

infrastructure and many affected neighborhoods have been rebuilt, education services have been re-

established and extended, and deaths from cholera driven down to below 1 percent of cases (though 

resurgences of the disease remain).  The 2015 Poverty Assessment undertaken jointly by the 

Government and the World Bank shows that the percentage of extremely poor Haitians (those who 

cannot fulfill their nutritional needs) fell from 31 percent to 24 percent between 2000 and 2012, mostly 

in urban areas and especially in the capital. 

 

On October 4, 2016, category 4 Hurricane Matthew struck Haiti, affecting over 2 million people, about 

20 percent of the country’s population. The Government of Haiti (GoH)’s Directorate of Civil 

Protection (DPC) reported  546 deaths, 128 missing, 439 injured, 175,500 people living in temporary 

shelters, and immediate humanitarian assistance needs for 1.4 million people (about 12.9 percent of 

the population).  The GoH has requested CRW support in light of the large scale of damages, losses 

and reconstruction needs, and the deep poverty of the affected region. The hurricane also caused the 

first round of Haiti’s long postponed Presidential elections to be rescheduled to November 20, 2016. 

Haitians elected Mr. Jovenel Moise, the candidate from former President Martelly’s party, in one 

round, with over 55 percent of the vote. The Electoral Council confirmed these results on January 3, 

2017. President Moise was sworn in on February 7, 2017. 

 

Situation of Urgent Need of Assistance or Capacity Constraint 
Hurricane Matthew made landfall on October 4 at 7a.m. on the south-west coast of Haiti.  The 

hurricane caused maximum wind speeds of 230/km/h and rainfall of over 600mm in less than 24 

hours, and a rise in sea levels of two to three meters in the departments of Grande-Anse, Nippes and 

Sud. This is the first hurricane of this magnitude to make landfall in Haiti in 52 years.  The hurricane’s 

high wind speeds, heavy rainfall, and devastating storm surge resulted in flooding, landslides and 

extensive destruction of critical infrastructure and livelihoods, including large sections of road 

networks and bridges, with some key roads and bridges washed away.  The southern departments of 

Grande-Anse, Nippes, and Sud were especially affected, where 80 percent, 66 percent, and 65 percent 

of people respectively are poor (under the national poverty line of US$2.41 per day) and 36 percent, 

30 percent and 26 percent are extremely poor (under the national extreme poverty line of US$1.23 per 



day).  Lesser damage was seen in coastal areas in other parts of the country. 

 

On October 4, 2016, Haiti’s interim President called for an immediate emergency response in the face 

of the national crisis and humanitarian emergency. The Government appealed to the international 

community to fund US$120 million in humanitarian assistance to provide relief to 750,000 severely 

affected people. The United Nations launched a flash appeal for that amount on October 10, 2016.  On 

October 13, 2016, the Minister of Finance requested support from the World Bank and the Inter-

American Development Bank (IDB) in undertaking a Rapid Damage and Loss Assessment (DaLA).  A 

team immediately set to work. The Rapid Assessment results became available on October 26, 2016, 

showing a massive impact on the Southern regions.  The Bank also participated in the subsequently 

launched Post-Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA). 

 

Total damages and losses were initially estimated by the DaLA Rapid Assessment at US$1.9 billion, 

the equivalent of 22 percent of GDP, and later to the equivalent of US$32% by the PDNA, with 

impacts largely concentrated in areas with poverty rates higher than the national average (Grande-

Anse, Nippes, and Sud departments).  The agriculture and housing/urban sectors were the hardest hit. 

Up to 90 percent of crops and livestock were lost in coastal areas, including stable food crops, but also 

cash and tree crops such as coffee, cocoa and vetiver.  Thousands of structures were damaged and 75 

percent of structures in the heaviest hit communities in Grande-Anse were entirely destroyed. More 

than 100,000 houses were heavily damaged or destroyed, half of which were Grande-Anse. 

 

Given the magnitude of the disaster, the GoH requires significant support to respond”, and to enhance 

the country’s overall resilience to disasters.  In the wake of Hurricane Matthew, emergency funding 

was sought from the IDA17 Crisis Response Window (CRW) in the amount of US$100 million toward 

recovery and reconstruction. of which US$35 million for the Agriculture Sector.  will support the 

country’s recovery needs under the Project.  Given the urgency to respond to the disaster, the Project 

would be processed invoking the Condensed Procedures set out in para 12 of OP 10.00 (Projects in 

Situations of Urgent Need of Assistance or Capacity Constraints). The Safeguards Action Plan 
setting forth the sequence for the preparation of the relevant safeguards instruments is annexed to the 

project paper.  

 Sectoral and Institutional Context 

 

Haiti remains extremely vulnerable to natural disaster with 96 percent of the population at risk. On 

October 4, 2016, Hurricane Matthew, a category IV hurricane, landed in Haiti and caused a large scale 

disaster affecting over 2.1 million people (almost 1/5 of the population) and leaving almost 1.4 million 

people in need of lifesaving assistance in the southern part of the country. Winds speeds up to 140 

mph and torrential rain for 48 hours (around 1,016 mm) triggered widespread flooding and numerous 

landslides and caused severe damage to all sectors - water, electricity, education, health, food security, 

and livelihoods - particularly in the Departments of Sud, Grande-Anse, and Nippes. It is estimated that 

Hurricane Matthew caused losses and damages equivalent to 22 percent of the Gross Domestic 

Product, killed 500 people and triggered humanitarian assistance for 1.4 million people (12.9 percent 

of the population). The impact of Hurricane Matthew on the agricultural sector is estimated at 

US$603.0 million, including US$213.0 million in losses and US$390.0 million in damages, making 

Hurricane Matthew one of the most devastating events of the past decades. 

 

Agriculture plays a significant role in the Haitian economy, contributing to more than 25 % of the 

country’s GDP. The sector employs about 57% percent of the active population, while providing 66% 

of employment in rural areas and 75% of employment to low-income rural households, thus 

representing the main source of income in rural areas. National agricultural production provides about 

50% of food availability, which is complemented by commercial imports (45%) and food aid. The 



departments struck by Hurricane Matthew had under cultivation 85% of the national production of 

maize and 37% of the national fruit production. These areas also accounted for about one third of the 

country’s stock of cattle, pigs and goats and poultry. 

 

In urgent need of assistance because of a natural disaster, the approval of this Additional Finance 

would allow to quickly mobilize the resources needed to provide much needed support to farmers in 

the areas affected by Hurricane Mathew. The task team has discussed alternatives to the proposed AF 

with the GOH and it was agreed that the proposed RESEPAG II AF is the most appropriate 

mechanism for a rapid mitigation response.  Indeed, the activities will primarily target areas already 

covered under the original project, the same profile of producers and tools to engage these producers, 

and use identical delivery mechanisms.  It will also be possible to use the current institutional 

arrangements and staff already in place. 
. 

C. Proposed Development Objective(s) 

 Original Project Development Objective(s) - Parent 

 

The PDOs are to strengthen the Ministry of Agriculture, Natural Resources and Rural Development's 

(MARNDR) capacity to define and implement the National Agriculture Extension Strategy, to 

increase access of small farmers to agriculture extension services and training on animal and plant 

health in priority regions, and to provide financial assistance in the case of an agriculture sector 

emergency. 

 Current Project Development Objective(s) - Parent 

 

The development objectives of the Project are to: (a) reinforce the capacity of the Ministry of 

Agriculture, Natural Resources and Rural Development to provide or facilitate access to services in the 

agricultural sector; (b) increase market access to small producers and food security in Selected Areas; 

and (c) provide financial assistance in the case of an Agriculture Sector Emergency. 

 Proposed Project Development Objective(s) - Additional Financing 

 

The new proposed PDO is: to (a) reinforce the capacity of the Ministry of Agriculture, Natural 

Resources and Rural Development to provide or facilitate access to services in the agricultural sector; 

(b) increase market access to small producers and food security in Selected Areas; (c) improve 

livelihood in areas affected by Hurricane Matthew and (d) enable the Government to respond promptly 

and effectively to an eligible emergency. 

 Key Results  

 
The proposed AF would allow to support 41,000 households affected by the hurricane. It would bring 

the total number of beneficiaries of the project (parent and AF) to 60,000, of which 40% of female.  
. 

  

 

D. Project Description 
 
Following the devastation caused by Hurricane Matthew, the project expects to receive US$35M 

Additional financing (AF) from the IDA Crisis Response Window to help restore productive assets 

lost, rehabilitate damaged or destroyed infrastructures, and support livelihoods to victims of Hurricane 

Matthew. The AF would (i) provide emergency assistance to allow more than 8,000 farmers to carry 

out winter 2016 and spring 2017 planting campaigns to secure food production; and to increase the 

number of beneficiaries of the pre-existing voucher schemes by 7000 (increasing from 8,000 to 15,000 

farmers) while fostering more resilient production systems; and (ii) introduce new activities to 

restore/rehabilitate irrigation systems through cash-for-work programs and larger infrastructure civil 



works allowing at least 3,500 hectares of agriculture land to recover access to irrigation and providing 

temporary jobs to at least 21,000 persons; and help restock part of the small animals lost by around 

6,000 poor households. 

 

In the Proposed AF, the emergency assistance and extension of the voucher scheme program activities 

would remain in the department of Sud, although more municipalities would be targeted. Irrigation 

works would be also conducted in the department of Sud, and would be closely related to the voucher 

schemes areas to ensure the adequate access to irrigation services of farmers benefiting from voucher 

schemes. Lastly, activities related to livestock restocking would concern the western areas of the 

department of Sud and Grande-Anse. 

 

Changes to the original project as part of the level 1 restructuring include: (i) Revision of the Project 

Development Objective (PDO) wording to reflect activities in the affected areas and an increase in 

scope of the Emergency Response Contingency (ERC); (ii) Activation of the Involuntary Resettlement 

Policy (OP/BP 4.12) to anticipate the possibility of an involuntary resettlement in the affected areas; 

(iii) Upgrading of the Results Framework to reflect adjusted outcomes and targets, and emerging good 

practices in climate resilience; (iv) Extension of the original grant closing date of to align it with the 

closing date of the Additional Financing; and (v) a reallocation between disbursement categories. 

 

The AF will trigger Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12). While the implementation of RESEPAG 

II has thus far not involved any resettlement of families or economic restrictions, rehabilitation of 

irrigation and water management infrastructure may result in involuntary resettlement. A Resettlement 

Policy Framework (RPF) will be prepared in accordance with OP4.12 to ensure application of the 

appropriate safeguard policies. The completion of social safeguards instruments was deferred to the 

implementation stage in line with the flexibility afforded by OP 10.00 paragraph 12.  Consultation in 

the affected areas will include outreach to main stakeholders and the affected communities to the 

extent possible.  Once sites where project activities will be implemented are identified, Resettlement 

Action Plans (RAP) or Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plans (Abbrev. RAP) will be prepared 

consulted and disclosed for sites with resettlement impacts in accordance with the policy. Any 

compensation or livelihood restoration efforts that may be needed will be completed prior to 

commencement of the works. 

 

Closing Date 

 

The proposed AF would extend the current closing date of the original Grants from 30-June-2018 to 

31-Dec-2019. The Financing Agreement of the parent project would be amended accordingly.  This 

extension would allow for the completion of the activities under the Parent project so as to allow for 

emergency recovery and reconstruction activities as described under the components listed below and 

in more detail under the Project Paper. 

 

Component Name 

 

The project will maintain its structure around four components: Component 1: Agricultural support 

services; Component 2: Direct support to producers and associations; Component 3: Emergency 

Response Contingency Reserve; and Component 4: Institutional strengthening, monitoring and 

evaluation, project management and studies. 

 

The proposed AF will finance the scale up and the implementation of new field activities under 

Component 2 only, which will increase in cost by US$28.7M; Component 3 will receive an additional 

allocation of US$ 2.4M to compensate for expenses already incurred immediately after the Hurricane, 



and Component 4 will receive and additional allocation of US$ 3.9M to account for additional 

operational and monitoring costs.

25.5, GAFSP TF-11396 US$ 0, US$ 28.7 IDA/AF). 

Comments ( optional) 

The activities planned under the Parent project (voucher schemes and matching grants) will not be 

modified. The Additional financing will (i) scale up the provision of vouchers under this 

component;  it will broaden the current geographical scope for this activity (Centre and Sud) with 

the inclusion of new municipalities within the Department of Sud and it will use the same delivery 

mechanisms as the Parent project reaching an additional 7,000 beneficiaries; (ii) add two new sub-

components: (a) Animal Husbandry and (b) Irrigation Rehabilitation and Micro-catchment 

protection. 
 

 

PHCOMP  

Component Name: 

Component 3: Emergency Response Contingency Reserve (Total: US$ 3.9, IDA-H7410 US$ 1.5, 

GAFSP TF-11396 US$ 0, US$ 2.4 IDA/AF). 

Comments ( optional) 

This component will change in title to “Emergency Response Contingency (ERC)”. Through this 

component uncommitted project funds, rather than an established upfront reserve amount, will be 

channeled to facilitate a timely response in case of an eligible emergency. 
 

 

PHCOMP  

Component Name: 

Component 4: Institutional Strengthening, Monitoring and Evaluation, Project Management and 

Studies Services (Total: US$ 11, IDA-H7410 US$ 7.1, GAFSP TF-11396 US$ 0, US$ 3.9 

IDA/AF). 

Comments ( optional) 

This component will not change in its design. However, to take into account the increased technical 

and geographical scope, and the increased in financial resources, additional allocation are being 

considered for equipment, vehicles, staff and consultancies. 
 

 
E. Project location and Salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if 

known) 

 

Parent Project 

Component 1, 3 and 4 activities are conducted nationwide. Component 2 activities are implemented in 

specific areas located in the Sud and Centre department for the voucher schemes; and Sud, Nord and 

Nord-Est departments for the matching grant schemes. 

 

Additional Financing (AF) 

The Haitian government carried out a Post-Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) identifying the areas 

most affected by Hurricane Matthew, and prioritized the most pressing interventions to ensure food 

production in the season following the disaster. The emergency assistance program and extension of 

the voucher scheme program activities would remain in the Sud department, although more 

municipalities would be targeted. Irrigation rehabilitation works would be also conducted in the 

department of Sud, and would be closely related to the voucher scheme areas to ensure optimization of 

benefits. Lastly, activities related to livestock restocking would concern the western areas of the 



department of Sud and Grande-Anse. 

 

Salient physical characteristics relevant to environmental and social safeguards under the RESEPAG 

II AF relate to high variability of landscapes, biodiversity and climatic zones, extreme weather, 

advanced deforestation, earthquake activity and climate change. Alternating topography of mountains 

and valleys create variability in rainfall varying from 550 mm on leeward slopes to 2,700 mm on 

northern and windward slopes. The heterogeneity of the territory is a determining factor for crop types, 

cropping season, land use and forest cover. 

 

Haiti is subject to extreme weather events such as droughts, hurricanes and tropical storms.  

Deforestation and steep slopes have intensified these risks. Loss of forest to charcoal and timber 

production and to agriculture since colonial days has reduced forest cover from 75% to 1.5%. 

Deforestation has contributed to high runoff, erosion, landslides, flooding, dust, loss of agricultural 

productivity, reduced rainfall, siltation of waterways and degradation of coral reefs and mangroves. An 

estimated 36 million tons of topsoil are lost in Haiti annually. 

 

Haiti is seismically active as it sits astride two shallow fault lines; it is vulnerable to earthquakes, 

especially in built-up areas. 

 

Although degraded, Haiti’s natural environment still contains areas with notable concentrations of 

globally or regionally threatened species, including numerous endemic ones. These Key Biodiversity 

Areas (KBAs) occur throughout Haiti. 

 

With predicted climate change, temperatures are projected to increase and rainfall is projected to 

decrease, which is likely to intensify droughts in the center of the country. Sea level is projected to rise 

between 0.13 and 0.56 m by 2090, which would threaten coastal zones. Future increases in number 

and intensity of tropical storms and hurricanes are likely, with associated increases in highly erosive 

rainfall, floods and storm surge levels. 

 

The project expands access to agricultural extension services and promotes environmentally friendly 

investments and practices in agriculture. The project aims to have a positive impact on agriculture, 

resource use and surrounding landscapes. It does not support any activities that have large-scale, 

significant or irreversible adverse impacts on the environment. The project provides agricultural 

extension services to existing agricultural lands, and will discourage the clearance of new lands..

II. IMPLEMENTATION 

The proposed AF will be implemented under the same institutional arrangements of the parent 

project. The closing date of the proposed additional grant would be December 31, 2019 to 

ensure that all additional planned activities would be satisfactorily completed in accordance 

with the revised and updated implementation plan. The date of the original grant would also be 

extended to December 31, 2019.

III. SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY 

 Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 

4.01 
Yes This policy will continue to be triggered under 

the AF as original activities under the parent 

project will not change; and animal husbandry 

and rehabilitation of irrigation canals activities 

will be added. 

 

Environmental impacts under the Parent 

Project have been low, and safeguards 

performance has been satisfactory. The project 

was designed to avoid the financing of 

activities with significant environmental 

impact and promote environmental good 

practice such as reforestation and soil 

conservation.  In the control of agricultural 

pests, the project has focused on integrated 

pest management. 

 

In summary, impacts observed include 

inadequate sanitation in sub-projects (poor 

design of latrines and septic tanks) in several 

sub-projects, as well as limited clearing of 

existing land of trees and shrubs for market 

gardening, as expected in an agricultural 

project. Poor sanitary practices in food 

production (e.g., dairy production) also posed 

potential risks, although no incidences of 

contamination has been recorded. 

 

Several positive activities were financed under 

the project, including use of biological control 

methods against the mealybug, a parasite of 

pea, bean and groundnut; planting of trees as 

part of productive landscapes (for cover as 

well as for fruit production); and planting of 

mangroves to compensate losses resulting 

from expansion of salt ponds. 

 

E&S impacts were adequately managed using 

the Environmental and Social Management 

Framework (ESMF) and Integrated Pest 

Management Plan (IPMP) prepared for 

RESEPAG II. No new, significant impacts are 

expected under the AF. 

 

The MARNDR will make minor updates and 

modifications to the ESMF and IPMP, to 

identify and manage the potential adverse 



impacts under the AF, which include:  

(i) animal husbandry, mostly small scale, 

resilience-oriented, mixed agriculture-

livestock systems, with very limited inputs, to 

around 6,000 households: includes training, 

production of forage, preparation of 

enclosures (for goat keeping), provision of 

beehives and protective equipment (for bee-

keeping). Impacts would be limited and 

include production of waste (animal waste), 

cutting of vegetation (for feed), overgrazing, 

and damage to riparian habitat. Mitigation will 

include effective waste management, control 

of water discharges, prevention of animals’ 

access to surface water bodies and prevention 

of free-grazing by raising animals in closed 

systems and provision of feed via forage tree 

planting and harvesting; and 

(ii) Irrigation Rehabilitation and Micro-

catchment protection: cash for work for small-

scale rehabilitation works (off-farm 

infrastructures); and civil works on river 

intakes, rivers embankments, sections of 

canals and drains, protection of infrastructure 

(mainly bridges and access roads). Impacts are 

likely to include health and safety of workers, 

construction waste (cement, metal and timber 

scraps, etc.), noise, dust, water quality 

(turbidity). Mitigation will include generic 

workplace design good practice, providing 

adequate protection equipment to workers, 

adequate waste management systems, etc.  

 

The project was rated category B because 

potential adverse impacts on the environment 

were moderate and easily identified, mitigated 

and managed. The project will remain 

Category B. 

 

Social risks and impacts: On the social side, 

no major safeguards risks are expected. 

Potential risks may include delays in 

compensation related to land acquisition or 

lack of appropriate consultations on relevant 

project information. The project will avoid or 
minimize land acquisition based on lessons 

learned. The RPF will include measures to 

deal with such potential delays in payments 

should land acquisition be necessary.  The 

communication activities will particularly 



target matching grants and voucher schemes 

activities, which may be open to speculation 

of corruption and unfairness unless the project 

team clearly explains the rules and procedures 

for distributing project benefits.  Risks linked 

to labor influx are expected to be limited. 

They will be mitigated by prioritizing local 

labor and ensuring clarity on where laborers 

coming from outside will be hosted through 

their stay in the host community and ensuring 

that contracts are consistent with ESMF and 

RPF provisions. The revised ESMF will 

include an annex with a social assessment 

targeted to new locations and sub-projects to 

be covered under the AF. 

 

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 Yes This policy will continue to be triggered under 
the AF as original activities under the parent 

project will not change; and animal husbandry 

and rehabilitation of irrigation canals activities 

will be added. 

 Because the project focuses on capacity 

building and provides agricultural extension 

services to existing agricultural lands, it does 

not support the clearance of new lands and 

such activities are not eligible for direct 

support. No agriculture activities that require 

the clearing of forested land or that damage 

freshwater habitat are supported. 

Nevertheless, because of the potential for 

indirect impacts on natural habitats, 

particularly if some agricultural activities are 

carried out around protected areas or KBAs, 

this safeguard policy has been triggered.  

 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 Yes This policy will continue to be triggered under 
the AF as original activities under the parent 

project will not change; and animal husbandry 

and rehabilitation of irrigation canals activities 

will be added in the revised ESMF. 

 Because of the project’s potential to indirectly 

influence the management of natural forests, 

particularly in silvo-pastoral landscapes, this 

safeguard is triggered. A section in the ESMF 

requires the development of a Forest 

Management Plan (FMP), should any project 

activities affect such forest landscape.  

 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes The project supports investments related to 
agricultural extension services. These 

investments include the procurement, 

handling, storage and use of pesticides for plot 



demonstration and emergency interventions of 

insect pest outbreaks. Only approved 

pesticides under national or international law 

(including World Health Organization – 

WHO) will be supported under project 

financing. A list of pesticides that fall under 

these categories or are otherwise ineligible for 

support are included in the IPMP. 

 

In line with the approach taken under 

RESEPAG II, activities under the AF will 

avoid the intensive use of pesticides and 

instead will support an approach that includes 

IPMP: (a) avoiding the use or promotion of 

pesticides in WHO toxic categories I (Ia and 

Ib) or II (except under strict supervision of a 

trained and certified “Pest management 

Specialist”); (b) reduce reliance on synthetic 

chemical pesticides; (c) promote the use of 

biological or environmental pest control 

methods based on prevention, surveillance and 

monitoring; (d) favoring the use of multiple 

strategies (e.g. crop rotation, cultural 

practices, host plant resistance, biological 

control methods, chemical control); (e) pest 

control that increases natural enemies of 

parasites; (f) applying products only when 

infestation levels are critical; (g) avoiding the 

use of herbicides and pesticides near water 

sources and their contamination with pesticide 

residues when cleaning the equipment used; 

and (h) training producers, technicians, and 

farm workers to responsibly manage pesticide 

products, equipment, and containers to avoid 

their own contamination or that of livestock 

food or produce. 

 

Under the AF, the project will continue to 

implement the IPMP developed under the 

guidance of the ESMF, including screening 

criteria to exclude pesticides that are 

prohibited under the Bank’s policies. A 

specific plan is included in the IPMP to 

provide for screening, no-objection and 

monitoring during the procurement of 

pesticides. The IPMP also includes guidelines 

on the relevant aspects of integrated pest 

management that are part of the extension and 

training services provided under the project. 

 Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP No This policy will not be triggered since the new 



4.11 activities (irrigation) will not have additional 
impact on physical cultural resources. 

 
Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 No The policy is not triggered because there are 

no groups in Haiti who meet the definition of 

IPs of OP 4.10. 

 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes This policy was not triggered in the original 
project as no involuntary displacement of 

people or land acquisition was foreseen. 

 

The AF will trigger Involuntary Resettlement 

(OP/BP 4.12). While the implementation of 

RESEPAG II has thus far not involved any 

resettlement of families or economic 

restrictions, rehabilitation of irrigation and 

water management infrastructure may result in 

involuntary resettlement. 

 

A Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) will 

be prepared, consulted and disclosed at project 

implementation stage in accordance with 

OP4.12 to ensure application of the 

appropriate safeguard policies. The deferral of 

the completion of safeguards instruments to 

the implementation stage was granted in line 

with the flexibility afforded by OP 10.00 

paragraph 12. This will ensure adequate time 

to prepare, consult, and disseminate the RPF 

and other safeguard-related documents 

following the Safeguards Action Plan annexed 

to the Project Paper. 

 

Consultation in the affected areas will include 

outreach to main stakeholders and the affected 

communities to the extent possible.  Once 

sites where the project activities will be 

implemented are known, Resettlement Action 

Plans (RAP) or Abbreviated Resettlement 

Action Plans (Abbrev. RAP) will be prepared 

consulted and disclosed for sites with 

resettlement impacts in accordance with the 

policy.  Any compensation or livelihood 

restoration efforts that may be needed will be 

completed prior to commencement of the 

works. 

 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 No This policy will not be triggered since no 
dams, nor will irrigation systems dependent on 

dams, per the WB definition, be restored or 

rebuilt. 



 

Projects on International Waterways 

OP/BP 7.50 
No This policy will not be triggered since neither 

the parent project, nor any activities under the 

AF, will take place on international 

waterways, per the WB definition. 

 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 

7.60 
No This policy will not be triggered since neither 

the parent project, nor any activities under the 

AF, will take place in disputed areas, per the 

WB definition. 
. 

IV. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 

 A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 

 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and 

describe any potential large scale,  significant and/or irreversible impacts: 

 

Safeguards Implementation under the Original Project 

 

Component 1, SPS activities: impacts from handling and use of testing material, disposal of 

animal carcasses, disposal of syringes from vaccination campaigns and occupational health 

and safety concerns were adequately managed.  

Component 2, Support to Producers: the project targets improved, environmentally friendly, 

climate smart agriculture. The voucher program which has not started field-based activities 

had no impact. Impacts from inadequate sanitation in sub-projects under matching grants 

(e.g., poor design of latrines, septic tanks), cutting trees and shrubs for land clearing for 

market gardening, poor sanitary practices in food production (e.g., milk production), were low 

and properly managed. In addition, an integrated pest management plan waste management 

plan was prepared to manage agrochemicals. 

 

Components 3 and 4 had no recorded adverse impacts. 

 

The Social safeguards ratings under the Parent project have been consistently satisfactory. OP 

4.12 was not triggered under the Parent project and there were no resettlement impacts or any 

other major social risks or issues that occurred to date. Under the Parent project, an 

involuntary resettlement screening form has been used to properly detect and exclude any 

investments with OP 4.12 related impacts.  Under RESEPAG I, a social assessment was 

carried out based on extensive consultations with both Ministry of Agriculture (MARNDR) 

staff and community members in the pilot areas as well as a stakeholder analysis. The results 

of this assessment have served as the basis for the design of RESEPAG II. Under the AF, the 

ESMF update will include an annex with a social assessment targeted to new localities and 

new activities covered by the AF. MARNDR has started  to consult with people that would be 

potentially affected by the future AF activities.  

 

A gender review has been carried out during RESEPAG I. Consultations with women during 

the project preparation phase ensured women’s inclusion at the policy and program levels. A 

resultant just-in-time grants series “Fostering Economic Empowerment for Women 

Agricultural Producers in Haiti” is working to integrate gender, particularly women’s issues, 

within the Ministry of Agriculture. A collaboration between the gender specialist and the 



Ministry of Women Condition allowed to consider gender inclusion during the design of 

RESEPAG II. The Ministry of Agriculture has also hired a gender specialist to ensure that 

gender is being respected in the different parts of the project implementation. The Ministry of 

Women Condition has been a key stakeholder in the implementation of the matching grant 

component allowing the project to reach almost 50% of women participation. Under the 

Additional Financing the inclusion of women will remain important to at least 40% with some 

of the activities reaching 80% notably with the livestock packages. 

 

In terms of capacity for managing social safeguards,  the project team has a good presence in 

the field and is regularly in contact with the project beneficiaries. The project team has been 

holding consultations about the project activities and preparing minutes of these consultations.  

There is no social safeguards specialist under the parent project. However, the environmental 

specialist have attended several safeguards trainings. He is familiar with the OP 4.12 

requirements and have used screening forms to detect any resettlement related impacts. Under 

the AF, a second safeguards specialist will be hired, to be in charge of monitoring social risks 

and impacts. The person hired by the PIU will have documented social expertise, particularly 

given the fact that resettlement action plans may have to be implemented under the project. 

 

Additional Financing to Respond to Hurricane Matthew 

 

Under the AF, most of the planned activities would restore or improve pre-existing 

agricultural production conditions, and therefore are not expected to create any significant 

additional adverse environmental or social impact. However, (i) animal husbandry and (ii) the 

rehabilitation of damaged irrigation canals, water intakes, and water reservoir infrastructures 

may imply some minor environmental and social impacts related to: (i) additional waste 

(animal waste), vegetation harvesting, overgrazing, damage to riparian habitat, etc. Because 

the production systems in Haiti to be supported by the AF are of very small scale, point 

source pollution of wastewater, ammonia, odor, nuisances, etc., typically associated with 

intensive production systems, are not expected to be encountered; and (ii) construction, 

especially around water bodies (streams, canals) may impact health and safety, and result in 

waste production, noise, reduced water quality (turbidity), increase level of dust, or result in 

loss of vegetation cover, etc.). These potential negative impacts are however expected to be 

moderate, localized,  and can be mitigated through (i) for animal husbandry system promoting 

enclosure of goats, training and technical assistance that goes with the livestock will be the 

principal vehicle to effective management of waste, wastewater, preventing animals’ access to 

surface water bodies, production of forage trees for feed,  etc.; (ii) for irrigation rehabilitation, 

mitigation will be through the application of good construction and management practices and 

with close supervision of contractor performance by field engineers and in close consultation 

with local communities. The potential impacts and mitigation measures will be identified and  

included in  the ESMPs (and RAPs when relevant) for each subproject. 

 

The AF triggers the Involuntary Resettlement Policy (OP 4.12) as works along riverbanks and 

irrigation systems may require a minimal degree of land acquisition and cause economic 

impacts, such as impact on fruit trees or damaged crops. These works will not be large-scale, 

significant or have irreversible adverse impacts on the population. Because of the deferral of 

preparation of the safeguards instruments, the project will prepare, consult and disclose a 



Resettlement Policy Framework at project implementation stage. 

 

Lessons learned on social safeguards from RESEPAG II: 

 

Lesson 1:  It is important to have a dedicated social specialist as part of the PIU to track and 

document social issues and impacts. Under the AF, there will be a second safeguards 

specialist hired to focus on social safeguards and social issues at large. 

Lesson 2:  A well-functioning Grievance Redress mechanism is needed to keep track of 

beneficiaries’ concerns and provide timely response. Under the parent project, there is a 

hotline established under the Ministry of Agriculture. 10 complaints were received, mostly 

coming from agricultural producers whose proposals were not accepted. Under the AF, the 

hotline will be coupled with a communication strategy focusing some specific social risks. 

(Eg.to explain to the farmers the eligibility criteria, targeting strategy and the voucher system 

that the project is implementing). The Ministry of Agriculture will designate one focal point 

from the Ministry in each Department to act as liaison for managing safeguards-related issues 

and address grievances. The Focal Points would resolve issues, and escalate them to the staff 

in Port-au-Prince as needed. Meetings will be held every two months between staff in capital 

city and the regional Focal Points to exchange information. 

Lesson 3:  Even in projects that have not triggered OP 4.12, the involuntary resettlement 

screening form is a useful tool as part of ESMF to detect potential resettlement risks upfront. 

Under the AF, this practice will continue as part of first environmental screening and a RAP 

will be prepared when potential impacts are detected. No activities will be able to start before 

the RAP is effectively implemented and the project affected people have received their 

compensation. The safeguards specialists under AF will receive a refresher training on OP 

4.12 as well as how to screen out social impacts beyond resettlement. 

 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in 

the project area: 

 

The project has potential indirect impacts on natural habitats if some agricultural activities are 

carried out around protected areas or Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs). Also, the project has 

the potential to indirectly influence the management of natural forests, particularly in mixed 

land use landscapes (forestry and grazing). 

 

However, the project is designed to avoid the financing of activities with significant 

environmental impact and promote environmental good practice such as reforestation and soil 

conservation.  The ESMF has provisions to prepare a Forest Management Plan (FMP) should 

any project activities affect such forest landscape. 

 

In the control of agricultural pests, the project has focused on integrated pest management: 

use of approved pesticides only; reduce reliance on synthetic pesticides; promote biological 

pest control; utilize multiple strategies (crop rotation, resistant varieties, and biological 

control); natural predators of parasites; critical use of products; protect water sources; and 

training operators. 

 

Furthermore, the ESMF and the capacity building provided to the Environmental Cell in 

MARNDR will enhance the ability of the Ministry to optimize environmental outcomes in the 



project area. 

 

No potential indirect or long term social impacts are expected. Resettlement, land acquisition 

and loss of economic livelihood are unlikely. The project will avoid or minimize land 

acquisition based on the lessons learned regarding delays and complications with land titles. 

RPF will include measures to deal with such potential delays in payments should land 

acquisition be necessary.   

 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse 

impacts. 

 

The project design is broad and includes many components. It takes into consideration the 

role played by the agricultural sector in employment (57% percent of the active population; 

66% of rural employment; and 75% of employment to low-income rural households); the 

variability of the topography and climate; environmental degradation; and social vulnerability. 

Project design considered the current alternative, which avoids funding activities with a 

significant environmental impact, commercial crops, monoculture and export-oriented crops, 

but promotes good environmental practices such as reforestation and soil conservation at the 

micro-producer level. 

 

Most of the planned activities under the AF are not expected to create any significant adverse 

environmental or social impact, as they will be restoring or improving pre-existing 

agricultural production conditions, and will put a particular emphasis on the quality and 

resilience of these structures and systems. As the proposed project would support the 

rehabilitation of damaged irrigation canals, water intakes, and water reservoir infrastructures, 

including river embankments, this may imply some minor temporary environmental and 

social impacts. These civil works are expected to be mostly of small size, and efforts will be 

placed on minimizing any possible negative effect through solid preliminary studies allowing 

to clearly identify areas of interventions, avoiding if possible to modify any previous canal 

routes, and ensuring the adequate design, use of appropriate construction materials, and 

construction techniques etc. Clearing canals and areas of interventions may produce some 

solid wastes that could present disposal issues. Adequate management of waste and debris 

would be embedded in the Terms of reference and contractual obligations for the contractors.  

 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an 

assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 

 

Parent Project 

 

The Borrower has prepared all the required safeguard instruments (ESMF and IPMP). The 

ESMF is the instrument used to identify when additional Environmental and Social 

Management Plans (ESMPs) are necessary and includes a procedure to screen out projects 

that will (i) negatively impact critical natural habitats; (ii) adversely affect the management of 

natural forests, or (iii) an IPMP that will address an increase in the use of, or the storage of, 

application or handling of, pesticides in categories I and II of the WHO Recommended 

Classification of Pesticides. The project design emphasizes the adoption of environmentally-

friendly technologies and others that favor increased productivity over simple land expansion. 

 

The MARNDR is experienced in implementing donor-funded projects (including World 



Bank, the IDB and IFAD) and managing the requisite safeguard actions. To strengthen their 

capacity, the MARNDR with the support of the RESEPAG II project has created an 

Environmental Cell within the Ministry to manage environmental risks within the agricultural 

sector more broadly. The project is supporting the development and operationalization of this 

Cell. The preparation, implementation and oversight of safeguard actions will continue to be 

provided by this Environmental Cell during implementation. 

 

To assist the Environmental Cell, the ESMF includes indicators to monitor compliance as 

well as a training and dissemination program to build capacity within the Cell and to build a 

constituency for environmental awareness in the agricultural sector more broadly. The Bank 

(external consultant) will closely monitor environmental compliance to identify opportunities 

to enhance environmental outcomes and better manage adverse impacts. 

 

The environmental and social capacity of the RESEPAG II project team has been largely 

adequate; it consists of an environmental specialist/agronomist; an economist/social specialist; 

and a social/gender specialist, who work on safeguards issues on a part-time basis.  

RESEPAG II staff is acquainted with the Bank´s policies after attending several safeguards 

workshops organized in country. 

 

Additional Financing to Respond to Hurricane Matthew 

 

Under the AF, the ESMF, and its attached IPMP, will be updated to reflect the new 

components added to the project; reference will be made to the World Bank Group ESHS 

guidelines.   

 

Under the AF, given that OP 4.12 is being triggered to address potential involuntary 

resettlement, the project concluded that the capacity of the PIU will need to be enhanced and 

that an additional specialist would be required to complement the current team. The Task 

Team recommended that the MARNDR/RESEPAG II hire a full-time, entry-level socio-

environmental specialist to complement the team, to be in charge of monitoring 

environmental and social risks and impacts, and receive training by the team on an ongoing 

basis. Given the urgency of the emergency works the environmental specialist at the PIU will 

be trained to screen works for potential involuntary resettlement. The Bank will assist the 

MARNDR in preparing the TORs and in selecting the socio-environmental specialist. 

 

The Project will also hire the services of a second Socio-Environmental Specialist in the 

coming months to prepare a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) to ensure the compliance 

of involuntary resettlement safeguards, as well as a social assessment annex to the ESMF. 

  

Social safeguards rating under the Parent project has been satisfactory. OP 4.12 was not 

triggered under the Parent project and there were no resettlement impacts or any other major 

social risks or issues that occurred to date. Under the Parent project, a rubric in the ESMF 

screening form covering involuntary resettlement has been used to properly detect and 

exclude any investments with OP 4.12 related impacts. 

 

In terms of capacity for managing social safeguards, the project team has a good presence in 



the field and is regularly in contact with the project beneficiaries. There is no social 

safeguards specialist under the parent project. However, the current environmental specialist 

have attended several safeguards trainings. He is familiar with the OP 4.12 requirements and 

have used screening forms to detect any resettlement related potential risks. Activities likely 

to cause involuntary resettlement were excluded. 

 

In the event that involuntary resettlement cannot be avoided by the necessary works, the Bank 

team will support the PIU to develop and implement Resettlement Action Plans. The Bank 

Task Team will provide an additional safeguards training for relevant PIU staff before the 

beginning of AF activities. A second training will be provided 6 to 10 months into the 

implementation of the AF. 

 

The AF will reinforce the existing Grievance Redress Mechanisms (GRM) established by the 

Parent Project. The GRM ensures that complaints received are promptly reviewed in order to 

address project-related concerns. Additionally, communities and individuals who believe that 

they are adversely affected by a World Bank (WB) supported project may submit complaints 

to existing project-level grievance redress mechanisms or the WB’s Grievance Redress 

Service (GRS). 

 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on 

safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 

 

The rural population depending on the Agricultural sector for their livelihood in Haiti is 

estimated to be around 5 million. The main stakeholders are the segment of this population 

who live and work in the regions supported by this project. Among this population, the project 

will pay special attention to women. Studies from RESEPAG I show that while women 

undertake a large part of agricultural activities and participate in many productive 

organizations, they are disadvantaged compared with the men in terms of decision-making, 

control over resources, and access to economic benefits. Other stakeholders include the 

Ministry of Agriculture central and regional staff, local government officials, extension 

service providers, both public and private, as well as the general public who will benefit from 

improved agricultural output (in quantity and quality), as well as from the reduced risk of 

disease transmission through improved plant and animal health safety. 

 

The Project team will conduct consultations in beneficiary communities affected by Hurricane 

Matthew areas to inform beneficiaries of project activities, opportunities to participate, 

potential adverse short-term impacts, and the grievance redress mechanism available to them. 

These consultations will be key in engaging the population in the emergency response 

programs, reconstruction works and cash-for-work activities. Specifically, the content of 

voucher programs will be consulted and validated with the beneficiaries; the beneficiaries of 

livestock replacement will be identified through community participatory engagement; 

irrigation infrastructure will be identified through community mapping; and cash-for-work 

schemes will be established through participatory processes. People affected by involuntary 

resettlement will be consulted on compensation and resettlement policies in accordance with 

OP4.12.

 Key development issues and rationale for Bank involvement  
 
1. Benin is one of the world’s least-developed countries, with an annual per capita income of 
approximately US$820 in 2016. Poverty remains widespread, with a poverty rate of at about 50 
percent ($1.90 a day poverty line – 2011 PPP) in 2015.  With an average per capita GDP growth rate of 
1.3 percent (2005-2015) driven primarily by the services sector, poverty reduction has been limited, 
highlighting the need to ensure a broad-based and stronger growth. There are significant regional 
disparities in poverty rates and rural poverty rates are higher than those in urban areas. Fewer female-
headed households fall below the national poverty line than male-headed households.  
 
2. Benin’s economic growth has been satisfactory over the past decade (averaging about 4 percent) 
but the country’s economic performance has been hampered by low competitiveness and high 
informality.  Following the temporary slowdown experienced in 2015, economy activity rebounded 
driven by the recovery of private consumption. Economic performance was supported by increased 
cotton production, strong activity at the Port of Cotonou, and rising telecommunications and transport 
sector activity. Despite the satisfactory growth rates, economic performance in Benin is hampered by a 
weak business enabling environment. The high cost and unpredictable supply of electricity is a key 
constraint for private sector development. Agriculture’s export is concentrated in the cotton sector, and 
agriculture suffers from supply chain deficiencies, including in the provision and distribution of inputs as 
well as on the marketing side. Approximately 90 percent of the labor force is engaged in the informal 
sector – agriculture, informal commerce and other services activities. 
 
3. The first pillar of the Fiscal Reform and Growth series on fiscal consolidation is justified given the 
Government’s effort to create fiscal space and improve the efficiency of public spending. In the run-up 
to 2016 Presidential elections, increases in the wage bill and out-of-budget expenses led to significant 
increases in public debt (up by almost 20 percent of GDP) and in the fiscal deficit (up from 2.1 percent of 
GDP in 2014 to 8 percent in 2015). The Government contained expenditures in 2016 to face the drop of 
tax revenues and managed to reduce the fiscal deficit from 8 percent of GDP in 2015 to 6 percent of

GDP in 2016.  The DPO series will support the authorities’ effort to create fiscal space by improving 
revenue collection and managing more efficiently public expenditure, with an emphasis on wages and 
transfers.  In addition to the DPOs, the Government program is supported by an ECF program with the 
IMF approved by the IMF Board on April 7, 2017, providing macroeconomic and fiscal anchors that will 
support the implementation of the reforms. The first review of the Program, carried out in September 
2017, confirmed that the authorities are committed to responsible fiscal management. 

 
4. The second pillar aims at promoting agricultural productivity and strengthening the power sector 
which is a Government’s priority to create productive formal jobs and support inclusive growth. 
Agriculture employs over 50 percent of the population and is the economy’s leading formal sector 
foreign exchange earner. The country has a large endowment of arable and fertile land and adequate 
water resources. However, Benin’s comparative advantage in agriculture remains largely unexploited as 
the governance structure and relatively low food-safety standards had a negative impact on the sector’s 
competitiveness. Also, the inconsistent supply of electricity is frequently noted as a leading constraint to 
private sector growth, particularly in the light manufacturing and agricultural processing sectors. 
Strengthening the financial viability of the power sector and promote private sector participation is 
essential to increase electricity production capacity in a sustainable way. Focusing on these important 
real sectors will help improve productivity, create higher paying jobs and livelihoods, and enhance the 
country’s effort to reach the World Bank’s twin goals of poverty reduction and shared prosperity. 
 

 Proposed Objective(s) 
 
5. The overarching goal of the proposed FRGC series is to boost real economic growth, reduce poverty 
and increase opportunities for the poorest in the population. The program development objectives of 
this FRGC series are to: a) support macroeconomic stability by strengthening fiscal management; and b) 
promote economic growth by increasing the productivity and competitiveness of the agricultural sector 
and strengthening the power sector’s financial viability and production capacity.  
 

 Preliminary Description 
 
6. The first pillar of the DPO series will focus on supporting macroeconomic stability by strengthening 
fiscal management. Not only is adequacy of the macroeconomic and fiscal framework a prerequisite for 
sustainable economic growth but budgetary and debt sustainability is necessary to the delivery of 
effective public services that maximize the impact of available revenues on beneficiaries, including the 
poorest segments of the populations. In addition, increasing fiscal space will help relax fiscal constraints 
to accommodate the financing of needed infrastructure projects.  
 
7. The second pillar will seek to promote economic growth by increasing the productivity of the 
agricultural sector and strengthening the power sector’s financial viability and production capacity. 
This series focuses on measures aimed at increasing the productivity of the agricultural sector by 
supporting a policy, regulatory, and institutional framework that strengthens agriculture value chains 
and enhances diversification, promotes higher quality standards for agricultural products and supports 
greater access to credit in the primary sector. Moreover, the measures supported by the operation 
strengthen the financial viability of the power sector that is necessary to attract private sector 
participation and, thus, increase electricity production capacity, including in renewables, and access to 
electricity in a sustainable way. 

 

 Poverty and Social Impacts and Environment Aspects 



 
Poverty and Social Impacts 
 
8. The FRGC series is expected to have a positive impact on poverty reduction. Measures to increase 
revenue and to strengthen public expenditure efficiency are expected to ensure ongoing fiscal space for 
the delivery of essential public services and to contribute to a macroeconomic environment conducive 
to economic growth and private sector employment creation.  
 
9. The supported measures aimed at increasing agricultural productivity and diversification are 
important in achieving the Government’s stated poverty reduction and equitable growth goals. 
Results from the Poverty Assessment indicate that while agricultural growth has contributed strongly to 
overall growth, the impact on poverty reduction has been limited. Diversifying production into more 
valuable crops, focusing more resources on export-oriented crops, and raising productivity should boost 
incomes among the large share of the population, especially the poor population, involved in 
agriculture. 
 
10. Initial results from the 2014 Poverty Assessment note the strong link between unemployment, 
underemployment and poverty. Gender-specific results and recommendations from the assessment 
have informed the policy dialogue with the Government. Gender disparities are especially pronounced 
in the credit market, where improving access to credit has had an important impact on women’s 
economic empowerment. Support for reforms designed to improve credit to agriculture sector and, 
enhance private-sector competitiveness and build a more diversified and resilient economy will have 
positive effects on employment creation and poverty reduction. 
 
11. Supported electricity sector reforms, should they meet their objective of encouraging increased 
access to electricity and more cost-effective provision of electricity, should have a direct and positive 
impact on the poor. Increased and more reliable access at affordable prices should also have a 
significant impact on firm creation, firm growth and resultant employment opportunities, particularly in 
the higher productivity formal sector. 
 
12. A Poverty and Social Impact Assessment (PSIA) has been carried out to assess the potential impact 
of electricity pricing reforms in Benin. The PSIA concluded that improving the financial situation of the 
SBEE and thus reducing the gap between SBEE’s service unit cost and revenues per kWh are 
prerequisites for the expansion of SBEE operations throughout the country and greater access for poor 
households to electricity. The PSIA study also concluded that the current social policy of subsidizing the 
tariff for the poor is not effective and suggested some possible options to strengthen the policy 
including adopting a tariff policy based on usage and eliminating fixed costs for small customers. 
 
Environment Aspects  
 
13. The policies supported by the proposed DPF are not likely to have negative impacts on the 
country’s natural assets. All the actions supported throughout the first operation are policy-oriented; 
they do not support direct investment in environmentally impactful investments or involve policy 
actions with significant environmental consequences.  The measures supporting domestic resource 
mobilization and efficient management of public expenditure pose no risk to the environment. 
Measures designed to strengthen economic competitiveness are also largely environmentally neutral.  
 



14. Strengthening the financial viability of the power sector will support increased access to electricity 
and is expected to have a positive environmental impact. Households in Benin, particularly rural 
households, are highly dependent on biomass for their daily energy requirements. The reform program 
supported under the energy sector is likely to have positive environmental impacts and would help in 
the reduction of greenhouse gases occasioned by the predominance of fuel biomass (fuelwood, charcoal 
and plant wastes). The prior action of strengthening the financial viability of the power sector is likely to 
produce climate change mitigation co-benefit, since strengthening the financial viability of the sector is 
likely to promote the development of new energy efficient production capacities.  In the agricultural 
sector, measures intended to diversify agriculture away from a reliance on cotton could have a 
potentially positive environmental effect as agriculture becomes less mono-culture based and 
increasingly diversified. 
 
15. Over the last 20 years, the Government has made significant strides in mainstreaming 
environmental sustainability in projects. EIA is a legal requirement and it is widely applied to all 
developmental projects.  Environmental assessment is a necessary condition to obtain the approval to 
implement any development project. It has been set up in the Law N° 98-30 relating to the 
environmental framework and in the Decree N° 2001-235 relating to the environmental assessment 
procedures. The national environmental protection agency (ABE) has the capacity to implement, 
monitor, and report on mitigating measures and/or environmental and social management plans; and 
have been working in direct collaborations with the environmental and social specialists of the Bank 
funded projects.

Country Context
Benin is a low-income country of about ten million people (2013 population census) with a per 
capita income of US$820 in 2014.  The economy is driven by agriculture and services, 
particularly import/export activities through the Port of Cotonou. Agriculture accounts for 25 
percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and 47 percent of the country's employment. Cotton is 
the primary export commodity. The informal sector, including subsistence agriculture, contributes 
up to 56 percent of GDP and engages over 90 percent of the labor force. Informal re-export to 
Nigeria contribute Â¼ of the government revenue (a part of that activity goes through formal 
channels for it to be able to generate so much of the government revenue). The country was able 
to maintain macroeconomic stability, which laid the foundation for accelerating growth. Real 
GDP grew by 4.6 percent in 2012; 6.9 percent in 2013; 6.5 percent in 2014; is estimated at 5.0 
percent in 2015; and is projected at 4.5 percent in 2016; which is higher than the previous 5-year 
average of 3.7 percent. Steady gross domestic product (GDP) growth of about 5 percent during 
the period (2012-2015) was partially offset by rapid population growth averaging 3.5 percent per 
year, which led to a modest and unequal increase in household consumption.  As a result, poverty 
levels grew from 36.2 percent in 2011 to 40.1 percent in 2015 . Growth was particularly modest 
in agriculture, which employs almost half the labor force. The economy remains poorly 
diversified and vulnerable to external shocks. This vulnerability underscores the need to promote 
economic diversification (including exports) as recommended in the 2013 Country Partnership 
Strategy (CPS) for Benin. Poverty reduction has been enshrined in successive poverty reduction 
strategies, but results have proven erratic and difficult to sustain. There are significant regional 
disparities in poverty rates, and while female-headed households have typically experienced 
lower poverty levels, women continue to suffer from a lack of economic opportunity, are 
underrepresented in politics and in other decision making positions, and are more susceptible to 
falling into poverty (Table 1). 
 
The disconnect between economic growth and poverty reduction during the last five years has 
been reinforced by the fact that higher growth stemmed mainly from more capital-intensive 
sectors like banking, telecommunications and the port. In contrast, agriculture, which employs 
half of the labor force, only grew at 4 percent per annum, with its growth derived from more land 
and more labor, but with modest increase in productivity. In addition, population growth has 
limited per capita growth and its impact on poverty reduction. Furthermore, Nigeria➢❨ s 
economic slowdown and policy changes have led to decreased opportunities for informal trade, 
both in the gas sector, where gas flows informally from Nigeria to Benin, and in the broader 
consumer goods sector, where rice, chicken, edible oil, used cars, used clothing etc., flow from 
Benin to Nigeria. For instance, the suppression of subsidies in Nigeria➢❨ s oil sector affected 
negatively the informal Beninese gas trade in areas adjacent to Benin➢❨ s border with Nigeria 
(Adjarra), where poverty increased from 34.8 percent in 2011 to 50.4 percent in 2015.
Sectoral and institutional Context
The agricultural sector in Benin is subject to the vagaries of climate and price fluctuations. 
Increase in productivity for major crops, including cotton has remained modest over time. Overall 
agricultural growth is around 4 percent, which is often offset by the relatively high population 
growth (3.5 percent). Yet, agriculture will remain one of the main source of growth and 
employment for the near future in the country. This will require higher and faster growth.  The 
past performance of 4% was insufficient to drive meaningful poverty reduction, due to the very 
high population growth. The agricultural production systems rely on an extension of cropped area 
and family labor, with no or limited use of improved inputs, production methods, and farm 



Page 3 of 11

equipment. Access to financing is limited outside the cotton system. The country➢❨ s agricultural 
trade performance is generally weak, with a persistently negative agricultural trade balance. 
Agricultural exports are concentrated on three groups of products: cotton, fruits (pineapple), and 
nuts and oilseed (cashew, soy and cottonseed). To meet the needs for a growing urban population, 
Benin continues to import a large share of horticultural products from neighboring countries (such 
as Burkina Faso and Nigeria), rice from Asia, wheat, frozen meat and milk from Europe, and 
frozen poultry products from Brazil. The sector faces the triple challenges of diversifying exports 
(consolidating cotton exports and increasing export volume for pineapple and cashew nut), 
increasing food production, and sustainably increasing farm and post-harvest productivity. These 
challenges must be addressed by taking into account the structural vulnerability of the 
country➢❨ s agricultural production system to floods and occasional droughts.  
 
Improving productivity and strengthening diversification are on the top of the agenda of the 
agricultural and overall development strategy in Benin. The agriculture sector strategy in Benin is 
defined within the broader framework of the Comprehensive Africa Agricultural Development 
Program (CAADP) by which the country commits to achieve a 6 percent growth in agriculture 
and to allocate at least 10 percent of the national budget to agriculture as recommended in the 
Maputo declaration . The country➢❨ s long-term development strategy (Benin 2025 - Alafia) 
establishes the long-term vision of the country and gives clear directions in relation to the 
promotion of agricultural value chains. The vision is that the country must move towards a greater 
diversification of agricultural production in order to become a major exporter of agricultural 
products by 2025. The achievement of this vision would require a sound public and private 
financing of agriculture and financial sector reforms that would support the promotion and 
implementation of specialized financing instruments for accelerated productivity growth and 
sustainable diversification in the agriculture sector.

C.  Proposed Development Objective(s)

Original Project Development Objective(s) - Parent
The Project Development Objective of the Agricultural Productivity and Diversification Project 
(PADA) is to restore and improve productivity and value addition for selected value chains in the 
Recipient's territory.

Key Results 
The key performance indicators will remain unchanged, although targets will need to be adjusted 
where necessary and new indicators will be introduced to account for the new activities and 
changes in corporate indicators. These new indicators include: (i) Number of farmers reached 
with assets or services  of whom 40 percent are women; (ii) Farmers adopting improved 
agricultural technology; (iii) Number of micro projects transformed into SMEs. The end date for 
all targets will also be extended to February 28,2021, in line with the proposed revised Closing 
Date of the original project. .

D.  Project Description

The proposed Additional Financing (AF) will be used to support the government of Benin in 
consolidating and scaling-up the achievements of the initial project, and to strengthen the project 
focus on income generating activities for poor households as well as improving their nutritional 
status.

II. Implementation
Institutional and Implementation Arrangements
There will be no major change to the implementation arrangements. The Project Coordination Unit 



Page 5 of 11

(PCU) is currently composed of staff who have been recruited based on the skills needed for the 
various positions. Given the nature of the scaling up and new activities, the PCU will include an 
additional animal production specialist. In addition, given the strategic orientation of the Programme 
Cadre-ProCAD  that hosts the PCU, some additional staff will be recruited with cost sharing between 
PADA and WAAPP: (i) an operations officer; (ii) a finance controller; (iii) a computer and 
information management specialist; (v) a logistics management specialist; (iv) an accountant; and (v) 
two administrative assistants.  
 
Financial Management (FM). The proposed AF will build on the existing institutional and fiduciary 
arrangements of the Project Coordination Unit of PADA under oversight of the Ministry of 
Agriculture. The overall performance of the PADA in financial management is Satisfactory. Staffing 
is adequate but needs to be strengthened with a Financial Controller and proper books of accounts 
and supporting documents have been kept in respect of all expenditures. The PCU is familiar with 
the Bank FM requirements and has demonstrated solid technical and fiduciary capacities to manage 
Bank-financed Projects. The audit for the year ended December 31, 2015 for the PADA was 
submitted on time, and was unqualified. The interim un-audited financial reports (IFR) are prepared 
every quarter and regularly submitted to the Bank on time.  
 
The overall FM risk of the Agricultural Productivity and Diversification Project including the 
proposed additional financing is rated Moderate. It is considered that the financial management 
satisfies the Bank➢❨ s minimum requirements under OP/BP 10.00, and therefore is adequate to 
provide, with reasonable assurance, accurate and timely financial management information on the 
status of the project required by the Bank.  
 
Procurement. The New Procurement Framework (including Procurement Regulations for Borrowers) 
that apply to projects with PCN held after July 1st, 2016 will normally apply. Given the fact that 
waiver has been obtained from CPO to apply the old procurement Guidelines, procurement 
arrangements of the original project will remain largely the same under the proposed Additional 
Financing in accordance with: (a) the World Bank➢❨ s ➢❨ Guidelines: Procurement of Goods, 
Works, and Non-Consulting Services under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits and Grants➢❨  dated 
January 2011; revised July 2014, and (b) ➢❨ Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants 
under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits and Grants by World Bank Borrowers➢❨  dated January 2011, 
revised July 2014.  Although procurement on PADA has been quite challenging, the PCU has 
conducted procurement activities for the original project in a satisfactory manner.  
 
Environmental and Social Safeguards. The AF triggers: OP/BP 4.01 on Environmental Assessment; 
OP4.09 on Pest Management; OP/PB4.11 On Physical Cultural Resources and OP/BP 4.12 on 
Involuntary Resettlement. The original project was rated as environmental assessment Category 
➢❨ B➢❨  so as the proposed AF. The environmental and social impacts of the Project are expected to 
be moderate, site specific, and manageable. The Project is expected to have a positive environmental 
impact through its support for agricultural technologies that promote the better use of land and water 
resources. Potential environmental risks could include point and nonpoint pollution of water sources, 
and other issues associated with the use of agricultural chemicals, and negative environmental 
impacts associated with the rehabilitation of irrigation or small-scale civil works. The parent 
project➢❨ s safeguards documents (Environmental and Social Management Framework-ESMF, Pest 
Management Plan-PMP and Resettlement Policy Framework-RPF) have been adapted and updated to 
include activities planned under the AF. Thereafter, all the three safeguard instruments have been 
consulted upon and disclosed in-country on February 03, 2017 and at the Infoshop on February 03, 



Page 6 of 11

2017. The latest implementation support mission (December, 2016) rated the safeguard compliance 
Satisfactory, based on review of progress reports and project site visits. The Project Management 
Unit has an extensive experience in Bank➢❨ s safeguards policies and a dedicated team has been 
appointed to follow up on environmental and social issues; especially the implementation of the 
safeguards instruments. In addition, the national body in charge of environmental and social 
management plans (ESMPs) implementation monitoring (ABE Agence Beninoise pour 
l➢❨ Environnement) will ensure the compliance with national legislation while Bank➢❨ s safeguards 
specialists guide and provide guidance to the PIU through regular supervision missions.

III. Safeguard Policies that might apply

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional)
Environmental 
Assessment OP/BP 
4.01

Yes The ongoing Additional Financing intends to finance small 
equipment to ensure proper use of irrigation facilities (sub-
component 2-1). More specifically, the project under sub-
component 2-2, will also fund the construction and 
rehabilitation of critical market and storage infrastructures: (i) 
cold chamber for pineapple packaging and storage before 
export; (ii) construction of centers of bulking up in pineapple 
production areas and distribution centers of pineapple to 
expand domestic marketing of pineapple; (iii) construction of 
25 warehouses to support the bulk marketing of cashew nuts; 
(iv) construction and equipment of 10 cashew apple juice 
processing units to support income-generating activities for 
women based on good results of the initial phase; (v) 
construction of 100 threshing and drying areas for rice to 
improve quality and marketability of the final product; and (vi) 
construction and equipment of fresh fish distribution centers. 
These several civil works will potentially impact 
environmental and social components. However, the exact 
locations of these investments were not determined with 
certainty an Environment and Social Management Framework
(ESMF) has been developed, reviewed, consulted upon and 
disclosed within the Benin on February 03,2017 and at the 
World Bank➢❨ s Website on February 03, 2017

Natural Habitats OP/
BP 4.04

No This policy is not triggered as there will be no potential impact 
on natural habitats.

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No The project is not expected to have any impact on forests.
Pest Management OP 
4.09

Yes The Additional Financing of PADA aims also at increasing the 
agricultural productivity. By this way, it is expected that 
farmers use fertilizers to improve soil fertility and pesticides to 
fight against pests and predators. To handle in a proper manner 
the potential use of these chemical products, the borrower has 
prepared a Pest Management Plan (PMP). After its preparation, 
PMP has been reviewed by the Bank, consulted upon and 
disclosed within Benin on February 03, 2017 and on the 
Bank➢❨ s website on February 03, 2017.

IV. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify 

and describe any potential large scale,  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
There are no significant or irreversible adverse impacts that are expected from the implementation 
of activities that will be financed under this AF. Most of the adverse environmental and social 
impacts associated with these investments will be small-scale and site-specific.  Hence, they will 
be manageable at an acceptable level. 
 
The project remains EA category B and triggers four safeguards policies namely OP/PB 4.01; 
OP4.09;OP/PB4.11 and OP/PB 4.12.  Safeguard instruments (ESMF, IPMP and RPF) have all 
been updated and will be implemented as guidance/guidelines for the activities during the 
Additional Financing phase.  
 
During the parent project➢❨ s implementation, Overall safeguard compliance (OP/BP 4.01 on 
Environmental Assessment; OP4.09 on Pest Management and OP/BP 4.12 on Involuntary 
Resettlement) is rated Moderately Satisfactory.  All safeguard documents have been prepared and 
disclosed in accordance with national legislation and Bank policies.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities 
in the project area:
The assessment of potential environmental and social adverse impacts does not foresee long-term 
impacts associated to this project.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse

impacts.
N/A

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
Given that the exact location of future investments are not yet known and activities are diversified, 
the borrower has prepared an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF). That 
safeguard instrument contains standards, methods, and procedures specifying how future activities 
whose location, number, and scale are unknown will systematically address environmental and 
social issues.  It includes procedures for screening and mitigating impacts from construction and 
operation of the irrigation schemes, and includes the following: (a) checklists of potential 
environmental and social impacts and their sources; (b) procedures for participatory screening of 
proposed sites and activities and the environmental and social considerations; (c) procedures for 
assessing potential environmental and social impacts of the planned project activities; (d) 
institutional arrangements for mitigating, preventing, and managing the identified impacts; (e) 
typical environmental management planning process for addressing negative externalities in the 
course of project implementation; (f) a system for monitoring the implementation of mitigation 
measures; and (g) recommended capacity building measures for environmental planning and 
monitoring of project activities. 
 
To manage land acquisition, involuntary resettlement or loss of livelihoods induced by the 
implementation of activities and other sub-projects, the client has developed a Resettlement Policy 
Framework (RPF).  That safeguard instrument clarifies the principles, organizational 
arrangements, and design criteria to be applied to investments/sub-projects to be prepared during 
project implementation. Investment-specific Resettlement Action Plans (RAP) will be prepared, as 
necessary, in line with the RPF and submitted to the Bank for approval.  
 
The PMP encourages the use of organic fertilizers and biological technics to fight against 
agriculture predators. In addition to that, It sets up guidance and guidelines with the aim to protect 
population health and environment integrity in promoting best practices in the case of use of 
chemical products. 
 
All the above safeguard documents provide detailed mitigation measures to ensure sustainability 
and compliance with Benin➢❨ s regulations and legislations, as well as with the World Bank 
environmental and social safeguard policies. 
 
Activities financed under the project will be screened using a standardized approach based on the 
tools developed under the original project.  ESIA including ESMPs will be prepared as needed for 
the small civil works expected to be undertaken under this AF.  For works with negligible impacts 
environmental measures based on national laws and regulations will apply. 
 
The PIU includes currently an environmental specialist who is responsible for safeguards 
implementation. Moving forward, under this AF, the same staff will continue to oversee the 
implementation of the project safeguards instruments and coordinate efforts at the national level. 
Moreover, the PIU staff will continue to regularly monitor and follow-up with any safeguard 
issues with the assistance of the ABE(Agence Beninoise de l➢❨ Environnement) involved since 
the beginning of the parent project in ESMPs implementation monitoring. Lastly, the Bank➢❨ s 
implementing support missions will also continue to include environmental and social safeguard 
specialists.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure 
on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Stakeholders concerned by the AF are constituted by farmers, breeders, fishermen, NGOs, and 
ministries in charge of Agriculture, Livestock, Water, Forestry, Environment and land 
management. During the safeguard instruments preparation, these various stakeholder groups have 
been consulted. During the updating of the safeguards documentation, new series of consultations 
were held where all of these stakeholders have been consulted and their recommendations, 
comments and suggestions taken into account in the safeguards documents finalization. The latest 
consultation in the process of safeguard instruments preparation was the workshop held in 
Bohicon from December 13 to 16, 2016 at Hotel Fifatin.

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 
 

1. Nepal is an under-developed country located in the Himalayan region, with harsh mountain 
topography except for its southern part consisting of a narrow strip of flat land called the Terai region.  The 
economy is largely agrarian-based, with low labor productivity.  The shares of agriculture, services and 
industry in GDP are around 32, 50 and 18 percent, respectively.  The per-capita GDP/yr is around US$700 
(FY16) with 24% of the population below the poverty line.   Nepal experienced its slowest growth in 14 years 
in FY2016.   Real GDP growth, which slowed to 2.7 percent in FY2015 because of a devastating earthquake, 
was further dragged down to 0.6 percent in FY2016 due to the sluggish post-earthquake reconstruction 
activities and the disruption in cross-border trade. 
 
2. The weak economic growth of the past two years has setback the steady reduction in poverty. 
Poverty headcount rate is estimated at 11.8 percent in FY2015, down from 15 percent in FY2010, but is 
projected to increase slightly to 11.9 percent in FY2016, measured at the $1.90 a day line. A contributing 
factor has been the higher inflation. Based on a simulation exercise, other things being equal, a 2 
percentage points increase in overall inflation would raise poverty headcount rate by 0.8 percentage point 
(measured at $1.90), pushing approximately 225,000 people back into poverty. 

 
 

Sectoral and Institutional Context 
 

Agriculture, despite being the mainstay of the rural economy, suffers low productivity in the crop sector  
 
3. Agriculture is the mainstay of the rural economy and a source of income for the majority of Nepali 
with 66 percent of the population engaged in agriculture (small farmers constitute 80 percent of the rural 
population), a 32 percent contribution to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (Central Bureau of Statistics, 
FY16), and 50 percent contribution to exports earning.  
 

4. Despite this importance of the agricultural sector, the level of income from agriculture is low by the 
regional and international standards, particularly for the major cereal crops (lower than their potential yield 
by at least 50 percent).   Thus, agriculture in Nepal has not made substantial contribution to improving the 
living standards during the past decades.   
 
5. Nepal’s rural population comprises mainly smallholder farmers and about 80 percent of the rural 
population aged fifteen and above is engaged in agriculture.  The unavailability of sustainable livelihood 
opportunities in the rural areas has led to a large-scale exodus of the population to the cities and more 
recently to the Gulf region.  The absence of able-bodied farm labor, continuation of traditional irrigation 
practice, and limited exposure to modern agriculture practices, have led to reduced farm production.  
Existing farmers are generally unable to benefit from existing modern technologies and inputs. 
 
6. The pressing priority is thus to improve agricultural productivity and foster diversification towards

high-value products to secure food security for a growing population and to improve rural incomes. 
 
Public investment in improving irrigation is becoming paramount for transforming the agriculture sector  
 
7. The frail mountain terrain limits the agricultural potential area to 2.641 million hectares (ha), of which 
1.77 million ha has irrigation potential.  Irrigation systems in Nepal fall under four distinct categories: (1) 
traditional farmer-managed irrigation systems (FMIS) developed and managed by the communities; (2) a 
range of small to large-scale surface systems developed with full or partial support from the government; (3) 
government-developed tube-well irrigation schemes; and (4) individually-owned and operated tube wells 
and pumps, mostly utilizing shallow aquifers, streams, ponds, and dug wells.  
 
8. At present, the total irrigated area stands at 1.39 million ha of which only 42% has year-round 
irrigation.  There is limited new land that can be brought under farming as most of the economically-suitable 
lands for agriculture have already been exploited, mainly because of the substantial increase in Nepal’s 
population in the past century, with the exception of some potential horizontal expansion in newly-irrigated 
lands of around 0.35 million ha through investing in inter-basin transfers (see government policy below). 
Thus the largest potential for increasing production is by providing better agricultural inputs and assuring 
irrigation to the already-existing cultivated land, namely, a “vertical expansion”.  Modern agricultural 
practices require crop diversification, high-yielding varieties, improved fertilization, and reliable year-round 
irrigation.    
 
9. Of the aforementioned improvements, improving irrigation is critical to agriculture both during the 
monsoon season to overcome the periods of dry spells as well as during the dry season when rainfall is 
negligible.  Agriculture is becoming even more vulnerable to water due to the erratic monsoon rain.  Even 
when recently precipitation during the monsoon has reached 90 to 110 percent of its long-term average 
after two years of low rainfall, farmers get unreliable rainfall with both droughts and intense rainfall/floods 
often occurring in same season.  Thus, transforming the agriculture sector requires upgrading the irrigation 
systems to regulate the irrigation supply.  Only by mobilizing public funding to invest in effective irrigation 
systems, farmers could then focus on the complementary inter-farm/farm-level investments such as 
improving agricultural techniques and inputs and cropping intensity, thus leading to transforming farming to 
more profitable levels. 
 
Government Irrigation Policy and Irrigation Development Program.   
 
10. The Government of Nepal (GoN) has thus recognized the lack of intensive cropping, inadequate 
supply and use of basic agricultural inputs such as fertilizer and improved seeds, and problems with 
deteriorated and inefficient irrigation systems.  
 
11. The Agriculture Perspective Plan (APP) assigns the first priority to accelerating agricultural growth 
through concentrated investment in irrigation. Also one of the key management goals of the APP is to 
expand farmer ownership and operation of irrigation schemes as irrigation is vital to the national 
agricultural production and economic transformation.

Basic Tenets of Irrigation Policy 2013

 
12. The Department of Irrigation (DoI) is the lead agency in Nepal tasked with developing and improving 
irrigation infrastructure.  The primary effort of DoI has been to design and implement irrigation 
infrastructure to provide irrigation to potential new areas and also to intervene in existing schemes to 
improve their irrigation efficiency and sustainability. 
 
13. The GoN’s strategy for irrigation development and management is reflected in the Water Resources 
Strategy (2002), National Water Plan (2005), Irrigation Development Vision and Action Plan (2006), and 
recently, the Irrigation Policy (2013

1
, Figure below).   The main vision described in these documents is to 

integrate agriculture and irrigation development in order to realize the full benefits from investment in 
irrigation and provide sustainable services to the agriculture sector through well-operating irrigation 
facilities, based on local resources mobilization through a partnership of the users and the government. 
There is an emphasis on: (i) provision of year-round irrigation services to increase the productivity of 
irrigated agriculture and extending the cropping seasons; (ii) the need for a service-oriented management 
approach as a means for providing more reliable and flexible water services to farmers; and (iii) the 
progressive shifting of operation and maintenance (O&M) costs to water users to enhance efficiency, equity, 
and sustainability.   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14. As GoN internalized the concept of year-round irrigation through its Nepal Water Resource Strategy 
(2002) and National Water Plan (2005), the DoI aimed to provide year-round irrigation to vast potential 
areas to boost crop production, leading to food self-sufficiency, employment generation and poverty

 Entitled the “Irrigation Policy for 2070” in reference to the Bikram Sambat (BS 2070) which corresponds to 2013 AD. The policy was approved on July 13, 2013.

reduction.  There are four themes under this DoI goal:  
a) Rehabilitation of existing FMISs;   

b) Design and construction of new irrigation schemes (including the ongoing MoRJKIP and its proposed 
phase 2);   

c) Improve the agency-managed large-scale irrigation projects and handover their management to 
beneficiary farmers (the so called, Irrigation Management Transfer (IMT)), either fully or below the main-
canal level; and  

d) Expand the irrigation area horizontally through investing in “inter-basin water transfers”. 

15. The Tables below reflect some of the DoI target indicators for the next five years, in incremental areas 
and crop yields.

of medium to small schemes (below 300 ha in hills and below 2,000 ha in Terai) are implemented by the 
Medium Irrigation Project (MIP) and the Non-Conventional Irrigation Technology Project (NITP).  At present, 
the MIP has about 250 new irrigation projects in the pipeline with a combined cultivable command area 
(CCA) of approximately 37,000 ha and the NITP has in the pipeline about 732 small new projects especially 
in the hills/mountains with combined CCA of about 8,450 ha.  The DoI intends to continue the development 
of feasible new irrigation schemes in the future.  In addition, the DoI has started the use of solar energy to 
pump blue water to adjoining river terraces for irrigation.  This activity has already been initiated along the 
Bheri corridor and is under consideration for the Babai river, and the DoI intends to expand its use to all 
feasible areas.    
 
17. The Rani Jamara Kularia scheme (the ongoing Bank-financed Phase 1 and the proposed Phase 2) is 
amongst the largest schemes in the entire country under the category of new schemes, and it benefits one 
of the poorest areas in the Tarai in south west of the Karnali river basin.    

 
Farmer Organizations and Participatory Irrigation Management (or “Joint Participatory Management”, JPM) 
18. Nepal has a long tradition of farmer-managed irrigation systems (FMISs) in the hills, mountains, and 
the Terai.  The FMISs cover about 70 percent of the 1.2 million ha of land with some form of irrigation 
infrastructure in the country. The hill FMISs are generally small in size compared to the FMISs in the medium 
to large irrigation systems in the Terai.  A strong sense of ownership and hierarchical management system 
exists in the FMISs.  They often exist in some form of Water Users Associations/Groups (WUA/WUG), tasked 
with operation and maintenance (O&M) of the schemes, most of which is done through labor contribution.    
 
19. However, improving irrigation services in the existing FMIS schemes requires a combination of 
“hardware” and “software” solutions.  The former involves rehabilitating and modernizing existing irrigation 
and drainage infrastructure to improve reliability of supply and expand the system of secondary and tertiary 
canals.   The latter requires the development of more efficient mechanisms for managing the irrigation 
systems down to the field level, through a clear delineation of responsibilities between the government and 
the WUAs in charge of delivering irrigation services to farmers.  There is also a need to pool funding through 
government and users contributions for O&M and asset replacement over time. 

 
 

Relationship to CPF 
 

20. The proposed project is consistent with the Nepal Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY 2014–18 to 
support poverty reduction and shared prosperity in Nepal. The proposed project is aligned with the Pilar 2 of CPS 
– Increasing Inclusive Growth and Opportunities for Shared Prosperity. The proposed project aims to improve 
agriculture and water productivities through modernizing or rehabilitating the lower-order irrigation 
infrastructure, strengthening WUA, and implementing a comprehensive agricultural improvement program (CPS 
Outcome 2.1).  
 
21.  In line with the CPF, the Bank has been engaged in the irrigation and WRM sector through two lending 
projects, namely: (1) Irrigation and WRM Project, which is a collaboration of the Agriculture and Water Global 
Practices (IWRMP, IDA US$114m, closing in June 2018, targets 26,808 hectares); and (2) Modernization of Rani-

Jamara-Kulariya Irrigation Scheme-Phase 1 (MoRJKIP, IDA US$40m, due to close in September 2017, targets 
14,300 hectares).    The Performance and Learning Review (PLR) of the CPS, conducted in October 2016, has 
indicated that by FY2018 the IWRMP and MoRJKP would increase the area under improved irrigation services by 
a total of 50,000 hectares, and would improve the end-users satisfaction with the performance of the WUAs 
from around 5% to 40%. 
 

 
 
C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  

 
22.  The project development objectives are to improve the irrigation service and to strengthen farmer organizations 
in the irrigated areas of the Rani Jamara Kulariya Irrigation Scheme. 
 

Key Results (From PCN) 

 
PDO indicators:  

 
1. Area provided with new/improved irrigation or drainage services (a Corporate Result Indicator): in hectares. 

2. Farmers reached with agricultural assets or services (a Corporate Result Indicator): in number, with the 
number of females as a supplemental indicator.   

 
D. Concept Description 

 

23.    The proposed operation will focus on modernization of the lower-order irrigation system (sub-branches, 
tertiary canals and water courses) so that irrigation water can reach farmer fields with the optimal flows, 
continuation of the WUA/WUG support program, implementation of a comprehensive agricultural improvement 
program, and support to the river-basin planning process. 
 
24.    The proposed operation is a second phase of the ongoing IDA-supported MoRJKIP.  The ongoing project 
focuses on modernization of the higher-order irrigation infrastructure (intakes, feeder and branch canals, 
including related flood protection), enhancing the capacity of WUAs to operate and maintain the improved/new 
irrigation infrastructure, and preparation and initiation of an agricultural development program.  The MoRJKIP is 
on track toward meeting the PDO.    
 
24.       The proposed phase 2 is very essential in complementing the ongoing phase 1, because of two inter-
related necessities:  
 
1. First, below the main/conveyance system introduced by phase 1, without phase 2 the irrigation distribution 

and application efficiencies would continue to be low compared to the global/regional norms.  Farmers apply 
as much as 2-3 litre/second/ha (the irrigation “hydro-module”) compared to an optimal level of around 1 
litre/second/hectare.  The lack of bulk inter-seasonal water storage needs to be compensated by completing 
the modernization of the system down to the farm level, in order to optimize canal storage and irrigation 
scheduling, thus optimize the root-zone moisture across the crop-growth stages.

2. Second, the WUAs function is not supposed to stop at the main-system level.  There is a need to utilize the 

immense potential for JPM in the Rani-Jamara-Kulariya community, building on the creation and 
empowerment of WUAs attained under the phase 1, so that the WUAs can also have a major role in the 
O&M of the irrigation subsystem down to the farm level.   
  

20. The envisaged project components are as follows:    
 
Component 1, Scheme Modernization (US$58 million, mainly civil works): will support the construction and 
modernization of the lower-order irrigation infrastructure, including the sub-branch canals, tertiary canals, and 
water courses. The activities will include design and execution of irrigation and drainage subsystems below the 
Branch Canals and down to the Field Outlet levels, including not only the irrigation subsystems but also related 
river-training and flood-protection works, collector and tertiary drains, and control structures. 
 

Component 2, Agricultural Production Support and Strengthening Water Users Associations/Groups 
(WUAs/WUGs) (US$6 million): will support: (i) strengthening WUAs/WUGs to assume responsibility for 
management, operation, and maintenance of the modernized system; and (ii) carrying out a series of 
agriculture-based activities in the project area to internalize the gains made in phase 1 and to increase and 
sustain agricultural production through the promotion of water-smart improved farming practices, crop 
diversification, post-harvest support, farmer training through demonstrations and farmer field schools, and 
other adaptive processes. Thus the second phase will adopt value-chain-based approach to support 
agricultural activities.   
 
Component 3, Project Management (US$1 million, including goods, technical assistance and capacity 
building): will support activities to ensure effective project management, including fiduciary and safeguards 
management and monitoring and evaluation.

A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 
 
Located in the Kailali District of the Far Western Development Region, the proposed project will cover eight Village Deve 

lopment Committees (VDC) and Tikapur Municipality. Tikapur Municipality is the main market center in the project area. 
The existing Rani Jamara and Kulariya Irrigation scheme consists of three independent traditional irrigation systems 
constructed, operated and managed by the indigenous Tharu community.  The ethnic composition of the project area 
includes Tharus as the dominant group (48 percent) followed by Chhetri (17 percent), Dalit (15 percent), Brahmin (10 
percent) and others (7 percent).  There are three water users associations and one central committee (federation) that 
has representations of the three WUAs. 
The proposed project is in the Terai (plain) area of Nepal. There are community and state forests in and around the 

project area. Nearest protected area is the Bardiya National Park, which is located across the source river Karnali, in the 
east of the project area. The target area is the 14,300 ha of the Rani, Jamara and Kulariya command area.  Under the 
ongoing phase 1 which focused on the river/ main system level, the Natural Habitats (OP/BP 4.04) has been triggered 
because the Karnali River has protected and endangered aquatic species, including the Gangetic Dolphin, Marsh Mugger, 
and Gharial Crocodile.    Also, the Karnali River corridor (forests) is a wildlife movement route for especially elephant, 
tiger, and rhino.  As some of the phase 1 works have been aligned along the fringes of forest areas, the OP/BP 4.36 on 
Forests was triggered and issues were addressed as part of the Environmental Management Plan.  An Environmental 
Assessment (EA) of the Phase 2 will be commissioned to identify, assess and recommend measures for avoidance, 
minimization, and mitigation of potential adverse environmental impacts as well as to enhance positive impacts related to 
component 1 and component 2 of the project.   
 
The scheme abstracts water from the Karnali River, a major left-bank tributary of the Ganges River. The Karnali River has 

its source in China and flows through Western Nepal into India (where it is called Ghaghara River before it joins the 
Ganges). The Karnali River is thus an international waterway for purposes of OP 7.50.  Due to uncontrolled diversion of 
the Karnali River water into the main canals there is typically excessive water entry, while there is no control of the water. 
The scheme in its current state has very low water use efficiency and large water losses through seepage and water 
logging.  The proposed phase 2 will complement phase 1 in helping to reduce water abstraction from the Karnali River, by 
over 40 percent of the current water abstraction.  There upon, an exception to the notification requirement under OP 
7.50 has been received from South Asia‟ s Regional Vice President on February 24, 2011. A Strategic Environmental and 
Social Assessment (SESA) of the proposed River Basin Management Plan (RBM) will be carried out during implementation. 
 
B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 

 
The DoI is currently implementing MoRJKIP - Phase 1.  During the preparation of the ongoing MoRJKIP – phase 1, Social 

Assessment (SA) and Environmental Assessment (EA) were carried out, based on which DoI prepared Social Impact 
Management Framework (SIMF) and Environmental Management Plan (EMP) to manage social and environmental 
safeguard issues.  The SIMF prepared under Phase 1 includes a policy framework for land acquisition and resettlement, 
along with Vulnerable Community Development Framework, Gender and Social Inclusion Framework to ensure that the 
benefits from the project reaches the indigenous people, vulnerable people, women and other disadvantaged groups.  A 
Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) for the feeder canal was prepared and implemented.  Under Phase 1, private land was 
not affected but a few private structures were affected.  An Indigenous and Vulnerable Community Development Plan 
(IVCDP) was also prepared.  To manage social and environmental safeguard activities, a Senior Sociologist and 
Environmental Specialist have been appointed under Phase 1, yet he started work in a late stage of the project.  The DoI 
have acquired familiarity and experience with Bank’s social and environmental safeguard requirements through the 
ongoing MoRJKIP- Phase 1.  The recent safeguard rating under Phase 1 is moderately satisfactory. Besides the safeguard 

specialist recruited under the project, a Local Environmental Monitoring Committee (LEMC) was formed. LEMC

consisted of representatives from environmental stakeholders in the area such as Bardia National Park, community forest 
users group, district forest and NGO, played positive roles in monitoring and providing advices / guidance with regard to 

environmental management. However, late recruitment of environmental specialists and turnover of the specialist was 
one of the weak points. The absence of specialist service/ support during initial stage and later as well has affected the 
timely support, monitoring, reporting, and implementing the mitigation activities as well as timely coordination with local 

stakeholders, and regularity of the LEMC meetings and awareness activities.   
 
The proposed project, Phase 2, will build on these existing frameworks and their implementation experience to comply 

with the safeguard policies.  The command area is defined, main canal and branch canal have been modernized in the 
Phase I.  An EA will be conducted for the new proposed system and EMP will be drafted accordingly to address 
environmental issues. The proposed project will intervene in the sub-system and inter-farm areas which are closer to 
privately-owned assets and livelihood. However, technical design of the project is yet to be performed, thus the specific 
nature and scale of the social impacts would be known later amid the pre-appraisal stage. Hence, social management 
framework is proposed. Gaps identified and lessons learnt during the implementation of RJKIP Phase I will be considered 
while revising the existing Social Management Framework.

Drona Raj Ghimire, Jun Zeng, Rekha Shreesh 

 
D. Policies that might apply 

 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

Same as phase 1. As the project scope under 
Component 1 and Component 2 includes physical 
construction activities, and agricultural production 
support, potential adverse impacts on the natural 
environment and human health and safety are likely. 
Command area is defined and main and branch canals 
are existing (modernized in Phase I).  Hence, EA and 
EMP will be prepared for the modernization and 
agricultural production activities. EA and EMP, inter 
alia, will cover issues related to labour and labour 
camps, and EHS issues (following World Bank Groups’ 
EHS Guidelines).   

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 Yes 

Was triggered in phase 1 due to working on the main 
system. Karnali and Mohana Rivers are known to have 
important aquatic species (Gangetic Dolphin, Marsh 
Mugger, and Gharial crocodile). Occasional movement 
of wildlife has been reported in the adjoining forests. 
During project preparation, impacts on natural habitat 
and biodiversity will be assessed and appropriate

mitigations as part of EA and EMP, (or if necessary, 
Stand-alone Biodiversity Management Plan) will be 
prepared.  

Forests OP/BP 4.36 Yes 

Was triggered in phase 1 due to working on the main 
system. There are community forests adjoining the 
project command area. Some sections of the main/ 
feeder canal constructed in the Phase I was located in 
the community forests.  In the Phase II, sub-branch 
canals, tertiary canals, inter-farm water courses are 
the main construction works.  These structure are 
away from the forest areas.  Hence, there is less 
chance of adverse impacts on forest. However, during 
preparation of the project, each activity will be 
reviewed to see if the project has potential to cause 
loss or degradation (the health and quality) of forest. 
EA will assess potential impacts and propose 
mitigations, if necessary. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

 
Emphasis of Phase II, under Component 2, is to 

increase and sustain agricultural production by 
carrying out a series of agriculture-based 
activities, adopting value-chain-based approach. 
This may lead to introduction of pesticides or 
increased use of pesticides. During project 
preparation, this will be reviewed thoroughly and 
the EA / EMP will have measures, such as 
Integrated Pest Management, to mitigate adverse 
impacts (or if necessary, separate Pest 
Management Plan will be prepared).    

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 TBD 
This was not triggered in the Phase 1.  The ESIA will 
confirm if the project will affect PCR. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 Yes 

The RJKIP project will be implemented in an area with 
Indigenous ethnic minorities. Tharus, indigenous to 
the area, are in a majority (48 percent) followed by 
other indigenous groups from the hill. The project 
areas are also comprised of other vulnerable groups 
such as Dalits, women-headed households.   
SIMF will comprise a Vulnerable Community 
Development Framework (VCDF) and Gender and 
Social Inclusion Framework to guide planning 
approaches on indigenous peoples (and vulnerable 
groups) and interventions under the project. SA and 
VCDP will be prepared for project locations known by 
appraisal while VCDF will be the guiding document for 
the remaining works.

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

Major issues of land acquisition are unlikely.  However, 
the upgrading works may require small plots of land 
and have impacts on structures requiring relocation.  
Policy framework for land acquisition and 
resettlement will be included as a part of SIMF will 
provide a legal framework on involuntary 
resettlement. If project locations are known by 
appraisal, SA and RAP will be prepared. In other 
remaining works, where project location is not fixed, 
policy framework will be the guiding document in 
preparation of RAP. RAP will include among others 
entitlement matrix, communication strategy and GRM. 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 No 
Same as phase 1. Project does not include 
construction of dam, neither depends on existing dam. 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

Yes 

Was triggered with phase 1 as it focused on works on 
the river and main system.  In phase 2, works on the 
sub-system and inter-farm level are not expected to 
cause any appreciable transboundary water impact.  
The system modernization is expected to reduce water 
abstraction (the hydro-module is currently as high as 3 
liter/sec/hectare) thus will not impact the water 
flowing downstream.  Through a similar rationale 
under phase 1 an exception to the notification 
requirement under OP 7.50 was received from South 
Asia‟ s Regional Vice President on February 24, 2011.  

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No There is no disputed area.

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 

1. Côte d’Ivoire is a lower-middle-income economy with a widening urban/rural gap that hinders the 
achievement of shared prosperity and poverty elimination – With a population of 22.7m, the Gross National 
Income per capita (Atlas method) was US$ 1,420 in 2015, which is 13% lower than the Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) 
regional average (US$ 1,637). Around 54% of its population lives in urban areas, and the population and the 
economy are highly concentrated around the economic capital Abidjan. Rural population in Cote d’Ivoire has 
increasingly suffered from poverty during the last 25 years

1
. Rural poverty has significantly increased since the 

end of the 1980s, and the rural/urban gap has widened. 57% of the rural population is below the national 
poverty line, whereas this rate is 21 percentage points lower for the urban population (36%) and the Northern 
regions are the most afflicted. The widening gap between the North and South of the country help explain why 
Côte d’Ivoire still stands at the 172

nd
 place in the world in the most recent global UNDP-HDI ranking (2016). The 

rural population suffered and still suffers from political crises, deterioration of governance and social services, 
and unstable revenues. At least three main challenges explain the increase in rural poverty over the past 25 
years: (a) political crises; (b) deterioration of governance and social services; and (c) unstable revenues. 

2. The country suffered from a period of civil war from 2002-2004, and a post-election crisis and armed conflict 
from late 2010 to April 2011, that disrupted the economic, social and political cohesion of the country – Côte 
d’Ivoire enjoyed decades of strong economic growth, but the country underwent a series of violent political 
and economic crises during 1999 to 2011 that led to a significant deterioration of living standards. The dismal 
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rates during this period reflect the impact of the crises: on average -1.2% 
during 1999-2003 compared to 3.9% for SSA, 2.0% during 2003-2010 compared to 5.2% for SSA, and -4.4% for 
2011. However, since mid-2011, the country has made significant progress in consolidating political stability 
and post-crisis economic recovery has proceeded at a rapid and sustained speed. Sound macroeconomic 
management combined with public and private investments have underpinned improved economic growth: 
GDP growth rate is on average 9.5% during 2011-2015 (4.3% for SSA). 

3. The rural population has suffered from deterioration of governance and cuts in expenditures in social 
services as well as poor infrastructure – Since the political crises of the year 2000s, the rural population has 
suffered from a combined deterioration in: (i) the governance structure;

 and (ii) cuts in health and education 

expenditure under structural adjustment programs that aimed at reestablishing macroeconomic stability.
3
 The 

infrastructure gap between the more affluent urban areas and the poor rural areas is compelling: 33% of the 
urban population has access to improved sanitation facilities compared to 10% of the rural population; 88% of 
the urban population has access to electricity compared to 29% of the rural population.

 For ICT, 16% of 

households in urban areas has access to the internet compared to only 2% in rural areas.

4. Unstable revenues and poor productivity of the rural economy, especially for agriculture, hinders poverty 
reduction – The agriculture sector is an important driver of Côte d’Ivoire’s economy, accounting for 22% of GDP 
and more than 75% of exports. Three out of four working adults living in rural areas are employed by the

. Despite its critical importance to the economy, the sector has had only a modest impact on 

income growth and poverty reduction in rural areas. The agriculture sector – and especially primary products – 
are highly sensitive to fluctuations in international prices which in turn have an adverse and volatile impact on 
revenues for rural households. 

5. To tackle these challenges, the country has implemented reforms that have significantly contributed to an 
overall improvement in governance and the business environment, making the country more attractive to 
private investment – The country has been a relatively weak performer on the World Bank Ease of Doing 
Business Index DBI (global rank at 142

nd
 out of 189 countries in 2016

7
). Nevertheless, the business environment 

has improved significantly during the last five years – from 177
th

 in 2013 to 142
nd

 in 2016 based on DBI – 
making Cote d’Ivoire one of the ten fastest reforming countries two years in a row (2014 and 2015). The World 
Economic Forum (WEF) Global Competitiveness Index also capture this improvement, whereby Côte d’Ivoire 
rose from 131

st
 in 2012 to 91

st
 in 2015. The authorities will remain focused on improving crucial infrastructure, 

particularly in the energy and transport sectors, but increasing attention will turn to investment in 
communications infrastructure, as well as the education and healthcare system. They will continue to look 
abroad to finance much of the sizeable infrastructure investment that is underway. 

 
Sectoral and Institutional Context 
 

B.1 Rural economy and rural agriculture sectoral 

6. The rural economy is dominated by the agriculture sector, which is mostly made of: (i) export-oriented cash 
crops; and (ii) food crops and animal and fish production for domestic consumption – The cash crops subsector 
is made of cocoa, coffee, rubber, oil palm, cotton, and cashews. Cote d'Ivoire is the world's largest producer 
and exporter of cocoa beans and a significant producer and exporter of coffee and palm oil. Cash crops benefit 
from the bulk of agricultural investment and usually involve more sophisticated production techniques. Cash 
crops suffer from limited value chain integration among farmers, intermediaries and processors, which 
prevents the country from increasing downstream transformation of its food production. Cash crop agriculture 
is potentially lucrative, but it also entails considerable risk, as volatile international commodity markets 
determine export prices. The food crop subsector is made of plantains, yams, cassava, maize, rice, and 
livestock. It is characterized by traditional practices and receives little support from either the public or private 
sectors (except for rice and maize). The relatively strong performance of the food crop subsector is critical to 
food security in Côte d’Ivoire and has enabled the country to become self-sufficient in most key staple crops 
(except for wheat, rice and dairy). This subsector is often neglected in agricultural research and sector 
development strategies, and thus food production tends to be small-scale, traditional, and mostly informal. 
Nevertheless, prices of food crops are less impacted by international price volatility, and compared to cash 
crops often represent greater economic security but tend to offer more limited returns. 

7. The traditional food crops are mostly produced in the poorer Northern regions, whereas the cash crops are 
produced in the richer Southern regions – Adding to the North/South social and economic disparities, the 
country falls into two distinct agricultural regions: the dry savannah in the North and the forest region in the 
South. Rural poverty has traditionally been significantly higher in the North – where the potential for 
agriculture has not yet been realized – whereas the South benefits from higher and more reliable rainfall and 
better soils and produces most of the export crops. However, both the North and South suffer from low

agricultural productivity, high cost of inputs, considerable post-harvest losses, inadequate use of modern 
farming techniques, lack of modernization and mechanization, all contributing to a decline in agricultural 
production.

8
 

8. Rural economy, and especially rural agriculture, suffers from five gaps crippling economic productivity and 
related to: (i) Enabling environment; (ii) Access to land; (iii) Access to finance; (iv) Skills and technology; (v) 
Physical capital – Poor performance in agriculture undermines shared prosperity and poverty elimination, with 
five major gaps hindering the development of the rural agriculture sector:

9
 

a. Gap #1: Lack of accurate data and enabling environment gap – The agriculture sector lacks good and 
accurate data; for example, the latest available National Agricultural Census is now 16 years old (2001). The 
lack of accurate data hinders the elaboration and implementation of sound policies and strategies, and 
prevents the design and conduct of impact evaluation research.

10
 The agriculture sector also suffers from an 

inadequate national and foreign investment framework, and the sector is still severely disadvantaged by a 
distortive policy framework (taxes on export commodities), coupled with a strong urban bias in 
development spending. 

b. Gap #2: Access to land gap – Lack of access to land is a major cause of rural poverty in SSA, and Cote 
d’Ivoire is no exception. Small-scale producers of food crops have access to about half the amount of land 
available to large-scale producers of export crops and they suffer from low productivity because of the 
small size of their lands.

11
 The 1998 Law on Rural Land required farmers to register their land within ten 

years, but very few farmers had the knowledge, means, and skills to do so. A new Law in August 2013 
extended the deadline by ten years, and as of 2014 only 0.09% of the total agriculture land is registered (i.e. 
20k out of 23m hectares). Food insecurity risk is twice higher for farmers not owning property than for land 
owners

12
 and lack of land certificates is worse for women farmers who face additional gender-related 

constraints, including legal or social norms that prevent them from inheriting or simply owning land. 

c. Gap #3 – Access to finance gap – Cote d’Ivoire is one of the least developed countries in the region for rural 
development finance, and there is a lack of financing services for the agriculture sector. Access to credit by 
small farmers is acutely limited due to the virtual absence of financing structures such as rural microfinance 
institutions and rural banks. Moreover, private banks are reluctant to provide loans to rural small-scale 
farmers as they see them as cumulating too many risks: low levels of capitalization, unstable revenue flows, 
lack of formal credit history, difficulty in evaluating small farmers’ repayment capacity, lack of collateral 
such as titled land, the influence of exogenous factors such as weather conditions, and the limited legal 
avenues for enforcing contracts. Where credit is available, interest rates are often too high compared to the 
average rate of return of farmers’ investments. This translates into a low bank account ownership rate and 
a low percentage of adults having the possibility to benefit from a mortgage. The financing obstacle faced

Bank, Côte d’Ivoire SCD – From Crisis to Sustained Growth, 2015 (p.55-66). 
10

 Without much sector impact analysis, the sector has been subjected to ineffective policies including high indirect and direct taxes on export 
commodities which have prevented small farmers from earning more revenues: the 2015 World Bank SCD calculated that a 10 percent decrease 
in the export tax would boost net revenue by 22 percent, which in turn would improve the living conditions of roughly 4 million Ivoirians.  

11
 IFAD, Rural poverty in the Republic of Cote d'Ivoire, accessed in January 2016; World Bank, Côte d’Ivoire SCD – From Crisis to Sustained Growth, 
2015, (p.55): “Agriculture in Cote d’Ivoire is dominated by smallholder farmers, the majority of whom use traditional practices and rely on family 
labor. Data from the most recent Agricultural Census (2001) estimated that there are 8.3 million farmers nationwide, of whom 49 percent are 
women. The average cultivated area for each household is about 3.89 hectares, but 80 percent of households cultivate less than 2 hectares.” ().

by the agriculture sector in Cote d’Ivoire is thus similar to the rest of SSA: only about 1% of commercial 
lending in SSA goes to agriculture, mostly to large-scale farmers.

13
 

d. Gap #4 – Skills and technology gap – In 2011, 62% of teenagers in the Northwest region were unschooled 
compared to the national average of 42%, and only 8% of young people aged 15-24 completed their 
secondary education compared to the national average of 27%.

14
 The combination of low level of education 

and other gaps highlighted above (such as access to finance) leads to a low usage of technology and 
agriculture inputs – such as equipment and fertilizers. Several market failures characterize inputs markets, 
including: inconsistent rules and standards requirements, unrealistic standards, and lack of equipment and 
capacity at the rural level to ensure compliance. Moreover, the cost of technology and agriculture inputs for 
smallholders tend to be too high due to several factors

15
: (i) weak bargaining power of smallholders; (ii) 

poor transportation and energy infrastructure; (iii) lack of market information; (iv) lack of knowledge of 
farmers concerning the use of inputs; and (v) limited access to finance.  

e. Gap #5 – Physical capital gap – While several crops such as cashew (anacarde), maize and tomatoes are 
produced in the Northern regions,  principal markets  destinations are located in the Southern regions, 
including the port of Abidjan for exports and urban domestic markets which sometimes offer greater 
opportunities to smallholders than export markets

16
.: This implies that an efficient transportation network 

must be available throughout the whole territory to link production areas to: (i) the port of Abidjan 
international output market; and (ii) the domestic consumption areas spread around the country. Hence, 
having reliable infrastructures – such as road networks, storage facilities, electricity, and 
telecommunications – is essential to the efficiency of the agriculture sector. However, Cote d’Ivoire’s rural 
infrastructure needs additional investments to be rehabilitated and extended. Currently, as much as 90% of 
the paved network in Cote d’Ivoire is between 15 to 40 years old, while routes coatings are generally 
designed and built for a lifetime of 15 years

17
; as a consequence, about 40 percent of the road network is 

not or only partially useable.
18

 In addition to the lack of reliable roads, the lack of efficient public 
transportation services also hinders the economic development of rural agriculture: smallholders often use 
public transportation such as passenger buses to take their products to distant markets, and this 
inadequate transportation mode leads to bruising and damage to the products, thus reducing its quality 
and market value. The electricity network is no better as all departments of the Northern half of the 
country had coverage rates below the national average in 2011. Among them, five departments had less 
than 15% of their localities connected to electricity

19
. The lack of reliable electricity is an impediment to 

well-functioning rural markets as limited access to storage facilities and unreliable electricity supply result in 
post-harvest losses. Most farmers often rely on open-air storage and need to sell quickly their products – 
sometimes at a significantly low price – before it rots. 

9. Several public and private institutions drive the agriculture sector, generating a fragmented knowledge and 
negatively affecting the efficiency of the government’s action on the sector; the sector would thus strongly 
benefit from a stronger coordination for data and knowledge gathering, sharing, and dissemination – The

agriculture sector is jointly supervised by the Ministère de l’Agriculture et du Développement Rural (MINADER) 
and the Ministère des Ressources Animales et Halieutiques (MIRAH), with the strong implication of the 
Ministère des Eaux et Forêts (MINEFF) and the Ministère de l’Environnement et du Développement Durable 
(MINEDD). The MINADER and MIRAH both have their own internal statistics and planning department: the 
Direction Générale de la Planification, du Contrôle des Projets et des Statistiques (DGPPS, at MINADER) and the 
Direction de la Planification, des Statistiques et des Programmes (DPSP, at MIRAH). The MINADER and MIRAH 
also supervise – with other ministries – several public institutions in charge of agriculture and rural 
development, including the Agence Nationale d’Appui au Développement Rural (ANADER), the Centre National 
de Recherche Agronomique (CNRA), the Fonds Interprofessionnel pour la Recherche et le Conseil Agricole 
(FIRCA), the Office National de Développement de la filière Riz (ONDR), and the Office d’Aide à la 
Commercialisation des Produits Vivriers (OPCV). Several branches of agriculture also have their own 
organizations, including the Chambres d’Agriculture de Côte d’Ivoire, the Association Nationale des 
Organisations Professionnelles Agricoles de Côte d’Ivoire (ANOPACI), the Conseil Café Cacao (CCC), the 
Association des Professionnels de Caoutchouc Naturel de Côte d’Ivoire (APROMAC), etc. The sector would thus 
greatly benefit from a stronger coordination in data and knowledge gathering, sharing, and dissemination. 

10. To address the main gaps to fast and sustainable development of the agricultural sector, the Government has 
developed several strategies, including the National Agricultural Investment Program (NAIP) and the e-
Agriculture Strategy – The NAIP is the agricultural pillar of the country’s National Development Plan (NDP). The 
first NAIP (NAIP #1) was a US$4 billion program over the 2010-2015 period, aimed at promoting a diversified 
mix of strategic cash and food crops for growth and food security. It was organized around six programs: (i) 
crops productivity and competitiveness; (ii) development of agricultural supply chains; (iii) sector governance; 
(iv) capacity building; (v) sustainable management of fisheries; and (vi) rehabilitation of forest and wood 
industry. The government launch the update of the PNIA in October 2016 (PNIA #2) and the final release is 
expected in May 2017. The Government has also developed a comprehensive national e-Agriculture strategy in 
2012, and updated it in 2014. This strategy has the aim of modernizing the country’s agricultural sector and 
enhancing its productivity with an increase in the country’s export of cocoa, coffee and other produce, and a 
decrease in food imports. The strategy requires suitable access to information services and data centers as part 
of an ICT package aiming to make real-time market information systems available via mobile phones and 
tablets. Finally, other sectoral strategies include: (i) the Loi d’orientation agricole (Loi n° 2015-537 du 20 juillet 
2015); the Stratégie Nationale de Développement de la filière Riz 2012-2020 (SNDR); the Plan Stratégique de 
Développement de l’Elevage, de la Pêche et de l’Aquaculture (PSDEPA 2014-2020); the Stratégie Nationale de 
Développement de la Mécanisation Agricole (SNDMA); and the Programme National de Sécurisation du Foncier 
Rural (PNSFR). 

 
B.2 Digital economy sectoral and institutional context 

11. The ICT institutions and the enabling environment have drastically improved during the last five years thanks 
to the creation and revamping of key institutions and the introduction of new legal and regulatory 
frameworks – Overall, the ICT enabling environment has drastically improved during the last five years. Each 
year, the World Economic Forum (WEF) performs a global ranking of the ICT sector in each country by 
measuring the Network Readiness Index (NRI). One sub-index of the NRI is the ‘ICT Environment sub-index’ 
reflecting both the ‘Political and regulatory environment’ and the ‘Business and innovation environment’. In 
2012, Côte d’Ivoire ranked as one of the worst country in the world regarding the ‘ICT Environment sub-index’, 
being at the 130

th
 place (out of 142 countries). In less than 5 years, Côte d’Ivoire has risen at the 72

nd
 place (out 

of 139 countries) in 2016 for the ‘ICT Environment sub-index’ (on the overall Network Readiness Index, Côte 



 
The World Bank

Mar 31, 2017 Page 8 of 17  

     

d’Ivoire has risen from 122
nd

 to 106
th

 during 2012-2016): no other country monitored by the WEF has enjoyed 
such a drastic rank increase during the 2012-2016 period for the ‘ICT Environment sub-index’. 

12.  The major improvement of the international ranking of the ICT sector in Côte d’Ivoire is partly explained by 
several reforms lead by the five main institutions that drive and supervise the ICT sector – The Ministère de 
l’Economie Numérique et de la Poste (MENuP) is the Ministry in charge of the ICT and digital economy in Côte 
d’Ivoire, and the MENuP has revamped the telecom law in 2012.

20
 The legislation is now aligned with regional 

recommendations and covers major areas such as convergence, universal service, license and authorizations, 
relevant markets and market power, and consumer protection.

21
 The National Regulatory Authority (NRA) is 

the Autorité de Régulation des Télécommunications de Côte d’Ivoire (ARTCI),
22

 a fully-equipped NRA dealing 
with licensing, consumer protection, wholesale market regulation, and telecom spectrum management. The 
three main additional institutions are: (i) the Agence Nationale du Service Universel des Télécommunications 
(ANSUT) that ensures the implementation of universal service programs on behalf of the state and manage 
investment operations funded by the state in the field of ICT; the Agence Ivoirienne de Gestion des Fréquences 
radioélectriques (AIGF) focused on radio frequency management; and (iii) the Société Nationale de 
Développement Informatique (SNDI), a state-owned company under the supervision of the Prime Minister, in 
charge of Information Technology and Information System projects for the Government.

23
 

13. Although the ICT sector, and especially the mobile sector, is performing well in Côte d’Ivoire, it has mostly 
benefited the affluent urban and educated population – The ICT sector in Cote d’Ivoire has consistently 
expanded during the last few years; it generated a total revenue of 982.5 billion FCFA in 2013 (US$ 1.6 billion), 
contributed to 8% of the country’s GDP, and provided around 5,400 direct jobs and 100,000 indirect jobs.

24
 The 

recent performance of mobile service (voice and SMS) in Côte d’Ivoire has been buoyant, driven by a healthy 
competition among the three main mobile operators (Orange, MTN, and Moov). The mobile connection 
penetration (number of total SIM divided by total population) reached 113% at the end of 2015, compared to 
88% for West Africa region and 77% for Sub-Saharan Africa (Figure 1). Despite these robust mobile service 
performances an important share of the population is still offline. As of 2014, only 4% of interviewed 
individuals stated that they have an internet access at home compared to an average of 12% for SSA (Gallup 
survey). The World Bank indicator ‘Internet users’ (percentage of the population that have used the internet – 
from any location and with any type of device – during the last 12 months) show that only 21% of the 
population of Cote d’Ivoire has accessed internet at least once during the previous 12 months in 2015, 
compared to an average of 22% for SSA and 29% for lower-middle-income countries (Figure 2). Moreover, the 
use of internet – mostly through mobile broadband, as fixed broadband connectivity is marginal – is 
concentrated in the most affluent, educated and urban population centers. 15% of the Cote d’Ivoire urban 
population uses internet on a weekly basis, but this rate drops to only 3% for the rural Cote d’Ivoire population 

                                            
20

 Until 2012 the main legislation covering the telecommunication sector was the Law No. 95-526 of 7 July 1995 (Code des Télécommunications); as 
this legislation was outdated, it was fully revamped by the Ordonnance n° 2012-293 of 21 march 2012. 

21
 Moreover, the Government has introduced a tax break for the ICT sector in August 2015 with a VAT exoneration and reduced custom duties for 
ICT and electronic equipment, and this measure should last until the end of 2018 (cf. Abidjan.net, Les prix des ordinateurs, tablettes, téléphones 
portables vont baisser en Côte d’Ivoire, November 2015). 

22
 The ARTCI was created in 2013 by merging two institutions, the previous Agence des Télécommunications de Cote d’Ivoire (ATCI) – in charge inter 
alia of telecom spectrum management, licensing, and wholesale pricing – and the Conseil des Télécommunications de Côte d’Ivoire (CTCI) – in 
charge inter alia of monitoring the market competition dynamics, ensuring the compliance with the license obligations, and solving litigations. 

23
 In 2011, the Government adopted the e-GOUV scheme, which consists of two major axes – e-Administration and e-Services. The SNDI is working 
to implement ICT solutions in all government activities, including finance, health care, and education, with the goal of providing, by the year 
2020, all government services available online in developed countries (cf. IDAL, ICT Ivory Coast market, 2015, p.6).

14. On the supply side, there are significant mobile coverage gaps for rural areas – The regulator ARTCI has 
identified that 48% of the 8,518 localities (localités) in Côte d’Ivoire were not covered by any mobile service; 
the uncovered localities represent 23% of the total population. Mobile operators have confirmed that they 
reached their profitability frontier and that extending their coverage would not be sufficiently profitable at this 
stage due to: (i) the lower population density in rural areas which increases the Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) per 
subscriber; and (ii) the lower purchasing power of subscribers which drives down the Average Revenue Per 
User (ARPU). Mobile broadband coverage with 3G is even worse, with coverage maps showing vast swaths 
without any coverage (. To counter this market failure, the ANSUT is currently deploying a national 7,000 km 
long fibre backbone to cover rural areas, and ARTCI is elaborating a “white zone” program to increase rural 
coverage. However, this will be insufficient to achieve mobile broadband coverage for all as the number of 
mobile sites should be at least tripled: each operator has deployed between 1,600 and 2,000 mobile sites in 
Côte d’Ivoire, a relatively low number compared to European countries that achieved acceptable level of 
coverage and services (in Romania, a country that is 30% smaller in area and with a similar population size, the 
regulator calculated that 6,000 sites were required to cover 99% of the population).

Relationship to CPF 
 

15. The proposed project is designed to contribute to the World Bank Group’s twin goals of ending extreme 
poverty and boosting shared prosperity – The project will help the country achieve the twin objectives through 
promoting agricultural growth which is inclusive of smallholder farmers. The proposed project is consistent 
with the Bank’s CPF (FY16-FY19), and especially with ‘Focus Area One: Accelerating sustainable private sector‐
led growth’ which comprises four objectives that the project will directly or indirectly support. 

16. The e-agriculture project will directly contribute to two objectives of the CPF regarding (i) agriculture and (ii) 
infrastructure – (i) The project will contribute to ‘Objective #1: Improve Productivity in Agriculture/Agribusiness 
Value Chains’. Unpredictable weather patterns, unreliable pricing information and crop failure due to diseases 
are a few of the issues that digital services could tackle in Côte d’Ivoire. The project will directly support the 
objective of improving productivity by promoting digital solutions that will: (a) empower smallholder farmers to 
access information and markets, leading to increase in productivity and sales, and reduction in post-harvest 
loss; and (b) enable public institutions to collect and gather agricultural and rural statistics to drive public policy 
and strategy. (ii) The project will also contribute to ‘Objective #2: Strengthen Economic Infrastructure’. By 
extending ICT connectivity in rural areas, the project will directly enhance digital infrastructure and provide 
workarounds to inadequate logistics services. This will positively impact rural agriculture and economy by 
enabling easier access to consumer markets at competitive costs.

17. The project will also indirectly contribute to two objectives of the CPF regarding (i) business environment and 
(ii) access to land – (i) ‘Objective #3: Improve Business Regulatory Framework and Access to Finance’ will be 
supported by extending the reach of ICT connectivity and facilitating the digitization of economic transactions. 
The spreading of ICT will support both: (a) the increase in mobile banking usage; and (b) the promotion of 
private sector growth with the ability for smallholders to get a credit with traditional banks thanks to a track 
record on which their financial performance can be assessed. (ii) ‘Objective #4: Formalize and Enhance 
Regulatory Access to Land for Business and Agriculture’ will also be supported thanks to the development of ICT 
platforms providing cheap and reliable tools to register land and deliver land certificates. Enhancing the 
registering process of land is fundamental to improve land security and support informed land transactions for 
both smallholders and private investors, and are a prerequisite for shared growth.  

18. The proposed project will leverage ongoing Bank operations in Côte d’Ivoire – The Bank has also been 
supporting the country’s agricultural strategy implementation through the sub-regional West Africa Agricultural 
Productivity Program (WAAPP), which is being implemented in 13 countries of the Economic Community of 
West African States (ECOWAS). The development objective of the Program is to generate and accelerate the 
adoption of improved technologies in the participating countries’ top agricultural commodity priority areas that 
are aligned with the sub-region’s top agricultural commodity priorities, as outlined in the Economic Community 
of West Africa Agriculture Program (ECOWAP). Other development partners such as the International Fund for 
Agriculture Development (IFAD), FAO, the African Development Bank (AfDB) and others have been 
implementing similar projects in support of the sector strategy. 

 
C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  

 

 
 
To improve access to affordable broadband in rural communities and leverage electronic platforms to improve farm 
productivity and access to markets. 

 
Key Results (From PCN) 

 

19. The key results expected from the proposed project are: 

a. Coverage of ICT services is significantly increased in targeted areas, and ICT usage (voice, SMS, and internet 
access) is significantly increased in targeted areas for local public and administrative institutions, 
businesses, and population – including vulnerable population (women); 

b. Digital solutions for rural development are made available, with electronic platforms being operational and 
used by: (i) public administrative services in charge of monitoring and informing rural development policies; 
and (ii) end users such as smallholders. 

c. As a result of increased use of digital solutions, smallholders in targeted area benefit from an increase in: (i) 
yields of selected crops (volume of production per ha or per smallholder); (ii) volume of sales of selected 
crops; and (iii) the reduction in postharvest losses by selected producer organizations supported by the 
project.

20. The Project will assess the number of ‘beneficiaries’ with a breakdown between both individuals (disaggregated 
by gender) and establishments (disaggregated by central public administrations, local government and public 
administrations, and local businesses). The project will use the following PDO indicators: 

a. Number of beneficiaries accessing mobile communication services (voice and SMS); 

b. Number of beneficiaries accessing the internet; 

c. Share of production of target crops marketed by selected smallholders supported by the project; 

 
 
D. Concept Description 

 

21. To achieve the Project Development Objectives, the proposed project follows an integrated transformational 
solutions approach with three components: 

a. Component #1 ICT Infrastructure – Extending the coverage of ICT services in rural areas, and thereby 
improving the number of individuals, public administrations, and businesses that will be able to access both 
mobile services (voice and SMS) and the internet to improve productivity; 

b. Component #2 Digital services for rural development – Stimulating the development of digital services for 
rural development (with an emphasis on e-Agriculture), improving public service delivery in rural areas, and 
encouraging development of local content, applications, and services, through the setting up of electronic 
platforms and the creation of business incubators; 

c. Component #3 Project implementation – Project management, coordination, monitoring, and evaluation. 

22. Component 1 ICT Infrastructure – Component 1 will contribute to achieving the PDO by increasing coverage of 
ICT services. The coverage increase will be done through a subsidy to investment in connectivity. Depending on 
the targeted region and community, the PPP model will be adjusted. Among the public subsidy options, and 
based on ad hoc economic analysis, the project will subsidize: (i) the rollout of a Radio Access Network (RAN) 
mobile infrastructure focused on passive elements (i.e., towers and energy solutions). The towers will be 
sufficiently dimensioned to ensure that all mobile operators in Côte d’Ivoire can use the passive RAN to install 
their own active elements (i.e. base stations and transmitters) to improve coverage of their network and 
provide voice, SMS, and data services to the offline population; and (ii) the rollout of backhaul segments. The 
fiber optic links will be deployed either through OPGW when available, or buried along roads to points closer to 
the targeted communities. The private operators will then deploy the last mile (e.g. RAN). Because this 
component implies the subsidy of an ICT infrastructure, the identification of target areas (where the passive 
RAN will be deployed) and project design (how they will be deployed) will comply with a set of criteria in line 
with international best practices to maximize “value for money” and support the overarching twin goals of 
shared prosperity and poverty elimination (cf. below Section B). 

23. Regions identified as priority for Component 1 through the selection criteria – Three districts have been 
identified by the client as priority for component 1: (i) District of Denguélé; (ii) District des Savanes; (iii) and the 
Bounkani Region (District of Bouna). These three district are particularly affected by low connectivity and 
productivity issues (see Figure 5 & Figure 6 above). 

24. Component 2 Digital services for rural development – Component 2 will contribute to achieving the PDO with 
two sub-components: 



 
The World Bank  
Digital Solutions for Sustainable Development (P160418) 

 
 

  
Mar 31, 2017 Page 13 of 17  

     

a. Sub-component 2.1 – Help improve the performance of the rural development public institutions in Côte 
d’Ivoire in gathering relevant, detailed, and recent data to monitor the rural economy and assist in shaping 
public policy; 

Sub-component 2.2 –Provide digital solutions to smallholders for selected crops that will increase crop 
yields, increase volumes of sales, reduce post-harvest loss, and improve market linkages. To that effect, a 
comprehensive program of activities will be implemented under this component that will be geared at: (i) 
improving the outreach and quality of crop extension and advisory services by strengthening the skills of 
public extension workers, promoting ICT in agricultural extension services, and supporting farmer-to-
farmer extension; (ii) developing farmers’ skills to scale-up the dissemination of Good Agricultural Practices 
(GAPs); and (iii) fostering the emergence of a digital innovation ecosystem aimed at providing local content, 
applications, and services for rural development through the creation and leveraging of e-Government 
platforms. The project will specifically aim at incubators and local labs training young women in 
coding/programming, as well as entrepreneurship in general. 

25. Regions and value-chains identified as priority for Component 2 through the selection criteria – Value-chains 
identified by the Ministry of Agriculture as priorities (with an emphasize on staple food) for this component 
are: (a) maze, manioc, rice; (b) plantain, yam (igname); and (c) poultry. Taking into account the regions where 
these value-chains are predominant, the component will target the following districts and regions: regions 
already included in Component 1 – District of Denguélé, District des Savanes, and the Bounkani Region (District 
of Bouna) – plus the District of Sassandra-Marahoué, and the District of Gôh-Djiboua. These crops fall to a large 
extent under the informal agriculture sector. Producers and farmers for these crops are predominantly women.

  SAFEGUARDS 

 
A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 

 
In terms of infrastructure, the project will target exclusively the three Districts of the northern part of the country: 

District of Denguélé, District of Savanes, and District of Bouna. As part of component 1, the project will finance the 
construction of towers (passive infrastructure) and/or bury fiber optic links. In the case of fiber optic , the fiber will be 
buried along roads or railways, or installed on the ground cable of power lines. Therefore, the fiber optic infrastructure 
will be installed along existing infrastructure, with negligible impact on the environment and the population. Regarding 
the towers, some towers may be installed on private properties depending on the site and expected coverage. However, 
it is again expected that the installation of towers will have negligible impact on the environment, and minimal impact on 
the neighboring communities. Analysis will be carried out on a case by case basis. For the second component project will 
be implemented in the following areas: (i) District of Denguélé; (ii) District des Savanes; (iii) the Bounkani Region (District 
of Bouna); (iv) District of Sassandra-Marahoué; (v) and the District of Gôh-Djiboua 
 
B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 

 
There are considerable legal and institutional frameworks in the country to ensure compliance with World Bank 

safeguards policies triggered by the proposed project. In Cote d’Ivoire, the Ministry of Sanitation, Environment, and 
Sustainable Development (MINSEDD) is responsible for setting policy guidelines on environmental issues and ensuring 
compliance with national environmental standards. It has different departments among which the National Agency of 
Environment (ANDE, Agence Nationale de l’Environnement) in charge of safeguards compliance of all projects in the 
country. The unit is well staffed and its capacities are acceptable. Based on the preliminary borrower assessment, the 
Agency (ANDE) has sustained resources to carry out the oversight of the safeguards performance during implementation. 
With regard to the PIU, capacity building efforts to support project implementation will be done by implementing 
recommendations contained in the safeguards instruments prepared for the project. The project will also receive 
guidance from the Bank’s environmental and social specialists in the Project team.

infrastructures and the deployment of fiber optic. 
These constructions may entail potential adverse 
impacts on the environmental components. However, 
as the exact locations of those activities are unknown 
to date, an Environmental and Social Management 
Framework (ESMF) will be developed, reviewed, 
consulted upon and disclosed both within Cote 
d’Ivoire and at the World Bank’s Website prior to the 
Decision meeting. 

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 No 
The project activities will not be implemented in areas 
hosting natural habitats. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No 
The project will not support activities related to forest 
exploitation or management or might have potential 
adverse impacts on forested areas. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 No The project does not involve pest management 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 Yes 

Activities supported by the ongoing bank’s funded 
operation such as the construction of towers, ICT 
infrastructures and the deployment of fiber optic will 
unquestionably involve excavations with possibilities 
to discover Physical cultural resources. However, the 
triggering of this policy does not entail the preparation 
of a specific safeguard instrument. Only a specific 
chapter will be included in the ESMF to provide 
guidance in case physical cultural resources will be 
discovered. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 No 
The Project location does not cover Indigenous 
Peoples as defined by the World bank 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

These planned interventions are not expected to lead 
to significant land acquisition or significant restriction 
of access to sources of livelihood. However, the 
implementation of the pools or antenna my lead to 
lands acquisition. Therefore, a Resettlement Policy 
Framework (RPF) will be prepared for the activities 
triggered by the OP 4.12  as a due diligence given that 
the specific sites or impacts of envisioned physical 
investments are not known, The  Resettlement Policy 
Framework (RPF) consistent with OP 4.12 will be 
prepared by the Borrower, reviewed and cleared by 
the team and disclosed in-country and at Bank 
InfoShop prior to appraisal. The RPF will be used as a 
guide to conduct specific Resettlement Action Plans 
(RAPs) as needed, as they relate to land acquisition 
and loss of economic activities issues, as well as 
compensation measures to minimize negative impacts 
on Project Affected People (PAPs).

B.   Introduction and Context

Country Context
Between 2010 and 2014, the overall economy grew at 7.7 percent and the extractive industry 
grew at 25 percent , making the DRC one of Africa's fastest growing economies. Extractive 
industry exports account for about 95 percent of DRC➢❨ s exports.  While mining revenues have 
contributed to strong macroeconomic growth and poverty reduction, high export concentration 
exposes the country to exogenous shocks and instability .  The recent trends of falling world 
commodity prices, lower export revenues, and the associated slow-down in DRC➢❨ s mining 
sector have contributed to a tight fiscal environment. In this context, the government has placed 
significant priority to economic diversification and has identified the Agriculture sector, 
DRC➢❨ s second biggest sector- as a key sector for expanding its export base and buffering the 
economy against oil price shocks. 
 
Despite high rates of macroeconomic growth, poverty and malnutrition remains widespread in 
DRC.  The national poverty rate is 64 percent, with poverty rates only slightly higher in rural 
areas (65 percent) relative to urban areas (62 percent). Almost one quarter of children are 
underweight. In rural areas, deficiencies in food storage and market access create seasonal food 
shortages. In urban areas, import tariffs (commonly 10 percent) and low domestic production, 
thus requiring sizable food imports, result in food prices that are amongst the highest in Africa.  
About six million people are classified as food insecure in the country. 
 
Climate change will exacerbate droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events. Although the 
Congo basin seems to be less exposed than dryer parts of Africa, Congolese farmers are 
particularly poor and isolated, therefore vulnerable to climate impacts and other external shocks. 
 
In addition, DRC is undergoing a process of decentralization. Last year, the number of provinces 
officially grew from 11 to 26. Equateur Province, where PARRSA is located, has been sub-
divided into five new Provinces, three of them falling under the project area (Sud Ubangi, Nord 
Ubangi, and Mongala). Within the decentralization process, the provincial services of the 
ministries are being revitalized to better serve the rural population. However, some new provinces 
lack the structures and fiscal resources to function independently. Consequently there is a need for 
new investments, including agriculture investments, to make these new provinces more fiscally 
secure. 
 
Socio-Political System. Following the African Union led dialogue, the 2016 elections were 
postponed and a second more inclusive dialogue led by the Conference Episcopale Nationale du 
Congo (CENCO) is still underway but has already achieved an agreement for a new government 
of national unity and a commitment from the President to not run for a third term. Presidential 
elections are expected to be held in December 2017, but this date has been viewed as not credible. 
The majority of the provinces are under-resourced (human and financial) and ill equipped. As a 
result, the majority of the provinces have increased taxes in order to cover their operational costs. 
Democratic process in the DRC faces a myriad of challenges, including a legacy of exploitation 
and conflict, lack of physical and communications infrastructure, extreme poverty and continuing 
pockets of insecurity.

Governance system, conflict and institutional fragility. The factors blocking an economic 
development in the country include: (a) a crisis resulting from contested 2011 election results; (b) 
weak governance; and (c) the weakness of state institutions in implementing appropriate policies. 
As a result, the agricultural sector is operating in an environment of fragile socio-political context, 
low quality human capacity with an outdated skills base, an unattractive business environment, 
rent based economy with low agricultural productivity, dilapidated infrastructure and under 
developed service markets (agricultural inputs, logistics services, financial services). 
 
Enabling environment and tax burden. The macroeconomic indicators for the country have 
remained relatively stable with annual inflation stable at 1.6 percent over the past 5 years. Real 
interest rates have remained at about 17 percent. This is illustrative of a business enabling 
environment which is characterized by: (i) high import taxes; (ii) high sales taxes; (iii) unofficial 
taxes levied across road, rail, river and air transport; (iii) high port handling fees; (iii) unreliable 
electricity supply; (iv) corruption; (v) ➢❨ red tape➢❨  bureaucratic procedures that make it more 
costly to close a transaction or sell a product; and (vi) very high logistical hurdles and costs. In 
addition, the agricultural sector has outdated laws and regulations on seed, land, food quality and 
control. Because of poor transport infrastructure, it is much harder to reach markets and the net 
effect is reduced competitiveness of domestically produced products in local, national and 
regional markets. Under-developed input markets and fragmented value chains further reduce the 
competitiveness of locally produced commodities, but itpresents opportunities for private 
investors.
Sectoral and institutional Context
Agriculture currently accounts for about 20 percent of GDP and employs some 70-75 percent of 
the economically active population. Related agro-industries employ another 10 percent of the 
population. Jobs in agriculture tend to be informal, with low value added per worker (US$227/
year ), often providing only for subsistence. Agriculture and other sectors are hampered by the 
fact that DRC is recovering from more than 15 years of civil war, which has created serious 
infrastructure and institutional vacuums. The country faces systematic challenges in its business 
environment and enabling services such as rural connectivity, power infrastructure, and extension 
systems. Public spending is constrained by weak budgetary processes, inefficiencies, and poor 
coordination. 
 
The Government➢❨ s objective is to reduce rural poverty by 2020 by restoring and modernizing 
agricultural production systems, improving nutrition and food security, and mobilizing significant 
public and private sector investments. In recent years, agriculture has become a top priority for 
DRC Government as evidenced by the allocation of 8 percent of total budget in 2016 (up from 3 
percent) in line with the Africa Heads of State Maputo Declaration. The 2013 Programme 
National d➢❨ Investissements Agricoles (PNIA), with a total estimated cost of US$5.7 billion 
over seven years, builds upon five pillars: (i) fostering value chains and agribusiness; (ii) 
achieving food security; (iii) enhancing research, extension, and training; (iv) improving sector 
governance, gender participation and institutional capacity; and (v) adapting to climate change. In 
2014, the Government launched the agro industrial park strategy to boost agribusiness and 
agroindustry, and attract private investments in the sector. 
 
The proposed AF project is aligned with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for DRC as it 
aims at contributing significantly to the Government➢❨ s efforts to alleviate extreme poverty and 
malnutrition (MDG1). It is also fully aligned with the fourth outcome of the CAS FY13-16, 



Page 4 of 13

addressing fragility through ➢❨ increased agriculture productivity and production and access to 
markets➢❨ . It is also consistent with major strategic initiatives for DRC, the Great Lakes region, 
and sub-Saharan Africa, including the second pillar (vulnerability and resilience) of the World 
Bank➢❨ s Africa Strategy and Africa Climate Business Plan. By supporting the development of 
agricultural value chains with strong economic potential, the proposed AF project is in line with 
the national strategy of DRC and the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program 
(CAADP). 
 
Several policy documents govern the agriculture sector, including the National Agriculture 
Investment Plan (NAIP), the Agricultural Code, a new proposal for Integrated Rural Development 
Centers, and the Agro-industrial Action Plan. In practice, ownership of these policies at the 
provincial level ➢❨  and even occasionally at the central level ➢❨  is low.  There is weak 
coordination and harmonization across the different policies and implementing agencies, and 
human, technical, and financial capacity to implement agricultural strategies is poor. 
 
DRC➢❨ s green revolution will require a technological leapfrog combined with progress on 
cross-cutting infrastructure, institutional and business climate issues in order to facilitate private 
investment and access to markets. From an operational perspective, DRC➢❨ s green revolution 
would pursue a two-track approach: (i) enabling traditional small-scale farmers to transition from 
subsistence farming to small holder commercial farming ; and (ii) promoting private investment 
in commercial agriculture using modern technologies geared toward mechanized farming and 
agro-processing for domestic and regional markets. 
 
DRC➢❨ s agro-industrial action plan (2015) proposes to privatize several government-owned 
farms, establish agro-industrial parks across all provinces, and has identified 60 abandoned   
farms for development. A focus on large commercial farms has the advantage of tackling many 
constraints simultaneously to promote faster growth in a challenging environment, albeit in a 
limited geographical area. Concentrating resources and political will in specific commercial zones 
can also serve to demonstrate the benefits of specific policy interventions, so that these could be 
scaled up.  Furthermore, incorporating smallholders into agro-industrial revitalization schemes 
will be critical for promoting peace, stability, and inclusive growth.

C.  Proposed Development Objective(s)

Original Project Development Objective(s) - Parent
The project development objective (PDO) is to increase agricultural productivity and improve 
marketing of crops, and animal products by smallholder farmers in targeted areas.

Proposed Project Development Objective(s) - Additional Financing
To increase agricultural productivity and improve marketing of crops and animal products crops 
and animal products in targeted areas.

Key Results 

D.  Project Description

The proposed Additional Financing will provide additional resources to reinforce the basic 
production capacity (staple crops and livestock) of smallholder farmers in three provinces to 



Page 5 of 13

ensure food and nutrition security, relaunch the perennial crops production and embark on 
commercial farming by selling surplus production on local markets. The AF will support the re-
emergence of a sustainable mixed farming system which is prevalent in the project areas. It will 
also revamp the extension and advisory services in the project areas giving a more prominent role 
to government institutions and involving the private sector. The AF will also assist the 
Government in setting up a sustainable feeder roads maintenance program and strengthening 
agriculture research and development. The AF will introduce information and communication 
technologies at different levels of the activities to enable mobile banking, remote sensing and 
other innovations to the beneficiaries. It will also expand a demand driven matching grant facility 
and combine it with free technical assistance so different actors can fully participate in the project 
activities. Finally the proposed AF also aims to promote climate adaptation (new technologies and 
management practices) and build community resilience (micro projects storage facilities, 
warehouses, processing centers, nurseries etc.). A partnership with the Central African Forest 
Initiative (CAFI) Fund is to be confirmed. The potential CAFI financing in the amount of US
$3.64 million as a grant would help enhance the environment benefits of the subprojects and 
increase the project efforts to reduce or mitigate deforestation and forest degradation.

Component 3 will support the government efforts to: (i) re-engineer the national agriculture 
extension and advisory services so it is responsive and inclusive (non-governmental 
organizations, private sector and producer organizations as advisory service providers); (ii) 
strengthen the planning, coordination and monitoring and evaluation capacity at national and 
provincial levels (statistics and georeferenced data system); and (iii) strengthen the agricultural 
research and development for efficiency and effectiveness gains in their service delivery and 
conduct a skills needs assessment in the areas of agribusiness and agronomy; (iv) introduce

II. Implementation
Institutional and Implementation Arrangements
The same structure that governed the implementation of the parent project will remain, with a 
National Project Implementation Coordination Unit in Kinshasa and three Project Implementation 
units at provincial level, one per each newly created province. The delegated management contractor 
will be responsible for implementing the infrastructure component with an extension of UNOPS 
contract. For each province, a provincial coordination monitoring committee will be established to 
oversee the project's planning process and implementation.

III. Safeguard Policies that might apply

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional)
Environmental 
Assessment OP/BP 
4.01

Yes Project activities will generate impacts on environment, 
especially the ones relating to the rehabilitation and 
maintenance of feeder roads and construction of key local 
markets. In addition to this, the ongoing operation intends to 
fund sub-projects such as storage facilities, warehouses, 
processing centers, nurseries, etc. These activities will 
unquestionably induce adverse impacts on environmental 
components. However, adverse impacts are expected to be 
moderate, site specific and easily manageable. Besides, the 
exact locations of these investments are unknown to date. 
Consequently, an Environmental and social Assessment 
Framework (ESMF) which is the proper safeguard instrument 
in such a case has been prepared, reviewed, consulted upon 
and disclosed both in DRC on January 13, 2017 and at the 
Infoshop on January 17, 2017.

Natural Habitats OP/
BP 4.04

Yes This policy is triggered in the preventive way because of the 
potential of the project to cause loss or degradation of natural 
habitats, whether directly or indirectly. This policy is also 
triggered to draw attention when activities may be undertaken 



Page 7 of 13

near Natural habitats, with the possibility to impact them. The 
ESMF was prepared in line with the OP/BP4.01 includes a 
section handling this matter.

Forests OP/BP 4.36 Yes The policy on Forests is triggered preventively as the project 
will be implemented in forested areas with the possibility of 
impact on the natural or plantation forests, and/or can bring 
some changes in management or protection of these forests. 
This is to avoid any significant conversion (loss) or 
degradation. This concern was taken in account in the ESMF.

Pest Management OP 
4.09

Yes Activities in the component 1 aims to improve agricultural and 
animal production where the main focus will be on improved 
access to fertilizers, pesticides, veterinary drugs and access to 
high quality and affordable agro-veterinary services. 
Consequently an Integrated Pest Management Plan (IPMP) 
about the safe use of agricultural pesticides and a promotion of 
the use of biological or environmental control methods was 
developed as a separate document. This safeguard tool has 
been reviewed, consulted upon and disclosed within DRC and 
at the Infoshop respectively on January 13 and January 17, 
2017.

Physical Cultural 
Resources OP/BP 
4.11

Yes In order to anticipate and to be sure that all the precautions 
have been taken to protect and safeguard physical cultural 
resources, a section addressing these concerns was included in 
the ESMF.  This is because activities related to the 
rehabilitation and the maintenance of feeder roads and other 
infrastructure works will induce excavations with potential 
discoveries of physical cultural resources.

Indigenous Peoples 
OP/BP 4.10

Yes As the project is focusing mainly on rural areas, and as there 
are Indigenous People in the project area, the Indigenous 
People Policy Framework (IPPF) of the parent project has been 
updated. Once the project site is clearly identified, the project 
will prepare an Indigenous Peoples Plan (IPP).

Involuntary 
Resettlement OP/BP 
4.12

Yes This policy is triggered because of the potential restriction of 
access to assets or sources of livelihood as a result of the 
proposed project activities. Since the exact geographic 
coverage of proposed activities is still to be determined, the 
Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) of the parent project 
has been updated by the Borrower for the project to clearly 
outline the basic principles and guidelines for mitigating any 
potential impact that may require compensation in the event of 
land acquisition and in some cases involuntary resettlement in 
the broad sense.

Safety of Dams OP/
BP 4.37

No The project will not finance dam works or activities associated 
to existing dams.

Projects on 
International 

Yes Projects on International Waterways OP/BP 7.50 is triggered 
because of planned irrigation activities. An exception to the 



Page 8 of 13

Waterways OP/BP 
7.50

Riparian Notification Requirement under OP 7.50 (Projects on 
International Waterways) was approved by the RVP on 
December 15, 2016. Due diligence was also completed under 
the parent project and an exception to the Riparian Notification 
Requirement was approved by the RVP on Oct 27, 2009..

Projects in Disputed 
Areas OP/BP 7.60

No The project will not be located in a Disputed Area.

IV. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify 

and describe any potential large scale,  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
The Additional Financing will support activities related to the rehabilitation and the maintenance 
of feeder roads, the construction of key local markets, storage facilities, warehouses, processing 
centers, nurseries, etc. These civil works will unquestionably induce environmental and social 
adverse impacts in terms of trees cutting, dust, noise, waste management, and security and health 
issues both for populations and for employees. However, most of adverse impacts associated with 
these investments will likely be site-specific, so manageable at an acceptable level.  
In addition, those civil works will take place in forested areas. Potential adverse impacts could 
occur on forests and natural resources. The civil works could also induce impacts on Physical 
cultural resources.  
 
On social level, the rehabilitation/maintenance of feeder roads and the construction of local 
markets as well as warehouses may induce the displacement of populations. In addition, 
Indigenous people are present within areas where some civil works will be undertaken with the 
possibility to some adverse impacts on them.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities 
in the project area:
Anticipated negative environmental and social impacts of the project would result mainly from 
civil works associated with rural roads rehabilitation, but also from increase and intensified crop 
production. The consequence would be change in routine activities, use of fertilizers and 
pesticides, generation of solid and liquid waste, acquisition/taking of private land. In addition, the 
potential use of quarry materials for consolidation of rural roads could also be sources of negative 
impacts on both the natural and physical environment, which will require restoration actions after 
use.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse 
impacts.
Not relevant.

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
The project remains EA category B and triggers eight safeguards policies which are OP/BP 4.01; 
OP/BP 4.04, OP/BP4.36; OP4.09; OP/BP4.11, OP/BP7.50; OP/BP4.10 and OP/PB 4.12.   
 
Considering that the exact geographic locations of project specific interventions are not yet 
determined with certainty, the Borrower updated four environmental and social safeguards 
instruments, namely an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF), a 



Page 9 of 13

Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF), the Indigenous People Policy Framework (IPPF) and a 
Pest Management Plan (PMP) in compliance with the core requirements of the triggered 
safeguards policies : OP/BP 4.01 (Environmental Assessment), OP 4.09 (Pest Management), OP/
BP.4.10 (Indigenous People) and OP/BP 4.12 (Involuntary Resettlement).  The ESMF has also 
made provision to address basic requirements from both OP/BP 4.36 (forestry) and OP/BP 4.04 
(Natural Habitats). Both the ESMF and the PMP were reviewed and cleared by the Bank and the 
Government and disclosed both in-country on January 13, 2017 and at the InfoShop on January 
17, 2017. The RPF and the IPPF was were also reviewed and cleared by the Bank, and disclosed 
both in-country on  January 13, 2017 and at the InfoShop on  January 17, 2017. 
 
During the parent project implementation, screening of sub-projects has taken place to ensure 
proper identification and mitigation of any adverse impacts. Consequently, many ESIA, RAP and 
IPPs have been prepared, disclosed and implemented as guidance/guidelines prior to activities 
implementation. As the parent project, the ongoing AF will follow the same process regarding the 
safeguard aspects.  
 
There is a recently recruited safeguards specialist in the PIU, who is familiar with project activities 
in the parent project, he has also been implicated in the preparation stage. For Component 2, the 
Contractor (UNOPS) has equally recruited a safeguards specialist, as well as the Netherlands 
Development Organization (Stichting Nederlandse Vrijwilligers/SNV) that implemented the IPP 
of the parent project, also has a safeguards specialist in the team. To supervise the implementation 
of social measures, it is recommended that the project recruit a social expert. 
All the environmental and social safeguard specialists involved in the team will ensure that all the 
sub-projects to be financed under the AF are in full compliance with Bank safeguards policies and 
in line with the national regulatory framework. Furthermore, the National Agency in charge of 
environmental impact assessment and safeguards monitoring (Agence Congolaise de 
l➢❨ Environnementale-ACE) is also involved in the environmental and social aspects monitoring.  
 
Lastly, the safeguards specialists at the World Bank, part of the project team, will ensure that all 
the project staff are trained on safeguards on the one hand and will be part on supervision missions 
on the other hand with the aim to make sure safeguards aspects are properly handled.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure 
on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The key stakeholders are the beneficiary communities, Ministries in charge of Agriculture, 
fisheries and livestock, rural development, transport, Environment and sustainable development 
(and their relevant agencies/departments), municipalities, NGOs and other relevant institutions. 
 
One of the key principles of this project from the outset was to foster participation of all relevant 
stakeholders. This approach will be sustained throughout project implementation. The 
environmental and social assessment studies, namely the ESMF, IPMP. IPPF and RPF, were also 
carried out according to the same principle, using broad-based public consultation approach, 
involving the above stakeholder groups. The objective was to raise awareness of project activities 
and impacts and foster ownership on their part. All the relevant bodies have been adequately 
informed of the Project. Concerns of the communities and some details of consultations have been 
taken into account in the body of the different reports and other results provided as Annexes. The 
key concerns raised during the consultation process included: (i) permanent information and 
sensitization of the population, (ii) compensation process for those impacted by the project, (iii) 
participation of local population as employee on works they qualify for, (iv) the involvement of 



Page 10 of 13

NGOs and state technical services during the execution of works. All these concerns have been 
addressed in the alternatives proposed through the developed safeguards instruments.

I. Project Context 

 Country Context 

 

More than twenty years after the end of apartheid, unemployment, poverty and inequality remain 

important development challenges in South Africa, despite substantial progress in overcoming the 

legacy of the past. While total employment increased from 9 million in 1996 to 16 million in 2015, the 

unemployment rate has stayed stubbornly high in the range of 20-26 percent. In 2015 approximately 5.4 

million South Africans were unemployed, of which about 40 percent were new entrants.  A 30 percent 

increase in per capita GDP since the late 1990s and a sharp expansion of the social grant coverage 

enabled a significant decline in the poverty rate—from 43.5 percent of the population living below 

ZAR219 (inflation-adjusted) a month in 2000 to 36.7 percent (or 18.3 million people) living below R501 

in 2015. Nevertheless, pockets of poverty remain deeply entrenched, mostly among the historically 

disadvantaged population. With a relatively stagnant income Gini coefficient of around 0.69 in 2011 

(versus 0.72 in 2006) and expenditure Gini of 0.634 in 2015 (versus 0.67 in 2006), South Africa has one 

of the highest inequality rates in the world. Land distribution, in particular, is one of the most unequal in 

the world. Threatening progress in poverty alleviation is the impact of the drought on agriculture and the 

widening gap between those with and without jobs. 

Recent developments in economic activity are not indicative of major improvements in growth or 

employment. South Africa’s annual GDP is estimated to have increased by 1.3 percent in 2015,

compared to 1.5 percent in 2014 and 2.2 percent in 2013, a result of depressed global conditions, as well 

as labor unrest and electricity shortages which compounded structural constraints. This weak growth is 

well-below the projected 5 percent growth needed to drive down unemployment. Inflation was relatively 

subdued in 2015 amid lower food and fuel prices (5.2 percent as of December 2015, up from 4.8 percent 

in November). However the Reserve Bank increased the repurchase rate by a total of 125 basis points 

from start 2015 to end March 2016 due to a deterioration of the inflation outlook as a result of the effects 

from rising food prices due to the drought, the risk of a higher pass-through from the sharp depreciation 

of the rand (depreciated by more than 30 percent against the dollar in 2015 and continued to weaken in 

January 2016, before showing a subsequent moderate recovery) and subdued global growth. 

A weaker growth environment will pose a challenge in the management of the fiscal deficit, which in 

turn increases the sovereign credit risk.  In an effort to mitigate sovereign credit risk, the National 

Budget Speech of February 2016 announced a strong fiscal adjustment effort, bringing the fiscal deficit 

from 3.9 percent of GDP for 2015/16 to 2.8 percent by 2017/18. The original target of the 2015 budget 

had been 2.5 percent, however deterioration in the growth outlook rendered the target unrealistic. In 

December 2015, Fitch and Standard and Poor’s (S&P) downgraded South Africa’s creditworthiness 

rating to BBB-, one notch above speculative grade, and S&P placed its rating on negative watch. The 

turmoil in markets experienced in December 2015 when a weakening in the government’s commitment 

to fiscal discipline was perceived, hints at the potential fallout from a further ratings downgrade.  

A substantial reduction in poverty and inequality will be hard to achieve without a major success in rural 

development. As stated by South Africa’s National Development Plan (NDP), the main challenge for 

rural development in South Africa is to “combat the marginalization of the poor”. While the rural share 

of poverty fell from 70 percent in 1993 to 58.3 percent in 2011, partly due to migration of the poor to 

townships and informal settlements around urban centers, rural areas remain characterized by greater 

poverty and inequality than urban areas.  The contraction in agricultural production at double-digit 

rates in the first three quarters of 2015, as extreme weather conditions related to El Nino led to the most 

severe drought in almost 20 years, pushed an estimated 50,000 South Africans into poverty. 

Agriculture development and successful land reform are key pillars of the strategy laid out by the NDP 

for integrated and inclusive rural development. South Africa’s agriculture sector is characterized by 

dualism: a modern, market-oriented capital intensive farming sector consisting of a small number of 

large commercial farms (around 40,000 farming units) and a large number of subsistence and 

small-scale or emerging farms, many in the former homeland areas. In addition, there is growing 

consolidation in the industry with a number of mergers taking place and the acquisition of smaller 

players. While improving economies of scale, this consolidation may also lead to lower competition in 

the market. Around 2006, over 80 percent of South African farmers worked on a piece of land of one 

hectare or smaller, and another 11 percent on one to five hectares. Only 3 percent had access to land of 

larger than 20 hectares. It is estimated that there are 2.5 – 3.5 million households engaged in subsistence 

farming, about 350,000 – 700,000 who can be classified as emerging farmers, producing part of their 

output for the market, and between 11,000 – 15,000 small to medium scale farmers who are 

commercially oriented. 

The progress of land reform has been slow and a large number of land reform beneficiaries are not using 

the land productively. The government committed itself to transfer 30 percent of the 82 million hectares 

of agricultural land owned by whites in 1994 to historically disadvantaged farmers by 2014, a total of 

24.5 million hectares, through both land restitution and land redistribution. According to the Twenty 

Year Review published by the Presidency, only 9.4 million hectares have been redistributed since 1994 

through both land restitution and redistribution. Achieving the objective of “productive use” of 

redistributed and restituted land requires even greater efforts and innovation. Land reform in South 

Africa to date has involved the transfer of relatively large commercial farms in their entirety to groups of 



beneficiaries. Land reform beneficiaries are typically resource-poor, risk-averse, and inexperienced 

historically disadvantaged farmers. Support provided to them after their takeover of the land, that is 

post-settlement support, has been inadequate. Land reform beneficiaries have experienced numerous 

problems accessing services, such as credit, training, technology extension, transport, plowing services, 

veterinary services, and marketing services. The well-developed agribusiness sector that services 

large-scale commercial agriculture has not been seen extending its operations to emerging farmers who, 

in most cases, would be cash-strapped and incapable of paying for such services anyway. As a 

consequence, there is limited integration of small farmers into the value chain.  

Support for small-scale farmers is equally crucial to job creation. Employment in the formal agriculture 

sector declined from 1.1 million in 1992 to 739,000 in 2014 despite output growth. Nevertheless, the 

NDP believes that with successful rural development and land reform the agriculture sector has the 

potential to create 1 million new jobs by 2030. The NDP counts on small-scale/ emerging farmers for 

over 35 percent of the job creation target, in addition to a 10 percent share from subsistence farmers, a 10 

percent share expected from better use of the land that has already been redistributed or restituted to land 

reform beneficiaries, and a 30 percent share from expansion of labor intensive commercial farming.   

 
 

Sectoral and institutional Context 

 

South Africa’s financial sector is the most developed in Sub-Saharan Africa and is significantly larger 

and more diversified compared to regional and income-group peers. It is supported by an elaborate legal 

and financial infrastructure and a generally effective regulatory framework. South Africa’s financial 

system totaled approximately ZAR 10 trillion in assets as of year-end 2014 (US$ equivalent of 1,026 

billion). As of end 2014, the banking sector constitutes almost 40 percent of the financial system assets, 

with pension funds and long-term insurers each contributing roughly 35 and 18 percent, respectively. 

The banking sector is highly concentrated, but at the same time commercially driven and professional. 

The ‘big four’ banks in South Africa, two of which are foreign owned, account for over 83 percent of 

total banking assets. This concentrated ownership structure has led to limited competition and distorted 

incentives for these banks to serve the lower end of the market, especially micro, small, and 

medium-sized enterprises and the low-income population. Nevertheless, the banking system generally is 

highly professional and commercially driven, and does not suffer from distortionary policies.   

Provision of agricultural finance and support  

One of the main challenges for rural and agriculture development is affordable access to working capital 

for emerging farmers and medium to long-term finance for small and medium-sized agricultural 

enterprises. While the financial services needs of the large commercial farms are generally well catered 

for by the private sector, farmers in rural areas experience many of the challenges faced by their peers in 

other African countries, ranging from difficulties in accessing markets, poor infrastructure, and little or 

no physical assets that could be used as collateral for accessing financing. With few exceptions, 

emerging and small-scale farmers are unable to use the land that they farm on as collateral given that the 

state owns most of the land in the former homelands. FinScope’s 2010 Small Business Survey estimates 

that of the roughly 700,000 emerging and small commercial farmers, only 5.6 percent used formal credit 

services and only 2.5 percent from a bank. In contrast, nearly half of those farmers used formal savings 

and/ or payments services and about 30 percent formal insurance. 

Without adequate collateral, rural farmers face challenges in accessing credit from traditional 

commercial banks. While the ‘big four’ commercial banks have made efforts to become more inclusive, 

their business models and cost structure do not lend themselves to serving the agricultural sector. Some 



banks are funding value chain off-take agreements with large processors and retailers for on-lending to 

smaller farmers, but such lending is small compared to the overall loan book of commercial banks. 

According to the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF), total farming debt 

amounted to ZAR 116,576 million (US$10,137 million) in 2014, out of which ZAR 66,345 million 

(US$5,769 million) was from commercial banks and ZAR 30,580 million (US$2,659 million) from the 

Land Bank. Compared to total commercial bank loans and advances of ZAR 2,967 billion (US$258 

billion), agricultural lending amounts to about 1 percent of their total loan book. 

A wide range of programs have been implemented by the government to provide financial support to 

land reform beneficiaries and small-scale farmers. In 1994 the government introduced the 

Settlement/Land Acquisition Grant (SLAG) to enable individuals and groups to finance the purchase of 

land from a willing seller. Until 2000, redistribution policy centered on the provision of a grant of ZAR 

16,000 (~US$1,034) to qualifying households with an income of less than ZAR 1,500 (~US$97) a 

month. In 2001 the Land Redistribution for Agricultural Development (LRAD) Grant was introduced to 

establish and promote emerging farmers. LRAD offered higher grants, paid to individuals rather than to 

households, and made greater use of loan financing through institutions such as Land Bank to 

supplement the grant. A few years later, the slow pace of land reform led to the introduction of the 

Proactive Land Acquisition Strategy (PLAS) in 2005-06. The use of grants for land acquisition was 

discontinued and the focus was shifted to the acquisition of strategically located land through PLAS by 

the state. Since its inception, PLAS has become the biggest single program area within redistribution, in 

terms of both budget and land area. 

There are also initiatives designed to provide post-settlement support to land reform beneficiaries. The 

LRAD policy for example sets out to close the post-settlement support gap that prevailed under SLAG. 

In addition, the Comprehensive Farmer Support Program (CFSP) provides two grants, one for capacity 

building and one for on-farm infrastructure. In order to access on-farm infrastructure grants ranging 

from a minimum of ZAR 5,000 to a maximum of ZAR 100,000 (~ US$323 to 6,462), beneficiaries must 

make an ‘own contribution’ along a sliding scale similar to that of the LRAD grant program. It is a 

once-off support package designed for LRAD beneficiaries. The Comprehensive Agricultural Support 

Program (CASP) supported by DAFF offers grants to support short-term operating expenses and small 

operating needs such as machinery. These grants are managed at the provincial level and come from 

funds that are transferred from the national to the provincial level. Combined land acquisition grants, 

both for redistribution and restitution, totaled ZAR 13.6 billion (US$1.61 billion) between 2008 and 

2012 while grants for movable equipment and fixed improvements amounted to ZAR 3.4 billion 

(US$1.58 billion) between 2004 and 2012 (DAFF). Borrowing for working capital needs to operate and 

expand farms has been one of the most acute challenges for emerging and small farmers as well as land 

reform beneficiaries due to the reasons mentioned above.  

Value chain integration is an opportunity to address significant skills and financing gaps of emerging 

farmers. In South Africa, there is a growing recognition in government and the private sector that value 

chain integration may be an effective way of building up a new class of commercial emerging farmers. 

Drawing on the successful experiences in the sugar, poultry, cotton, tobacco and forestry sectors, the 

government and private sector are joining forces to scale up efforts in these and other sectors. A new 

area opening for value chain integration is in the supply of fresh fruits and vegetables to retail 

supermarkets. With new BBBEE procurement policies government is encouraging the private sector to 

get involved. For example, Walmart-Massmart has established a supplier fund to support emerging 

farmer integration into their supply chain. The South African Poultry Association through the creation 

of the Developing Poultry Farmers Organization (DPFO) facilitates technical and financial assistance to 

access contracts with egg and poultry businesses. 



Land Bank 

In addition to government grants, financing from Land Bank has been expected to play a critical role in 

land reform and agriculture development. Land Bank was established in 1912 and is governed by the 

Land and Agricultural Development Bank Act of 2002. Land Bank was given a mandate of 11 aspects, 

which fall into five broader areas: (i) access of the historically disadvantaged population to land; (ii) 

agriculture productivity, growth and job creation; (iii) gender equity; (iv) environmental sustainability; 

and (v) food security. The NDP published in 2011 continues to call for a key role of Land Bank in 

providing financial support to land reform beneficiaries and to help them overcome difficulties in entry 

into commercial farming. 

As the leading development financial institution in the rural and agriculture sector in South Africa, Land 

Bank had an approximately 29 percent market share in agricultural financing as of July 2015. The bank 

has achieved a significant turnaround during the past five years. It is now on a sustainable trajectory with 

profits of ZAR 420 million in 2014/15 (up 61 percent from 2013/14), and a Return on Average Assets of 

1.12 percent and a Return on Average Equity of 6.78 percent. Total assets stood at ZAR 39.4 billion in 

2014/15 with a performing loan book of ZAR 36 billion. Non-performing loans (NPLs) under Land 

Bank methodology were at 3.72 percent in 2014/15 and the cost-to-income ratio was 54.9 percent. Fitch 

Ratings upgraded Land Bank from AA to AA+ in January 2014. The rating was maintained at AA+ in 

December 2015. The bank does not take general deposits and funds itself mainly through the debt and 

capital markets, issuing instruments such as promissory notes.  

Land Bank is fully owned by the South African government and supervised by the National Treasury. It 

follows prudential guidelines as issued by its Board of Directors. It is consequently not prudentially 

supervised by the South African Reserve Bank (SARB). The bank is audited by the Auditor General. 

Land Bank is engaged in both wholesale lending through intermediaries as well as direct lending. 

Intermediaries are mainly credit providers, cooperatives, or agri-businesses.  

In 2015, Land Bank adopted a new strategy following the completion of its organizational review. The 

review was undertaken following conditions set by NT pursuant to the issue of a Government guarantee, 

aimed at enabling the Land Bank to raise longer term funding. The review was completed in August 

2015 and subsequently an implementation plan was approved by the Land Bank Board. Land Bank has 

started implementing the new strategy and key changes are planned to be put in place over a two-year 

period in line with the priorities of Land Bank. The changes focus on: (i) a strategy to optimize the retail 

commercial banking segment of Land Bank, the long term viability of which was a concern owing to 

loan losses and significant operational costs; (ii) new initiatives to potentially expand the development 

portfolio of Land Bank for emerging farmers in a sustainable and commercially viable manner by 

adopting a project finance approach in partnership with large corporates and intermediaries to integrate 

the emerging farmers into established value chains; and (iii) steps to align Land Bank financial 

soundness indicators, credit appraisal processes and risk management practices with international 

banking standards.  

Following the adoption of this new strategy, Land Bank has two main business lines: Corporate Banking 

(CB) and Commercial Development Banking (CDB). The new CDB business line is a combination of 

previous Retail Emerging Markets (REM) and Retail Commercial Banking (RCB) business lines. In 

2014/15, CB accounted for 83.6 percent of the bank’s loan book and CDB accounted for 16.4 percent, of 

which 1.3 percent was composed of loans provided under REM. 

Under CDB, the REM sub-business line continues to focus exclusively on lending to emerging farmers 

for development purposes. Farmers supported under REM typically have no or limited access to 

commercial funding and little or no collateral, but can be commercially sustainable and viable with 



financing and technical support. Subsistence farmers are not supported under REM. Lending is based on 

cash-flows and non-financial support (end to end on-farm support) is provided by Land Bank 

intermediaries and agricultural specialists based in Land Bank branches. REM uses wholesale as well as 

direct lending and offers production financing, installment sale finance, and medium-term loans. The 

total REM portfolio amounted to ZAR 489 million in 2014/15 (increase of ZAR 97 million in that year).  

Intensive and high-quality extensions services under the REM program are effectively provided by Land 

Bank’s intermediaries. These intermediaries have a comparative advantage in providing these services 

due to their close interaction with the beneficiaries. The non-financial complementary services, 

especially extension services, are critical for emerging farmers to develop. The costs for the extension 

services are embedded in the overall cost structure under REM and are borne by the intermediaries. 

While the provision of extension services is costly, especially for new emerging farmers, intermediaries 

can generate profits from these clients over time due to the long-run and comprehensive nature of 

engagement between intermediaries and their clients. The current model of providing extension services 

is considered to be of high quality according to the assessment carried out during project preparation. 

Under CDB, the RCB business line which was exclusively focused on direct retail lending to medium 

scale farmers, through 27 Agriculture Finance Centers (AFCs), has been significantly restructured to 

improve its long term sustainability. RCB was loss-making due to high operating costs of the large 

branch network and had NPLs of 11 percent in 2014/15. RCB was losing clients to commercial banks 

and agricultural enterprises who started to lend in that space and could offer a wider range of products. 

The competitiveness and long-term viability of RCB was therefore questionable. The new strategy aims 

at consolidating the branch network into 9 provincial offices in strategically important geographical 

locations which will also result in significant staff reduction. Importantly, the consolidated branch 

network’s role will specifically focus on facilitating effective partnerships in their respective regions 

with corporate retailers, emerging farmers, government programs, as well as technical and financial 

intermediaries to leverage on high impact and high value chain finance deals. 

Importantly, as part of the new strategy, Land Bank aims to scale up financing support to emerging 

farmers in a sustainable and commercially viable manner through their integration in established value 

chains. The approach is anchored in identifying high-potential value chain projects in a given 

geographic region and securing buy-in from large agriculture corporates or technical partners to assist in 

supporting emerging farmers’ integration into the chain. The agriculture corporates will provide 

technical support (directly or indirectly) to the emerging farmers, building up their capacity to be 

sustainable suppliers to the chain. Land Bank has identified selected potential value chain projects and 

agriculture corporates to partner with in the grains, winery, horticulture and livestock sectors for this 

type of financing. 

The CB business line is the corporate part of the bank and the most viable business line. The CB 

business line involves both direct and wholesale lending. Lending takes place primarily through 

intermediaries (cooperatives and agri-businesses). CB operates through two offices in Pretoria and Cape 

Town. The total portfolio of CB amounted to ZAR 31 billion in 2014/15. While CB targets commercial 

farmers, the workers employed on these farm tend to be part of the low-income population.  

Land Bank aims at increasing its developmental focus in both CB and CDB business lines by 

strengthening its wholesale business as well as its direct lending to emerging farmers. Both business 

lines contain a development portfolio with “development” referring to a focus on supporting the 

historically disadvantaged population in line with Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment 

(BBBEE). International experience with development banks suggests that wholesale lending is more 

likely to be successful than retail lending. The key reason is that wholesale lending does not require a 

large branch network which is costly to build and maintain but rather leverages the networks already 



built by other financial service providers. Wholesale lending is also more market enabling and does not 

aim at competing with the private sector.  Direct lending via value chain financing leverages the 

corporate partner’s ability to provide technical support to the borrower, building up their capacity to be 

sustainable suppliers to the chain. As such, emerging farmers in this scheme have the potential to 

increase their revenues and thus a greater likelihood of fulfilling debt obligations to the bank. The 

project will therefore focus on supporting Land Bank in scaling up its wholesale portfolio as well as 

expanding direct lending through LB’s new approach of integrating emerging farmers into established 

value chains. Using long-term financing to fill existing funding gaps will additionally help Land Bank 

meet its investment needs as well as improve its asset liability management.  

Land Bank is making an important contribution to job creation. Land Bank estimates that the impact of 

its loan disbursements on employment opportunities in South Africa was close to 400,000 in 2013-2014. 

This estimate is comprised of over 23,000 new employment opportunities generated and over 370,000 

jobs maintained during the year. One employment opportunity constitutes 240 days worked per year. 

The estimated new jobs created are arising out of the medium and long-term loans Land Bank is 

providing.

III. Project Description 

 Component Name 

 Line of Credit for Agricultural Financing 

 Comments (optional) 

 

Land Bank will provide both wholesale finance to participating PFIs for on-lending to commercial 

and emerging farmers and direct financing, in partnership with large agriculture corporates, to 

emerging farmers to support their integration in established value chains. It will do so through two 

main financing windows 

Window 1: Wholesale finance to commercial and emerging farmers. This window will provide a 

wholesale line of credit to Land Bank. Land Bank will on-lend the funds to participating financial 

intermediaries (PFIs) which comply with eligibility criteria agreed with the World Bank. The PFIs 

will on-lend funds to eligible agriculture enterprises, commercial and emerging farmers, communal 

property associations and other eligible borrowers supported under the Land Bank’s CB and CDB 

business lines. Currently, the wholesale line under CDB primarily includes the REM portfolio, 

however, over the life of the project this may change to include other wholesale loans under CDB. 

Window 2: Financing to integrate emerging farmers into established value chains. This window will 

provide a line of credit to Land Bank to finance direct lending to emerging farmers for integrated value 

chain finance. For direct lending to value chain finance/development projects, Land Bank will finance 

eligible emerging farmers and agriculture enterprises in collaboration with large agriculture 

corporates and/or technical partners in a targeted value chain.

B.   Introduction and Context

Country Context
Bolivia's recent economic growth, one of the highest in Latin America, has brought about 
significant benefits to the poor, with poverty decreasing from 63 to 39 percent in the last decade. 
As in other Latin-American countries highly dependent on extractives industries, Bolivia's 
economy has been affected by multiple global factors, particularly by low commodity prices. The 
overall economy slowdown will make it difficult for countries like Bolivia to maintain the levels 
of investment that characterized the previous decade. Furthermore, damaging weather events, 
such as floods in 2013 and a severe drought in 2016, have taken a huge toll on Bolivia➢❨ s 
economy, particularly in the agricultural sector, where prices of domestic staple products have 
risen considerably, disproportionately affecting urban and rural poor. Changes in climate patterns 
will exacerbate climate variability, and therefore, their impacts on vulnerable populations.
Sectoral and institutional Context
The proposed AF, with its scale-up to reach poor producers countrywide, is consistent with WBG 
and GoB development agendas for 2016-2020, which prioritize inclusive economic growth, 
reducing poverty and inequality, and building capacity to cope with climate change. The AF is 
aligned with the World Bank Group Country Partnership Framework (CPF- 2016-2020) for 
Bolivia, Pillar 1 (Promoting broad-based and inclusive growth), particularly under Objective 3 
(Improving opportunities for income generation, market access, and sustainable intensification); 
and also supports Pillar 2 (Addressing environmental sustainability and resilience to climate 
change). In relation to government priorities, PAR II will contribute to reaching the targets set 
forth in the General Economic and Social Plan (PGDES), particularly under Pillar 1, Result 2 
(reducing moderate poverty), and under Pillar 6 (sovereignty with productive diversification). It is 
important to note, that as part of its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDCs), the 
Government of Bolivia has committed to triple the irrigation area and double food production 
under irrigation by 2020; the Project is also aligned with those priorities. 
 
Key results. The AF will scale up activities to enhance the impact of a well-performing project 
that has proven effective in improving rural income and reducing poverty; the alliance approach 
will also help small-scale producers cope with climate variability. With an expanded geographical 
area countrywide, the AF will reach directly an additional 30,000 rural and majority-indigenous 
households, via supporting about 850 productive alliances. Public infrastructure subprojects will 
reach out to about 70,000 indirect beneficiaries. As in the original project, the AF will continue 
promoting strong engagement by women in the subprojects. Maintaining the menu of activities of 
the original project, the AF will make extra efforts to improving efficiency in water use. As a 
result, the bulk of additional funds (up to 75%) allocated to alliances will not only serve to 
improve access to markets, as PAR has been doing over the past ten years, but also strengthen 
resilience to a harsher climate.

C.  Proposed Development Objective(s)

Original Project Development Objective(s) - Parent
The objective of the Project is to improve accessibility to markets for small rural producers in the 
Selected Areas by: (a) promoting productive alliances between different small rural producer 



Page 3 of 14

organizations and purchasers; (b) empowering rural producers through the establishment and 
strengthening of self-managed grass-root organizations; (c) increasing access to productive assets, 
technologyand financial services;  (d) promoting more effective, responsive and accountable 
service organizations at the local level; and (e)enhancing environmental sustainability of 
productive practices. The Project is a follow on operation to the successful PAR I, whichtested the 
model for improving market access.

Proposed Project Development Objective(s) - Additional Financing
The re-written PDO would be: ➢❨ The Objective of the Project is to improve accessibility to 
markets and climate resilience for small-scale rural producers in the country➢❨ 

Key Results 
The Project will track progress against the PDO through the following indicators: 
 
- Increase in the average volume of sales of the product(s) involved in the alliance 
- Producer Organizations (SPOs)➢❨ s members that apply climate -related resilience practices/
measures as defined in the business plans 
- Producer organizations that maintain or improve their commercial relations (alliances) for at 
least two productive cycles 
- Direct project beneficiaries (disaggregated by men and women): Direct producer beneficiaries 
from SPOs (disaggregated by men and women) and Beneficiaries of public investment sub-
projects (there is not disaggregation).

D.  Project Description

PAR II project aims at strengthening market access and climate resilience for small scale 
producers by: supporting producers➢❨  collective action via the establishing and strengthening of 
small producer-based self-managed grass-root organizations; strengthening farmers➢❨  linkages 
with buyers; and increasing their access to productive assets, climate-resilience technologies/
practices, knowledge, and financial resources. As in the parent project, Small Producer 
Organizations (SPOs) will identify opportunities for business upgrades; consolidate those 
opportunities into Business Plans (BPs); and co-fund and implement those plans. Although the 
Project will maintain its demand-driven focus, it will introduce mechanisms to contribute to shape 
the demand by SPOs, in alignment with the increased resilient emphasis of the project's 
investments. In fact, in the AF phase, the Project will more strategically support climate resilient 
investments via irrigation modernization and climate smart practices. Investments under the BPs 
will be complemented with off-farm investments under Municipal Subprojects to improve 
productive infrastructure and facilitate market linkages. 
 
PAR II safeguard performance has consistently been rated as satisfactory. The track record of 
EMPODERAR carrying out PAR and PAR II, confirms strong capability to monitoring 
compliance with environmental and social safeguards throughout the lifespan of subprojects. 
Over the years, the PIU has put in place a set of standards and procedures, which has proven 
effective in diverse environments and social contexts, and which form the basis for the 
instruments that the PIU will use countrywide in the AF. These tools are included in the Social 
Assessment & Management Framework, the Resettlement Policy Framework, and the 
Environmental Management Framework, and will allow the PIU to conduct permanent social and 
environmental analysis, reinforce information and consultation, strengthen women➢❨ s

participation, and define site-specific mitigation measures, among other multiple actions.

Component Name
Institutional Strengthening
Comments (optional)
This component will continue supporting pre-investment activities for the creation and 
strengthening of Rural Alliances. As in the parent project, this component will support alliance 
pre-investment activities to: (i) promote the project concept and outreach, viacommunication and 
dissemination campaigns; (ii) strengthen capacities of eligible Small Producer Organizations to: 
form Rural Alliances, identify potential business opportunities, fully prepared business plans, 
formalize their organizations, and improve their marketing and business skills; (iii) strengthen 
capacities of service providers and local governments; and (iv) appraise alliances.

Component Name
Implementation of Rural Alliances
Comments (optional)
This component would provide grants to co-finance investments found technically and financially 
feasible under component 1. These include grants to co-finance the implementation of 
competitively selected business plans / rural alliances (Subcomponent 2a); and co-finance the 
implementation of public infrastructure subprojects (Municipal Subprojects Subcomponent 2b). 
Support to SPO via advisers (acompanantes) would be provided under Subcomponent 2c.

Component Name
Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation
Comments (optional)
This component would support the incremental costs associated with project administration and 
monitoring, to support project activities, such as: updating and operation of the Geo-referenced 
Management Information System (SIGG, for its acronym in Spanish) and of the public 
information system; baseline information collection and the impact evaluation of the Project. The 
component will also support the undertaking of studies.

E.  Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis (if known)

In the additional financing phase, PAR II will expand opportunities to farmers countrywide. The 
expanded geographical coverage of the project, includes a variety of six ecological regions 
spanning from high-altitude valleys to tropical humid forests. The Borrower has finalized an 
Environmental Assessment (EA) including a guide of good environmental practices that 
complements and updates the earlier assessments of environmental characteristics and problems 
relevant to the Project by each ecological region, including projected concerns of climate 
vulnerability. The Borrower conducted a complementary social assessment (SA) for the extended 
project area. The SA analyzed the particular social, cultural, and productive features in each of the 
eco regions, with emphasis on the TCO/TIOCs and their regulations. The social instruments that 
were part of the original SA in the parent project (e.g. those for detecting potential social 
dynamics that might affect the subproject) were revised taking into account the new project area.  
 
To facilitate the application of the social tools, the Social Assessment was broken down into 3 
items.  



Page 5 of 14

- The Social Assessment (Part I) includes the analysis of social context, poverty aspects, cultural 
diversity, gender and cross-generation issues in the 6 eco regions (Amazonia, Yungas, Altiplano, 
Valles, Oriente and Chaco), covering 339 municipalities. The preparation of this document also 
included a systematic consultation process, which was based on an initial stakeholder analysis.  
- The Social Management Framework (Part II) provides technical criteria and customized tools 
for assessment of feasibility of alliances through social lens; systematizes pertinent information 
for social monitoring and evaluation; and includes criteria to retro-feeding the beneficiaries➢❨  
organizations with valuable recommendations to ensuring cohesion and sustainability.  
- The Social Management Framework (for Indigenous Peoples/Part III) includes specific tools and 
procedures to strengthen consultation processes with indigenous peoples; those tools are 
particularly useful to analyzing the conditions and specific regulations of minority groups located 
in the TCO/TIOCs and conducting Free, Prior and Informed Consultation processes 
- The Resettlement Policy Framework has been updated to reflect the geographic expansion of the 
project. A land donation protocol has been included to address the land cession for municipal 
infrastructure subprojects. 
  
Overall the institutional arrangements of the Parent project will remain unchanged, including 
responsibilities in the supervision of environmental and social aspects. To strengthen 
implementation capacity, with the expansion of project coverage, the PIU will hire additional 
safeguard specialists for the Departmental Units and provide them with pertinent training, with 
support from the Task Team.

II. Implementation
Institutional and Implementation Arrangements
In order to streamline the implementation of subcomponent 2.2 (Municipal Subprojects), in the AF, 
the National Fund of Productive and Social Investment (FPS) would take responsibilities in the 
administration of financing resources aligned with Subcomponent 2.b activities.  Under the original 
design, EMPODERAR performs most of the activities for subcomponent 2b, such as: defining the 
Municipal Subprojects pipeline; funding the preparation of pre-feasibility/feasibility studies, and 
paying contractors. Meanwhile, the FPS was only assigned with the function of appraising the 
Municipal Subprojects, and procuring and overseeing (from a technical and safeguard perspective) 
the civil works. 
 
The proposal to assign fiduciary responsibilities to the FPS in the implementation of subcomponent 
2.b activities derives from recent changes in public procurement rules, which are slowing-down the 
implementation of Municipal Subprojects, particularly resulting from cumbersome registration 
procedures and new requirements for registering procurement processes. To reverse these unforeseen 
obstacles that emerged during implementation, EMPODERAR will hand over to FPS the 
responsibility of managing the financing resources for Subcomponent 2b, including the payment for 
contractors that perform the civil works. This will allow FPS to register the budget for subprojects 
and manage the procurement in a more straightforward manner. It is important to note that, besides 
this change, the AF will maintain the same distribution of roles and responsibilities as in the Parent

project.

III. Safeguard Policies that might apply

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional)
Environmental 
Assessment OP/BP 
4.01

Yes As in the original project, no large-scale impacts are expected 
given the limited, producers-based nature of Project activities. 
In the AF phase, most of the alliances will be devoted  
to agricultural /livestock primary production. A number of 
associated small municipal public works will also be financed 
such as road rehabilitation and improvement and small 
vehicular bridges. The AF will place strong emphasis on 
irrigation and water management both on-farm and in 
municipal subprojects. To account for it the project has 
triggered OP/BP 4.37 (Safety of Dams) and OP/BP 7.5 
(Projects in International waterways). An EA was conducted 
by the Borrower to reflect the expanded coverage area (six 
eco-regions). The EA report includes an updated 
Environmental Management Framework (EMF) at the Project 
level reflecting management measures in compliance with OP 
4.37 (Safety of Dams), instructed in the Environmental 
Management Manual. The updated EMF will be included as an 
annex to the Operational Manual.

Natural Habitats OP/
BP 4.04

Yes The updated EMF includes a comprehensive exclusion list to 
be applied at the early stage of subproject evaluation in order 
to prevent any negative impacts on natural habitats. No 
activities will be eligible within the core zones of protected 
areas, but specific activities such as beekeeping can be 
financed within their buffer zones, provided pertinent 
authorizations have been obtained and the activities are 
compatible with the area's Management Plan.

Forests OP/BP 4.36 Yes As in the original project, the updated EMF contemplates 
deforestation risks of humid or dry forests related with 
expansion of croplands or pastures that might be induced by 
some of the beneficiary rural alliances or other Project effects. 
On the other hand, rural alliances focused on eco-tourism and 
gathering of non-timber forest products could effectively 
promote natural habitat conservation by rural producers. PAR 
II, has however, financed very little (if any) of these types of 
productive activities.

Pest Management OP 
4.09

Yes As in the original project, Pest management is expected to be 
one of the main risks to environmental management. To 
minimize this risk, the PIU revised and improved the pest 
management plan, which is part of the EMF, taking into 
account the extended project area (and new crops).

Physical Cultural 
Resources OP/BP 

Yes Considering the portfolio of investments supported by the 
original project and expected to be financed in the AF, the 



Page 7 of 14

4.11 major risks regarding OP/BP 4.11. are associated with civil 
works such as roads and irrigation canals that could possibly 
uncover significant cultural property. This risks did not 
materialize in the original project. As in the original project, 
management plans in individual subprojects will be developed 
to manage specific issues if identified. It is possible that 
excavations could unearth cultural artifacts. The ESMF 
includes measures to ensure that chance finds are timely 
determined and respected before proceeding with approval of 
municipal subproject financing.

Indigenous Peoples 
OP/BP 4.10

Yes Given the fact that most of the potential beneficiaries identify 
themselves as indigenous (58% of the targeted population), 
PAR II AF will operate further as an Indigenous People 
Project in compliance with the OP/BP 4.10. 
The PIU will encourage minority groups inthe lowlands to 
benefit from the intervention. Project documents and the 
Operational Manual will include key procedures and activities 
to ensure culturally adequate implementation, which 
essentially consists of using their native languages to the 
greatest extent possible, as well as respecting their traditional 
and functional social structures and deliberation forms. 
Furthermore, the project will include regular consultations at 
the local, regional and national levels, following the principle 
of Free, Prior and Informed Consultation processes.  
Finally, the project will pay special attention to the traditional 
and valid gender roles in production. By doing so, the PIU 
seeks to avoid any negative impact derived from the 
interference or disruption of social and productive traditional 
networks. IP rights and women rights will be mapped during 
all the project cycle.

Involuntary 
Resettlement OP/BP 
4.12

Yes As in the parent project, the Involuntary Resettlement Policy 
(OP/BP 4.12) will continue triggered in the AF because of the 
possibility of minor physical impacts on land (up to 5% of the 
property) and assets,  in complementary municipal 
infrastructure investments. The PIU updated the Resettlement 
Policy Framework (RPF) to reflect the new project area and 
included more specific mitigation measures related to access to 
services, natural resources and physical impacts on land, 
infrastructure and assets. A land donation protocol has been 
included to address land cession for municipal infrastructure 
subprojects.

Safety of Dams OP/
BP 4.37

Yes Although PAR II does not finance the building of any large 
dam, this policy is newly triggered in the AF because of the 
emphasis on irrigation. In the event that a subproject depends 
on water supplied from an existing dam, the EMF stipulates 
that, before financing the subproject, the PIU will require a 
preliminary specialized dam safety assessment.



Page 8 of 14

Projects on 
International 
Waterways OP/BP 
7.50

Yes This policy is newly triggered because of the renewed 
emphasis of the AF on supporting irrigation investments. The 
exception to riparian notification has been requested because 
the project will essentially rehabilitate and improve efficiency 
in existing irrigation systems. Moreover, the proposed project's 
activities are not likely to damage the quality or quantity of the 
water flowing to downstream riparians; similarly, the Project 
will not be affected by other riparians' possible water use.

Projects in Disputed 
Areas OP/BP 7.60

No No project activities are contemplated in disputed areas.

IV. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify 

and describe any potential large scale,  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
It is not anticipated that the AF would generate negative environmental impacts, based on the 
experience of the original project. As in the parent project, the bulk of the investments in the AF 
will continue to be of a small scale and be led by the beneficiaries themselves. In addition, the 
projected investments in irrigation, both on-farm and off-farm, will focus on improving efficiency 
of water use and, therefore, are likely to generate positive environmental impacts. Based on the 
experience gained with PAR I and PAR II, the PIU has incorporated into the revised EMF multiple 
good practices that have proven effective in minimizing environmental impacts, such as crop 
rotation, terracing, reforestation, and soil protection. 
 
By applying the revised EMF, PAR II AF is likely to result in positive long-term environmental 
impacts, at least, on the following three fronts: (i) reducing risk of soil erosion through the 
adoption of practices such as crop rotation, pasture management and terracing; (ii) reducing 
negative effects of pesticides on health and environment as a result of the reduction of toxicity of 
products used and through awareness-building training; and (iii) improving efficiency in water use 
through implantation of modern irrigation systems. 
 
 
Findings from the consultations for the AF phase, highlighted the importance of continue 
strengthening women participation in project activities. In Amazon and Chaco regions, the 
participation of women in the project activities is lower as a result of diverse constraints that they 
face. Under these considerations the project will continue promoting the participation and 
empowerment of women in the 6 ecoregions but particularly in the Amazon and Chaco ecoregions 
by improving the access to opportunities of training and decision making in the Alliances. The 
project will continue promoting women participation and empowerment by, among others, 
facilitating their access to and engagement in training and decision making in the subprojects. In 
particular, the PIU will make extra efforts to hire more female technical staff for training, technical 
assistance and technology transfer, so that the project can reach out to women in a more effective 
manner. 
 
Additionally, in alignment with the up-coming new safeguard requirements, the SA includes 
instruments to better understand the possible risks of the project associated with child labor issues 
and possible mitigation measures to address them if identified. The prohibition of the management 



Page 9 of 14

and use of pesticides by minors is introduced. 
 
EMF, including subproject screening, has been updated to mitigate potential risk.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities 
in the project area:
AF is expected to benefit approximately 850 new SPOs in nine Departments. The ongoing project 
experience shows that PARII has the ability to significantly increase capacity building in the 
SOPs, and promotes inclusion by women and youth. In the original financing, women➢❨ s 
participation in subproject identification and implementation was strengthened. As a result, 30 
percent of the participants in alliances were women. However, the SA recommend strengthening 
gender-related activities in some regions (Amazons and Chacho).

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse 
impacts.
It is expected that the social impact of the project in general is positive. Mitigation measures 
incorporated into the project design and/or reflected in the Operations Manual of the project 
include mechanisms for: a) improving information and transparency, and adopt participatory 
monitoring at the SPO level; b) integrating vulnerable groups within farmers' groups to the 
processes of decision-making on priority needs, as well as the implementation, maintenance and 
equal access to benefits of subprojects, and c) promote the inclusion of women.

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
Based on previous experience, for the PAR II project, EMPODERAR has developed a series of 
criteria and instruments for the environmental management, monitoring and control process. The 
instruments developed serve to identify and assess possible environmental impacts and establish 
mitigation and control measures that are necessary for each type of activities. In the same way, it 
has developed instruments for the process of control and monitoring of climate threats and 
measures to adapt to climate change. In the case of Municipal Subprojects, FPS will have the 
responsibility to follow and comply with the EMF. 
 
EMPODERAR has in place reasonable standards and procedures for the implementation of the 
social safeguards policies. In the AF, the PIU will take advantage of those instruments to ensuring 
information and consultation for indigenous minorities during the project cycle. The use of those 
instruments will be an integral part of  the assessment of proposals from the social perspective.  
In addition, the PIU will identify opportunities to strengthening women's participation and 
developing further the existing GRM mechanisms, which thus far comprise the following three 
elements:  
(i) The regional units use a protocol to assessing and, to the extent possible, solving conflicts by 
identifying key stakeholders and their views, interests and needs; this tool seeks to anticipate risks 
and tensions that can either strengthen or weaken the Alliances, and to handle expectations and 
possible conflicts before escalating.  
(ii) The regional units also offer an open space, where individuals can file complaints, affectations 
or recommendations; The NCU receives and processes the claims. To strengthen this mechanism, 
each regional unit will make available a Community Book of Complaints.  
(iii) The PIU will put in place a public transparency platform to track beneficiaries' satisfaction 
and provide public information; the NCU will monitor the system on a regular basis.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure 
on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.



Page 10 of 14

The key stakeholders of the project are community members, including ingenuous populations, 
women, government agencies, and the private sector. 
 
In the AF phase, extensive stakeholder consultation took place during project preparation, and will 
continue through implementation. Particularly vulnerable groups, such as women and minority 
indigenous groups, were specifically targeted. This process included six consultation workshops 
and various group interviews held in the following ecoregions (Valles (Cochabamba), Altiplano 
(La Paz), Yungas (Chimore) and Amazon (Rurrenabque). Each consultation comprised two stages: 
(i) discussion on the project concept, its development objectives and eliciting suggestions, the 
project components and discussion on how best to implement and develop partnerships, and (ii) 
discussion on potential risks and how to avoid or mitigate them, listening and answering to 
consultations. As a result, the exercise made it possible to gather a comprehensive set of 
recommendations, in particular with respect to  minority indigenous groups  and gender issues. 
 
Consultations with a total of 496 participants were held between August and September 2016. In 
addition, through structured interviews and questionnaires the PIU collected and analyzed valuable 
socio-economic data for the social assessment. In addition to these primary sources of data and 
inputs from stakeholders, secondary sources such as existing studies and project reports were  
reviewed to ensuring appropriate design and targeting in terms of indigenous groups, gender, cross 
generation needs and priorities, and mitigation of social risks and impacts.

Other Decision (as needed) 
 
 
B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 

1. The Republic of Congo (ROC) is sparsely inhabited, with a population of 4.4 million people 
and ranks among the least densely populated in the world (12.8/km

2
). The country has an   

urbanization rate of about 62 percent, with more than half of the population living in 

Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire, its two largest cities. Oil’s share of total GDP increased from 

56 percent in 2000-2004 to 66 percent in 2010-2014 and – despite the recent oil price decline 

– still accounts for more than half of GDP and more than 80 percent of total exports. 

Agricultural exports (palm oil, sugar, and cocoa) are stagnant and the country suffers from a 

rapidly deteriorating trade balance for food. ROC’s cereal import dependency ratio is 94 

percent
1
.  

 

2. ROC is highly endowed in natural resources, but with poor social indicators. The 
country is largely covered by the Congo Forest Basin, with 31 percent of its total surface area 

comprising cultivable land. The country is also endowed with significant hydrocarbon 

reserves with an estimated 1.6 billion barrels of oil reserves and with a proven 90 billion m
3
 

of natural gas, respectively the 4
th

 largest oil reserves and the 5
th

 largest natural gas reserves 

in Sub-Saharan Africa. In addition, the country is significantly endowed in mining ore such 

as iron, potash and magnesium. However, ROC’s key social indicators, notably health and 

education outcomes, as well as service delivery in these sectors, are much lower than 

countries with similar resource endowments, evidence of the Country’s inability to harness 

its potential into dividends for its citizens. 

 

3. High vulnerability of the economy and inequality. Despite steady GDP growth of 5 
percent over the past 10 years, ROC continues to suffer from high rates of poverty and 

inequality due to jobless growth. 63 percent of the population are self-employed in either 

agriculture or the informal services, with youth severely affected by unemployment. The 

unemployment rate for those aged 15-29 is 32.7 percent.
2
 The country has a Gini coefficient 

of 0.45 with a poverty incidence of 74.8 percent in rural areas against 32.3 percent in urban 

areas. Gender and disability have an indirect impact on poverty as women and disabled 

persons exhibit lower levels of education and employment opportunities. The ROC’s Gender 

Inequality country index is 137 out of 157 countries. Cultural division of labor and a 

preference for boys regarding expenditure on education often work against women. The 

malnutrition rate remains high (32 percent), with a total of 1.4 million people estimated as

malnourished
3
 and 31 percent of children stunted. Food and nutrition insecurity is driven by: 

(a) inadequate access to quality food; (b) poor hygiene practices and lack of awareness of 

food and nutrition requirements; and (c) unsafe food.    

 

4. Business climate and access to financial services. ROC was listed the 177
th

 country out of 

190 in the ranking of the World Bank Doing Business report 2017, which noted it takes an 

average of 50 days to register a business well beyond the regional average of 27.3. Access to 

finance is cited as the second highest constraint by businesses
4
. Bank credit to agriculture 

accounts for 6 percent of short-term credit and 17 percent of medium-term credit, and is 

focused primarily on the forestry industry
5
. Microfinance institutions are mostly focused on 

urban markets, and agriculture accounts for only 2 percent of Mutuelles Congolaises 

d’Epargne et de Crédit (MUCODEC)’s portfolio (the largest microfinance institution). Low 

penetration of financial services in rural areas, knowledge of the agriculture sector and 

collateral requirements limit access to credit for producer groups and micro, small and 

medium agribusiness enterprises (MSME).  

 

5. Private sector development. The private sector in ROC is largely fragmented with little or 
no structured public-private dialogue taking place to improve the enabling environment for 

business. The contribution of the private sector to growth is limited, as reflected by the level 

of private investments (excluding oil), which represents only 5 percent of GDP (against 14 

percent on average in Sub-Saharan Africa and 25 percent of GDP in Asia). Sectors with 

strong growth potential identified by the Government include transport services, 

agribusiness, forestry and mining. 

 

6. Environment. As part of its Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation 
(REDD+) agenda, ROC is developing an Emissions Reductions Program in the Sangha and 

Likouala departments. The government program seeks to access a variety of REDD+ funding 

sources like the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF), the Forest Investment Program 

(FIP), and the Central Africa Forest Initiative (CAFI). ROC’s forests are at risk of 

deforestation due to mineral extraction, road development, illegal logging, agricultural 

expansion and charcoal collection. In addition, trends
6
 indicate that exposure to periods of 

intense rainfall has been increasing. ROC, in its recently submitted Intended Nationally 

Determined Contribution (INDC), has highlighted agriculture among its priority areas. 

Climate actions with regards to agriculture will embrace adaptation and mitigation through 

the promotion of agro-forestry plantations, an increase in the number of producer 

associations, and production of bioenergy.

 Undernourishment means that a person is not able to acquire enough food to meet the daily minimum dietary 

energy requirements, over a period of one year. FAO defines hunger as being synonymous with chronic 
undernourishment. Food Hunger Map 2015.

Sectoral and Institutional Context 

7. Agriculture, including forestry, employs about 40 percent of the labor force and contributes 
5 percent of GDP. Approximately 498,000 people are actively engaged in agricultural 

production, of which 70 percent are female. With an average rainfall of 1,200 mm per year 

and only 2 percent of the 10 million hectares of arable land exploited, the agricultural sector 

holds potential for growth. ROC has three types of agricultural production systems: (i) 

subsistence agriculture, mainly composed of small-scale producers farming 1 to 2 hectares 

per household, and accounts for 90 percent of agricultural output. Subsistence producers 

cultivate primarily staple crops such as plantain, cassava, ground nuts, maize, potatoes, 

beans, banana, and yam. Yields of these crops are lower on average than in other Sub-

Saharan countries mainly due to the poor quality of planting materials, the low use of 

fertilizer and the limited access to improved technologies and mechanization; (ii) urban and 

peri-urban agriculture is mainly composed of producers with small-scale gardens and semi-

modern commercial farms producing for urban consumers; and (iii) agro-industrial 

production systems, mainly monocultures geared towards export markets or niche urban 

markets. Apart from that of sugar cane, the production of traditional export and cash crops 

(e.g. coffee, cocoa, palm oil and rice) collapsed over the past couple of decades. A few large 

private agribusiness investors have recently started to invest again in these crops (including 

large-scale maize cultivation and the revival of palm oil and cocoa plantations). 

 

8. The cumulative effects of the different production systems have left an undeniable 
impact on the environment. Studies revealed that the sector contributes a total of 79 percent 

of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
7
. Subsistence farming has promoted deforestation 

through slash and burn shifting cultivation techniques. As a result, particularly in the 

Province of Plateau, producers are experiencing: (i) earlier planting times and longer crop 

cycles; (ii) soil degradation, which makes some crops no longer suitable; and (iii) greater 

occurrences of flooding. Lastly, peri-urban vegetable and fish farming are competing with 

growing demand for water from urban dwellers. 

 

9. Gender in agriculture. Women are underrepresented in politics and higher levels of 
government, even though the Family Code protects them against racial, ethnic and sexual 

discrimination. Women earn less than men and are more likely to be self-employed as they 

do not have equal opportunities for accessing secondary education and paid employment. 

Labor market analyses show that gender employment gaps result from unequal access to 

education and skills training. Lack of education gives women limited power in business and 

social dealings with men, who typically are better educated. Women are customarily 

encouraged to focus on subsistence farming, family and child-rearing activities (fertility rate 

is high at 3.8 percent) and, as a result, 70 percent of the country’s agricultural workforce are 

women. Congolese women face additional barriers compared to men in accessing credit, 

agriculture inputs, land ownership and labor.   

 

10. Agricultural skills, competencies and jobs. Access to formal paid wage job is very limited

for the youth who are more likely to be unemployed. If they manage to find a job, those aged 

15-29 are more likely to be employed by a household (15 percent) or by an SME (12 

percent)
8
. There is only one institute for higher education in agriculture, Ecole Nationale 

Supérieure d’Agronomie et de Foresterie (ENSAF), with approximately additional 7 

agriculture vocational skills training centers. They are under resourced and do not offer all of 

the relevant skills and entrepreneurship training. Internship arrangements with the private 

sector are difficult to organize and the capacity to train masters and doctoral students is 

limited. 

  

11. Demand for food is high and growing in domestic and regional markets. ROC is highly 
dependent on food imports, with a negative trade balance. Food imports increased from US 

$197 million to US$240 million between 2007 and 2013, and spiked to US$353 million in 

2011. Volumes of imported food in 2013 included 104,567 tons of wheat, 50,581 tons of 

palm oil, 45,878 tons of chicken meat, 41,541 tons of rice and 38,455 tons of wheat flour
9
.
 

The domestic cassava market is valued at US$ 174 million with some value addition already 

taking place. Cassava is consumed by 90 percent of the population. There is a high 

consumption of chicken at household level and consumption of other livestock products is 

expected to grow significantly, e.g. 80 million eggs and 15,000 tons of pork per annum by 

2020
10

. Demand for milk (and milk-based products) is high and growing. Fish consumption 

is at 24.4 kg per head per year, one of the highest in Africa. Other regional markets present 

sizable opportunities as well, for instance the Kinshasa market (over 12 million inhabitants) 

in the Democratic Republic of Congo, or other neighboring countries such as Angola, Gabon 

and Cameroon.  

 

12. Food safety concerns are huge and compounded by the absence of a food policy and 
regulatory framework. No analysis has been done to understand the national cost of food 

borne diseases (e.g. loss of human lives, cost of treatment and loss of income especially on 

poor households). Food safety issues from imports include: (i) food spoilage; (ii) absence of 

harmonized food and product standards; (iii) poor product quality (e.g. expired food, 

deceitful labelling and high levels of preservatives in food); (iv) limited coordinated national 

surveillance and inspection capacity; and (vi) no laboratories for food testing. In addition to 

the risks created by limited awareness amongst consumers and low levels of hygiene 

standards (e.g. unregistered food street vendors & unsanitary urban markets), additional food 

safety risks from domestic agriculture include: (i) the use of animal waste and sewage on 

crops as agriculture fertilizer; (ii) poor harvesting and post-harvest handling (raises risks of 

mycotoxins and aflatoxins); and (iii) unhygienic agricultural transport systems.          

 

13. Every segment across the agriculture value chain is characterized by under 
development and fragmentation. Most inputs are imported, at high cost with no quality 

assurance. Agricultural production is performed in a rudimentary, inefficient, low input-

output model making unit costs of production much higher than imported commodities. The

transport sector is managed by cartels that fix the transport prices, making it difficult for 

producers to transport commodities and processors to source primary material. There is only 

a few domestic agro-processing companies and the distribution and retail of food is done 

mostly through formal open markets, informal markets and small corner stores. There are 

only seven registered retail outlets (supermarkets) in urban areas selling mostly imported 

food.  

 

14. Commercial agricultural production is constrained by a multiplicity of factors. The 
competitiveness of domestic production – in value chains such as poultry, piggery, and fish 

for livestock, cassava and groundnuts for staple crops, and cocoa and palm oil for cash crops 

– is hampered by: (i) sector specific legislative and governance constraints (seed policies, 

land access, food safety policies and guidelines, taxes and registration procedures for the 

legal status of cooperatives); (ii) weak producer organizations (iii) non-existent agricultural 

extension and veterinary services and obsolete Research and Development (R&D) capacity;  
(iv) high costs of agricultural inputs (seeds, fertilizers, land, animal feed, credit); (v) an 

ageing and under skilled workforce; and  (vi) poor road and communication networks and 

costly logistics and energy services.  

 

15. A substantial number of smallholders have the potential to engage successfully in 
commercially demanding value chains.

11
 These producers are found amongst farms located 

outside cities and towns (urban and peri-urban) as well as within specific value chains (e.g. 

cocoa, palm oil).
12

 These producers work in groups but are often marginalized from higher-

value markets due to high unit costs of production, poor infrastructure and limited access to 

credit and technical assistance. Three main profiles have been identified in the ROC of SMEs 

that are currently operating in the agribusiness sector and could establish business 

relationships with producer groups for commercial agriculture: (i) suppliers of critical inputs 

(e.g. day-old chicks, veterinary medicine and technical assistance provided by 

Transcontinental Business Néerlandais (TBN) in Pointe-Noire); (ii) off-takers for agricultural 

products (e.g. tropical fruits to produce concentrate bought by Bayo in Brazzaville); and (iii) 

firms that are both input suppliers and off-takers (e.g. supplying cassava cuttings then 

purchasing of cassava for saka-saka processing by Agridec in Dolisie).

 M.H. Collion, Rural Productive Partnerships: An Inclusive Agribusiness Model for Overcoming Small-holder 
Market Barriers, World Bank, 2012. This finding is echoed by studies in Africa and Asia which indicate that 50-70% 
of farmers are unable to move out of subsistence (S. Ferris et alt., Linking Smallholder Farmers to Markets and the 
Implications for Extension and Advisory Services, MEAS Discussion Paper 4, 2014). 
12

 The Ministry of Agriculture holds a Registry of Farmer Cooperatives that totals 1,055 cooperatives nation-wide, 
out of which 25% (approximately 250) are estimated to be active according to a survey conducted by the Ministry 
in 2015.  According to records from ongoing projects (PDARP, PADE), there are approximately more than 500 
additional active producer groups that are not registered with the Ministry since they registered at the 
Department level or they decided to register as an Association with the Ministry of Interior instead. There are 
therefore approximately 800 active producer groups (associations/cooperatives) in Congo, totaling approximately 
16,000 smallholders.

17. Additional development challenges to be considered. The project will also help address 
nutrition and food insecurity by promoting producer groups’ access to nutrition and climate 

sensitive technology, agriculture extension services, and by supporting MSMEs to produce 

fortified and enriched foods in the market. Skills development and job creation for youth 

challenges (auto-employment, semi-permanent, temporary jobs, etc.) will be addressed 

through support to internship arrangements between institutes of higher learning and the 

private sector. 

The gender gap 

with respect to 

access to 

services, inputs 

and finance and 

ownership of 

economic 

resources will be 

reduced by 

promoting female 

producer groups’ 

access to 

matching grants. 

Female owned 

MSMEs will also 

be promoted 

through access to 

a tailored 

technical 

assistance 

package for 

women MSMEs 

(business 

leadership, 

entrepreneurship 

training, 

mentorship and networking support).  Targeting principles and the approaches by component 

are described in Box 1. 
 
 

A. Project Components 

Component 1: Direct support to producer groups and agribusiness MSMEs (IDA: US$25 million)  

18. Component 1 seeks to increase productivity and value addition along value chains, and 
improve food and nutrition security. Support provided under this component will be through 

a matching grant program financing technical assistance and productive investments to 

support production, marketing and processing activities. This component has two sub-

components. 

Box 1: Targeting Principles 

Two basic principles will guide project design: (i) an open menu approach with 

respect to the selection of value chains, subsectors and business opportunities; 

and (ii) a geographical concentration and targeting of project interventions where 

commercial opportunities and the need for support have been identified and 

expressed by market actors (producers, processors and others). The rationale for 

an open menu is to avoid excluding any potentially viable value chain and 

business opportunity. The project’s geographical focus will start where 

commercial agriculture has the strongest potential: the three main cities of 

Brazzaville, Pointe Noire and Dolisie and in the North of the country. In its first 

component, the project will directly support private sector initiative in agriculture 

by facilitating market access for producer groups and agribusiness MSMEs. 

Support to producer groups will follow a Productive Alliance approach through 

which these producer groups target new markets and seek to establish commercial 

relationships with buyers and off-takers. Support to MSMEs will focus on 

helping agribusiness firms to connect with specific off-takers and markets (both 

domestic and export), through  sound business plan development, supply chain 

development for sourcing quality raw materials, and access to know-how to 

improve processing techniques, relevant market information and/or equipment, 

etc.  

 

The second component will support public investments in agricultural service 

roads and other improved public infrastructure (e.g. access to electricity and 

water supply for agro-processing) selected based on the location (clustering) of 

the demand for sub-projects from producer groups and agribusiness MSMEs in 

Component 1. Producer groups and agribusiness MSMEs will need to identify 

(along with their expression of interest) if their value chain development activities 

are constrained by the lack of viable infrastructure. Activities in Component 2 

will also contribute to improving the business climate for commercial agriculture. 

Lastly, the project will support the strengthening of institutional capacities for 

commercial agriculture development in its third component.

Subcomponent 1.1: Sustainable intensification and commercialization of crop and animal 

production (IDA: US$ 20 million)  

19. Objective and instruments used. This subcomponent will support producer groups in 
Productive Alliance arrangements with buyers and markets for increased production, value 

addition and improved marketing of their products. It will support the intensification of 

production and commercialization of products within supported value chains through 

technical assistance and financing of business plans using a matching grant scheme 

administered through a Productive Alliance approach.  

 

20. Productive Alliance approach.
13

 Productive Alliances will aim to develop the managerial 

and technical capacity of producer groups and help them implement business plans that 

include support for productive investment (access to inputs, production facilities, nutrition 

and climate-sensitive technology) and technical assistance (agriculture advisory, extension 

services and business development skills and practices). The project will also seek to 

strengthen existing business arrangements between producer groups and buyers and/or 

support new ones.  

 

21. Business plans. Producer groups will be supported to translate their vision and strategy into 
a business plan that clearly identifies specific markets, marketing plans and technical and 

financial needs. Business plans are expected to finance a series of investments (depending on 

market requirements, the supply chain and associated constraints), such as: (i) improved 

access to quality inputs (e.g. seeds, cuttings, chicks, fertilizer, feed, water through small 

pumped and piped irrigation systems, etc.); (ii) infrastructure and/or equipment for 

processing; and (iii) infrastructure and/or equipment to improve the storage and transport to 

reach target markets. Investments will systematically be accompanied with technical 

assistance to install and maintain the investment and to improve the producer group’s 

marketing skills and management of its business and finances. The matching grants, 

however, will be awarded based on a competitive process. Applicants will have to meet a set 

of eligibility criteria to present their business plan, which will then be assessed on the basis 

of additional relevant prioritization criteria
14

. In forest areas, application of REDD+ 

principles will for instance be a precondition for relevant value chains. Female producer 

groups will receive tailored technical assistance that will include business leadership 

networking support to enable them to access markets and manage business operations.

Subcomponent 1.2: Development of agro-industrial activities (IDA: US$ 5 million) 

22. Objective and instruments used. This subcomponent will support the competitiveness of 
MSMEs involved in agribusiness, from input supply to the production, processing and 

distribution of agricultural products, as well as the delivery of agri-based services. These 

actors face efficiency challenges linked to the cost of processing, packaging and marketing 

their products. Efficiency gains in operations will result in higher quality agricultural 

products (nutritional and safety standards compliant), jobs (full, part-time and seasonal), and 

a secure market that rewards farmers with quality produce with higher prices. Female owned 

MSMEs will access a technical assistance plus package (business leadership, 

entrepreneurship training, with additional mentorship and networking support) to support 

them to bridge specific gender related challenges. This subcomponent will aim to allow 

MSMEs to have better access to training, equipment and skills they need to develop their 

business. 

 

23. Business plans. Agribusiness MSMEs will be able to apply for grants on a competitive basis 
through the same matching-grant scheme as the one described for Subcomponent 1.1. They 

will have to submit a business plan that identifies market demand for the firm’s products and 

services and shows returns on investment and financial sustainability of the firm’s 

operations, while clearly demonstrating that the investment contributes to addressing at least 

one of the following challenges: product upgrade, process improvement, new product 

development, volume increase, or reduction of the environmental footprint. The matching 

grants will cover technical assistance and equipment. Technical assistance will systematically 

accompany equipment requests to ensure the proper use and maintenance of the investment. 

Eligibility and prioritization criteria will be applied to maximize the transparency of the 

Promotion plans and 

activities targeting 

potential members of 

productive alliances. 

This process 

continues during the 

call for proposals 

phase.

Public calls for 

potential productive 

alliance partners (i.e. 

producer groups, 

input suppliers, 

buyers, etc.) to 

present business 

plans. 

The calls will be 

accompanied by a 

communications 

campaign, as well as 

field information and 

training workshops.

Component 2: Improving public infrastructure and the business climate for commercial 

agriculture (IDA: US$ 45 million) 
24. This component aims to foster the development of commercial agriculture by lifting 

constraints in terms of infrastructure and business climate. This component consists of two 

sub-components:  

 

Subcomponent 2.1: Public infrastructure for the development of commercial agriculture (IDA: US$ 

37 million)  

25. Objective and instruments used. This subcomponent will contribute to the development of 
basic infrastructure essential for the promotion of commercial agriculture and the emergence 

of an agro-industry. It will include public investments in the rehabilitation and maintenance 

of the feeder road network and improved access to other public infrastructure (e.g. access to 

electricity and water supply for agro-processing, and other public infrastructure) in a targeted 

way.  

 

26. Prioritization criteria. High logistical costs and limited access to markets are major 
obstacles faced by the private sector. To address these important issues, the project will make 

a provision to ensure public investments in infrastructure: (i) are identified by the 

Government as infrastructure of a public nature; and (ii) are located in targeted geographic 

zones where producer groups and MSMEs promoting commercial agriculture development 

express interest in receiving Productive Alliance and / or MSME support (see Component 1). 

 

27. Sustainability of investments. Technical assistance will also be provided through this 
subcomponent to selected departmental councils to implement the new road maintenance 

strategy developed with the assistance of the Agricultural Development and Rural Roads 

Rehabilitation Project (PDARP) in order to make such maintenance more sustainable.  

 

Subcomponent 2.2: Governance and regulatory framework for commercial agriculture (IDA: US$ 8 

million) 

28. Objective and instruments used. This subcomponent aims to improve the legal and 
regulatory framework for commercial agriculture. It will do so by: (i) establishing and 

financing platforms for public-private dialogue on commercial agriculture at the 

departmental and national levels to identify needed reforms; (ii) providing technical 

assistance to draft the identified legislation and regulations; (iii) policy advocacy with 

parliamentarians (e.g. policy notes, sensitization, training); and (iv) conducting sensitization, 

dissemination and training activities toward relevant stakeholders (i.e. ministries and public 

institutions, producer groups, agribusiness MSMEs and other private sector actors, etc.) on 

drafted legislations and regulations pertaining to commercial agriculture. 

 

29. Public-Private Dialogue (PPD) on commercial agriculture. The project will build on the 
mechanism for public-private dialogue put in place with the support of PADE to start a

public-private dialogue specifically on commercial agriculture by providing technical 

assistance and budget support to set up and operate PPD platforms
16

 on commercial 

agriculture at the departmental and national levels. The platforms are expected to identify and 

contribute to building consensus around changes to legislation and practices that constrain 

commercial agriculture.    

 

30. Identified reforms. Some of the needed improvements to constraining legislation specific to 
commercial agriculture have already been identified with stakeholders and their drafting will 

be supported by the project. The legislation pertains to: (i) compliance with the Organisation 

pour l’Harmonisation du Droit des affaires en Afrique (OHADA) Uniform Act on 

Cooperatives; (ii) National Seed Policy in compliance with the norms of the Economic 

Community of Central African States (CEEAC); (iii) Rural Code to clarify and secure land 

access; and (iv) food safety policy and regulatory framework, standards and the certification 

of products
17

. 

 

Component 3: Strengthening institutional capacities to support the development of commercial 

agriculture (IDA: US$ 30 million) 

31. The objective of this component is to strengthen the capacity of public and non-public 
service providers involved in the implementation of project activities and / or supporting the 

development of commercial agriculture in the Republic of Congo. At the same time, it will 

ensure and oversee the successful management and implementation of the project, while 

making a provision to enable an immediate response in case of declared crisis or emergency. 

This component has three sub-components: 

 

Subcomponent 3.1: Capacity-building of institutions providing support to commercial agriculture 

(IDA: US$20 million) 

32. Objective and instruments used. The subcomponent will provide equipment, training and 
operating cost support to government and non-government actors that are necessary for 

commercial agriculture to succeed, including a number of technical departments of the 

Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries (MAEP).  

 

33. Targeted institutions. These capacity-building efforts will target institutions involved in key 
areas related to: (i) agricultural statistics services; (ii) the access to improved genetic 

materials; (iii) the implementation of the reform of the national public system for agricultural 

extension and advisory services; (iv) the agricultural vocational and higher education training 

systems; and (v) the policy framework for food safety, quality standards and product 

certification supported in Subcomponent 2.2
18

. 

                                                           
16

 When business practices and legislation identified by these sector-specific PPD platforms are economy-wide in nature (e.g. easing business 
entry and business exit, facilitating trade across borders, etc.), the project will share these inputs with PADE, which is better placed to address 
them. When identified reforms are specific to commercial agriculture, and if a strong consensus can be built with stakeholders from the public 
and private sectors around them, the project will provide support for their drafting through this subcomponent. 
17

 See Annex 1 for more detail on the reforms that have been identified. 
18

 A list of the institutions identified for capacity-building support includes: (i) the Studies and Planning Department 
of MAEP; (ii) the Ministry of Scientific Research and Technical Innovation through the Institut National de 
Recherche Agronomique (IRA) and the Centre National de Semences Améliorées (CNSA), among others; (iii) the

Subcomponent 3.2: Project management, coordination and monitoring at national and provincial 

levels (IDA: US$ 10 million)  
34. This subcomponent will support project management, coordination, communication, 

monitoring and evaluation, adequate monitoring of the environmental and social safeguard 

policies, at the national level as well as at the departmental levels. Under this subcomponent, 

a strong fiduciary management system will be introduced and an effective monitoring and 

evaluation framework will be designed, which will not only monitor impact indicators, but 

will also ensure real time data collection that will facilitate the adoption of corrective 

measures in a timely manner and even attempt to integrate the data into the national 

agricultural statistics database.  

 

35. Through this subcomponent, the project will finance a baseline study, mid-term review study, 
final impact assessment, the recruitment of staff, consultancy services, the acquisition of 

property and equipment, and will support relevant seminars and training, as well as diverse 

operating costs to supervise the project activities. 

 
Component 4: Contingency emergency response (IDA: US$ 0.0M) 

36. This component will provide support for immediate response to an eligible crisis or 
emergency, as needed. A crisis or emergency eligible for financing is: an event that has 

caused, or is likely to imminently cause, a major adverse economic and/or social impact to 

the Borrower, associated with a natural or man-made crisis or disaster. Rapid disbursement 

of funds will allow the Government to request a reallocation of project funds to partially 

cover emergency response and recovery costs. This component will be triggered if: (i) the 

Government has determined that an eligible crisis or emergency has occurred and has 

furnished to the Bank a request to include said activities in the Contingency Emergency 

Response Component (CERC) for emergency response; (ii) the Government has prepared 

and disclosed all safeguards instruments required for said activities; (iii) the Borrower has 

adopted the CERC Operations Manual (OM) in form, substance and manner acceptable to the 

Bank. A specific OM for this component will be prepared detailing financial management, 

procurement, safeguards, and any other necessary implementation arrangements. While 

Components 1, 2 and 3 focus on pre-crisis disaster risk mitigation and climate resilience 

enhancement measures, Component 4 will help to strengthen the Government’s capacity to 

respond effectively to an eligible crisis or emergency. 
 
 
E. Implementation 
 
Institutional and Implementation Arrangements 

37. The institutional arrangements proposed for this project, under the supervision of the 

                                                                                                                                                                                           
Cooperative Action Department of MAEP and Agricongo among others; (iv) the Ministry of Higher Education 
through the Ecole Nationale Supérieure d'Agronomie et de Foresterie (ENSAF), among others; and (v) institutions 
identified through the food safety reform supported in Subcomponent 2.2. See Annex 1 for more detail on the 
institutional capacity-building work of Subcomponent 3.1.

Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries (MAEP), includes the following supervisory 

and implementation bodies: (i) a Steering Committee; (ii) a National Coordination Unit of 

the project (including a Matching Grant scheme); (iii) Project Implementation Units at 

departmental level; (iv) technical service providers (public, private, NGOs); and (v) financial 

institutions, which will render financial services to the private sector (producer groups, 

agribusiness MSMEs) (See Figure 2). 

 

38. Public service providers will participate in the project through the structures of the MAEP, 
The ongoing reform of MAEP and the introduction of specialized agencies is an opportunity 

for re-thinking and repositioning the role of public technical services, including agriculture 

advisory and extension services.  

Steering Committee (CP)  
39. A high level Steering Committee will be officially established before effectiveness. It will be 

chaired by the Minister in charge of Agriculture and composed of representatives of key 

project stakeholders (relevant ministries, private sector, and civil society including producer 

groups) in the project. The Steering Committee will be responsible for the strategic direction, 

operational oversight, communication and overall good governance of the project. 

 

National Project Coordination Unit (NPCU)  

40. It is proposed that the current PDARP national project coordination unit, with a proven track 
record in administrative and fiduciary management, be retained and strengthened to 

coordinate and manage the Commercial Agricultural Project. The NPCU will be responsible 

for project implementation, management, coordination, monitoring and evaluation, and 

supervision. The NPCU will rely on specific expertise, including the hiring of an independent 

firm contracted for the management of the matching grant program of Component 1.  

 

Project Implementation Units (PIUs) 

41. Four Project Implementation Units will be established at departmental level to support 
specific zones targeted by the project. They will ensure project activity monitoring and 

evaluation as well as receive and process complaints related to the implementation of the 

project in collaboration with the authorities and civil society.

SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY 

 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

Activities from Subcomponent 1.1: Intensification of 
Agricultural and Livestock value chains; 
Subcomponent 1.2: Development of logistic, trade 
and business services; and Subcomponent 2.1: 
Public Infrastructure for Agribusiness and Agro 
industrial Development are expected to impact 
environment and these impacts are evaluated to be 
moderate, localized and manageable; so the project 
is classified to the EA category “B”. And the 
Environmental Safeguards Policies triggered are 
PO/PB 4.01 "Environmental Assessment"; PO/PB 
4.04 "Natural Habitats"; OP/PB 4.09 "Pest 
management and pesticides"; PO/PB 4.10 
"Indigenous Peoples"; PO/PB 4.11 "Physical Cultural 
Resources"; OP/PB 4.12 "Involuntary Relocation"; 
PO/PB 4.36 "Forests"; OP/PB 7.50 Projects relating 
to International Waterways; PO/PB 17.50: Right of 
access to information. 
To ensure that any environmental issues by the 
project activities are appropriately addressed, the 
safeguard instrument elaborated according OP/BP 
4.01 is the Environmental and Social Management 
Framework (ESMF). This one is also designed to 
serve as a guide for developing ESIAs and ESMPs as 
needed, when the exact sites of sub-projects will be 
known. In particular, the ESIA will include a 
diagnostic of the project areas, potential 
environmental adverse impacts, potential issues 
related to labor influx, and mitigation measures to 
manage properly expected adverse impacts. The 
ESIA will highlight specific provisions that need to be 



 

The World Bank  
Congo Commercial Agriculture Project (P159979) 

 

 

  
Mar 22, 2017 Page 17 of 25  

 

included in construction/installation contracts to 
ensure that contractors’ ESMPs address relevant 
mitigation measures. 
The ESMF include specific sections to address all 
issues related to OP/BP 4.04 on Natural Habitats; 
OP/BP 4.36 on Forests and OP/BP 4.11 on Physical 
Cultural Resources. 
 

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 Yes 

OP/BP 4.04 is triggered to enable the project to 
perform the screening of the identified sites and 
their vicinities relative to natural habitats, the aim is 
to avoid project activities to create significant 
degradation of natural habitats. Project will also 
seek to identify appropriate conservation measures, 
follow-up, assessment and management of natural 
habitats within the project area. The Government 
will be encouraged to provide necessary information 
to the people and to provide them with the right 
incentives to protect and to support the 
conservation of natural habitats and to facilitate, if 
necessary, the rehabilitation of degraded habitats. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 Yes 

This project could possibly impact the health and 
quality of forests or the rights and welfare of people 
and their level of dependence upon the interaction 
with forests, and it may lead to changes in the 
management, protection or utilization of natural 
forests or plantations. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

OP/BP 4.09 is triggered because the project supports 
activities that requires the use of pesticides, 
fertilizers, vaccines and other chemicals like in the 
production of eggs, of cattle feed and veterinary 
products in the poultry, goats, pigs, cattle, fish 
farming and aquaculture, and some projects 
activities will lead to a surge in the use of pesticides 
and fertilizers which can create negative effects on 
the environment. This policy supports the integrated 
pest control approaches. It identifies pesticides that 
can be financed under the project and develop an 
appropriate plan of pests to deal with risks. To 
comply with this policy a Plan of Management of 
Pests and Pesticides (PMPP) was prepared in 
separated document from the ESMF. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 Yes 
This policy, OP/BP 4.11, is triggered by the project 
because during implementation of project activities, 
it is possible to discover or to affect some cultural 



 

The World Bank  
Congo Commercial Agriculture Project (P159979) 

 

 

  
Mar 22, 2017 Page 18 of 25  

 

relics. The Physical Cultural Resources Policy aims to 
protect cultural resources, to avoid any significant 
conversion (loss) or degradation of these resources. 
To be in compliance with this policy, project has 
developed, into a separate document, the Physical 
Cultural Resources Framework (PCRF). 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 Yes 

Indigenous Peoples are found on a large part of the 
Republic of Congo’s rural territory, and a number of 
the areas visited under project preparation and 
evaluation phase are known to inhabit Indigenous 
Peoples (IPs). This includes the Cuvette (Oyo-
Owando), in the Sangha (Ouesso), and Plateau (Oyo, 
Gamboma). Since the project will be implemented at 
the national level, with specific zones of 
interventions yet to be identified (based on targeted 
crops, agribusiness, and in accordance to the 
national agricultural plan), the project has prepared 
an Indigenous Peoples Policy Framework (IPPF), 
which will establish the framework for consultation 
and inclusion of IPs in the project areas. The project 
will identify various IPs associations and IP 
communities in the selected zones as collaborators, 
as well as potential CSOs and local NGOs. Once the 
specific sites are known, an Indigenous Peoples Plan 
(IPP) will be development, and it would identify the 
targeted IPs, and ensure their inclusion as 
beneficiaries of project activities, in a culturally 
appropriate and inclusive manner. 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

Activities suggested in Component 2, Subcomponent 
2.2 “Public Infrastructure for Agribusiness and Agro 
industrial Development”, may require acquisition of 
land. Due to low population density in rural areas, 
however, the risk of physical resettlement is 
minimal, although there may be potential economic 
displacement or loss of assets.  
The project has prepared the Resettlement Policy 
Framework (RPF) since the exact site locations are 
yet unknown, and eventually Resettlement Action 
Plans (RAP) or Abreviated Resettelement Action 
Plans (ARAP) will be prepared to mitigate potential 
negative impacts.  
This new project is to some regards an extension of 
the Agricultural Development and Rural Roads 
Rehabilitation Project (P095251, and Additional 
Finance P145627). The project established an escrow 



 

The World Bank  
Congo Commercial Agriculture Project (P159979) 

 

 

  
Mar 22, 2017 Page 19 of 25  

 

account of US $500,000 for resettlement 
compensation. Since the project did not require any 
land acquisition and therefore did not induce any 
resettlement (physical or economic displacement), 
no RAPs were prepared for the project. The funds in 
the escrow account remain unused, and the account 
will be transferred to the new project in order to 
fund potential compensation cases for the new 
Commercial Agriculture project.  
 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 No 
This Safeguard Policy is not trigged because no 
project activities involved in dams or located in their 
vicinities. 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

Yes 

OP 7.50 is applicable to the Project because 
activities may have an impact on the Congo, 
Oubangui and Sangha river basins, all of which are 
international waterways. ROC is one of the riparians 
of the Congo-Oubangui-Sangha basin together with 
DRC, Central African Republic, Cameroon, Gabon, 
and Angola. The proposed Project covers primarily 
high potential agricultural zones around the main 
cities of Brazzaville, Pointe Noire and Dolisie, the 
south corridor along the national road from 
Brazzaville to Bouenza and Kouilou and the northern 
part of country, Sangha and Likouala. The planned 
rehabilitations of irrigation systems are very small in 
size. Most of these schemes will be located around 
the three big cities and markets of Brazzaville, Pointe 
Noire and Dolisie (using the rivers of Djoué, Niari, 
Kouilou … ), the country’s bread basket and where 
70% of the population live. The task team has 
carefully considered any potential impacts of the 
proposed investments, and because that: (i) the 
project will not cause appreciable harm to the 
riparian countries; and (ii) no activities are expected 
to have any adverse effects on the water quality or 
quantity, no notification is required under OP 7.50 
since the project deals only with micro/minor 
irrigation rehabilitation, and thus falls under the 
exception to the notification requirement under 
paragraph 7 (a) of the Policy. An exception memo 
has been prepared and was approved by the AFRVP 
on May 15, 2017. 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No This Safeguard Policy is not triggered.

KEY SAFEGUARD POLICY ISSUES AND THEIR MANAGEMENT 

 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential 
large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
In agricultural development and infrastructure implementation, the expected negative impacts are inherent in 
deforestation and the loss of biodiversity; soil erosion, silting of rivers, degradation of water courses; pollutions and 
nuisances, the generation of construction waste, rubble and other demolition residues, disruption of activities on land 
rights, etc.  
In the operational phase, the risks relate to pollution and degradation of watercourses linked to the use of pesticides 
and fertilizers; pollution and nuisance due to solid and liquid waste from agricultural activities, pollution of the 
environment by sewage and solid waste disease, risk of accidents, risks (HIV / AIDS) and development of water-related 
diseases (malaria, bilharziasis), social conflicts related to local customs and practices; losses of land and socio-
economic income sources; influx of the population as a result of the installation of structuring facilities, strong 
pressure on land and water with increasing development.  
Terrestrial and aquatic habitats (wetlands) can be altered mainly during the start-up and implementation phase of 
agricultural. But globally, all these impacts are evaluated to be moderate, localized and manageable. 
 
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area: 
This project would increase agricultural productivity, enhance food security and nutrition. No adverse long term or 
indirect environmental or social impacts are expected. 
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts. 
There are no significant negative impacts of the project, designed on the contrary to have positive social and 
environmental impacts. No alternatives were therefore considered to avoid impacts. 
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower 
capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
Based on experience gained through the implementation of the Agricultural Development and Rural Roads 
Rehabilitation Project, a Category B project, the capacity of the Implementing Agency housed in the Ministry of 
Agriculture to implement the Bank’s environmental and social safeguards policies is considered high. An 
environmental specialist has been included as part of the PIU core team, and the project will recruit a social specialist. 
The two specialists will monitor and supervise the environmental and social measures as recommended in the various 
safeguards instruments for the project. The current environmental specialist, as well as the Project Coordinator have 
both benefitted from the World Bank organized capacity-building initiative in November 2016.   
Finally, to manage and monitor safeguards implementation in a timely manner, the PIU will prepare quarterly reports 
of the implementation of the safeguards instruments. The Project will equally ensure that all the instruments (in 
accordance with OP 4.01, OP 4.10, OP 4.11 and OP 4.12) put in place and the Grievance Redress Mechanisms (GRMs). 
The project will monitor indicators set forth in the safeguards instruments. To this extent, the two safeguards 
specialists in the PIU, will closely collaborate with the M&E specialist in the PIU, and reflect the findings in the 
quarterly reports. 
An important lesson learned under the previous Agriculture project was the poor management of grievances. The

Congo Commercial Agriculture Project (P159979) 

 

 

  
Mar 22, 2017 Page 21 of 25  

 

mechanism as established in the safeguards documents were not appropriate or applicable to existing local structures. 
The PIU has drafted a new GRM to manage complaints ensuing from the new project.  
 
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, 
with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
The key stakeholders outside of government structures are agricultural producers, civil society, private sector (MSMEs 
and SMEs), Indigenous Peoples communities and representatives. Overall, the design of the project has been 
participatory at various levels, through consultation with the different stakeholders throughout preparation. This is 
complemented with additional consultations as part of the review of safeguards instruments.  Representatives of the 
national government formulated the design of the project, while regional governments, local authorities, and 
conservation actors provided inputs. The project will be implemented with the participation of local stakeholders.

Pakistan posted the GDP growth of 4.2 percent in FY2014/15, below the 5.1 percent target. Private 
investments as share of GDP declined to 9.7 percent, but overall deficit remained 5.3 percent of GDP, 
0.3 percent higher than estimated. While Pakistan continues to score poorly on doing business 
indicators, there are signs of improvement. Growth in FY16 was expected to be moderate at 4.5 
percent, well below the 5.5 percent target. For FY17, the expected growth is 5.2 percent while for 
FY18 it is projected at 5.5 percent.

Sectoral and Institutional Context

Pakistan’s agriculture sector is heavily depends on irrigation - more than 90 percent of production is 
form irrigated lands. However, per capita availability of useable water is decreasing with population 
growth, pollution and inefficient use of water. An estimated 40 percent of water is lost in the unlined 
watercourses due to seepage, spillage, side leakage and evapotranspiration. In Punjab, out of the total 
59,500 watercourses, about 43,700 were improved in various projects and Government’s National 
Program for Improvement of Watercourses (NPIW). Under PIPIPP 5,500 new watercourses are being 
improved leaving about 10,300 that still need improvements.

C. Proposed Development Objective(s)
Original Project Development Objective(s) - ParentPHORGPDO

The project?s main objective is to improve productivity of water use in irrigated agriculture. This will 
be achieved through improved physical delivery efficiency and irrigation practices, crop 
diversification and effective application of inputs that will translate into greater agricultural output per 
unit of water used. The project?s objectives would contribute to increased agricultural production, 
employment and incomes, higher living standards and positive environmental outcomes.

Proposed Project Development Objective(s) - Additional Financing

The project?s main objective is to improve productivity of water use in irrigated agriculture. This will 
be achieved through improved physical delivery efficiency and irrigation practices, crop 
diversification and effective application of inputs that will translate into greater agricultural output per 
unit of water used. The project?s objectives would contribute to increased agricultural production, 
employment and incomes, higher living standards and positive environmental outcomes.

Key Results 

The AF would support: (a) installation of high efficiency irrigation systems; (b) improvement of 
community irrigation systems; (c) introduction of modern technologies and methods in irrigated 
agriculture, assistance in crop diversification and training; and (d) Project management, construction 
supervision, quality control, technical assistance and training.

.

D. Project Description

The AF would provide resources for: (i) component B of the project related to upgrading of the 
Community Irrigation Systems; (ii) a new sub-component C3 is added focusing on post-harvest 
processing, value addition and market linkages; and (iii) make up for loss of resources due to changes 
in exchange rates between SDRs to USD.
PHCOMP

Component Name:
Upgrading of the Community Irrigation Systems
Comments ( optional)
W/Cs would be improved using only pre-cast concrete sections (PCPS) with water-tight joints. The 
WUAs/farmers would share costs through providing labor, and the Government of the Punjab 



would provide PCPS and other material needed for watercourse improvement. The AF would 
improve 2,000 W/Cs and irrigation schemes – making the total number of schemes under 
component B 11,000.

PHCOMP

Component Name:
Improved Agriculture Technology/Practices and Monitoring and Evaluation
Comments ( optional)
Changes in this component are based on implementation experience and lessons learnt. These 
changes include: (i) supplementing support under sub-component C1 and C2 for monitoring and 
evaluation and impact assessment of the additional works under the AF; and (ii) adding a new sub-
component to address value addition and market access for farmers adopting efficient irrigation 
technologies.

E. Project location and Salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if 
known)
The AF project will be implemented in Punjab province of Pakistan. Agriculture in Punjab is affected 
by waterlogging and salinity. In central and southern Punjab, rainfall is more sporadic and agriculture 
is entirely irrigation dependent.

II. IMPLEMENTATION
The implementation arrangements under the AF will remain the same as for the Original 
Project. The Director General Agriculture (Water Management) (DG-AWM) will continue to be 
responsible for the implementation of the Project. The Directorate of On-Farm Water 
Management (OFWM) has demonstrated that it has the capacity to implement such programs in 
the Punjab.
.

III. SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY
Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional)

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 
4.01

Yes The Government prepared an Environmental 
and Social Assessment (ESA) for the original 
project. An Addendum to ESA covering 
revised and up-scaled scope of work has also 
been prepared. The Addendum is cleared and 
disclosed. The key potentially negative 
environmental and social impacts of the 
proposed interventions under the AF project 
include changes in land use pattern 
particularly where barren/fallow land is 
brought under cultivation, contamination of 
soil and water caused by excessive use of 
agro-chemical inputs, salt build up in crop 
root zone, loss of natural vegetation and trees 
for water course improvement, loss of crops 
caused by water course improvement works, 



and reduced ground water recharge caused by 
water course lining.  These potential impacts 
are temporary and reversible in nature and can 
be mitigated with the help of appropriate 
mitigation measures, such as avoiding 
interventions in the environmental hot spots 
and wildlife protected areas when expanding 
the cultivation fields, awareness raising and 
capacity building of farmers for judicious use 
of chemical inputs, occasional flood irrigation 
in fields using high efficiency irrigation 
systems to avoid salt build-up in soil, tree 
plantation to compensate any tree cutting, 
avoiding cropped area while carrying out the 
water course improvement and other 
construction works during the project, and 
limiting the extent of water course lining in 
the sweet groundwater zone to minimize 
negative impacts on groundwater recharge. 
Some of the new activities proposed under AF 
may have additional environmental impacts 
like those related with disposal of waste and 
wastewater from fruit washing bays and 
cleaning platforms, construction related issues 
with small-scale platforms, and disposal of 
discarded fruits, vegetables (generally and 
largely biodegradable material). Occupational 
health and safety may be an additional 
potential environmental impacts for the new 
activities related to post-harvest processing 
centers. The Addendum proposes adequate 
mitigation measures for these issues and after 
the adequate implementation of mitigation 
measures, no residual impacts are forecasted.

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 No The project supports activities only in already 
disturbed environment and no project site is 
located in any natural habitat.

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No The project does not support any activity in 
the forest land.

Pest Management OP 4.09 No The proposed interventions are likely to 
reduce the quantities of agro-chemicals 
particularly the ones that are water soluble.

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 
4.11

No The project activities will be undertaken 
where cultivation is being practiced for 
decades if not longer. Hence presence of any 
physical cultural resources is extremely 
unlikely.  Chance Find procedures are 
nonetheless included in the main ESA.



Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 No There are no indigenous communities in 
project area.

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 No No land acquisition is envisaged for the 
proposed activities.

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 No The project does not include any component, 
which involves construction of new or 
rehabilitation/upgradation or renovation of 
any existing dam.

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50

Yes An exemption to notification was obtained for 
the original project that also applies to the AF.

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 
7.60

No The project is located in the Punjab province, 
which does not have any disputed area as 
defined in the policy.

IV. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and 
describe any potential large scale,  significant and/or irreversible impacts:

The project prepared an Environmental and Social Assessment (ESA) report, which suggests 
that the proposed project does not pose any long term or irreversible adverse environmental 
impacts. The key potentially negative environmental and social impacts of the proposed 
interventions under the original project include changes in land use pattern particularly where 
barren/fallow land is brought under cultivation, contamination of soil and water caused by 
excessive use of chemical inputs, salt build up in crop root zone, loss of natural vegetation and 
trees for water course improvement and reduced ground water recharge caused by water 
course lining.  Scope of additional work proposed under Component B does not bring in any 
additional or new environmental impacts other than those which have already been covered in 
the ESA prepared for the original project. New activities proposed under Component C3 may 
have additional environmental impacts like those related with disposal of waste and 
wastewater from fruit/vegetable washing bays and cleaning platforms, construction related 
issues with small-scale washing bays and platforms, and disposal of discarded fruits, 
vegetables (generally and largely biodegradable material). Occupational health and safety 
may be an additional potential environmental impacts for the new activities related to post-
harvest processing centers. These potential impacts are temporary and reversible in nature and 
can be mitigated with the help of appropriate mitigation measures, such as avoiding 
interventions in the environmental hot spots and wildlife protected areas when expanding the 
cultivation fields, awareness raising and capacity building of farmers for judicious use of 
chemical inputs, occasional flood irrigation in fields using high efficiency irrigation systems 
to avoid salt build-up in soil, tree plantation to compensate any tree cutting, avoiding cropped 
area while carrying out the water course improvement and other construction works during 
the project, and limiting the extent of water course lining in the sweet groundwater zone to 
minimize negative impacts on groundwater recharge. The Addendum proposes adequate 
mitigation measures for the issues arising out of the implementation of component C3 and 
after the adequate implementation of proposed mitigation measures, no residual impacts are 
forecasted. Land acquisition will not be required for the project rehabilitation works, which 



will be undertaken within their existing boundaries.  There are no indigenous communities in 
the project areas as defined under World Bank OP 4.10 on Indigenous Peoples. The project 
will support livelihoods through improvements in food harvesting and handling of produce. In 
particular, women may benefit from these interventions through decreased work load in post-
harvest processing. The community water course improvement will benefit agricultural 
communities’ especially small farmers.
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in 
the project area:

Agriculture and irrigation development are key priorities of the Government’s development 
agenda with the aim to improve agricultural productivity, irrigation efficiency and livelihood 
of the people. The long term impacts of the project will contribute to reduction in poverty in 
conjunction with environmental protection.
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse 
impacts.

The ESA report elaborates on various project alternatives including, ‘no project’ option, 
alternative irrigation methods, alternative land-leveling methods, alternative methods of on-
farm water conservation and alternative methods of implementation. Analysis concluded that 
high efficiency irrigation results in reduced need of farm inputs such as fertilizers, pesticides, 
fungicides, and herbicides, as well as reduced vulnerability of crops to pest attacks and 
proliferation of weeds, leading to less use of pesticides and herbicides. In addition, fertigation 
(application of fertilizers or other soil additives through the irrigation system) is done through 
drip and sprinkler, which results in increased effectiveness of fertilizers with reduced 
quantities needed.  Similarly, through high efficiency irrigation systems, chemigation 
(application of pesticides, fungicides, and herbicides) is also done through drip and sprinklers, 
resulting in effective use of chemicals with reduced quantities needed. The overall result of 
high efficiency irrigation system is therefore a much reduced usage of chemical inputs and 
introduction of post-harvest technology under AF will help better achieve the PDO. The only 
comparable alternative for this activity is ‘no project option’.
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.

The original ESA is based on detailed assessment and includes an Environment and Social 
Management Plan (ESMP) for any possible environmental and social impacts under the 
project. The Addendum to the ESA uses the same ESMP with some additions related to the 
proposed activities under Component C3 and proposes preparation of a separate ESMP for 
each post-harvest fruit/vegetable processing facility. These ESMPs will need to be cleared by 
the Bank before these facilities can be established. For establishing these facilities, transparent 
and accessible guidelines on the selection process will be established, and communicated 
widely to all farmers to ensure that the selection process is seen as transparent and fair, and 
possible social conflict is avoided. The ESA Addendum is cleared and disclosed.
The original ESA report presents a well-structured organogram for the implementation 
arrangements of EMP. The Director General Agriculture Water Management (DG-AWM) is 
overall responsible for environmental and social performance of the project in accordance 
with the national and WB requirements. An officer is designated as the Environmental and 
Social Coordinator (ESC) for ensuring effective implementation of ESMP. The ESC 



coordinates with the WMOs at the district level, who have been designated as the district 
environmental and social coordinators (DESCs) at district level. The DESCs supervise and 
coordinate with the WUAs and farmers for the actual implementation of the environmental 
and social guidelines and other ESMP requirements. These institutional arrangements have 
been effective in ESMP implementation of the original project and will be continued for AF 
project.
The Project Implementation and Supervision Consultant (PISC) are responsible for 
implementation of ESMP while M&E Consultants are responsible for monitoring. Production 
and maintenance of all documentation outlined in ESMP is to be done by PISC. The client has 
been successfully implementing the ESMP in the original project and understands fully the 
planning and operational levels of safeguards requirements. While GD-AWM does not have 
an environmental management unit within its operational hierarchy, it continues to implement 
project level implementation of ESMP. The implementation performance of environmental 
safeguards in the original project is satisfactory. Quarterly progress reports are done regularly 
and will continue for the AF. Training is conducted for field staff as outlined in the ESA and 
these will continue for the AF. Monitoring will include both quantitative and qualitative data 
through consultations and feedback from beneficiaries, especially women, and will be 
included in the progress reports.
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on 
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.

Key stakeholders consulted at various levels include: (i) People directly affected by the 
Project and Project beneficiaries (i.e., farmers, WUA members, and other villagers), (ii) Sales 
and service companies, (iii) Officials from the Agriculture Department and agriculture 
research institutes, (iv) Environment Protection Agency of Punjab, (v) Academia, (vi) Donors, 
and (vii) NGOs, international organizations, and other interest groups. Consultations with the 
project stakeholders were carried out during preparation of original ESA. The stakeholders 
have remained involved during the implementation including the project affected people, 
project beneficiaries and other local communities in several districts. Similar consultations 
were carried out for AF project during the preparation of the ESA Addendum and will 
continue during the implementation of the AF.

1.  The Republic of Angola is still recovering from a turbulent past despite oil and mineral wealth. 
With approximately 25.8 million inhabitants,  it is the seventh most populated country in Africa. 
Angola is one of the largest oil exporters in the region, and is rich in diamonds and other mineral 
resources. Angola became independent from Portugal in 1975, but was then engulfed in a 27-year 
civil conflict, which ended with a peace accord in 2002. Despite the country➢❨ s upper-middle 
income status with GDP per capita of US$5,400 in 2014, poverty remains pervasive with 30.1 
percent of the population living below the international poverty line in 2008. 
 
2.     Propelled by the end of the civil conflict and the expansion of the oil sector, the Angolan 
economy posted an average growth rate of 12.5 percent between 2004 and 2008. This period of 
high growth was interrupted by the 2008-09 global financial crisis. Following a slowdown 
between 2009 and 2011, when GDP grew at 2.5 percent on average, fast growth resumed in 2012 
(7.6 percent). 
 
3.  Limited progress was made in improving social indicators during the oil boom years. Angola's 
remarkable growth has not been equally shared. Large parts of the population lack access to basic 
services. Life expectancy is 52.3 years and the country ranks 149th out of 188 in the Human 
Development Index. Income inequality is high and marked disparities in regional and urban/rural 
poverty persist. More than half of Angola➢❨ s poor are located in rural areas and depend almost 
exclusively on agriculture for their livelihood. Among the most vulnerable groups in the country 
are women-headed agriculture households, which represent 33 percent of agriculture households. 
 
4.  Angola is experiencing a major macroeconomic shock due to the dramatic oil price drop since 
2014. This is not surprising as oil represents about 30 percent of GDP, over 95 percent of export 
earnings, and 75 percent of government revenue. The country faces a scarcity of foreign exchange 
(FX), fiscal and external deficits, higher inflation and weakened economic activity. The impact on 
households are considerable. Lower government expenditures and a reduced public sector wage 
bill have resulted in reduced private consumption, compounded by the elimination of fuel 
subsidies. Because of the crisis, GDP growth is forecasted at just 0.9 percent in 2016, followed by 
a rebound of about 3 percent in 2017 . 
 
5. The government has implemented bold fiscal measures since mid-2015 to address the effects of 
the oil price drop, but challenges remain on the monetary front. A revised budget was adopted in 
March 2015 to reflect the major shortfall in revenue, with oil prices dropping from US$80 in the 
initial budget to US$40. The government cut capital expenditure by nearly half, and significantly 
reduced fuel subsidies. The Strategy to Exit the Crisis brought further fiscal consolidation 
measures such as the institution of a new tax on financial transactions and the cancellation of 
double payments to former combatants. The adjustment however has not progressed much on the 
monetary and external sector. Although interest rates have risen and the currency has devalued, 
inflation reached 29.2 percent in May and the spread between the official and parallel exchange 
rate has more than doubled. Imports have been contained and international reserves have been 
kept high due to strong administrative controls on access to foreign exchange (FX). As a result, 
companies are postponing investments and reducing production because they cannot import the 
inputs needed. 
 
6. Despite recent reforms, Angola➢❨ s investment climate remains challenging. The country 
underperforms in competitiveness, business environment, and governance rankings. For example, 
the World Economic Forum➢❨ s Global Competitiveness Report (GCR) 2014-2015 ranked

Angola 140th out of 144 economies while the country ranks 181st out of 189 economies in the 
Doing Business 2016 report, suggesting a complex regulatory environment. Angola lags other 
Sub-Saharan Africa countries in the 2015 Worldwide Governance Indicators. Recent reforms 
include a reduction in the costs and requirements to start a business, a new Labor Code, and an 
overhaul of investment policy. Other efforts are underway to modernize tax and customs 
administration, and the justice sector. Well implemented, they could contribute to a more 
effective and transparent government interaction with the private sector. However, institutional 
weaknesses and governance issues defy reform implementation. Overall, Angola➢❨ s business 
environment is characterized by cumbersome regulations, constrained competition and 
considerable government presence in economic activity. Limited access to finance, poor 
infrastructure, weak workforce skills and corruption are the main constraints mentioned by firms. 
 
7. Diversifying the economy away from oil is an urgent priority and part of the Government➢❨ s 
response to the oil price crisis. Dependency on oil leaves Angola vulnerable to price and 
production shocks. For years, an overvalued exchange rate contributed to reduce the 
competitiveness of the non-oil sectors. The government crisis response strategy, presented in 
February 2016, aims at reducing the reliance on oil to generate revenues, substitute imports and 
promote non-traditional exports. Agricultural production plays a large role in the government➢❨  
strategy. Diversifying the economy will require economic transformation and eliminating 
obstacles to private investment, as well as efficient use of government resources to address 
infrastructure bottlenecks, and invest in human capital.
Sectoral and Institutional Context
8.  Angola➢❨ s agriculture potential remains largely untapped. The country has an abundance of 
land, water, and diversity of climatic and soil conditions for the production of a large variety of 
crops, but only 8 percent of its 58 million hectares of arable land is currently cultivated .  The 
agricultural sector in Angola currently represents around 5 percent of GDP, compared to 57.7 
percent for industry, including extractive, and 37.7 percent for services, and could contribute 
more to employment creation, especially for the youth. Nonetheless, agriculture is the main 
source of income for 90 percent of the 8.5 million Angolans living in rural areas (about 37 percent 
of the population). 
 
9.  Once a large exporter of coffee, cotton, sisal, sugar cane, bananas and tobacco, Angola➢❨ s 
agriculture sector suffered widespread destruction during the conflict and has not fully recovered 
since. Before the war the country was self-sufficient in all food crops except wheat. The exodus 
of Portuguese settlers after independence and the ensuing civil war that ravaged the country 
meant the loss of technical capacity and infrastructure destruction, cutting production areas from 
markets. Roads, bridges and other rural infrastructure were largely destroyed. Large-scale 
population displacement in rural areas and land mines➢❨ as many as 10 million➢❨ further 
constrained the sector recovery.  
 
10.  Production has been growing in recent years and the country has reached self-sufficiency in 
sweet potatoes and manioc, but Angola still relies on imports for most of its food consumption 
needs. For example, locally produced chicken supply only 40 percent of the local demand and 
production is limited by the lack of feed. In general, Angola has greater opportunities to compete 
with imports of perishable goods, including fruits, vegetables, and eggs, and local production of 
these goods has increased in recent years. Statistics on agriculture production are unreliable and 
outdated, but should improve with the planned agricultural census. According to MINAGRI 
2013/2014 production data, major crops based on volume include sweet potatoes, cassava,

bananas, maize, pineapples, citrus fruits, beans, peanuts, and tomatoes. Agriculture exports 
represent less than 0.8 percent of total exports. Excluding fish, where little value is added in 
country, agriculture exports amount to just US$3.5 million. Coffee accounts for 43 percent, 
followed by non-alcoholic beverages (32 percent), beer (9 percent), fruit juice (5 percent) and 
medicinal plants (3 percent). The country is slowly opening new export markets including to 
neighboring DRC. It recently restarted exporting bananas to Portugal, 42 years later, with a 
shipment of 17 tons.  
 
11. Smallholders represent over 80 percent of agriculture production and 92 percent of land under 
cultivation. A small but growing formal distribution sector is establishing partnerships with local 
producers to ensure quality supply of primarily fresh produce. Still, most agriculture production is 
used for self-consumption or sold through informal channels. 
 
12. Macroeconomic conditions and the business climate constrain private investment in 
agriculture. An overvalued exchange rate in recent years and the current scarcity of foreign 
exchange affect the sector competitiveness and hamper private investment. The challenging 
business environment, including high cost of doing business, uncompetitive input markets, and 
insecurity of land tenure, as well as government crowding out the private sector, further reduce 
the sector➢❨ s attractiveness to private investors. However, based on discussions with private 
operators, investment opportunities exist in the production and processing for products such as 
horticulture, grains and beans, poultry and livestock, as well as aquaculture. While foreign 
exchange shortages are resulting in some of these investments being put on hold, they could 
materialize once macroeconomic conditions improve. New investment could bring much needed 
capital and know-how to the commercial agriculture sector. 
 
13. Access to finance is a serious hindrance to commercial agricultural development. 
Notwithstanding the high credit growth from 2004 to 2014 (going from 5 percent to 22 percent of 
GDP), the share of credit going to agriculture has remained very low at less than 5 percent of 
overall credit provided. Additionally, despite the general increase in access to finance over the 
five years between 2010 and 2014 (with an increase of two-thirds of branches, doubling of ATMs, 
and tripling of Points of Sale), there has been a clear urban/rural divide in access with Luanda 
accounting for the bulk of financial sector outreach. Specifically, Luanda, which has 27 percent of 
the population, accounted for 83 percent of credit, 94 percent of deposits and the majority of bank 
branches, ATMs and POS in 2015. Government programs such as the Angola Investe, offer 
subsidized credit, guarantees and a public risk capital fund, however most supported projects 
belong to non-agribusiness sectors and tend to be concentrated in Luanda. The Angola 
Development Bank also offers some lines of credit to the agriculture sector. Finally, the enabling 
environment for promoting agriculture finance (including agriculture insurance, warehouse 
receipts, equipment leasing, moveable collateral registry) is yet to be developed. 
 
14.  Infrastructure weaknesses hinder the creation of value addition through processing, and the 
integration of small producers into value chains. Market linkages are constrained by poor road 
and storage infrastructure. The total road network is about 76,000 km, many in need for 
rehabilitation, and the road density is 6 km /100 kmÂ², one of the lowest in Southern Africa. The 
rural access index is 42 percent, which is the fourth lowest in the world after South-Sudan, Chad 
and Mali (WDI). Although the government has heavily invested in improving the transport 
network over the last decade, including road and railways, limited budget is available for rural 
roads. Moreover, the limited reach of the electricity grid and the high cost of operating generators

hamper the competitiveness of agribusiness, including agro-processing, irrigated agriculture, and 
livestock. The sector also suffers from lack of other adequate dedicated public services and 
infrastructure, such as phytosanitary and quality systems and commercial infrastructure. 
 
15.   Lack of technical knowledge and access to inputs further constrain commercial agriculture 
development. Poor agronomic practices, limited use of improved seeds, fertilizers, and irrigation 
technology, undermine productivity, growth and diversification. Most agricultural inputs, 
including fertilizers and machinery, are imported at high cost, and remain out of reach of small 
producers. These shortcomings are compounded by the very low technical capacity all along the 
value chain. 
 
16. Responsibility for agriculture policy and program development falls under the Ministry of 
Agriculture (MINAGRI). The Ministry is represented at the provincial level by the Provincial 
Directorates of Agriculture (DPA), and at the municipal level by the EstaÃ§Ã£o de 
Desenvolvimento AgrÃ¡rio (EDAs). MINAGRI➢❨ s capacity for program design and 
implementation has room for significant improvement. The World Bank Market Oriented 
Smallholder Agriculture Project (MOSAP), which closed in March 2016, and its follow up 
Smallholder Agriculture Development and Commercialization Project (SADCP), approved by the 
Board of Directors on July 5, 2016, include activities to strengthen MINAGRI➢❨ s capacity at the 
local, provincial and national levels. This project will build on and complement these efforts. 
 
17.   Other Government agencies are involved in the development of the agribusiness sector. 
These include the Ministry of Economy, which manages the Angola Investe program to provide 
subsidized credit to productive investments, the Angola Development Bank, the Ministry of 
Commerce and Industry, which is in charge of investment promotion (through APIEX) and  the 
agriculture commercialization program (PAPAGRO). Other relevant agencies include the 
Ministry of Construction (for road construction), Ministry of Transport, and Ministry of Energy 
and Water. The coordination among the various Government agencies in the implementation of 
complex multisectoral projects to support agribusiness development needs substantial 
strengthening. This is hindered by limited technical capacity and a centralized approach to 
decision-making. 
 
18.  In an effort to spur commercial agriculture, the government has invested in spatial approaches 
and infrastructure development. Government-sponsored projects range from integrated socio-
economic projects, following Israel➢❨ s Kibutz model (Aldeia Nova) to large-scale agro-
industrial poles such as the 400,000 ha Capanda development pole, as well as irrigated perimeters 
with plots for large, medium and small-scale producers. These projects are often financed by 
foreign lines of credit, and management is frequently contracted out to foreign firms, which bring 
the technology and know-how to run them. A state owned company, Gesterra, sponsors many of 
these projects. While some of these projects have achieved productivity close to international 
good practices , others are still not operational or have failed to attract private producers (e.g. 
Family Aviculture Project). Overall, the financial and economic viability of these projects on a 
purely commercial basis needs to be confirmed. Other government investments include 
distribution centers and cold storage, some of which remain underutilized. Support infrastructure 
is still insufficient and existing facilities need to be more effectively used. 
 
19.  Low and declining public spending in agriculture highlights the need for mobilizing private 
investment. The share of agriculture in the national budget declined from 1.10 percent in 2013

(US$701.76 million) to 0.41 percent (US$543.9 million) in 2015. In the current constrained fiscal 
environment, there is a need to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of public expenditures to 
develop strategic infrastructure, strengthen institutional capacity and improve research and 
extension services, and support smallholders. More efforts are needed to attract private 
investment and promote public-private partnerships under transparent criteria. The Commercial 
Agriculture Development project will contribute to these goals. 
 
20.  Weak public sector governance and poor capacity have considerably limited agriculture 
development efforts in the past. These issues affect resource allocation across a range of key areas 
in the agriculture sector, from access to land to financing of irrigation, agricultural infrastructure, 
and inputs. For example, one bottleneck for investment in agriculture is secured land access: land 
allocation procedures and coexistence of several legal systems for recognition and governance of 
land rights in Angola (state law and traditional rights) weaken legal certainty and hinder the 
sector➢❨ s development. To attract transformative private investments in the agriculture sector, 
particular attention will need to be paid to: (i) legal and regulatory measures; (ii) institutional 
mechanisms and delivery platforms; and (iii) transparency and social accountability. Besides 
involving several agencies/departments within the Ministry of Agriculture, the Project will need 
to work closely with, and reinforce the capacities of, several public institutions that have critical 
influence on agricultural investment generation.
Relationship to CAS/CPS/CPF
21. Supporting integrated national economic diversification is one of the pillars in the Country 
Partnership Strategy (CPS) FY14-16. Development of the agriculture sector, through productivity 
increases and market linkages, is seen as an important source of growth, employment creation and 
poverty reduction. Making progress toward the twin goals is found to be feasible building on the 
adoption of pro-poor growth strategies and policies. The draft Performance and Learning Review 
(PLR) envisions an extension of the CPS until FY18 and a reformulation of the objectives to 
respond to the macroeconomic challenges emerging from the oil price drop. The draft PLR 
maintains economic diversification as one of the key objectives of the CPS. A specific outcome 
related to enhancing productivity and competitiveness in the agriculture sector has been proposed, 
which is directly related to the activities of this project. 
 
22.  This Project will also build synergies with other World Bank Group projects, such as the 
Smallholder Agriculture Development and Commercialization Project (SACDP, P154447) and 
Angola Statistics Project (P157671). Close coordination between the IFC and the Bank (IBRD) 
will play an important role to mobilize investment, sector financing and PPPs, where each 
institution will contribute on the basis of its respective mandates. 
 
23.  Economic diversification and the development of commercial agriculture are critical 
priorities for the government, as outlined in the National Development Plan (NDP) 2013-2017. 
The National Development Plan seeks to promote an enlargement of the productive base to 
increase employment, leveraging the country➢❨ s natural and human resources. It underscores the 
role of the private sector as the engine of economic growth, with the public sector playing a 
leveraging role. For the agriculture sector, the NDP objective is to achieve sustainable 
development building on the country➢❨ s natural resources and competitive advantage to ensure 
food security and self-sufficiency, as well as maximizing regional and international market 
opportunities. Developing a competitive agriculture sector, with increased private investment and 
market linkages for smallholders is an objective that will be supported by the activities of this 
project. The project also contributes to the objectives of Angola➢❨ s Medium Term Agriculture

Development Plan 2013-2017, which seeks to foster agricultural and rural transformation, based 
on the development of smallholder agriculture, cooperatives and public-private partnerships, as 
well as contribute to the country➢❨ s industrialization.

C.  Proposed Development Objective(s)

Proposed Development Objective(s) (From PCN)
24.  The proposed project development objective (PDO) is to promote commercial agriculture 
development, increasing production and employment within selected value chains, in targeted 
areas in Angola.

Key Results (From PCN)
25.  The project strategy to achieve the PDO is to support the transformation of Angola➢❨ s 
agriculture towards a greater role for the private sector, building on existing programs, and 
focusing on value chains with the largest growth and employment creation potential. More private 
investment in agriculture is needed to increase production, productivity and commercialization, 
and to help create employment opportunities for the Angolan poor. This will be achieved by 
identifying and helping prepare Private-Public Partnerships (PPPs) ➢❨  private investment 
opportunities in selected value chains, and providing support to Small and Medium Enterprises 
(SMEs), including cooperatives, and producer organizations, in those value chains to increase 
their production, productivity and linkages with larger firms. In order to create the conditions for 
private investment the project will support investments in supporting infrastructure, as well as 
improvements in the regulatory environment and government capacity to play a catalytic role for 
the commercial agriculture sector development. 
 
26.  Success in achieving the PDO will be measured by the following PDO-level indicators: (i) 
increased investment in dollar terms; (ii) support infrastructure constructed or rehabilitated by the 
project; and (iii) jobs created in the beneficiary firms. 
 
27.  External factors may affect the realization of the PDO: (i) evolution of international markets 
(e.g., commodities prices, growth, and external financing), (ii) security and/or disease outbreak in 
Angola, and (iii) global warming, that may worsen droughts and lead to severe floods.

D.  Concept Description

28.  The overall approach is to foster commercial agriculture  through a set of integrated 
investments in hard and soft infrastructure, and developing an enabling environment for private 
participation in the sector. By simultaneously intervening along multiple dimensions, the project 
aims to remove key constraints to business formation and strengthen the platform for growth in 
high-potential value chains. World Bank support is required first to identify and prioritize these 
investments; and to develop the capacity to procure them and manage their execution. The project 
will also seek to mobilize private funds for the sector through PPPs and targeted investment 
promotion. At the same time, the project will support activities to create more conducive 
conditions for the future development of commercial agriculture, including regulatory reforms, 
and strengthening of research capacity. Strong coordination among the government agencies 
involved (agriculture, transport, energy, commerce, etc.) and building a constituency for the 
project among public, private and non-governmental stakeholders will be necessary, as suggested 
by previous experience in supporting integrated interventions along agriculture value chains.

29.  Initially, two value chains will be supported and this would be scaled up during the life of the 
project to a maximum of five. Criteria for selecting value chains will be based on the 
competitiveness of specific value chain segments, potential impact (on jobs, food production, 
export diversification, and opportunities for upgrading), and readiness (existing production, 
necessary investments, and sector organization). Identifying competitive value chains in Angola 
will require a more in-depth analysis of demand, current cost structure and existing constraints. 
Two initial value chains will be selected during preparation, in consultation with the Government 
and private sector stakeholders. Existing studies of priority value chains for the Government, 
including horticulture, livestock, chicken and dairy, and by extension maize and soy, provide 
limited analysis on existing cost structures to assess their competitiveness. Preliminary work on 
the poultry sector inspired by the value chain segmentation methodology identified opportunities 
for competitive production of fresh chicken to supply the local market, provided reliable supply of 
local feed can be secured (see Annex 3). The Government has requested initial focus on poultry 
and by extension maize/soy as a priority due to growing demand, recent growth and the large 
share of chicken in the country➢❨ s imports. Support to export-oriented value chains, such as 
coffee, another government priority, also requires careful consideration of the competitiveness of 
Angola vis-➃❫ -vis other countries. Analytical work supported by the project will inform public-
private dialogue to agree on priority subsectors and constraints. The experience and capacity 
developed by the project will enable supporting other value chains in the future. 
 
30. The project will be geographically concentrated in the areas (to be defined during 
preparation), with the highest agricultural potential to meet domestic consumption (as would be 
the case for example in the poultry/maize/soy value chain) and export (e.g. coffee value chain). 
Other factors to select geographic areas include having a critical mass of potential commercially 
oriented producers, and access to downstream value chain activities and markets through 
proximity to agrologistical networks and platforms. 
 
31.  Moreover, the proposed project will ensure that: (1) equal opportunities and support will be 
provided to women➢❨ s and youth groups to participate in several aspects of the project; (2) 
training in gender awareness will be provided using appropriate media, language and gender-
sensitive approaches and methods; and (3) a gender informed M&E system will be implemented, 
will collect and present gender-disaggregated data on project beneficiaries. 
 
32. Given the institutional weaknesses, governance, and other risks, a flexible and modular design 
is called for. The project must remain flexible to potential delays in specific components, 
changing implementation realities, and to the response of private sector supply and demand. It 
should allow subcomponents to be removed or amended without compromising the overall 
project framework and the causal chain of activities.  Starting with a focus on existing investment 
opportunities and just two value chains will help test the approach while striving to deliver results 
early on in the project. In parallel, efforts to build client project implementation capacity and to 
improve the enabling environment will start.  Once key conditions   are established, such as: (i) 
progress in business environment reforms, PPD, analytical and implementation capacity (ii) 
selected area and pilot value chains under implementation, in compliance with all activities 
planned for the first two years of the project life, work on other value chain will be undertaken (to 
be defined during preparation). Therefore, the proposed time for the project implementation is 6 
years. 
 
33.  With an amount of $230 million,  the project will support commercial agriculture

development through three interrelated components: (1) Agribusiness development by means of 
mobilizing investment, including PPPs, providing financial and non-financial support to value 
chain actors and developing support infrastructure (rural roads, storage, irrigation, and energy); 
(2) Support to create an enabling environment for commercial agriculture; and (3) Project 
management, coordination, and public-private dialogue. 
 
34.  Component 1 ➢❨  Agribusiness Development (US$ 190 million). This Component will 
address the following challenges: (i) underinvestment by SMEs in inputs, technology and skills 
development due to access to credit constraints and information failures; (ii) insufficient linkages 
among value chain actors due to coordination and information failures and (iii) underprovision of 
infrastructure oriented to underpin market-oriented agriculture. This component aims to mobilize 
investments in agribusiness and support improvements in productivity, quality assurance and 
market linkages through the following subcomponents: 
 
35. Subcomponent 1.1 Technical and financial support to SMEs development.  This 
subcomponent will have a value chain focus and will aim to (i) support SME development, 
including market-ready producer groups and cooperatives, and help them overcome constraints in 
access to credit and managerial/technical knowledge; and (ii) support links and partnerships 
between large, medium and small-scale producers and purchasers through business alliances. As a 
result of project investments, enhanced capabilities and links to larger firms, it is expected that 
SMEs will be able to grow their business, improve productivity and quality, strengthen market 
connections, and create jobs. An important aspect during preparation will be to assess the actual 
size of the SME sector in the pilot value chains and adapt the intervention design to uptake, 
capacity, and sustainability considerations. 
 
(a) This subcomponent will provide support through a competitive  matching grant facility: 
 
1. Provision of technical assistance for pre-investments. This window will provide financial 
resources for the development of innovative business and linkages between small producers and 
other actors along the value chain. 
 
The competitive grant will provide ➢❨ startup➢❨  capital for promoting the introduction of new 
sustainable practices and technologies, and processes that improve the competitiveness of 
agricultural production by SMEs. The grant will consider three main levels of support to be 
further defined during preparation. These could include: (i) extension and technology 
development; (ii) studies for business alliances, including the formulation of business plans and 
associated productive subprojects and pilots➢❨  investments; and (iii) capacity building for 
entrepreneurs, individually or as member of a formal group (e.g. associations, cooperatives, 
farmer organizations).  
 
2. Establish a Matching Grant facility for Value Chain Development.  . This window will 
finance investments based on the business plans directly linked to the selected value chains and 
will have a geographical focus.  
 
SMEs investments will be identified through a competitive process based on a review of feasible 
business plans and selected proposals identifying SMEs financial contribution through a matching 
grant (at least 60% of total investment, to be confirmed during preparation), and presenting social 
environmental and economic sustainability analysis.

The grant will combine innovation with a focus on partnerships with the market and will consider 
to implement investments designed based on business plans agreed with their business partners. 
The objective of each proposal would be to reach the product specifications (quantity, quality, 
delivery, etc.) agreed and established in the business plan. Eligible activities that would be 
financed could include expenditures at the level of both individual producers and their 
organizations (e.g. cooperatives), such as: (i) minor on-farm infrastructure and working capital, 
(ii) technical assistance services, (iii) agriculture inputs, equipment, production facilities 
(nurseries, greenhouses), (iv) value addition investments (post-harvest processing and storage, 
packaging), soil and water conservation measures and (v) other minor infrastructure, e.g. off-farm 
infrastructure for storage specific to the needs of the business alliance. If needed, the project will 
provide additional training to improve their governance, organizational, managerial, business and 
risk-management skills and to facilitate adoption of good agricultural and environmental 
practices.  
 
Eligible applicants would include: (i) organized producer organizations associations and related 
farmers organizations with developed or developing linkages to agricultural value chains, and 
supporting the development of smallholder farmers; (ii) agribusinesses linked with smallholders, 
involved in processing, trading, and marketing of agricultural and food products/commodities 
which help to improve the growth and competitiveness of smallholder farmers either directly to 
farmers at the production stage, or further down the value chain as part of the processing chain of 
agricultural commodities; (iii) input suppliers; (iv) nucleus commercial farms working with 
smallholders; and (v) publicly and privately funded agricultural and industrial institutions and 
trusts.   
 
In addition, for mobilizing business alliance investments, the project will carry out a differentiated 
communication and dissemination campaigns to: (i) inform potential stakeholders about the scope 
and rules of the Project; (ii) the publication and dissemination of Project activities including, inter 
alia, information on demand, approvals, procurement and results; and (iii) promote investments 
and contract farming/buying contracts in agricultural sector value chains.  
 
 (b) This subcomponent will also provide support to mobilize and select larger private investors. 
 
1. Selected interventions will need to demonstrate (i) alignment with the value chain development 
and (ii) potential impact on job creation. The stakeholders jointly with the PIU will develop 
proposals to request select interventions that are not firm-specific but that benefit their segment of 
the value chain and the value chain as a whole (i.e. common goods). 
 
2. Following the Client➢❨ s and the Chamber of Commerce➢❨ s advice, the investors will need 
to be strongly involved in crafting these proposals for interventions to ensure their commitment 
aspect and consistency with the constraints faced by groups of firms in the VC. The project will 
support the creation of a national committee composed of public and private sector stakeholders 
that will be in charge of reviewing the requests for funds to finance catalytic activities, ensuring 
that they conform with the strict eligibility criteria that will be imposed (e.g. demonstrate direct 
contribution to the VC➢❨ s development and job creation) and selecting the best proposals that 
receive project support. 
 
36.  Subcomponent 1.3. Establish a Partial Credit Guarantee (PCG) fund to promote access to

credit for the project target groups. The fund is expected to lower the risk exposure of financial 
institutions through a PCG arrangement and thus increase the incentives for financing agricultural 
activities. The fund would target the agribusiness SMEs in the selected value chains for their 
financing needs whether these are for fixed assets or for working capital. It would therefore 
support matching grants beneficiaries to provide the contribution required to benefit from the 
matching grants. It is anticipated that the project PCG fund will utilize the existing structure 
established by the Angola Investe Program. However, a dedicated Fund for commercial 
agriculture will be created and will be governed in accordance with applicable Bank Group➢❨ s 
policies and the recently issued Principles for Public Credit Guarantee Schemes for MSME, with 
IFC support. For participating banks wishing to benefit from the guarantee coverage, a 
prequalification process will be undertaken.  
 
Financial institution eligibility criteria will be transparent and open to all institutions that have an 
interest to lend to the beneficiaries of the Project.  The PCG will cover 50 percent of the risk pari-
pasu for loans to and it will be priced to cover the administration costs and risks it covers. 
However, the PCG fees would be priced, so that the facility would remain sustainable after the 
project conclusion and would continue to serve this market segment following project conclusion. 
 
37. Eligibility criteria and selection processes for investment support may vary according to the 
type of support required, and will be detailed during the preparation phase and described in the 
Project Appraisal Document (PAD). 
 
38. Subcomponent 1.3. Develop critical infrastructure. This subcomponent aims to (i) address 
existing gaps in infrastructure (rural roads, post-harvest facilities, irrigation, and energy); (ii) 
strengthening the capacity of public agencies to formulate, prepare and promote medium and 
long-term public-private partnerships in the sector. Special focus will be given to the promotion 
of climate smart agriculture approaches and renewable energy technologies. 
 
39. This subcomponent will support infrastructure investments in selected value chains and 
geographic areas of focus. It will leverage existing transport, logistics, energy, and irrigation 
infrastructures to support improvements in agriculture production and productivity, reduce post-
harvest losses, and connect production areas with markets: 
 
- Construction and rehabilitation of feeder roads. Once geographic areas of focus have been 
identified during preparation, a mapping will be conducted of existing road links and current gaps 
between production areas and the main national road networks (for example, the Luanda-Malanje 
corridor for the poultry/maize/soy value chain). Maximum length of rural roads supported by the 
project will be no more than 50 km to the main road (to be confirmed during preparation). The 
project will build on the existing Strategic Plan for the Rehabilitation of Tertiary Roads and the 
National Integrated Plan for Accessibility, Mobility and Transport (PENAMT) by the Ministry of 
Transport. 
 
- Post-harvest facilities: support to landing docks infrastructure and rehabilitation/construction of 
storage facilities to facilitate collection of production. 
- Irrigation infrastructure: support to irrigation infrastructure including water storage facilities and 
main canals will be agreed during preparation. Private investors will finance the construction of 
secondary canals to their farms.

- Energy investments will be further explored during preparation phase, depending on 
confirmation of targeted value chains and the degree of electrification of the selected geographic 
areas of focus. Other sources of clean energy will also be explored. 
 
40.  This subcomponent will also support the identification and assessment of existing 
government storage and agro-industrial infrastructure amenable to private sector participation, as 
well as other rural infrastructure and agribusiness services that could advantageously be 
developed and implemented by private entities as PPP or as purely private investment. Whenever 
the local conditions so require, opportunities for the use of PPPs for the integrated development 
and management of rural facilities and services should be identified, particularly when those 
facilities and services are apt to be co-funded by commercial and individual users. Following that 
initial assessment, the project will support pre-feasibility studies for the 3-4 most promising 
opportunities to enable the government to decide whether to move ahead with a PPP. This 
subcomponent can also provide support to strengthen the legal framework for PPPs in Angola and 
support capacity building efforts in this area. This would be done not as an isolated effort, but in 
order to guarantee an adequate environment for private investment, and conditions for effective 
definition of incentives for private investors to implement the government➢❨ s agricultural 
policy. 
 
41.  Component 2 ➢❨  Support to develop an enabling environment for commercial agriculture 
(US$ 25 million). This component will focus on addressing challenges related to (i) existing gaps 
in the Government strategy for commercial agriculture development and analytical capacity; (ii) 
limited government investment generation capacity (iii) constraints in the agriculture input 
markets; (iv) high costs and uncertainty of doing business, related to burdensome regulations and 
procedures; and (iv) weaknesses in the agriculture research and development capacity. The 
component will focus on strengthening the building blocks for creating a competitive commercial 
agriculture sector, including strategy and regulatory reforms, as well as support to enhance 
research and development (R&D) for the sector. 
 
42.  Subcomponent 2.1 Support sector strategy development and enhance client analytical 
capacity. This subcomponent will contribute to strengthen institutional capacity at MINAGRI to 
develop strategies for competitive and sustainable agriculture value chain development based on 
analysis of local, regional and global demand and existing competitive advantage. By doing so, it 
will complement envisioned support by SADCP to strengthen the capacity of local, provincial, 
and national units of the Ministry of Agriculture to provide services to smallholders in the areas 
of irrigation, extension, market information, statistics and policy analysis. Specific areas of 
support will be defined during preparation, but may include: (i) capacity building for evidence-
based economic research, value chain segmentation analysis, and M&E; and (ii) technical 
assistance to develop Climate Smart Agriculture Country Profile .  It could be an important 
mechanism to build awareness of country options, facilitate dialogue, and help prioritize 
investments to deliver on the ➢❨ triple win➢❨ , implementing agriculture and food production 
practices that not only boost productivity but also enhance resilience and lower greenhouse gas 
emissions, the three pillars that form the basis of climate smart agriculture. 
 
In order to support the thinking on Government strategy, the project preparation advance will 
fund the organization of a practitioners➢❨  forum on international experiences, including 
successes and failures, in developing commercial agriculture with a special focus on value chain 
approaches and agroindustrial poles.

43.  As part of this component, the project will also support the establishment of a team of 
analysts at MINAGRI with strong skills in economic and market analysis. They will be in charge 
of reviewing and validating the outputs of consultants hired previously by the Government, and in 
assessing the experience of failed prior agribusiness initiatives. They will receive training on 
value chain segmentation methodology and will conduct additional analysis as needed to identify 
the most promising value chain segments for Angola and the existing binding constraints for their 
development. This analysis will inform the discussions in the public-private dialogue platform 
(Component 3). The team will formulate proposals for addressing such constraints in 
collaboration with the relevant government agencies. This activity will be developed in 
coordination with other Government efforts to develop skills to support economic diversification 
strategies. 
 
44.  Subcomponent 2.2 Promote investment opportunities. This subcomponent will work with the 
recently established Agency for Investment and Export Promotion (APIEX) and MINAGRI➢❨ s 
Technical Unit for Investment Promotion to strengthen investment promotion, facilitation and 
aftercare in agribusiness. In particular, the project will support the compilation of a pipeline of 
investment leads and build capacity for assisting investors during the process of establishing their 
operations. Additionally, the project will assess current investor aftercare functions and provide 
training and other capacity building activities to ensure client➢❨ s effective support to existing 
investors, with the goal to encourage reinvestment. Technical assistance will be provided to 
prepare information packages and implement targeted investor outreach efforts in the priority 
value chains. Finally, the project will include additional support to the implementation of the 
revamped Investment policy and legal framework, including an assessment of existing incentives. 
 
45. Subcomponent 2.3 Improving the regulatory environment. This component will support key 
regulatory and administrative reforms to remove barriers to private sector activity in agribusiness. 
Strong emphasis will be given to ensure capacity for implementation of amended regulations is in 
place and adequate monitoring systems are developed. In these, the project will focus on those 
areas (i) have been identified as key constraints by analysis and private sector actors in the 
priority value chains, and (ii) where there is clear government commitment. This subcomponent 
will be closely coordinated with efforts to support regulatory improvements in the business 
environment under the DPL series and other World Bank Advisory work, including support in the 
areas measured by the Doing Business report. Areas for support will be confirmed based on the 
value chains selected. The following four areas have been identified as problematic in initial 
consultations with agribusiness private sector actors: 
 
- Policy and competition barriers in agricultural inputs: limited supply and high costs of improved 
seeds, fertilizers, and equipment is a critical constraint to increased productivity and production. 
The project will support studies to assess existing constraints affecting input availability including 
sector policies, tariffs, entry barriers and market competition. Recommendations emanating from 
these studies will inform public-private dialogue and the development of actions to address 
existing constraints. The project will provide technical assistance for implementation of these 
actions. 
 
- Trade facilitation and identification, classification and removal of Non-Tariff Barriers (NTBs): 
Given Angola➢❨ s dependency on imports for food and agriculture inputs and the country➢❨ s 
objective to develop exports as a way to diversify export revenues away from oil, an efficient

trade environment is essential. Building on ongoing reform efforts, the project will identify 
activities that will further simplify trade logistics systems and services, focusing on reducing the 
time and cost associated with international trade, through coordinated agency efforts. In addition, 
NTBs in Angola severely hamper the import of key products and inputs. There is a strong need to 
streamline NTBs, especially those related to agriculture. This exercise would include building 
capacity for streamlining non-tariff measures (NTMs) and identifying and removing non-tariff 
barriers, effective simplification of import-export procedures, and strengthening risk-management 
approaches for SPS (Sanitary and Phytosanitary) and TBT (Technical Barriers to Trade) 
measures. 
 
- Land administration: This subcomponent will support targeted interventions to strengthen land 
management and administration. Land in Angola is owned by the Government and the 2004 Land 
Law (Lei de Terras de Angola, Lei 09/04) defines the mechanisms for the Government to grant 
transferable land use rights for rural and urban land. The law recognizes customary uses, and the 
Government can grant surface rights to individuals and entities. Land is a delicate issue in 
Angola. It is estimated that 85-90% of the land is not registered due to weaknesses in land 
administration institutions, among other factors. Given the magnitude of this challenge, the 
project will focus on local level interventions based on needs identified in the priority value 
chains and focus on transparent and fair procedures for land acquisition and regularization, 
protecting communities➢❨  rights to land use and natural resources. The project will build on the 
experience of the FAO implemented Land Project and will follow the ➢❨ principles for 
responsible agriculture investments➢❨ . 
 
- Regulatory reforms to promote agriculture finance: In addition to the catalytic interventions to 
promote access to credit, the project would support reform efforts to improve the enabling 
environment for agriculture finance. Activities will be defined during preparation, but may 
include diagnosis and support to reforms to enable agricultural equipment leasing, establish a 
moveable asset registry, warehouse receipts and commodities exchange development, and 
agriculture insurance (including weather base d index insurance). 
 
46.  Component 3 ➢❨  Project Management, Coordination and Public-Private Dialogue (PPD) 
(US$ 15 million). This component will support the costs of establishing and funding the Project 
Implementation Unit (PIU), which will be comprised of a technical team, supplemented by 
external consultants, to manage the following activities: Project Manager, Financial Management, 
Procurement, Social and Environmental Safeguards, Monitoring & Evaluation, Technology & 
Information, among others. Lessons learnt from Bank operations in several weak and fragile 
environments suggest that both Borrower and Bank teams typically tend to underestimate project 
implementation costs, and run into associated difficulties. The team will re-visit the estimated 
costs of implementation during project preparation. In addition, this component will address 
existing weaknesses in implementation capacity, coordination, and public-private dialogue for 
development of commercial agriculture by (i) providing capacity building and technical assistance 
to the inter-agency working group to be created by MINAGRI to coordinate project activities, and 
(ii) creating and implementing a PPD platform. 
 
47. Subcomponent 3.1 Project Implementation Unit and coordination support. This component 
will fund the activities of the Project Implementation Unit (PIU). Strong emphasis on capacity 
building based on the experience from MOSAP will be included in this component. The MOSAP 
PIU, which will remain in place for SADCP, will be used during project preparation, but the

client has requested creating a separate PIU for this project. This component will also provide 
technical assistance and training to the inter-agency working group to be established by 
MINAGRI to coordinate project implementation. Support may include successful experiences 
from other countries in planning, development of action plans, and implementation monitoring, 
among others. 
 
48. Subcomponent 3.2. Establishing Public-Private Dialogue. The project will support increased 
public-private dialogue specific to the agribusiness sector. An assessment will be conducted on 
existing public-private dialogue mechanisms in Angola. Recommendations for establishing an 
inclusive public-private dialogue platform, including institutional arrangements, will be 
developed, followed by technical assistance for implementation. The objective of the dialogue 
will be to ensure private sector inputs to sector policies and programs, including the identification 
of priority value chains, identify specific constraints and remedy actions to increase private 
investment, and assess implementation progress, as well as avenues to improve the effectiveness 
of public investments. In addition to government and private sector, efforts will be undertaken to 
ensure the maximum representativeness of the PPD including farmer organizations, as well as 
other stakeholders as relevant, such as academia or civil society. Special attention will be given to 
ensure the voice of women is well represented and the specific constraints for women in 
agribusiness are discussed in the PPD.

II. SAFEGUARDS
A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis (if known)
49.  The project is expected to be at national scale however, specific geographic details of the exact 
project footprint and its impacts will be determined during project preparation and will be reflected 
in the safeguards documents (ESMF, ESIA, MP, RPF, and RAP, PMP, etc.).

B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
50.  At the framework level, there are no relevant gaps between the Angolan environmental 
legislation and the World Bank➢❨ s Safeguard policy and guidelines. The environmental legislation 
in Angola is quite recent and inspired by the international Conventions that Angola takes part. In 
regard to the environmental impact assessment, the existing Angolan regulatory framework covers 
the most relevant principles and best practices, including public consultation and participation, 
monitoring and licensing procedures. 
 
51.  The Ministry of Agriculture (MINAGRI) through the Institute for Agriculture Development 
(IDA) will be the lead implementing agency. IDA will have the responsibility of coordinating 
implementation by hosting a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) with sub PIUs at Province level, 
tasked with the responsibility of project coordination and management using Technical Assistance 
(TA) when needed. MINAGRI has acquired reasonable experience in handling World Bank projects 
that require Safeguards attention, such as MOSAP. Hence, Commercial Agriculture Development 
Project will build up from the experience in safeguards management acquired by IDA-MINAGRI 
during MOSAP implementation. Nonetheless, substantial capacity building and training will be 
required to deal with this project Safeguards requirements, particularly in ensuring adequate 
subproject screening and subsequent preparation of ESIA/ESMP and RAP as necessary.

D. POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional)
Environmental Assessment 
OP/BP 4.01

Yes The construction of rural roads, electricity and water 
infrastructure for irrigation , including a series of 
land administration reforms, under component 2.3, 
may have adverse impacts on soil, water, air quality, 
flora and fauna. Some of the adverse impacts may 
include land right conflicts, soil erosion and water 
logging, alteration of water flows due to irrigation 
schemes, vegetation loss and fauna disturbance for 
access road and power transmission construction, 
risks to the human health by those handling 
pesticides. Consequently the OB/BP4.01 is triggered 
to comply with the Environmental Assessment 
safeguard requirements. Specific geographic details 
of the exact project footprint and its impacts are not 
yet know and will be determined during project 
preparation.  Hence, the recipient will prepare an 
Environmental and Social Management Framework 
(ESMF) to help mitigate the potential environmental 
and social impacts by the direct and indirect 
investments in the project selected areas and to guide 
the preparation of ESIA and ESMP. The ESMF will 
be consulted and disclosed both in-country and at the 
Infoshop prior to appraisal.

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 Yes The project is not expected to invest in activities that 
may have direct impacts on natural habitats. 
However, rural roads improvements and water 
infrastructure may happen in proximity to national 
parks or protected areas and therefore lead to 
downstream impacts that may affect ecosystem 
services and functions provided by natural habitats. 
Hence, OP/BP 4.04 is triggered and the ESMF will 
include the specific provisions to prevent or mitigate 
impacts on natural habitats.

Forests OP/BP 4.36 Yes The Project will not have any direct or indirect 
negative impacts on health and quality of forests, or 
the health and safety of people who depends on 
forests. However, clearance of vegetation for rural 
roads improvements and water infrastructures may 
require compensatory reforestation and tree 
maintenance along the rehabilitated roads. OP/BP 
4.36 is triggered and the ESMF will include specific 
provisions to address the requirements.

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes Promotion of agriculture activities may include the 
use of small quantities of pesticides, though expected 
only at a small scale, to treat orchards and crops 
against pest and infestations to enhance agriculture 
productivity of project beneficiaries. Hence, OP/
BP4.09 is triggered and a Pest Management Plan will 
be prepared to help mitigate potential risks to human 
health and to the environment using the integrated 
pest management approaches.

Physical Cultural Resources 
OP/BP 4.11

Yes The policy is triggered as project investments 
involve infrastructures (roads, irrigation, electricity) 
that may require large movements of earth in areas 
likely to contain sites deemed physical cultural 
resources by communities living there (e.g. holy sites 
sacred graves, sacred forests, etc.). To ensure due 
diligence, the ESMF will include a Chance Find 
procedures that will be detailed in the ESIA/ESMP 
then reflected in the constructor contracts.

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 
4.10

TBD

Involuntary Resettlement OP/
BP 4.12

Yes The project will finance activities associated with 
construction/ rehabilitation of small scale irrigation 
infrastructures, rural roads, electricity transmission 
lines that could necessitate involuntary land 
acquisition resulting in physical of people and/or loss 
of assets, means of livelihoods or resources. The 
Borrower will prepare a Resettlement Policy 
Framework (RPF) to adequately deal with issues of 
land acquisition resulting with compensation and/or 
the physical displacement of peoples. The RPF will 
be consulted and disclosed both in-country and by 
the Bank prior to appraisal. The RPF will include 
detailed guidance for the preparation of site specific 
Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) prior or during 
project implementation.

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 No

Projects on International 
Waterways OP/BP 7.50

TBD The proposed project is not expected to engage in 
large scale irrigation activities or other activities that 
would adversely affect the quality or quantity of 
water flow within shared waterways. 
Notwithstanding, triggering this policy will be 
determined once specific details of the project are 
known.

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/ No This policy is not triggered. The area in which the 
Project will be implemented is not known to include

I. Introduction and Context
Country Context

1. Tanzania has experienced strong and rapid economic growth, with its annual GDP growth averaging 
around seven percent in the last decade. Despite the strong economic growth, Tanzania is one of the 
poorest countries in Africa with approximately 13 million people (28 percent of the population) still 
living below the basic needs poverty line.

2. A rapidly expanding population will require continued growth, translating into the creation of 
employment opportunities and household wealth, just to keep pace. The population is growing at an 
average rate of 2.9 percent, one of the fastest in the world, with about 1.3 million people being added 
to the population annually (NBS, 2009). Economic expansion must be accompanied by creation of 
quality jobs if poverty rates are to continue to drop.

3. Tanzania's growth and economy depend heavily on its renewable natural assets such as water, 
forests, and wildlife. Almost half of GDP is harnessed from natural resources in agriculture, energy, 
and tourism.  An estimated 89 percent of the country's water withdrawals are for irrigation, which 
contributes to 20 percent of agricultural production from 6 percent of the land. An estimated 90 
percent of Tanzania's energy needs are satisfied by water and wood fuels: hydropower generates 39 
percent of the installed 1,438MW electricity generation capacity, while charcoal and fuel wood serve 
as the overwhelming source of energy for urban and rural households. Tanzania's tourism industry - 
which is largely based on the country's unique natural resources and wildlife - is an important driver of 
the national economy, generating $1.88 billion in revenues in 2013, or 13 percent of GDP, in 2013. 
Tourism contributes approximately 28% the total export earnings in 2013.

4. The majority of the population lives in rural areas, and is dependent on natural resources in the form 
of food, fuel, and fodder. In 2010, an estimated 73.6 percent of Tanzanians were rural residents. These

people largely comprise 80 percent of Tanzanian households who depend on agriculture, the majority 
of which is rain fed, as their primary economic activity. Food security is often supplemented by bush 
meat protein. They depend overwhelmingly on forests for their energy; only 3 percent of rural 
populations have access to electricity, with most households being dependent on charcoal or fuel 
wood.

5. Rural poverty remains pervasive and deep. All data sources suggest that Tanzania has not made 
adequate progress in raising incomes in rural areas, where the majority of the poor live. Lack of access 
to technology, credit, water, and power resulted in stagnant productivity and high vulnerability to 
shocks, leaving many rural households in the same or weaker position as at the beginning of the 
century.

6. Slowing agricultural growth is a challenge in the rural space. The agricultural sector has seen its 
share of the economy decline from 48 percent in 1990 to 28 percent in 2010. Agricultural GDP grew at 
around 4 percent per year since 2000, or only around 1 percent in per capita terms, with acute droughts 
in 2004 and 2006. Yields of staple crops, which are the livelihood of small farmers, appear to have 
been flat or declining, with agricultural growth primarily driven by extension of cultivated areas, along 
with modest shifts in the composition of crop production.

7. Addressing rural poverty will require the creation of new off-farm jobs. The share of goods and 
services exports of GDP has grown from 13.4 percent in 2000 to 23.2 in 2009. In 1998, minerals and 
non-factor services, mainly tourism, accounted for 47 percent of exports, while they rose to 66 percent 
by 2010. In 2013, tourism represented the largest source of foreign exchange. At the same time, the 
share of traditional agricultural exports declined from 60 percent of total exports in 1998 to 12 percent 
in 2009, replaced mostly by tourism and minerals such as gold. Manufacturing exports have grown by 
about 17 percent annually since 2005, but account for less than 5 percent of GDP and 25 percent of 
total merchandise trade. Efforts to promote rural development must look to expanding off-farm 
employment opportunities. Tanzania's tourism industry, which is predominantly wildlife-based, 
provides an important potential source of new rural jobs and household revenues, provided linkages 
with local communities are in place.

Sectoral and Institutional Context

8. Tanzania's natural resource-based economic sectors such as wildlife-based tourism have strong 
potential for generating economic growth, creating jobs, and improving livelihoods. Tanzania is one of 
the world's mega diverse countries with its outstanding wildlife, ecosystems, and other natural assets, 
and represents a prime global tourist destination with significant potential for growth. It is the 
abundance of wildlife and unique ecosystems that have made Tanzania a prime African tourist 
destination, generating significant revenues. In fact, Tanzania is very successful in attracting high-
expenditure tourists; Tanzania earns more money per tourist than any other country in Sub-Saharan 
Africa. Notably, despite significantly fewer tourist arrivals, its tourism sector earned as much as 
neighboring Kenya before the recent decline of tourism in the latter due to security concerns. 
Tanzania's "low-volume high-value" approach has significant economic, social and environmental 
benefits, particularly in ecologically sensitive areas such as the greater Serengeti eco-system and other 
areas.

9. Tourism today is largely concentrated on a few areas, in and around the Serengeti, Ngorogoro 
Crater, and Mount Kilimanjaro (i.e., the "Northern Circuit") and Zanzibar. While there are many high-
potential tourism sites, ranging from high mountains to spectacular landscapes and coral-fringed 
beaches, there are signs of over-crowding. Pressures on the carrying capacity of key ecosystems such 
as the greater Serengeti lead to concerns that future expansion of visitors in some of Tanzania's key 



Page 3 of 9

attractions may soon undermine the quality of the tourism experience. As highlighted in a recent 
World Bank study (in draft), the expansion of the tourism sector must consider options to ensure that 
growth in tourism does not compromise the natural asset base; that is, efforts to increase tourism 
numbers and revenues must not undermine the quality of the very resource base that tourists are 
attracted and paying to see.

10. The Government of Tanzania (GOT) is keen to develop new tourism products to expand the 
tourism sector while in core areas maintaining the low-volume high-value approach that has been 
successful in capturing the highest per capita revenue in the region. Specifically, it is interested in 
developing a more diversified tourism sector that balances the focus on the "Northern Circuit" with 
developing the "Southern Circuit", which includes a number of parks (i.e., Ruaha, Katavi, Mahale, 
Kitulo), game reserves (Selous being the largest), two Rift Valley lakes (Nyasa and Tanganyika), and 
other areas of cultural interest. Such elements would be a core part of an updated tourism policy.

11. The sustainable management of natural resources is fundamental to Tanzania's economic growth. 
Natural resources are among the few assets that Tanzania's poor access and utilize. Sustainable 
management of natural resources is therefore an integral part of development, poverty alleviation and 
growth. This suggests that depletion of the natural resource base will inevitably compromise poverty 
alleviation efforts unless there is rapid and exponential growth in employment to absorb labor 
surpluses and provide high quality jobs. Already, poor land use and watershed management practices, 
which lead to degradation of forests and watercourses, are threatening the very natural resource base 
upon which Tanzania's economy and poor depend on, while rampant wildlife poaching threatens to 
reduce the assets that are key to current and future tourism potential. Recent GOT studies point to the 
need to ensure that decisions on development initiatives are supported by robust data and information 
in order to avoid unintentional externalities, which can in turn lead to constrained future development 
opportunities. Given the strong links with poverty, livelihoods, and food security, particular care 
should be taken to ensure sound management of land, water, and wildlife are a core focus of any rural 
intervention.

12. Water is at the heart of the sustainable natural resource management imperative. Tanzania, long 
considered a water-rich nation, is increasingly struggling with local incidences of water insecurity, 
driven by unsustainable levels of agricultural abstraction and poor watershed and land management. In 
some areas, such as the Pangani, Rufiji, Wami-Ruvu and the Internal Drainage Basins, conflicts over 
water among different users - farmers, hydropower plants, wildlife - are already undermining 
economic potential of sectoral investments in agriculture, energy and tourism, and may curtail 
Tanzania's ambitious growth plans. Notably, some of the areas targeted for increased irrigation under 
various government programs are already known to suffer from some degree of water conflict.

13. For example, the Great Ruaha River provides about 56 percent of flow to the Mtera and Kidatu 
power plants, which together are responsible for 50 percent of the country's total hydropower capacity. 
Within the Great Ruaha basin, expansion of (mainly rice) agriculture in the Usangu Plains from about 
14,500 ha in 1986, to 24,000 ha in 1998, to 115,000 ha in 2013, 87 percent of which is small-scale 
informal irrigation farms. As a result of this irrigation expansion, the Great Ruaha River has since 
2005 gone from a perennial river, serving as the lifeblood of Ruaha National Park, and a key input to 
the Mtera/Kidatu power system, to a seasonal river, leading to impacts on tourism and wildlife, power 
production and Tanzania's economy.

14. The sustainable management of natural resources across users at the watershed, landscape and 
ecosystem levels is a key condition to the success of the government's plans. Responding to this 
challenge requires strong cross-sectoral coordination and action. Improved watershed management, 



Page 4 of 9

including promoting sound landscape management and conservation practices, is needed to ensure the 
long-term productivity of key basins. Recent studies by the GOT suggest that while achieving 
important short-term goals in target sectors, these programs may unintentionally lead to negative 
consequences in other sectors and over the longer term.

15. Specifically, the impact of unplanned irrigation expansion in the Great Ruaha sub basin on 
downstream flow, has led to significant negative impacts on tourism (in Ruaha National Park) and 
energy generation (at Mtera and Kidatu dams) as noted in the Ministry of Water's Integrated Water 
Resources Management and Development Plan for Rufiji Basin. Likewise the Strategic Regional 
Environmental and Social Assessment undertaken for the Southern Agricultural Growth Corridor 
points to the need for careful planning of agricultural development in order to avoid unintended 
downstream impact on water quantity and quality.

16. Climate change represents an additional important risk for Tanzania's natural asset-based growth. 
Tanzania is already experiencing changes in its climate: the average temperature rose by 1°C between 
1960 and 2006, and models indicate future increases in average annual temperatures between 1°C to 
3°C by the 2050s. Likewise, precipitation is increasingly unpredictable with studies showing a shift in 
the onset of the rainy season(s). Changes in timing and quantity of rainfall are also predicted, with 10 
percent annual precipitation decreases possible in the south, decreases up to 26 percent in the north, 
and heavier, more concentrated rain events along the coast.  Water security, which is already under 
threat from current climate variability and social, economic and environmental change, is likely to be 
under greater threat from future changes in the climate. Increasing temperatures and changing rainfall 
patterns will have multi-dimensional effects on the Tanzanian economy, affecting agricultural 
productivity, energy use, water dynamics, and the wildlife upon which tourism depends. Efforts to 
promote climate resilience in these key natural asset-based sectors will have important longer-term 
effects on food security and livelihoods.

17. To achieve the GOT's goal to expand broad-based tourism in a sustainable way, a long-term 
concerted effort is needed.  The following deserve special attention:
- Managing water resources. Water is an increasingly scarce resource in many areas critical for 
wildlife and tou rism, including the Rufiji Basin, which is dominated by the Great Ruaha River. This 
has far reaching consequences for the ecology of parks, such as Ruaha.
- Developing the value proposition and strategy for tourism, with a focus on the "Southern Circuit". 
Market research, positioning, planning, and focused development are needed to utilize and 
commercialize the area's tourism potential. Strong public and private sector partnership would be 
important to leverage respective roles.
- Providing an enabling environment for the private sector. There are many obstacles for private 
operators to enter and operate in the tourism sector in Tanzania, particularly for local operators. The 
policy and regulatory environment, including a comprehensive look at the licensing requirements, 
would need to be reformed.
- Developing visitor infrastructure. Infrastructure, such as air strips, visitor services, logistics, 
hospitality, and park management investments, are essential elements of enhancing accessibility and 
the overall quality of the tourism product.
- Curbing wildlife poaching. One of the key threats to the management of existing and potential 
tourism assets is the recent unprecedented increase in wildlife poaching. Elephant populations in 
Tanzania have declined precipitously: between 2009 and 2013, populations in the Selous -Mikumi 
Ecosystem declined by 66 percent, while in the Ruaha-Rungwa ecosystem, populations declined by 
36.5 percent. The crisis has been fueled by the rising price of ivory in the illegal destination markets, 
which provides a strong incentive to local populations who do not otherwise see direct benefits from 
wildlife.



Page 5 of 9

- Linking tourism with local economies and communities. Despite the national economic importance 
of tourism, at the local level communities in and around protected areas are some of the poorest in the 
country. While in other African countries (such as Namibia, Mozambique and parts of Kenya), tourism 
is providing an important source of revenue and employment to local communities, Tanzania's current 
policies, which aim to promote local benefit from tourism, have not been as effective. Rather, local 
populations, which are highly dependent on natural resources for food, fodder and fuel, generally 
consider wildlife to be worth more dead than alive. Sustainable tourism development would need to 
rely on stronger connection with local economies through training and job creation, supply chain 
development, and other forms of benefit sharing.

Relationship to CAS

18. The proposed Project is consistent with the Bank's Country Partnership Strategy Progress Report 
(CPSPR) FY12-15 (Report No. 80313-TZ) for the United Republic of Tanzania that was discussed by 
the Board on July 3, 2014. The CPSPR has two strategic clusters: (i) Productive investments for 
growth of labor-intensive industries and job creation; and (ii) Programs that target reduction of 
extreme poverty and improvements in quality of social services and six strategic objectives. The 
proposed project contributes to CPSPR strategic cluster one - Productive investments for growth of 
labor-intensive industries and job creation. The proposed project contributes to the CPSPR's second set 
of activities under cluster one which addresses key infrastructure gaps and promotes sustainable 
management of natural resources. In particular, the proposed project enhances ecosystem resilience 
and improves the environmental services of natural resources through development of infrastructure to 
better protect environmental assets. The project would also enhance capacities of government 
institutions at the national, districts and village levels as well as park and wildlife management 
authorities.

19. The proposed Project is one of the initiatives which contribute to the TerrAfrica Platform for 
Sustainable Land and Water Management (SLWM). It also supports the African Wildlife for 
Development Program in support of the Elephant Protection Initiative supported by the Bank and the 
Global Environment Facility (GEF) along with other development partners.

20. The proposed project also contributes to the GOT's strategies and plans, in particular current jobs 
creation initiatives, tourism development and tourism growth, and rural economic development.

III. Preliminary Description
Concept Description

23. The PDO will be achieved through the following four project components.

24. Component 1 - Improving management and development of priority tourism assets (Total Cost 
US$50m). This component will focus on investments that aim at improving the management of natural 
resources inside priority protected areas in southern Tanzania to increase tourism. The expected 
outcome of this component is an increased number of tourists and bed nights in priority tourism sites. 
Expected outputs include (i) an adopted tourism strategy for Southern Tanzania; (ii) an adopted 
tourism master plan for southern Tanzania; (iii) number of roads, enhanced airstrips, viewing 
platforms, and visitor centers built; (v) a strengthened monitoring system in place to improve wildlife 
protection; (vi) number of trainings conducted; and (vii) strengthened policy and institutional 
framework.

Sub-Component 1.1: Improve the knowledge base at (i) the sub-national level by assessing tourism 
potential and investment needs, developing a new tourism strategy, and a tourism master plan for 
southern Tanzania; and (ii) the site level through ecological monitoring and conservation planning and 
integrated planning for key tourism aspects.

Sub-Component 1.2: Improve tourism infrastructure to enhance accessibility and the overall quality of 
the tourism product, including through, e.g., building unpaved roads inside protected areas to provide 
improved access to viewing areas, enhancing airstrips to allow for planes to safely land, and building 
viewing platforms and visitor centers. Develop Public Private Partnership (PPP) model to help 
enhance tourism asset management and accessibility.

Sub-Component 1.3: Improve the capacity for management of tourism assets. Improve the capacity for 
management and development of tourism assets through training and supplying of goods including for 
wildlife monitoring.

Sub-Component 1.4: Strengthen policy and institutional framework including through private-public 
dialogue.

25. Component 2 - Enhancing local economic benefits from tourism (Total Costs US$20m). This 
component will support investments that ensure local communities in vicinity to the protected areas 
benefit from tourism. The expected outcomes of this component are increased community employment 
levels in tourism and wildlife related sectors, while expected outputs include: (i) creation of PPP 
ventures in priority areas; (ii) number of micro-finance groups operational; (iii) number of tourism 
infrastructure outputs to promote local benefits built; and (iv) an adopted policy and institutional 
framework.

Sub-Component 2.1: Strengthen supply value chains for local communities and businesses that are 
linked to tourism (e.g., vocational training to enhance skills in communities to better participate in 
improved labor market such as hospitality industry and guide services), and infrastructure to promote 
local benefits may be supported (e.g., building schools).

Sub-Component 2.2: Build awareness and capacity to engage with the private sector including through 
nurturing SMEs and enabling PPPs. Develop model and associated processes to help ensure local

economic benefits when using PPP to enhance tourism asset management and accessibility.

Sub-Component 2.3: Build capacity for communities to manage wildlife and tourism (e.g., 
investments in community co-management initiatives).

Sub-Component 2.4: Provide access to finance (e.g., piloting targeted support in the form of micro-
finance or grants to support alternative livelihood development including activities linked with tourism 
supply and support).

Sub-Component 2.5: The policy and institutional framework will be strengthened.

26. Component 3 - Improving landscape management (Total Cost US$20m). This component will 
support investments and technical assistance to promote the integrated management of landscapes with 
an aim to securing environmental services within priority sub-basins in Southern Tanzania.  The 
expected outcomes for this component are improved land management in watersheds that are critical 
for agricultural productivity and/or priority tourism assets. Expected outputs include (i) number of 
watershed management plans prepared, (ii) number of improved soil and water management measures 
in place; and (iii) number of incentive programs established.

Sub-Component 3.1: Support activities to sustainably manage watersheds through a participatory 
process.  Depending on the size of the watershed, a planning unit will be micro-watershed of XX ha.  
The key activities include inter alia (i) planning, implementation of micro-watershed plans, and related 
capacity building (e.g., link village land use planning with watershed planning, studies), and (ii) 
communication and awareness raising activities.

Sub-Component 3.2: Strengthen small-scale water and land management through (i) implementation 
of measures developed in planning process referred to in component 1.1 above; (ii) check dams, 
control gates, and erosion control measures to reduce run-off and improve water use efficiency; (iii) 
reforestation and reduced deforestation; and (iv) sustainable incentive programs such as payment for 
environment services to promote water use efficiency and upper watershed management for protecting 
water sources.

Sub-Component 3.3: Strengthen policy and decision-making capabilities to support the protection of 
key natural assets. Activities will include (i) an inventory of key wetland, wildlife and tourism areas; 
(ii) improved monitoring; and (iii) capacity building for analytics to inform decision-making.

27. Component 4: Project management (Total cost: $10m). This Component will focus on project 
management arrangements and mechanisms including monitoring and evaluation (M&E) and 
implementation. In addition, funds under this Component will be used to support the procurement of 
essential goods and equipment such as vehicles, office equipment and furniture, imagery, software and 
other accessories, etc. To strengthen project management, funds would be available to finance selected 
technical assistance such as for safeguards, fiduciary management, and monitoring and evaluation. The 
expected outcome of this component would be the effective implementation of the project activities 
with due diligence and efficiency.

Track II - The review did authorize the preparation to continue

I. Introduction and Context
Country Context
China's rapid urbanization over the past three decades has facilitated impressive economic and 
social gains. The country became the second largest economy in the world in 2010, with over half of 
its population now living in cities. About 500 million people have been pulled out of poverty in the 
process. Further transition is projected to add another 300 million to China's urban population by 
2030 and continue boosting the economic growth. Unfortunately, China's economic gains came at a 
significant cost to its environment, with serious implications on health and quality of life, as 
environmental depletion and degradation were overlooked during China's impressive economic 
growth period. The cost of environmental degradation and resource depletion in China is estimated

to approach 10 percent of GDP, of which water pollution accounts for 2.1 percent, based on China 
2030 Study estimates. The Government of China has recognized that it cannot continue on this road 
and has put in place plans to ensure the environmental sustainability of its economic development 
pathways.

Sectoral and Institutional Context
The Chinese water sector suffers from both water quantity and quality challenges. In terms of water 
quantity, with 20 percent of the world's population but only 7 percent of its freshwater, water 
scarcity is a major problem for sustainable urban development in China. Moreover, there is also a 
strong disparity in spatial distribution of its water resources, as only 19 percent of China's water 
resources are available to 40 percent of the population in the north, where most of the major grain 
production is located, and in the west. In terms of water quality, due to environmentally 
unsustainable development trajectory pursued over the last three decades, a significant portion of 
China's freshwater sources are polluted. According to 2010 data, about 40 percent of rivers in China 
were seriously polluted and unfit for drinking water. Similarly, the groundwater quality in more 
than half of 200 cities surveyed was classified as 'bad' (in 40.3 percent of cities) or 'extremely 
bad' (14.7 percent). Similar figures are reported for the quality of other water bodies in the country, 
including lakes. 
 
Poyang Lake is the largest freshwater lake in China with a maximum surface area reaching 5,050 
km2 and a storage capacity - 30 billion m3. The basin area of the lake is about 162,200 km2 
covering over 97 percent of the land area of Jiangxi Province. The lake plays many vital functions, 
such as hydro-morphologic, environmental, social, cultural and economic; the livelihood of more 
than 40 million people is closely linked to the water and environment of Poyang Lake. Poyang Lake 
connects to Yangtze River in the middle reach at Hukou, Jiujiang County. The dynamics of the lake 
water movement is governed by both the stages of the Yangtze River and the discharges from its 
five major tributaries (Gan, Xin, Fu, Rao and Xin Rivers). While the annual water level in the 
Poyang Lake has remained stable in the recent years, the area of the lake fluctuates dramatically 
between the wet and dry seasons. In normal years, the average lake area is about 3,200 km2. The 
fluctuations are also affected by severe climate events, e.g., in early 2002, due to serious drought, 
the area of the lake reached a low of 200 km2.   
  
Poyang Lake is also a wetland of national and global importance, which provides a key habitat for 
half a million migratory birds. It is a house for over 95% of world's white crane, 60% of world??s 
white-napped cranes, 55% of world's hooded crane, 60% of world's white storks, and 96% of 
world's swan goose population. Poyang Lake is also a species gene pool with 156 kinds of aquatic 
plants, 136 planktons, 230 kinds of benthic animals, 58 kinds of fishes, 89 kinds of water birds, etc. 
It also plays a significant role in the seasonal flow regulation of the Yangtze River. The average 
amount of lake water entering the Yangtze River is about 150 billion m3, amounting to 15.6% of the 
mean annual runoff of the river.  
 
The water quality of the Lake has been comparatively good (with 83% falling under Class I ~ III, 
13% under Class IV, and 4% under Class V ). However, research results of the World Bank 
supported TCC5 project and the available monitoring data of Ministry of Environmental Protection 
show a concerning trend of water quality deterioration, with chemical oxygen demand (COD) and 
ammonia-nitrogen (NH3-N) gradually increasing and dissolved oxygen (DO) gradually decreasing. 
The existing data on COD discharge collected by the local governments in the lake basin show that 
domestic wastewater (about 60%) and solid waste disposal (about 30%) produce the major water

pollution. While industrial pollution remains an issue, discharges from industries are gradually 
decreasing. Site visit also found uncontrolled solid waste disposal and insufficient treatment, and 
improper fish feeding and improper habit of farm land fertilizing also lead to severe water pollution. 
By provincial environmental statistics, only 79% of domestic wastewater is treated in urban areas of 
Jiangxi province, which is much lower than the national average of 85%. Similarly, solid waste 
collection and treatment rate in the province is 69% compared to the national average of 80%.   
 
Conclusions from recent studies and discussions with Provincial governments identify the following 
key causes for increase of pollution levels in the waterbodies feeding into Poyang Lake: (a) lack of 
basin wide integrated water/environment management; (b) weak water quality and pollution source 
pollution monitoring and disclosure system; (c) lack of public awareness and incentives in the 
communities on environmental protection; (d) weak enforcement of regulations related to disposal 
of untreated industrial and domestic wastewater directly into water bodies; (e) lack of investment in 
infrastructure for wastewater collection and treatment systems in urban and rural areas as well as for 
solid waste management in the small cities and towns and rural areas; and (f) lack of use of good 
practices on proper domestic solid waste disposal and agriculture practices. 
 
Government of China and Jiangxi Provincial government recognize the needs to protect the Lake. 
Series of measures have been triggered at national, provincial, and county levels to protect the value 
the Poyang Lake as a unique resource and a national heritage, and to control the lake's pollution and 
to restore the vital water quality and its associa ted functions. The Government of China issued the 
Poyang Lake Ecological Economic Zone Development Plan (PLEDP) in 2009 focusing on 
ecological development of Poyang Lake. Under the PLEDP, there is an implementation plan and 18 
specific sector plans, including water environment management, water resources, five river 
management plan, etc. In 2014, Jiangxi government also issued a plan for establishment of 
ecological and civilization demonstration areas, stating actions and targets for industrial, domestic 
wastewater and solid waste management. Based on the plan, by 2020, COD would be decreased by 
5% compared to the 2015 baseline, wastewater treatment ratio would reach 90% and urban solid 
waste treatment ratio - 85%. The PLEDP together with other relevant sector plans foresee 
significant increase in size of population and economic activity by 2020, with the focus on tourism 
industry. This, together with unresolved improvements in infrastructure, is expected to result in big 
pressure on water quality in the lake basin. 
 
Following the series government plans, the government of Jiangxi has been conducting six major 
ecological environment protection group projects: (a) Poyang Lake wetland and biodiversity 
protection projects; (b) Poyang Lake-rim green belt projects; (c) pollution prevention and control 
projects including wastewater, solid waste and non-point agricultural pollution control; (d) blue sky 
action demonstration projects; (e) circular economy, energy conservation, and emission reduction 
projects; and (f) ecological cultural projects. 
 
In 2013, the World Bank approved the Jiangxi Poyang Lake Basin and Ecological Economic Zone 
Small Town Development Project with the objective to improve key public services in participating 
small towns of Jiangxi Province through improvements to priority infrastructure. Though overall 
project implementation has been satisfactory, there are a number of challenges including the rapid 
urbanization rendering some of the sub-projects irrelevant/unviable, capacity constraints and issues 
related to O&M for wetland, solid waste and wastewater facilities. The proposed project would 
expand the coverage to include seven additional counties, particularly focusing on water 
environment management and solid waste management infrastructure while taking into account

lessons from the Small Town Development Project and incorporating in its design best international 
practices.  
 
Note : Chinese surface water quality standards: Class I is good quality water which with simple 
purification is drinkable (DO>7.5mg/l; COD<15; BOD5<3; NH3-N<0.15; P<0.02); Class II is good 
quality water which is slightly contaminated, drinkable after normal purification (DO>6mg/l; 
COD<15; BOD5<3; NH3-N<0.5; P<0.1); Class III contaminated water which could be drinkable 
after treatment (DO>5mg/l; COD<20; BOD5<4; NH3-N<1; P<0.2); Class IV water is not drinkable 
(DO>3mg/l; COD<30; BOD5<6; NH3-N<1.5; P<0.3); and Class V is bad quality water (DO>2mg/
l; COD<40; BOD5<10; NH3-N<2; P<0.4).

Relationship to CAS
The project is aligned with the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for 2013-2016, specifically the 
objectives set under focus area I --"Supporting greener growth", including Enhancing Urban 
Environmental Services; Promoting Sustainable Agriculture Practices; and Demonstrating 
Sustainable Natural Resource Management. The project design is in line with the national strategic 
development plan of China, as envisioned in the Poyang Lake Ecological Economic Zone 
Development Plan (2009) and Jiangxi Province implementation plan for establishment of ecological 
and civilization demonstration areas (2014). The project is also in line with 12th Five-year Plans 
and draft 13th Five-year plan at Jiangxi provincial and county levels. 
  
The project is expected to contribute to both China??s national strategy on water security agenda 
and to the World Bank Group twin goals of ending extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity. 
Water security has become a high priority at highest for decision makers at all levels (central and 
local government). The strategy focuses on applying systematic treatment and combination of 
structural and non-structural measures in water sector to promote ecological safety, economic 
security and the safety of human health and lives. The project would contribute to, through 
integrated and participatory approaches, sustainable water/environment management, improvement 
of ecological condition, promotion of social and economic environment of Poyang Lake Basin, as 
one of the key areas of Chinese water system. 
 
For the contribution to the twin goals, as the poor are known to live relatively closer to degraded 
and polluted areas, and have less access to water and solid waste disposal infrastructure, they are 
expected to directly benefit from the project. The project will aim at addressing specific challenges 
that the poor, vulnerable and women face, as identified through social assessment. The project is 
also expected to boost shared prosperity, as improved water quality and local living conditions will 
likely result in such benefits as increase in land value, access to income earning opportunities etc.     
 
To achieve maximum impact and to address the higher strategic objectives indicated above, the 
project will incorporate an "integrated" approach in the design of the activities in selected counties, 
and focus on enhancement of ecological and institutional sustainability of water/environment and 
strengthening of domestic wastewater and solid waste management system. This will involve 
participation of communities during project preparation and implementation as well as in designing 
long-term operation & maintenance mechanisms to ensure sustainability of the investments. 
Ultimately, successful implementation of the project will help to facilitate the improvement and 
restoration of water quality and ecological environment of the Poyang Lake basin. It would also 
contribute towards the enhancement of water regime in the Yangtze River.

Note :   "Integrated approach" refers to a mechanism whereby structural and non-structural 
measures are fully utilized, as well as whereby management of environmental protection is done in 
a collaborative and coordinated way throughout the project cycle involving all stakeholders (from 
different sectors and disciplines) and based on consensus building to ensure sustainability.

II. Proposed Development Objective(s)
Proposed Development Objective(s) (From PCN)
The project development objective is to reduce the pollutant discharge into key selected waterways 
in the Poyang Lake basin and to improve management of water environment.

Key Results (From PCN)
The proposed PDO level results indicators include: (a) Direct project beneficiaries (core sector 
indicator), of which female beneficiaries; (b) Nutrient load reduction (nitrogen (N) and Phosphorus 
(P)) achieved under the project (core sector indicator, tons/year); (c) Volume (mass) of COD 
pollution load reduction achieved under the project (core sector indicator, tons/year); (d) domestic 
solid waste reduced or recycled under the project (core sector indicator; tons/year); (e) Increased 
number of counties in full compliance with Provincial Water and Environmental Protection 
Guidelines . 
 
Note :   The guidelines broadly include elements such as citizen participatory engagement and 
institutional capacity to undertake regular water monitoring, reporting and enforcement.

III. Preliminary Description
Concept Description
a. Overview.  
 
The Jiangxi Provincial Government proposes to utilize the World Bank loan in managing the water 
environment in the key towns of Poyang Lake Basin. Seven counties - Duchang, Poyang, Yugan, 
Jishui, Fengxin, Jingan, Shangli, have been selected for project planning and implementation; total 
population of the seven counties are about 5 million. These seven counties represent a mixed pattern 
of geographic distribution across the basin: three sites are in close proximity to the main Lake, one 
site along the mid-stream of a main river draining into the Lake, two sites adjacent to the tributary 
streams of a main river, and one site at the remotest distance from the Lake. The water quality of 
Poyang Lake is closely associated with the quality and environment of the water and land bodies in 
these contributing catchments, and vice versa.  
 
The project is designed to integrate different ways of environmental protection to improve the water 
quality of Poyang Lake basin, including by means of wastewater treatment and solid waste 
management, as well non-structural measures. As such, the project will focus not only on 
engineering aspects but also on enhancing institutional mechanisms, improving operation and 
maintenance (O&M) and monitoring systems to help the selected counties in Jiangxi Province to 
enhance water environmental services, including wastewater collection and treatment systems, 
urban storm water management, river and lake environment restoration, solid waste collection and 
transportation system, and participatory integrated environment management system.

The proposed project activities consist of four main components as below:  
 
Component 1: Strengthening Institutional Capacity for Managing Water Environment in Poyang 
Lake Basin (US$15 million): This component will finance capacity building and awareness raising 
activities to improve participatory wastewater and solid waste management, enforcement of 
environmental regulations and creating pre-conditions for sustainability of project results. The 
component will be structured in two key sub-components: (a) institutional capacity building and 
enforcement and (b) sustainable Poyang Lake basin management.  
 
Sub-component 1.1: Institutional Capacity Building and Enforcement (USD11 million): This sub-
component will finance activities related to: (a) strengthening of the current integrated Poyang Lake 
Basin management institutional architecture (River manager as leader of the party - River 
implementer as the mayor of the county - high level leading group for strategic orientation and 
guidance, and Poyang Lake water/environment financial and investment mechanism study; (b) 
strengthen Basin-wide water/environment management planning: (i) support an integrated 
vulnerability and sensitivity assessment of Poyang Lake (water quality improvement and protection- 
water quantity control - land uses change -biodiversity conservation- urbanization and demographic 
changes- tourism impact and industrialization-basin pollution, and providing comments on 
integrated action plan leading to series of projects with implementation sequencing and synergies in 
line with the long-term commitment) along with resilience and adaptation measures; (ii) promotion 
of integrated basin plans for the five tributaries of the Poyang Lake; (c) strengthening knowledge 
sharing of integrated lake management and establish Lake management advisory platform - with the 
continuous pressure on water resources, the lakes under environmental stress are evidenced across 
China; and (d) strengthening the water/environment monitoring system through upgrade/newly 
installation of water/environment monitoring facilities, enhancement of the integrated monitoring 
information system, early warning system, real-time data disclosure etc. 
 
Sub-component 1.2: Sustainable Poyang Lake Basin Management (USD4 million): This sub-
component will finance activities related to enhancing conditions for lake basin environmental 
management sustainability, including: (a) enhancement of citizen participation and information 
disclosure - translating the high level ownership of the Poyang protection to grassroots level could 
contribute to the rapid and broader success of the Poyang Lake conservation. Building on the 
institutional structure and ecological compensation mechanism, the citizen participation could 
involve labor corporations (fishermen, farmers, factory workers and industries etc.) in having a 
voice in Poyang Lake protection; and (b) ensuring soundness of infrastructure design and its O&M 
sustainability¡ª the project will aim to increment the quality of innovation and appropriate 
technology with the economics of their financing for sustainable operation and maintenance 
implementation; and strengthening of incentive mechanisms, i.e., the compensation scheme for 
ecological protection of the Poyang Lake that could be further strengthened building on proven 
incentive mechanisms; 
 
Component 2: Improvement of Lake and River Environmental Restoration and Enhancement of 
Domestic Wastewater Management System (US$ 140 million). This component will finance 
activities related to protection and restoration of the water environment of selected rural and urban 
water environments in Poyang Lake basin through collection and treatment of urban and rural 
wastewater; collection and safe disposal of stormwater from both rural and urban watersheds; and 
implementation of integrated engineering and biological as well as Low Impact Development (LID) 
interventions in selected rural and urban waterways.  The aim of the component is to demonstrate an

integrated watershed management approach by focusing on key areas for protection, improving 
water quality and environmental protection caused by the municipal wastewater and aquaculture 
sources, and establishing ecological pollution-control zones along the course of pollutant movement.
 
Sub-component 2.1: Improvement of Lake and River Environmental Restoration (USD66 million): 
This sub-component will finance implementation of integrated engineering and biological 
mitigation measures and Low Impact Development (LID) in selected small lakes, rivers, and

domestic and international training and study tours, procurement of project implementation 
supervisors, procurement of social and resettlement and environmental monitoring services, etc. 
 
d. Gender. 
 
There is strong evidence that gender inequalities contribute to poverty and reduce human well-
being, and that gender issues are an important dimension of the fight against poverty. In water 
supply operations specifically, there has long been an understanding of importance of incorporating 
a gender perspective, because women and girls are most often the primary users, providers and 
managers of water in their households and are the guardians of household hygiene. Limited access 
to water and poor water quality have direct impact on household welfare and health. If a water 
system falls into disrepair, women are the ones forced to travel long distances over many hours to 
meet their families' water needs. Therefore, women and girls benefit most when services are 
improved. Given women's household roles and responsibilities, they are also more likely to impact

decisions related to ways to collect and dispose the domestic waste. Finally, women can greatly 
contribute to oversight of a well-functioning community enforcement of environmental reg  ulations 
and also such aspects as decisions related to water and solid waste collection fee levels.  
 
Worldwide good performance on gender mainstreaming in projects requires: (a) carrying out a 
gender analysis as part of the project's social assessment; (b) introducing relevant design elements; 
and (c) tracking project performance through the inclusion of gender disaggregated indicators. The 
project will conduct a standalone social assessment, in which a close attention to gender aspects will 
be paid. This will include investigating on and consulting with female beneficiaries in the project 
areas in order to clearly identify their needs and concerns, as well as possible project impacts, and 
explore both mitigation measures of such impacts and opportunities for women targeted activities to 
achieve project objectives. The project design will particularly emphasize female participation in 
project activities, capacity building and M&E activities. Specific indicator(s) related to women's 
participation will be included in the Results Framework and will be closely monitored during 
project implementation. 
 
e. Lessons learned from Jiangxi Poyang Lake Basin and Ecological Economic Zone Small 
Town Project 
 
There are valuable lessons of Jiangxi Poyang Lake Basin and Ecological Zone Small Town Project 
implementation that will be taken into account during further design of the proposed project. The 
on-going project faces challenges in terms of institutional capacity and inter-departmental 
coordination, issue that is also observed in other provinces in China. Collaboration in controlling 
and reducing substances at their source is the most effective way of keeping pollutants out of the 
lake. This requires clarity of responsibilities of each authority, as well as full collaboration to meet 
the joint objective. While industrial pollution control is under the responsibility of provincial 
Environmental Protection Department (EPD), agricultural land and aquaculture pollution control is 
managed by the provincial Agriculture Department (AD).   
 
To address these problems, it is critical that county Government maintains ownership of the 
proposed sub-projects, even with the change of the county leadership to ensure continued focus on 
initially agreed project activities and development objectives. Similarly, continuity and retention of 
project staff at the county level (including PMOs, PLGs and Expert Groups) is important to ensure 
good capacity developed under the project is maintained. Finally, the project will also raise 
awareness among communities and farmers.  
 
Equally important is to considerably strengthen institutional coordination mechanisms, not just for 
project purposes, but also for future management of the Lake. It would be important to assign a 
function of responsibility to review development proposals in the basin with a view on their 
implications on the Lake water quality to one of the institutions that is currently managing Poyang 
Lake, or to establish a Poyang Lake Management Commission. The institution would also be 
responsible to spearhead the improvement/ restoration of the Lake water quality over the long run. 
This entity could include representatives of relevant provincial and county governments, as well as 
concerned citizens and academic or research agencies.  
 
f. Global Lessons Learned and World Bank's Value Added 
 
World Bank participation has the added benefit of introducing and replicating, where possible,

international best practices in the management of water body pollution control and environmental/
ecological improvement. Lessons learned from World Bank-financed pollution control and 
ecological restoration projects (such as Danube Water Program; Iran Northern Cities Water Supply 
and Sanitation Project to reduce pollutant loads to the Caspian Sea; Lake Victoria Environmental 
Protection Project; Aral Sea Restoration Project; Integrated Water Management in Metropolitan Sao 
Paulo Project) as well as lessons from other countries' experiences (such as the Great Lakes and 
Chesapeake Bay restoration programs in the US) are being used to inform the key concept of the 
project, and include: (a) investments in infrastructure upgrading needs to be matched consistently 
with required institutional support for appropriate maintenance and management competencies, to 
ensure sustainability of investment; (b) the needs within the basin exceed the current scale of 
investments and therefore (i) investments need to be modelled, targeted and monitored to establish 
the most cost-effective interventions to improve basin health and green resilient growth that 
supports livelihood and maintains the sustainability of economic development; (ii) capacity and 
investments need to be leveraged from a variety of public and private partners; (c) problems related 
to water quality management, pollution control and urban upgrading are complex and require multi-
sectoral and integrated approaches; (d) both the institutional and environmental objectives 
associated with addressing such complex issues should be treated as long-term program goals rather 
than short-to medium-term project objectives; (e) integrated approaches to water quality 
management can enhance additional benefits and contribute to poverty alleviation; (f) participatory 
approach, though time-consuming, is essential for sustainability of project results as it ensures 
consensus building between all stakeholders in reaching agreement on project design and achieving 
institutional and policy reform and public support; and (g) ex-post monitoring of activities to collect 
evidence of costs and benefits help to enhance chances for successful replication. 
 
Specific best practices that will be examined for application of proposed project activities include: 
(a) strengthening of the current institutional architecture - River manager as leader of the party - 
River implementer as the mayor of the county - high level leading group for strategic orientation 
and guidance (the Great Lakes National Program Office (GLNPO in the USA); the Office of the 
Prime Minister Program for the Lake Balaton (Hungary); and the creation of the Commission and 
Secretariat of the Lake Balaton from above mentioned office); (b) strengthening of incentive 
mechanisms (direct and indirect payment fee mechanism in Biwa Lake (Japan); environmental fee 
on net revenue from chemical factories around Lake Toba (Indonesia); fee grid for water 
consumption in Lake Constance (Germany-Switzerland and Austria) and; the revolving polluter-
payer fee/subsidy mechanism of the Seine Normandy River Basin Agency (France)); (c) citizen 
participation and information disclosure - (Women Association for the Lake Balaton which 
pioneered the lake's protection in earlier 1990; the Lake Naivasha (home of Kenya??s flowers 
export) Riparian Association (LNRA) and Lake Naivasha Growers Group (LNGG)); (d) ensuring 
soundness of infrastructure design and its O&M sustainability (the Chesapeake Bay restoration 
program (USA); Lake Champlain basin program (USA/Canada); the Lake Balaton water quality and 
tourism program; and Danube Water Program); (e) integrated action plan to maximize impact of 
interventions (the Great Lakes restoration program; the lake Ponchartrain restoration plan 
(Louisiana); the Lake Balaton program). 
 
Note:   Proposed project activities have been selected based on the following criteria: (a) cost 
effectiveness - each sub-project should have economic/financial return; (b) sub-projects should not 
cause any negative social and environmental impacts that cannot be mitigated through proper design 
and contract execution; (c) sub-projects must be in compliance with government development plans; 
(d) all land used for construction purposes shall conform to general land utilization plans of the

Other Decision (as needed) 
 
 
 
B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 
 
1. After taking office in December 2015, the new Argentine Government moved with significant speed to 
implement reforms. The Government has rapidly implemented various macroeconomic reforms and initiated a program 
of structural reforms. These include inter alia (a) the elimination of export taxes on major crops, beef, and most 
industrial manufacturing products and the reduction by 5 percent of export taxes on soy; (b) unification of the exchange 
rate, effectively ending most foreign exchange restrictions; (c) moving from a system of discretionary to automatically 
provided import licenses in line with World Trade Organization procedures; (d) resolution of the dispute with holdout 
creditors; and (e)  measures to enhance public transparency and accountability. In addition, the National Institute for 
Statistics launched a new inflation index and improved the overall quality of statistics. Electricity tariffs and transport 
fees were increased to reduce subsidies, while protecting low-income users with a social tariff. Broader efforts to reduce 
energy subsidies (which account for a large portion of fiscal deficit) are under way.  

2. Economic activity contracted in 2016, but growth is expected in 2017. Economic activity contracted 2.3 percent 
during 2016, taking a toll on labor markets, where up to 0.9 percent of formal private sector jobs were lost in the first 
semester

1
. However, GDP expanded in the second half of 2016 (0.6 percent), and employment in the formal private 

sector recovered to its previous peak level (October 2015). The economy is expected to continue to grow in 2017 (+2.7 
percent

2
) on the assumption that the positive impact of recent policy changes kicks in and the global economy recovers. 

Inflation in the city of Buenos Aires was 40 percent in 2016, mostly due to currency depreciation and the reduction of 
energy and transport subsidies. However, inflation is expected to decrease to 21 percent in 2017

3
, despite further 

increases in energy and transport tariffs. The central government primary deficit in 2016 was 4.6 percent of GDP, below 
the official target (4.8 percent). The target primary deficit for 2017 (4.2 percent), though higher than originally planned, 
will require further fiscal consolidation efforts. 

3. The Argentine Government has made important steps to address the key macroeconomic imbalances with the 
objective of creating an environment conducive to economic growth and employment creation.  Argentina offers 
many opportunities in a weak global environment, and there is a strong interest from foreign investors and firms. Going 
forward, Argentina aims to continue building a growth enabling policy framework to enhance credibility and support 
broad based growth and quality employment. In particular, the following policies will be important to permanently 
reduce inflation and put Argentina on a sustainable growth path: (a) increase public spending efficiency as well as its 
efficacy and reduce the fiscal deficit in line with government targets; (b) continue fostering the credibility of the Central 
Bank so that monetary policy can further anchor inflation expectations; (c) strengthen competitiveness and productivity 
through an improved business environment and investments in infrastructure and increasing competition in markets 
and improving the regulatory framework in sectors; (d) continue strengthening the credibility of official statistics; and (e) 
continue improving the provision of public goods (including transportation, health, and education) and reducing regional 
disparities.

4. Because of its geographical characteristics, Argentina is exposed to a variety of natural hazards. According to 
the Third National Communication (2015) by the Government of Argentina to the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change (TNC, 2015)

4
, the projections of climate models during this century generally indicate 

that the extremes of high temperatures and extreme precipitation will continue to increase in most of the country, 
although the precise quantification of this change presents considerable levels of uncertainty.  For example, droughts 
and floods during the last decades have increased due to the influence of stronger El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) 
events and due to climate change.

5
 The natural disaster loss per capita in Argentina is high and relates predominantly to 

hydro-meteorological hazards, which represent 58 percent of the total economic losses over the last 50 years.
6
 

According to Swiss-Re, Argentina is among the 10 emerging economies with the highest flood hazard exposure, with 
potential losses in excess of US$ 3 billion a year (0.5% of GDP).  Drought, hail, and frosts are other hazards that 
significantly affect the economic performance of the country. 

 
Sectoral and Institutional Context 
 
5. Argentina is one of the world’s leading food exporters, enjoying vast farmlands and favorable natural 
conditions. Despite these advantages, the country’s agricultural sector is at a point of inflection. Over much of the past 
decade, the sector enjoyed high global prices but was buffeted by public policies that narrowed profit margins and 
stifled investment. The new administration made a major shift in taxes and regulation towards supporting economic 
incentives for development and investment, but global commodity prices have weakened over the past two years and 
prospects over the medium term are uncertain (World Bank, 2016). Lower commodity prices and slower growth in 
China, the major commodities consumer, seem to be here to stay.  Argentina and other major agricultural exporters face 
a difficult transition to a new equilibrium, a “new normal.” 

6. Despite a boom in global commodity prices, from 2002 to 2013 investment in agriculture/agribusiness fell and 
the rate of total factor productivity growth slowed compared to its neighbors. The Agriculture Production Index of the 
United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) for Paraguay, Brazil and Uruguay was between 20 percent and 
30 percent higher than that of Argentina in 2013. This trend was closely associated with domestic policies that imposed 
export tariffs, quotas and exchange rate controls. In December 2015 the new administration eliminated most of the 
tariffs and quotas, unleashing new potential. Simulations that only look at the potential benefits from the removal and 
lowering of agricultural export tariffs and controls suggest a significant gain in both production and employment. By 
2019 grain and oilseed production may increase to 137 million tons, cattle stocks to 56.8 million head, and employment 
by 500,000 new jobs. 

7. While the sector prognosis is positive, there remain a number of important challenges that will determine the 
quality of sector growth and sustainability going forward. The main challenge the sector faces is the low and volatile 
productivity growth with a yield gap reaching 20 percent in selected crops. Dilapidating infrastructure and inadequate 
transportation and logistics networks further hurt the sector competitiveness, and can account as much as 35 percent of 
the total cost of a ton in the case of soy. Environmental degradation contributes further to significant losses, estimated 
to be in the range of 1 to 8 percent of GDP

7
. Because of these rising costs and accumulating underinvestment, export

product diversification equivalents fell from 2.1 to 1.7 from 1995 to 2009. Going forward, a key role for public policy will 
be to enable a conducive business environment (both for investments and cost competitiveness) as the private sector 
shifts gears from extensive to intensive production systems, and promote diversification towards higher price and value 
markets. 

8. Furthermore, given that agriculture is one of Argentina’s core economic activities, the country appears to be 
quite vulnerable to risks, in particular to more intense heat and extreme precipitation events.  Given the geographic 
extension of Argentina, the country faces a large set of natural hazards that have adverse economic impacts on a regular 
basis.  The hazards that are most reported to cause systemic losses in the agriculture sector are floods, extreme 
precipitation, droughts, hail, frosts and volcanic eruptions.  These macro and sector-level constraints and the sector risks 
outlined above have led to the Agriculture Sector of Argentina to show a drop in Total Factor Productivity (TFP) in 
relation to neighboring countries in recent years, as well as a drop in the adoption of agriculture technologies (see 
graphs below). These risks will likely intensify with rising climate variability and change.  

  
 
9. Agriculture production losses in Argentina during the past 20 years due to extreme weather events are 
estimated to amount to US$12 billion (current value)

8
.  Extreme losses

9
 in agriculture production between 1993/94 and 

2014/2015 have been estimated at US$8.7 billion for soy, US$2 billion for maize, US$860 million for wheat and US$493 
for sunflower.  The worse years in terms of agriculture production losses in the past two decades have been 2008/9 and 
2011/12 due to an extreme drought in the central “key” agriculture region (zona núcleo) of the country, which reached 
losses of more than US$9 billion.  Unfortunately, farmers in Argentina, especially family farmers, do not have access to 
financial instruments that would allow them to cover themselves against such systemic events.  Agriculture insurance in 
Argentina is concentrated on covering hail, with very few insurance policies being sold to cover for rainfall risks (excess 
rainfall, drought, and floods). 

10. Flood is the hazard that has caused the largest losses to the Argentinean economy historically.  It is 
estimated

10
 that the accumulated losses between 1950 and 2015 from the 10 worst floods were US$8.77 billion 

throughout the entire economy.  Many of these events have been linked to El Niño (ENSO) events, such as the floods of 
1982/83, 1992, 1997/1998, and 2015.  In relation to the most vulnerable areas, the La Plata Basin is one of the most 
affected given its level of exposure.  It is estimated that 80 percent of the Argentinean population lives in this basin, and 
it concentrates the main industrial (including agroindustrial) investments of the country. 

11. Within the Argentinean economy, the agriculture sector is the most susceptible to losses due to flooding.  In 
2000, for example, approximately 1.85 million hectares (4.5% of total cultivated area) were flooded due to extreme 
rainfall.  Losses to the sector amounted to US$187 million.  In 2001, a similar area was affected, producing losses of up

to 70 percent of pastureland, a 15 percent drop in milk production, and between 50 and 60 percent drop in maize and 
wheat production, respectively

11
. 

12. The second most important hazard in terms of agriculture losses has been extreme drought.  The events of 
2005, and 2007-2009 have been very damaging for the livestock sector.  In 2009 the National Meteorological Service 
(SMN) reported that 90 percent of the national territory was under some type of drought situation; with the most 
severe droughts being recorded in the North of La Pampa and South of Buenos Aires and Cordoba Provinces

12
.  Because 

of these events, the number of cattle dropped considerably from 58.7 million in 2007 to 49.9 million in 2012 (15 
percent)

13
. 

13. Price volatility has also increased for international agriculture commodities since 2006/2007.  This has had a 
negative effect on Argentinean farmers.  From the beginning of the cropping seasons for grains (October), local prices in 
Argentina have had a tendency to drop until harvest, which highlights the need for Argentinean farmers to hedge their 
positions before planting.  Although Argentina has one of the oldest agriculture commodity exchanges globally, with 
futures and options for several grains, family farmers do not have access to such financial instruments to allow them to 
hedge against drastic price movements. 

14. Public policies and programs in Argentina that look towards the management of agriculture risks are 
concentrated in responding to agriculture emergencies.  This is quite different from other countries in the Region and 
other developed economies, which have a wider set of instruments and tools to manage agriculture sector risks in a 
more integrated fashion.  In Argentina, the main public policies and programs for agriculture risk management are in the 
area of agriculture emergency response, agroclimatic information systems (including price), and animal and plant health.  
From the private sector side, the main agriculture risk management instruments are the development and marketing of 
climate smart technologies (improved seeds, fertilizers, software and machinery, etc.), animal and plant health products, 
storage facilities, and agriculture insurance and commodity price derivatives.  

 
Relationship to CPF 
 
15. The project is fully aligned with the FY2015-18 World Bank Group’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for 
Argentina. The CPS identifies maintaining Argentina’s position as one of the world’s top food providers through adapting 
to climate change and addressing the needs of small farmers as one of the country’s development challenges for 
sustained poverty reduction and shared prosperity. Argentina’s high potential in agriculture is at risk due to the 
increasing number of severe climate events such as droughts and floods.  

16. The CPS focuses on reducing poverty and promoting shared prosperity.

 It is organized around nine results 
areas within three broad strategic pillars. The proposed project is aligned with Strategic Pillars I--“Sustaining 
Employment Creation in Farms and Firms”--and III--“Reducing Environmental Risks and Safeguarding Natural 
Resources”. Additionally,  the proposed project is also aligned with the recently widened focus to unlock long-term 
productivity growth and job creation under Pilar I, in response to the reorientation of policies by the new 
Administration.

15
   The project would contribute strongly to “Raising agricultural productivity of small- and medium-size 

farms in low income regions” (Result Area 3 of the CPS). It may also support outcomes included in two other CPS result 
areas: “Reducing exposure to extreme flooding in the Province of Buenos Aires” (Result Area 7), and “Improving natural

forest cover in the Chaco Eco Region” through the development of an agriculture and climate change information 
system that facilitates producers’ access to climate-related data.  

17. This project builds on previous work in Argentina and in the region on the improvement of the management 
of agriculture risks.  The Bank has provided support to Argentina in 2016 through the development of an Agriculture 
Risk Management Policy Note (P156197) and a technical assistance program for building the institutional capacity for 
managing agriculture risks and preparing for ENSO events (P159720).  This project also builds on the information 
systems and farm-level climate resilience technology adoption experiences of the ongoing Project for Increasing Climate 
Resilience & Enhancing Sustainable Land Management in the Southwest of the Buenos Aires Province (P125804) funded 
by the Adaptation Fund and executed through the Ministry of Environment, and the study on “Agricultura y ganadería. 
Impacto y vulnerabilidad al cambio climático” (2015)

16
 funded by the GEF Argentina Third National Communication 

UNFCCC (P116974) project.  The project will also work alongside ongoing and future IFC advisory services and 
investments financing green technologies for agribusinesses in Argentina through commercial Banks.  Furthermore, the 
Bank has provided support to the Ministry of Agroindustry in the past years, helping in the design of agriculture risk 
transfer instruments for the livestock sector in Buenos Aires Province and cotton producers in Chaco Province.  Finally, 
this project is based on the Bank’s approach towards an integrated management of agriculture risks, promoting 
resilience and sector competitiveness, focusing on the most vulnerable farmers

17
. 

18. The project would contribute to poverty reduction by ensuring the inclusion of the most vulnerable farm 
households in the risk management strategies and subsequent activities, as these households tend to be among the 
poorest in the country. Reduction of agricultural output volatility and improvements in emergency response times 
would also benefit firms and employees along the value chains benefitting from project interventions, mitigating income 
shocks and variations, which disproportionately affect the poorest sectors of society, and thus contributing to shared 
prosperity. 

19. Climate change co-benefits. By increasing the resilience of the sector, the project would contribute to climate 
change adaptation. While the focus of agriculture risk reduction strategies and plans to be supported by the project is on 
retrospective risk, they will also consider climate change impacts.  Project investments in infrastructure and technology 
adoption can be considered as “no regrets”, given that key future climate change hazards would likely manifest through 
increased frequency and intensity of current trends.

18
 

20. Nutrition co-benefits. The Project is expected to contribute to improvements in food security by its focus on: (i) 
improved information for planning and response to production and climate-related hazards in agriculture; (ii) mitigation 
of risks of vulnerable small farmers, who depend on their output for daily sustenance; (iii) mitigation of risks in high-
value sub-sectors, which provide permanent and temporary employment to significant numbers of people up and 
downstream agriculture value chains; and (iv) improved recovery of agricultural systems and thus reduction of volatility 
of food prices, which affect disproportionately the poor, nationally and globally.

C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  
 

 
 
The objective of the project is to contribute to strengthen resilience of the agroindustrial sector, particularly among 
the most vulnerable producers. This objective will be achieved through reduction of producers' vulnerability and 
exposure to climatic and market risk. 

 
Key Results (From PCN) 

 
i. Adoption of technologies and/or instruments for increased resilience (measured by number, type and gender 

of farmers; and area that has adopted production/market resilient technologies/instruments). [CORE SD 
INDICATOR: Farmers adopting improved agricultural technology] 

ii. Number of farmers (and/or area cultivated) that are part of an improved agriculture emergency system, by 
type of farmer and segregated by gender. [ CORE SD INDICATOR: Farmers reached with agricultural assets or 
services] 

iii. Number of Provinces that have adopted an integrated agriculture risk management plan. 
iv. Number of farmers participating in international value chains, among beneficiaries, by type and gender.

19
 

 
 
D. Concept Description 

 
21. Beneficiaries. The project will have as direct beneficiaries the most vulnerable small and medium-sized 
agricultural producers and small and medium-sized agricultural enterprises, located in the provinces where activities are 
carried out. It would reach about 70,000 small and medium producers and a number (TBD) of small and medium 
agribusiness firms. Small and medium farms, in particular those outside the main cereal production zones, are among 
the most vulnerable and have the lowest capacity to recover from negative impacts caused by external factors like 
extreme weather or market shocks. Small and medium-sized farmers conform mostly family-based units. Agriculture 
plays a varied role in these households, mostly depending on size and location, along a continuum of situations. 
Agriculture in small farms in marginal areas may function as a safety-net, part of a set of multiple activities in their 
livelihood strategies (close to 70 percent of the family members also work outside the farm, in other farms or sectors

20
). 

Many medium farms are well-integrated into markets, deploying advanced agriculture techniques and using wage labor.  

22. Gender. Women occupy a variety of roles in this continuum, from farm management to farm workers and are 
slightly over-represented in the smallest farms’ workforce. There are important gaps related to gender equality in the 
agroindustrial sector, though data is scant. Migration from poor rural areas may disproportionally affect both single and 
married women. Nevertheless, some young women are changing this trend by deciding to stay in rural areas in order to 
develop opportunities for themselves. Project preparation will explore gender aspects of vulnerability in order to 
determine if there is a need for specific support to women’s livelihood strategies.

 This indicator would be included if project design incorporates financing for export diversification, to reduce market risks and in 
line with Argentina’s policy to  become one of the world’s “supermarkets”.

23. Indirect beneficiaries. Contractors (firms and employees) who provide services to farmers and whose income 
often collapses when disaster strikes agriculture production; firms and their employees, up- and downstream the 
agriculture value chains, who depend on reliable supplies of agricultural products; provincial governments, which 
allocate scarce public funds to attending emergencies and whose revenues suffer when these occur in their jurisdictions. 
In addition, the project will strengthen the institutions responsible for generating and disseminating critical information 
for risk management and the offices responsible for managing responses to agricultural emergencies. 

24. Integrated framework for managing agriculture risks. The implementation of the framework implies a balance 
between existing public policies and programs, available public resources, and existing private sector technologies and 
instruments.  It also requires the development of a robust institutional structure to ensure policy and program 
integration and clear communications across various sector stakeholders.  Interinstitutional coordination to reduce 
response times after an event, improving targeting of risk management programs to the most vulnerable population and 
changing the risk management paradigm from an ex post to an ex ante system are key issues to be tackled by the 
proposed operation.  Thus, this project seeks to provide the public sector with the capacity and strategies for managing 
agriculture sector risks in an integrated fashion, increasing the resilience of the most vulnerable farmers while improving 
the effectiveness and efficiency of public spending.  

25. Components.  In order to contribute to implementing an integrated approach to risk management, the project is 
divided into three components that have been identified as the key areas of improvement within the existing public 
sector policies and programs in Argentina. Component 1 focuses on the provision of agroclimatic information (public 
service) for the management of agriculture risks, while components 2 and 3 focus on bringing integrated management of 
agriculture risks at the farm level, addressing different agriculture risk layers with different risk management strategies 
(risk mitigation, transfer and coping – see risk layering figure below). 

 

 
 
 

26. Component 1 - Strengthening agro-climatic information systems (approximate cost USD 15 million, of which 
80% from the Bank). Despite the fact that the GoA has made important progress in facilitating access of agro-climatic 
information and commodity prices for agriculture risk management purposes, there remain important limitations – 
technical and financial – that hinder sustained cooperation among government institutions, and the use of data by the 
private sector and the public. For instance and despite the existence of cooperation agreements among institutions that

Integrated Management of Agricultural Risk (P162316) 

 
 

  
Apr 02, 2017 Page 10 of 19  

     

generate data, heterogeneity of IT infrastructure and information systems still impedes coordination and cooperation. 
These constraints make it difficult to carry out risk monitoring and risk analyses in a timely manner. 

27. Based on an approach that intends to leverage public funds with private assets and participation, the 
component would finance improvements in capacity and interoperability of agroclimatic and price information systems 
operated or disseminated by the Ministry of Agroindustry (MAI) and other selected public and private entities linked to 
the agriculture sector. An example of this is the work being done to standardize and disseminate the agroclimatic data 
collected by private networks of meteorological stations with the ones of the National Meteorological Service (SMN) and 
of the National Agriculture Technology Institute (INTA).  Another example is the ongoing development of an information 
system that collects and publishes real-time spot prices of basic grains (Operations Information Systems for Grains

21
), 

which is a joint effort between MAI and the Agriculture Commodity Exchanges of Argentina. It would also improve the 
institutional capacity of selected institutions to analyze georeferenced data. The component would finance goods, 
training, consultant services and operational costs for the development or enhancement of agro-ecological data and 
information management systems. The project would also allocate resources to promote private- and public-sector 
development and implementation of IT systems and software solutions that improve access to agro-industrial 
information and enhance the assessment of agricultural risks associated with climate variability, climate change, and 
market price fluctuations. The key expected results from this component are: (i) a well-functioning early-warning system 
for the main hazards that affect agricultural value chains

22
; and (ii) a reliable and easily accessible system for the 

provision of production, price and meteorological information to the public. 

28. Subcomponent 1.1. Development of Tools and Systems. The purpose of this subcomponent is to consolidate 
and integrate production, price and meteorological information generated by a variety of public and private institutions. 
It envisages financing for the following activities: 

a. diagnostic of sector ICT capacities and systems;  
b. diagnostic of existing capacity for generation, transmission, maintenance, quality assurance and security 

of information;  
c. design and implementation of the infrastructure for provision of agro-industrial agro-climatic data, 

including systems for downloading, analyzing, visualizing and consulting data and information;  
d. design of protocols, standards and operation and maintenance manuals for supported tools and 

systems;  
e. integration and strengthening of key price and meteorological networks and data;  
f. development of historical synthetic data series for agroclimatic variables for probabilistic analysis; and 
g. strengthening of provincial and regional spatial data infrastructure selected on the basis of information 

gaps. 

                                            
21

 The real time price information system can be accessed at: www.siogranos.com.ar.  This information system received technical 
assistance from the World Bank in 2015 for its development and it is a unified system for the purchase and sale of grains that make 
up the Physical Market ("disponible", "cash", "forwards" a fijar "," directas ", etc.) and that arises according to the estab lished in the 
CNV - SAGyP Joint Resolution Nº 208 and 628. This system has been developed by the Cereal Stocks exchanges of Bahía Blanca, 
Buenos Aires, Córdoba and Entre Ríos, and the Stock Exchanges of Chaco, Rosario and Santa Fe, the Mercado a Término de Buenos 
Aires SA (MATba) and the Mercado a Término de Rosario S.A. (ROFEX). The products on which the aforementioned operations are to 
be reported are: wheat, corn, sunflower, soybean, soybean oil, forage barley and sorghum. The aim of the joint action is to improve 
transparency in the physical grain market and, in particular, to promote the link between the quality and the price of the products 
traded. 
22

 An example is the linkage and coordination with the Information and Early Warning System (IEWS) established under our 
Argentina Adaptation Fund: Increasing Climate Resilience & Enhancing Sustainable Land Management in the Southwest of the 
Buenos Aires Province (P125804) and coordinated between National Agriculture Technology Institute (INTA) and the National 
Meteorological Service (SMN).

29. Subcomponent 1.2. Institutional Capacity Development. This subcomponent aims at building the capacity of 
selected national and provincial government institutions for the operation of the supported information systems.  It 
would also promote the development of software solutions by the private sector, based on the data generated by the 
improved systems. This subcomponent would finance the following activities: 

a. hardware, software and training required for effective operation of selected national, provincial and 
decentralized entities; 

b. promotion and dissemination of visualization, consultation, analysis and data download tools developed 
by MAI, under an open data approach for private sector developers and use by other institutions; 

c. training of government staff and potential software developers in data management and information for 
agricultural risk management; and 

d. technical assistance for the design of market price references, agro-meteorological indexes and event 
impact analysis. 

 
30. Component 2 – Agriculture risk mitigation investments (approximate cost USD 125 million, of which 80% from 
the Bank). The purpose of the component would be to improve the resilience of agricultural systems prioritized through 
regional-level (inter-provincial) agriculture value-chain risk strategies and provincial-level integrated agriculture sector 
risk-management plans. The component would finance: (i) Rural public Infrastructure works; (ii) Afforestation, 
reforestation and watershed management to protect water sources, reduce flood risks, and as a basis to encourage the 
adoption of good practices and climate smart technologies; and (iii) incentives for the adoption of climate-smart 
agriculture technology and risk management instruments at the farm-level.  These would be financed through two 
subcomponents: 

 
31. Subcomponent 2.1. Infrastructure and natural resources management. This subcomponent aims to reduce the 
impact of climate and production risks events at the sub-regional level, as prioritized by risk management instruments. It 
would finance on-lending to provinces for the execution of risk mitigation subprojects (combinations of works, goods, 
consulting and non-consulting services, and operational costs) for:  

a. water for agriculture, including activities destined to capture, collect, store, distribute and use of water for 
agricultural production, as well as improvement in the efficiency in use of water (construction, rehabilitation and 
improvement of irrigation, micro-irrigation, surface and subterranean storage); 

b. natural resources management, including watershed management, drainage, forestation, reforestation and 
protection and recovery of forest, soil and water resources; 

c. other activities (to be defined) that may be prioritized in the risk management plans and which have 
demonstrated impacts on risk reduction. 

 
32. Subcomponent 2.2. Technical assistance to vulnerable producers. The purpose of this subcomponent is to 
promote the farm-level adoption of validated technologies to improve resilience of agricultural production systems. It 
may be deployed in combination with activities financed through subcomponent 2.2., or as standalone programs, all 
within approved risk management plans. The subcomponent would finance training and technical assistance services to 
farmer and farmer groups to:  

a. facilitate the adoption of good practices and climate smart production and storage technologies;  
b. improve the efficiency and sustainable operation of existing or new infrastructure; and 
c. facilitate access and use of agriculture insurance and price hedging instruments, and improve knowledge and 

purchase of such financial risk transfer instruments.

33. The subcomponent may also finance: (i) applied research, piloting and dissemination of promising but un-tested 
climate-smart technologies; (ii) research, piloting and dissemination for technological diversification (e.g. marine and 
aquaculture, agroforestry systems); and (iii) support for the implementation of certification and traceability systems (e.g. 
country-level value chains of global importance). 

34. The project would explore the provision of incentives through financial institutions (such as partial credit 
guarantees, credit lines, etc.) and/or matching grants for poor and vulnerable farmers whenever a public goods element 
is envisaged (effectiveness of regional works, food safety, human nutrition or food security, climate change adaptation 
or mitigation, demonstration effects, etc.), or to mitigate a market failure.  

35. The Project may also work on market risk with a long-term view, and at a high level, supporting a set of (inter-
ministerial) policies and interventions, as well as to their coordination, which aim to reduce Argentina’s heavy 
dependence on undiversified and basic commodity exports, and make Argentinian agriculture more competitive in the 
world stage. This is in line with the Government’s vision to make Argentina the “supermarket of the world”. To this end, 
the Project would support and scale up existing and new measures that aim to improve value-addition, and 
diversify/differentiate exports and markets in agriculture/agribusiness. It would finance, among others, technical 
assistance programs on marketing and standard development, and other private sector development initiatives, to 
accelerate productivity growth and global integration in a strategic set of agricultural value-chains. 

 
36. Component 3 – Agriculture Emergency Response Financing (approximate cost USD 37 million, of which 80% 
from Bank). This component aims to improve the operation of the current agricultural emergency system enacted by 
Law  26.509 (of 2009), in order to increase coverage for vulnerable producers.  This Agriculture Emergency Law (AEL) 
provides the main response mechanism that assists the agricultural sector against extreme events. Nevertheless, the 
National Emergency and Disaster Agricultural Fund, constituted through the AEL, lacks enough resources to implement 
risk preparedness, mitigation and response activities. The AEL does not provide a clear distinction of roles and 
responsibilities between federal and provincial governments in the aftermath of an extreme event, and all farmers are 
entitled to receive the same benefits, irrespective of their characteristics. Allocation of benefits is not governed by clear 
rules and the system lacks transparency.  Most AEL benefits are not able to be used by family farmers because they are 
linked to cancelation or delays in the repayment of formal bank loans, and since most family farmers to do not have 
access to formal credit, they are de facto excluded from this support, although they are the most affected by natural 
disasters. 

37. The component would work in two directions: (i) improving the efficiency, equity and transparency of the 
agriculture emergency system; and (ii) introducing risk mitigation and risk transfer instruments to improve the financial 
sustainability of the agriculture emergency systems, in particular in terms of climate-related events.   The project will 
also improve provincial institutional capacities for the management of agriculture emergencies, promoting the use of a 
more integrated risk financing structure. At the national level, it would support the design, implementation and 
purchase of risk financing instruments (credits, guarantees, insurance, derivatives, etc.) in a pari passu modality with 
selected provincial governments.  The component would finance the following activities: 

a. Technical assistance for MAI’s Agricultural Emergency Subsecretariat in order to strengthen the systems for 
decision making, benefit allocation, and registry and monitoring of beneficiaries; 

b. Development of aggregate (provincial or regional-level) agriculture risk financing instruments (parametric 
insurance, catastrophe bonds, contingent lines of credit, weather derivatives, etc.), as well as training and 
technical assistance for their validation and adoption; and  

c. Payment of premiums and related costs of agriculture risk financing instruments to be piloted under the 
framework of the system of agricultural emergency, on the basis of national and/or provincial demands.

38. The component may also include support for the design of instruments for price risk transfer for agricultural 
commodities and risks that are covered by current private sector agents. It may also provide support to build capacities 
in the public and private sectors for agricultural risk valuation and analysis. 

 
39. Component 4-- Project coordination, monitoring and evaluation (approximate cost USD 10 million, of which 
80% from the Bank). Provision of support to MAI, through its Rural Change Unit (UCAR), for carrying out: (a) project 
coordination and management; (b) monitoring, results evaluation and impact assessment of project activities; (c) project 
fiduciary administration, internal controls and audits; (d) project environmental and social risk/safeguards management; 
(e) a citizen’s engagement mechanism; and (vii) project-related studies. 

 
 

 
 
    

  SAFEGUARDS 

 
A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 

 
Specific subprojects to be financed under component 2 to strengthen resilience of the agricultural sector will not be 

identified before the project appraisal, and therefore their specific locations and environmental and social conditions are 
not known at the moment. While the project is national in scope, the natural environments of the Argentine provinces 
are very varied, including high diversity of ecosystems ranging from forests to desert and the Andes Mountains. The 
respective social and productive contexts are also diverse, the producer groups varying from large producers to 
subsistence farmers. Due to the national scope of the project, the project addresses potential presence of Indigenous 
Peoples. 
 
B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 

 
The implementing agency will be the Ministry of Agroindustry (MAI), through the Rural Change Unit (Unidad para el 

Cambio Rural-UCAR). The project’s environmental and social risk and safeguards management will be responsibility of 
UCAR’s Environmental and Social Unit, and previous experience has allowed it to enhance its capacity to streamline 
safeguards implementation and monitoring. However, beyond UCAR with previous experience with Bank-financed 
agriculture development projects and its strong commitment and active involvement during implementation of said 
operations, the project’s decentralized implementation approach will involve a number of provinces with uneven 
institutional capacities and diverse regulations, including limited resources to implement the required safeguards 
procedures. Further, despite of UCAR’s wide experience, it has recently faced some challenges regarding implementation 
of OP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement, in particular when addressing existing gaps between national and provincial 
regulatory and institutional frameworks and the OP 4.12 requirements. In conclusion, there is room for safeguards 
related capacity building. UCAR’s and the responsible provincial agencies’ institutional capacity needs will be assessed in 
detail as the project preparation proceeds and the identified actions included in the project design.

D. Policies that might apply 

 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

The project will implement an integrated framework 
for managing agriculture risks, including a diverse set 
of investments. It aims to have an overall highly 
positive socioeconomic and environmental impact, 
including improvements in watershed management, 
reforestation, and application of climatic information 
systems to facilitate agricultural production planning 
and decrease climate related income loss. OP/BP 4.01 
is triggered as the physical interventions/subprojects 
under component 2 could have negative 
environmental impacts in case not properly managed. 
However, the majority of project activities are 
expected to have low to moderate impacts that can be 
prevented or mitigated. In socioeconomic terms, 
positive impacts are expected in terms of 
improvement of existing public infrastructure e.g. on 
irrigation.  
 
Negative cumulative impacts are not expected as all 
activities will be implemented in areas already under 
agricultural production. Further, the project will 
promote good environmental practices as a means to 
improved management of agricultural risks and thus 
reduction of producers' vulnerability through exposure 
to climatic and market risks. The project will also 
finance activities to avoid or restore land degradation 
in adjacent watersheds. 
 
As the subprojects will only be defined during project 
implementation, the project requires an 
Environmental and Social Management Framework 
(ESMF) that UCAR will prepare, including a framework 
level Environmental and Social Management Plan 
(ESMP). The ESMF will guide identification and 
adoption of measures to mitigate environmental and 
social impacts and good practices to create 
environmental and social value added. The ESMF will 
be structured to prevent, minimize and mitigate 
impacts on forests, water resources, worker and 
community health and safety, as well as public 
infrastructure and services. The ESMF will reference 
the relevant sections of the World Bank Group General 



 
The World Bank  
Integrated Management of Agricultural Risk (P162316) 

 
 

  
Apr 02, 2017 Page 15 of 19  

     

Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) Guidelines e.g. 
on annual crop production, perennial crops and 
related water consumption and management. 
 
As part of the ESMF preparation, UCAR will prepare a 
Social Assessment (SA) that will focus on the analysis 
of the situation of small and medium, indigenous and 
female farmers; in general those that are primarily 
linked to regional economies and thus the most 
vulnerable against climate related risks and with the 
lowest capacity to recover from negative impacts 
caused by external factors like extreme weather or 
market shocks. The scope of the SA will include 
indigenous communities/farmers in order to assess 
whether there are specific challenges they face to 
recover from negative impacts. 
 

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 Yes 

The project will develop capacity of national and local 
institutions for effective environmental planning and 
management in relation to climatic risks and improved 
land use practices. Even though all the productive 
activities financed by the project will be implemented 
in areas already under agricultural production, OP/BP 
4.04 is triggered for precautionary purposes as 
watershed management and flood control 
investments financed by the project may require 
restoration activities e.g. on buffer or adjacent zones 
to protected areas. If such situation is identified at the 
subproject screening stage, the ESMF will require 
identification of support activities to strengthen the 
associated management instruments/practices. 
Triggering OP/BP 4.04 will secure the project is able to 
implement potential restoration activities related to 
any type of natural habitat. The ESMF will include a 
negative list that will exclude any investment that 
might impact negatively any type of natural habitat. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 Yes 

OP/BP 4.36 is triggered as project is expected to 
finance forestation, reforestation, and protection and 
recovery of forests, particularly as part of watershed 
management. Only investments with positive impacts 
on forests and/or people dependent on forests will be 
eligible. The project will not intervene in the forest 
value chain. As component 2 will promote 
diversification of agricultural production and finance 
climate-smart technologies (e.g. agroforestry systems 
and agro-silvo-pastoral models), the project is

expected to contribute to reducing pressure on forests 
and favor their management and conservation efforts. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

The project will finance subprojects in agricultural 
systems that may require use of agrochemicals. By 
project appraisal, a list of agriculture innovations to be 
promoted by the project will be prepared, and some 
of them will most probably include use of agro-
chemicals. Additional technologies might be 
incorporated later on, and support is also envisioned 
to agricultural technology research that may involve 
agrochemicals. In every case, the policy will be applied 
using a negative list on prohibited substances and 
promoting integrated pest management. 
 
The ESMF will guide related screening and preparation 
of an Integrated Pest Management Plan (IPMP) for 
each subproject that may require use of 
agrochemicals, including proper management of any 
chemical waste. 
 
A positive list will be prepared to identify relevant 
natural/organic and low toxic pesticides and 
herbicides. Related training and capacity building 
activities will be included in the ESMF. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 Yes 

Project implementation is not expected to have any 
negative impact on identified physical cultural 
resources. However, the OP/BP 4.11 is triggered for 
precautionary purposes. The ESMF will provide 
guidance to address potential chance finds during 
implementation of construction activities and soil 
excavation. The Environmental and Social Unit of 
UCAR has proven experience and appropriate 
procedures in place to address chance finds, aligned 
with Argentina’s well-developed legislative framework 
on the subject. The ESMF will also include reference to 
further guidance in case any subproject would relate 
to landscapes with historical/cultural significance, yet 
that is not envisioned at least at the PCN stage. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 Yes 

The project will trigger OP 4.10 due to its national 
scope. Indigenous peoples are present in Argentina 
(about 2.5 percent of the population), and the income 
of several indigenous communities is linked to 
agriculture. As part of the preparation of the social 
assessment, UCAR will prepare an Indigenous Peoples 
Planning Framework (IPPF) to ensure that: (i) 
indigenous peoples' groups are afforded opportunities 



 
The World Bank  
Integrated Management of Agricultural Risk (P162316) 

 
 

  
Apr 02, 2017 Page 17 of 19  

     

to participate in planning of project activities that 
affects them; (ii) opportunities to provide such groups 
with culturally appropriate benefits are considered; 
and (iii) any subproject that could have a negative 
impact on indigenous peoples will not be eligible for 
project funding, or otherwise minimized and 
mitigated. 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

The project will trigger OP 4.12 since it includes 
infrastructure works that may imply either physical or 
economic displacement of people and/or business in 
the project area (e.g. activities like irrigation, and flood 
risk reduction may imply involuntary resettlement). 
UCAR will prepare a Resettlement Policy Framework 
(RPF) that will guide the preparation of specific 
Resettlement Action Plans (RAP), as required. 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 Yes 

The Project will not finance building of any large dam. 
However, OP/BP 4.37 is triggered as it is possible that 
irrigation or water supply may rely on performance of 
an existing dam. The ESMF will guide, when needed, 
the applicable review and evaluation of the operation 
and maintenance procedures of the relevant existing 
dam and presentation of the related report. Said 
report will include findings and recommendations for 
any remedial work or safety measures that, if needed, 
will have to be undertaken before the start of 
operations on the relevant subproject.  
 
Similar procedures have been in use and proven 
satisfactory during the implementation of other Bank-
funded projects with UCAR (e.g.  Second Provincial 
Agricultural Development Project - P106684). UCAR 
has signed an agreement with ORSEP, the Argentine 
Dam Safety Regulatory Agency, which will ensure 
proper dam safety supervision when needed. 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

TBD 

The project is not expected to finance activities that 
could adversely affect other riparians, particularly as 
most of them would be upstream. The project will not 
finance large dams, and potential irrigation projects 
are expected to relate with ongoing and/or minor 
schemes that (i) will not adversely change the quality 
or quantity of water flows to the other riparians; and 
(ii) will not be adversely affected by the other 
riparians' possible water use. Triggering and 
addressing of OP/BP 7.50 will be analyzed in further 
detail with UCAR and the World Bank legal specialists 
as the project preparation proceeds.

E. Safeguard Preparation Plan  
 
Tentative target date for preparing the Appraisal Stage PID/ISDS 
 
Jul 31, 2017 
 

Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed. The specific studies and 
their timing should be specified in the Appraisal Stage PID/ISDS 
 
UCAR will prepare, consult and disclose the ESMF, SA, IPPF and RPF with support and respective approvals by the World 

Bank by the project appraisal that is currently scheduled for August 22, 2017. The ESMF will be prepared based on the 
ESMFs of UCAR's earlier projects with World Bank financing, including improvements and adjustments/additions in terms 
of related lessons learnt and the particular features of this new operation, particularly in terms of climate-smart practices. 
 
The criteria and methodology to be used to select project beneficiaries with focus on the most vulnerable producers, as 

well as the mechanisms to be used for project related consultations and grievances will be discussed with UCAR as the 
project preparation proceeds.

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 
 
1. Ethiopia is a large, landlocked, and diverse country. It is the 11th poorest country in the world by 
income per person, and home to Sub-Saharan Africa’s second largest population of about 92 million people, the 

vast majority of which are rural dwellers. The natural resources base remains the foundation for most 

livelihoods, and is subject to considerable climate risks. Despite past progress, a historic legacy of 

underinvestment still bears its mark as more than half of the adult population is illiterate and the country’s 

infrastructure deficits remains one of the largest in the world. Ethiopia is undergoing a faster demographic 

transition than the rest of Africa and the rapidly rising working-age population presents opportunities as well as 

challenges. 

 

2. Ethiopia has experienced a sustained period of rapid economic growth and progress towards the 
achievement of Millennium Development Goals (MDG), however it retains a very high poverty rate, high levels 

of chronic under-nutrition and continued vulnerability of households and communities.  The “development 

state” model, put in place following the overthrow of the repressive military regime in the early 1990s, has seen 

high levels of government-led investment in infrastructure, a commitment to decentralization of service delivery 

and devolution of authority and some liberalization of the economy.  While these reforms have progressed to 

different degrees, the impacts on the economy have been broadly positive, with strong and generally broad-

based economic growth averaging around 10 percent over the past 10 years.  

 

3. The services and agricultural based economy is relatively stable, but the private sector remains nascent. 
Agriculture accounts for most jobs and about 40 percent of output and exports. Services accounts for close to 

half of output and half of exports. Manufacturing shares of output, jobs and exports have remained stagnant at 

around five percent, but the sector holds the promise of a takeoff. The economy is relative stable though high 

inflation presents occasional challenges. Substantial external deficits arise largely as a result of very low exports 

and high public capital imports. Supported by a system of financial repression and other heterodox macro-

financial policies, Ethiopia has the third highest public investment rate in the world, but the sixth lowest private 

investment rate. This reflects a fledgling private sector with state owned enterprises dominating several key 

services sectors. 

 

4. Albeit from a low base, the country has seen solid progress on a range of human development 
indicators. Poverty in both rural and urban areas has been reduced substantially though remains high by 

international standards, with 78 percent of the population living below US$2 per day. Despite high levels of 

public resources channeled to the sector, the MDG targets for universal primary education would likely not be 

met, though gender parity is on course. With respect to health and nutrition, Ethiopia is on track to reach the 

child mortality, HIV-AIDS and malaria MDGs as a result of the expansion of health infrastructure and service 

delivery systems.  Under-nutrition remains a major challenge: despite reductions, levels of underweight and 

stunted children remain very high, and is prevalent in both food secure and food insecure districts and within all 

but the highest wealth quintile.  

 

5. The vision of the country, as expressed in the Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP, 2009/10 to 
2014/15), and in tvhe Second Growth and Transformation Plan (GTPII, 2015 to 2020) is to reach the level of a 

middle-income economy by 2025.  This is an ambitious goal, and would require the country to move to a higher

growth trajectory and address persistent challenges including ensuring macro-economic stability, the lagging 

quality of social services, the weak capacity of the public sector and encouraging a higher level of private 

investment. Further opening of the economy would be vital to achieve increased productivity and 

competitiveness in the industrial and services sector and to achieve the government’s ambitious plans for 

agricultural transformation.  

 

6. The challenges of moving to higher growth need also to be set in the context of significant external and 
internal risks that may need to be addressed. External economic shocks could impact on growth, including the 

decline in prices for export commodities, while issues with neighboring countries could increase domestic 

instability, including tensions with Eritrea, instability in Somalia and South Sudan, and the on-going water 

related dispute with Egypt.  Internally, vulnerability to natural disasters, mainly drought, would continue to 

undermine development efforts, with trends suggesting an increase in rainfall variability. 
 
Sectoral and Institutional Context 
 
7. The agricultural sector remains a dominant sector in Ethiopia and contributes significantly to economic 
growth. Although the Ethiopian economy is undergoing a structural transformation, (from agriculture to 

services), agriculture comprises 45 percent of total output and employs 78 percent of its labor force. In addition, 

the sector is a major contributor to export earnings, with over 80 percent of goods exports (including coffee). 

Despite its declining share in the economy, the agriculture sector is growing rapidly. Based on official statistics, 

the sector grew on average by 7 percent per year over the past 15 years. Although there is debate about the 

reliability of these figures, with some studies showing a slower growth rate, there is consensus that the sector 

grew at fast pace over the past decade. The key sources of growth include: (1) increased area under cultivation; 

(2) increased productivity, largely driven by large public investments in agricultural extension and rural roads 

among others, and (3) some advances in public policy including improvements in land tenure security. In 

addition to contributing to economic output and exports, agricultural growth correlates with poverty reduction 

through positive impacts on farming and non-farm rural economies.  

 

8. Livestock (including fisheries) is emerging as a priority focus area for the Government. It is as part of its 
ambitious plans under the GTP2, which would support the country to move towards middle-income status by 

2025. Despite the neglect and lack of attention to date, the livestock sector is seen as significant in achieving 

multiple goals of the government including: (i) contribution to overall economic growth, including an increase 

in the volume and value of exports; (ii) contributing to poverty reduction in both highland and lowland areas; 

(iii) contributing to improved food security and nutritional outcomes for rural and urban households; and 

(iv) supporting the country’s green growth priorities. In this context, the Government has laid the institutional 

and analytical basis for the sector with the creation of the new Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries (MoLF) in 

October 2015, and the recent approval of the Livestock Master Plan (LMP) based on a rigorous Livestock 

Sector Analysis.  

 

9. Ethiopia has 55 million head of cattle, 78 million goats and sheep, 28 million chickens and 5 million 
beehives. It has the largest livestock population in Africa and ranks fifth in the world

1
. In addition, there is 

potential to better utilize water resources to develop the fisheries and aquaculture sector. In spite of this 

potential, food, nutrition and livelihood securities remain a challenge for many households. Approximately 44

.   

 

10. Spurred by population growth, increasing urbanization and incomes, domestic demand for meat and 
dairy products continues to grow. The meat and dairy markets present huge opportunities for business, and 

increasing the availability of animal sourced products can address food and nutrition security challenges in 

Ethiopia. However, key challenges continue to undermine the performance and potential of the livestock sector. 

The sector as a whole is characterized by low production and productivity levels. For example, the average milk 

yield of Ethiopian cows is 1.5 kg per day, which is lower compared to other countries in the region such as 

Kenya (3.6 kg per day) and Rwanda (3.6 kg per day), and significantly lower compared to major milk producing 

countries such as China (7.8 kg per day) and the US (25 kg per day)
3
. Several factors undermine livestock 

productivity and production. Inadequate feeds, poor animal health due to disease prevalence, low livestock 

genetic make-up, weak adoption of improved livestock practices and weak livestock support services are major 

sources of low productivity levels. The public sector dominates livestock support service delivery, and service 

delivery systems for animal health, breeding, feed, finance and extension are weak.   

 

11. Livestock disease incidence is high and to limit its impact, especially economic losses for producers, 
animal health and veterinary services need to work more effectively both in terms of quality of service and 

institutional management. Often rural farmers are underserved -- one health post covers three Kebeles – and 

complain that service provided do not meet their needs. There are over 5000 health staff in the public sector and 

the private sector engagement is limited to urban and peri-urban areas.
4
 There is also dissatisfaction with the 

quality of drugs and vaccines available. The National Veterinary Institute produces 12-17 vaccines for 

transboundary and for some endemic animal diseases. Other vaccines are imported.  Counterfeit and 

substandard drugs are sold next to quality drugs and over 90 percent of animal drugs are imported.
5
 VDFACA is 

responsible for regulation and control of veterinarian vaccines and drugs but is a new agency and building 

capacity.     

 

12. Poor animal nutrition due to feed scarcity, quality and affordability is another key challenge to livestock 
productivity in Ethiopia.  In dairy, only 0.2 percent of cattle holders use improved feed

6
. Limited use of 

improved fodder production and underdeveloped feed preservation practices result in feed shortages in the 

highland mixed crop livestock system, while bush encroachment and rangeland deterioration due to lack of 

sustainable resource management  limit feed availability in pastoral and agro-pastoral areas. Overall, grassland 

coverage of Ethiopian land has been reduced from 30 percent (1980) to 12 percent (2000)
7
. This has 

significantly reduced the amount of roughage available for livestock feed. Extension work in feed has not paid 

significant attention to improved conservation and use of crop residue and by products. In addition, the 

imposition of a 60 percent VAT tax on imported feed pre-mix, concentrates and other inputs combined with 

high custom duties (53 percent) on feed mill ingredients significantly raises the cost of production
8
. These 

factors hinder the use of improved feed and fodder, limiting nutritional health and productivity of livestock.    

 

13. Over 90 percent of Ethiopia’s livestock population is of indigenous breeds (cattle 98 percent and poultry 
95 percent) with low productivity levels. For an average laying period, indigenous chickens lay on average 12

eggs per hen compared to 107 eggs for exotic breeds
9
. Improving the genetic potential through crossbreeding 

and improving indigenous breeds is paramount in raising livestock productivity. The National Artificial 

Insemination Center (NAIC) produces and distributes semen at heavily subsidized cost ($0.23 cents per 

insemination)
10

. However, conception rates remain very low (less than 40 percent on average). AI service 

delivery is weak: producers often do not obtain the service at the right time and the NAIC collects and processes 

inadequate semen. There is a need for policy to encourage competition among alternatives AI service providers, 

while the national breeding policy focuses on guiding the choice of breeds and monitor breeding materials.  

 

14. Markets of livestock products are largely unorganized and fragmented. In dairy, only 2 percent of 
marketed milk supplied from the highlands is handled by the organized sector concentrated in urban areas. The 

rest is sold through informal channels, which are characterized by no licensing requirements, limited 

compliance with safety standards and high risks of contamination. For meats, there is inadequate control and 

inspection of abattoirs. Backyard production characterizes the poultry sector, yet the potential of backyard 

poultry remains untapped. Per capita consumption of milk and poultry in Ethiopia are low, compared to those in 

other East African markets
11

. However, Ethiopians regularly consume dairy products
12

, and the projected 

increase in demand in response to population growth, urbanization presents business opportunities in milk and 

meat markets
13

, especially opportunities that can include more women (e.g. milk and poultry).  

 

15. To increase the potential of the livestock product markets, including export of livestock products, 
several improvements are needed including, strengthening market linkages, increasing per capita consumption 

and greater awareness of the nutritional value of milk and livestock products, increasing value addition, and 

improving food safety and quality measures. Most of all, there is a need to rethink the roles of the public and 

private sectors: there is considerable scope to increase private sector investment in production, processing and 

service provision, while strengthening national programs’ capacity and government’s regulatory roles.   

 

16. The main elements justifying increased investment in the sector are as follows: (i) Ethiopia has the 
largest livestock population in Africa, which can be a major asset for economic growth, poverty reduction, 

improved food security and nutritional outcomes; (ii) the livestock sector is underperforming despite its 

enormous potential; (iii) public services to the agriculture sector have prioritized the crop sector over livestock. 

The main service delivery with respect to the feed, animal health and animal breeding has faced systemic and 

operational challenges limiting the sector to develop; (iv) low participation of the private sector in livestock 

sector limits private investments and opportunities for intensification and commercialization. Weak market 

linkages and high cost of basic inputs and low access to appropriate financial products are major features of the 

smallholder livestock systems; and (v) weak institutional capacity throughout the sector, including in private 

and public organizations is a further hindrance to the growth of the sector.  

17. It is in this context that the Government is now giving greater attention to the sector. The  Government 
of Ethiopia has recently completed the LMP, which provides an ambitious vision for the transformation of the 

sector. In view of this, there is a clear and strong rationale to design a livestock project to address the challenges 

of overall weak performance of the sector, limited access to quality livestock services and markets, limited 

participation of the private sector and institutional and policy gaps and challenges existing in the sector.

18. Key guiding principles underpinning preparation of the proposed project include: 

a. The needs are long term and require policy and institutional reforms, coupled with public and 
private sector investments. The requested IDA support would therefore need to be positioned in a 

broader, longer term support to the sector. The proposed project, likely to have a six year timeframe, 

would aim to invest in addressing some immediate needs in the sector, while supporting key 

institutional building blocks for the longer term development of the sector. 

b. The team would aim to bring in leading global technical knowledge to the preparation process, 
including a close collaboration with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations 

(FAO), the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) and the World Organization for Animal 

Health (OIE). In this regard, it has been agreed with FAO that its staff would join the preparation 

team and provide substantive inputs for the project design process. 

c. The preparation process would seek to collaborate with IFC, IFAD and on-going WB-financed 
projects to ensure alignment and where appropriate to seek opportunities for more formal 

collaboration and/or co-financing. 

The project would engage with multiple stakeholders in the sector. From the Government side, this would 

stretch beyond the MoLF, and include further relevant Ministries and Agencies, including the Ministry of 

Natural Resource Management (MoNRM), Ministry of Trade, Ministry of Industry, the Agricultural 

Transformation Agency (ATA), etc., at both Federal and Regional levels. It would also include private sector 

participants and associations, and farmer/herder/professional representatives. 
 
Relationship to CPF 
 

19. The Ethiopia Country Partnership Strategy dated August 29, 2012 was completed at the end of FY16 
and the new Country Partnership Framework (CPF) is under preparation. It will be based on the Systematic 

Country Diagnostic (SCD), which was completed in March 2016. The SCD identifies the most critical 

constraints and opportunities facing Ethiopia to accelerate progress towards the WBG twin goals. It emphasizes 

the leading role that agricultural growth (including livestock) has had in driving the reduction of poverty. The 

predominance of agriculture as a source of income for the poorer households in Ethiopia suggests that growth in 

the sector will remain important for poverty reduction in the coming years. The SCD identifies eight binding 

constraints to the achievement of the twin goals, including poor market access for farmers and an uncompetitive 

private sector. These resonate with the aims of the LMP, which emphasizes the need for private sector 

investment with approaches that link livestock producers better to markets. Although still in draft, the new CPF 

will likely include objectives to develop the institutions, services and infrastructure to increase private sector 

engagement in the economy, and to increase agricultural and livestock productivity and commercialization. The 

project would be closely aligned to these goals, as it would aim to increase smallholder productivity and for 

selected products to improve the linkages for smallholders to value chains, and would support the improved 

functioning of these value chains.

C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  
 

 
 
Increase livestock and fisheries productivity , commercialization and market access of targeted smallholders in 
Ethiopia. 

 

20. Strategic approach. The principal aim of the project is to support the government’s strategy for livestock 
growth and transformation as articulated in its GTP2 and LMP in adding value to the existing investments in 

support to the sector. It also supports the fisheries sector, not included on the LMP but newly added by the 

government as a clear priority. The proposed project would follow a dual approach of: (i) supporting immediate 

and long-term capacity building of the newly established MoLF and its strategic national programs; and (ii) 

targeting strategic commodity value chains through a comprehensive support to smallholder producers, in line 

with the government cluster approach.   

 
21. Direct beneficiaries. The primary beneficiaries of the project would include smallholder farmers 
inclusive of family, traditional and small-scale producers; smallholder farmers with improved husbandry 

practices; and producer organizations. Smallholder producers are being considered around four different levels 

of advancement (para. 23). Other direct beneficiaries would be: (i) livestock farmer’s organizations and their 

apex institutions; (ii) small and medium scale private livestock operators and enterprises; (iii) vulnerable groups, 

particularly women and youths; and (iv) livestock support services institutions, including public livestock 

research and extension services, NGOs, and service providers involved in the targeted livestock value chains in 

the project areas.  

22. Indirect beneficiaries. Secondary beneficiaries would include other livestock producers not directly 
involved with the project activities who would indirectly benefit from the national programs (e.g. improved 

animal diseases service delivery). Value chain actors (buyers, processors, and exporters) would benefit from 

increased provision of livestock products. On the consumption side, consumers in Ethiopia would benefit from 

increased and better quality of national animal sourced products supply. Other indirect beneficiaries would be 

livestock service providers, including private veterinarians, and inputs providers, including feed, veterinary 

medicines, and genetic material suppliers. 

23. Transformation pathway. In order to address the actors in holistic and systematic manner, the 
identification mission developed a transformation pathway for improved livestock productivity and 

commercialization. In this pathway, the project envisions the smallholder farmers to move through stages (Stage 

1: Smallholder farmer, Stage 2: stage 1 with improved husbandry practices, Stage 3: stage 2 organized into 

producer organizations and Stage 4: stage 3 in productive partnerships along the value chain) for them to 

achieve the goals of increased productivity, commercialization, and market access, in an inclusive and 

sustainable manner. Each stage requires a specific set of interventions tailored to the beneficiary present status 

in the transformation pathway. Therefore, the project would simultaneously intervene in all four stages of the 

transformation pathway, but with a differentiated focus: stage 1 and stage 2, where most of the Ethiopian 

smallholders are present, would require fundamental access to quality services, inputs and organization and 

management skills; stage 3 and stage 4, where fewer actors are currently present, would require more 

specialized support. Figure 1 below elaborates about the transformation pathway in more detail.

24. Target Value Chains. The project would target three priority value chains considered strategic both for 
food security/national supply and for their potential for growth and innovation. The primary target value chains 

are: (i) dairy with small-scale mixed crop-livestock systems in wet highlands and dairy belts, including peri-

urban areas; (ii) poultry with small-scale broilers and layers systems in all highlands, urban and peri-urban 

production zones; and (iii) fish with improved inland fisheries and aquaculture in selected suitable areas. In 

addition, the project would support the red meat value chain nation-wide through its support to the strategic 

national programs on animal health, access to feed and traceability system, as well as through its direct support 

to the dairy value chain in small-scale mixed crop-livestock systems through specific income generating 

activities such as fattening. The latter would be supported through the capacity building of national programs.  

There is a strong rationale for the selection of the dairy, poultry, and fisheries and aquaculture value chains for 

the project. These commodities are important for the food and nutritional security of the country. Milk is a 

remunerative commodity which can have a significant impact on poverty alleviation efforts for the estimated 8 

million households in Mixed Rainfall Sufficient (MRS) and Mixed Rainfall Deficient (MRD) regions that have 

dairy cattle as primary livestock. In addition, improving the productivity of the dairy sector would have positive 

effect in reducing GHG emission intensity and climatic sustainability. Poultry meat and eggs are important 

sources of protein. Successful poultry interventions would enable the sub-sector to move to improved and more 

organized family poultry with semi-scavenging crossbreds, better access to services, inputs and markets, and 

expand its scale of more specialized dual purposes breeds, and layer and broiler operations. Such a 

transformation would contribute considerably to reducing poverty and increase national income. In addition, 

improving the productivity of the poultry sector would have positive effect on the feed conversion ratio (kg feed 

per kg product), and help meet the Climate Resilience Growth Economy target of increasing the share of 

chicken meat to total meat consumption from the current 5% to 27% by 2030, by substituting red meat with the 

chicken meat. This substitution can have environmental benefits as red meat comes from larger high-emitting 

ruminant. Fisheries and aquaculture are important to address the food and nutrition security. Fish is a 

remunerative commodity and can play a significant role in poverty alleviation efforts for the 100,000 

households who largely depend on fishing, with the potential to increase the number of households to half a

million. Sustainable investment in fisheries would enable Ethiopia to exploit the ample potential of its 

renewable fisheries resources found in many lakes, reservoirs and rivers. Investors are eager to enter the 

aquaculture sub-sector. But some major hurdles including high quality fingerling and fish-feed production, need 

to be removed for such investment to actualize. 

 

25. Geographical targeting: The primary geographic focus area of the project would be the rural and peri-
urban areas of the highland regions where the dairy, poultry, fisheries and aquaculture value chains dominate. 

Furthermore, the project would follow the Government cluster approach and intervene in the existing or planned 

clusters of dairy, poultry and fisheries and aquaculture. This would enable the project to benefit from synergistic 

gains which might arise from other investment (infrastructure, private sector, etc.) coming in these clusters. 

Tentatively, the project might be implemented in the following regions/places in Ethiopia: Amhara, Addis 

Ababa, Oromiya, SNNR, Tigray, Harari, Benishangul Gumuz, Dire Dawa and Gambella. 

 
Key Results (From PCN) 

 
26. The following PDO level results indicators have been identified : 

(i) Number of direct project beneficiaries reached, disaggregated by gender (core indicator) and age 
group (18-35 yrs., representing the youth); 

(ii) Percentage increase of productivity of targeted small-scale productions (by selected commodity);  

(iii) Percentage increase in the sales of targeted small scale production (by selected commodity); and 

(iv) Beneficiary satisfaction rate with livestock services delivery systems supported by the project 
(disaggregated by gender and age group). 

 
D. Concept Description 

 

27. The project would be structured as an Investment Project Financing (IPF), funded by an IDA credit for 
US$150 million over six years (to be confirmed). At this stage, it was agreed with the Government to consider 

structuring the project around the following four components: (A) Strengthening National Programs; (B) 

Farmer’s Access to Productive Services, Inputs and Assets; (C) Farmer’s Access to Output Markets; and 

(D) Project management, coordination and monitoring and evaluation. This structure would be further reviewed 

and revised if necessary during the preparation period.    

28. The first component is crosscutting and designed to build immediate and long term human and 
institutional capacity of the key actors in the livestock and fisheries sector, as well as support key Strategic 

National Programs (SNPs), notably on animal health, feed and genetic [in order to improve the delivery of 

livestock services to small scale livestock producers]. The second component is designed to support sustainable 

productivity increase in the selected commodity value chains, through improved smallholders’ access to 

effective livestock and fisheries services, inputs and productive assets. The third component is designed to 

allow better access to markets for smallholders, through collective actions and productive partnerships, by 

supporting business linkages between livestock producer organizations and/or cooperatives, buyers and 

financial institutions and value addition at producer organizations/cooperatives levels where business

opportunities exist. The fourth component would support implementation of the first three components and 

inform the project execution and performance monitoring, reporting and knowledge management. 

 

Component A: Strengthening National Programs.  The first component of the project would be designed to 

building immediate and long-term human and institutional capacity of the livestock and fisheries sector key 

actors, as well as supporting key selected strategic national programs (SNPs). In addition, this component 

could support the development of a contingency emergency response plan, to increase preparedness in the 

event of a crisis affecting the livestock sector (subcomponent A4). 

 

This component would have the following four sub-components:  

 

29. Sub-component A1. Policy development, investment planning and sector coordination. This sub-
component would strengthen staff capacity in the MoLF to carry out its core responsibilities of sector analysis, 

policy preparation and implementation, and sector monitoring and evaluation, and coordination. Activities 

could include: identification of short-and long-term training and education needs, improvement of the MoLF 

information system, development of a communication strategy and implementation plan to improve the relation 

between the ministry and key stakeholders involved in the targeted value chains, including private investors and 

financial institutions, supporting ongoing modernization and implementation of the sector legislation including 

the development of norms, quality and safety standards of inputs and animal sourced products.  

 

30. Sub-component A2. Sustainable animal health and advisory services. Strengthening Veterinary 
Services (VS) would enhance the government long-term capacity to detect and respond quickly to major disease 

outbreaks (PPR, CBPP, FMD, HPAI and NCD to name a few). It would further contribute to the control of 

‘diseases of production’ (parasitic, vector-born or bacteriological diseases) that negatively affect animal 

productivity. This component would build on the recent results from the OIE Performance of Veterinary 

Services pathway. In conjunction with the SNP2, it aims to promote partnership between the public authorities, 

the private veterinarians, and the associative actors, especially through: (1) re-focusing the official VS towards 

its core public functions, (2) scaling up of the sanitary mandate approach (delegating, under the oversight of the 

official VS, public tasks to private veterinarians), (3) progressive transfer of private tasks to the private and 

associative actors, and (4) supporting the veterinary statutory body (auto-control of the veterinary profession).  

 

31.  Strengthening Extension Services (ES), especially animal husbandry management practices, would 
require a transition from a public system of technical subjects delivery to a public-private system of 

comprehensive and adapted (basic or specialized) advisory services. In conjunction with the SNPs, the specific 

path for such a transformation would be defined during project preparation.  

 

32. Strengthening Producer Cooperatives (PCs), would be the necessary complement to the VS and ES, to 
improve the capacity of the smallholders in formulating their needs and evaluate the services they receive. 

Ultimately, the growth and transformation of the livestock and fisheries sector would require a strong and well-

balanced institutional tripartite: the Public, Private, and Cooperative sectors working together to deliver the 

fundamental functions of the sector. Support to the VS, ES and PCs would have a national coverage, although 

specific activities would be targeted towards the selected commodity value chains, in conjunction with 

subcomponent B2.

33. Sub-component A3. Strategic national programs (SNP). Five major national programs were 
considered during identification. They would be further developed during project preparation.  

a. Animal identification, traceability and performance recording (SNP1) 
b. Animal health program

14
 (SNP2) 

c. National forage development (SNP3) 
d. Dairy-meat and poultry breeding program (SNP4) 
e. Sustainable fisheries management and biodiversity conservation (SNP5)  

 

The World Bank Group is supporting b) Animal health and d) Dairy/poultry breeding policy in the L-MIRE 

project. The proposed project will build on this work.   

 

34. Sub-component A4. Contingency emergency response (US$0 million). Following an adverse natural 
event that results in a major natural disaster, the government of Ethiopia may request the Bank to reallocate 

project funds to support response and reconstruction. This component would draw resources from the 

unallocated expenditure category and /or allow the government to request the Bank to re-categorize and 

reallocate financing from other Project components to partially cover emergency response and costs. This 

component could also channel additional funds should they become available as a result of an eligible 

emergency. Detailed operational guidelines acceptable to the bank for their implementation of the Contingency 

Emergency Response Plan, would be prepared during the first year of project implementation. Should this 

component be triggered, all expenditures would be made in accordance with paragraph 11 of OP 10.00 and 

would be reviewed and accepted by the Bank before any disbursement is made. In accordance with paragraphs 

11 and 12 of OP 10.00, this component would provide immediate, rapidly disbursing support to finance goods 

(positive list agreed with governments), works, and services needed for response, mitigation, and recovery and 

reconstruction.  

 

Component B: Farmer’s Access to Services, Inputs and Assets. The project would support smallholders’ 

access to critical knowledge and information, services and inputs, and investments (technologies and 

equipment) focusing on the three targeted commodity value chains of (1) dairy (dairy-meat in mixed crop-

livestock systems), (2) poultry (broilers and layers) and (3) fisheries (cultured-based fisheries and aquaculture). 

The project would link and work with Federal and Regional Agriculture Research Institutes to facilitate access 

to new technologies, innovations and management practices. 

 

This component would have the following three sub-components: 

 

35. Sub-component B1. Access to knowledge and information. This component would support capacity-
building activities of smallholders and their organizations on good management practices tailored to each 

selected commodity value chain, as well as on organizational skills towards the establishment of future and 

strengthening of existing producer organizations. It would design and pilot an information system accessible by 

smallholders and their organizations for the selected commodity value chain, in conjunction with SNP1.  

 

36. Sub-component B2. Access to services and inputs. This component aims to improve smallholders’ 

                                            
14

 During identification, the following five building blocks were discussed: (i) Creating a conducive and coherent policy environment; (ii) Strengthening diseases 

surveillance capacity; (iii) Strengthening diagnostic capacities and laboratories; (iv) Supporting diseases prevention and control programs; and (v) Including one health 

and food safety considerations.

access to advisory services, animal health services, Animal Genetic Resources (AnGR) and quality forage and 

feed. While it complements sub-component A2, it focuses on each selected commodity value chain and would 

support the establishment of a public-private collaboration to develop a comprehensive (inclusive of all 

services) and differentiated (tailored to the level of advancement of the smallholder or his/her organization) 

system of service, input and advice delivery.     

     

37. Sub-component B3. Access to productive investments. This component aims to improve the 
smallholders’ access to investments linking smallholders and/or their organizations to public and private 

providers of basic equipment and new technologies, and to financial institutions. Production-oriented 

investments could include: feed production and processing, improved animal husbandry techniques, small-scale 

products’ collection or processing units/equipment, waste management systems to minimize greenhouse gas 

emissions, pollution and dissemination of pathogens, renewable energy (bio and solar energy) supply. To 

minimize a farmer’s risk of accessing improved technologies, the component would establish a matching grant 

mechanism to co-finance strategic investments, i.e. investment linked with the adoption of new technologies 

and practices associated with the SNP or investments aimed at increasing the participation of women and youth 

in the selected value chains.   

 

Component C: Farmers’ Access to Output Markets.  The project would support smallholders and their 

organizations to improve their access to output markets with a broader engagement of local entrepreneurs in the 

three priority commodity value chains. Depending on the beneficiary level of advancement in the 

transformation pathway, several options for project support would be explored further during preparation. 

Lessons from recent experiences in similar conditions would be considered. These include the existing USAID-

parallel financed AMDe and Livestock Market Development projects, which support improved market linkages, 

and regional initiatives such as the Hub Approach in Milk Collection Centers. The component would establish 

“Productive Partnerships” (PPs) between livestock and fisheries Producer Cooperatives (PC) and buyers (Agri-

Businesses: agro-industries, small and medium enterprises, etc.). These PPs would be supported through the 

provision of matching grants, contingent upon contractual arrangement between producers and buyers, and 

would facilitate access to rural financing for investing in various PC Sub-Projects (SPs). The selection criteria 

and mechanisms for PPs and SPs would be detailed during project preparation. The overall aim of this 

component is to create an enabling environment for direct and sustainable commercial relations between 

producers and buyers of products in the targeted value chains, and with Financial Institutions (FIs). 

 

This component would have the following three sub-components: 

 

38. Sub-component C1. Support to Producer Cooperatives (PCs). The sub-component would support the 
establishment of sustainable business relations between targeted PCs and Financial Institutions (FIs). To 

facilitate the involvement of FIs and the provision of adapted financial services, the subcomponent would 

support capacity building of PCs in the area of preparation of viable Sub-Projects (SPs). Capacity-building 

activities related to PCs’ business and administrative skills could be conducted in partnership with IFC through 

its Business Edge 
TM

 training system. Additional 

activities in support to PCs could include: (i) supporting market studies and surveys to characterize market 

opportunities and product requirements, organizing communication and dissemination campaigns to inform 

stakeholders about the project, and creating an online-based market information system; (ii) the establishment 

of a dialog platform between the government and key stakeholders, and (iii) mobilizing financial institutions 

(FIs) by negotiating a co-financing agreement for the SPs, and providing technical assistance on the design of

tailored financial services and products to meet the financing needs of eligible SPs.  

 

39. Sub-component C2. Establishment of Productive Partnerships (PPs). This sub-component would 
promote partnerships between PCs and buyers of selected commodities (milk, poultry meat and eggs, fish). 

Financial Institutions (FIs) would be included in the PPs as they are expected to co-finance the sub-projects to 

be developed by the PCs. The partnerships would be based on the following principles: (a) agreement on 

product quality and characteristics; (b) quantity to be produced and bought; (c) modalities of delivery; (d) 

payment modalities and price; and (e) buyer’s contribution, such as Technical Assistance (TA), specific inputs, 

and arrangements for input reimbursement. 

 

40. Sub-component C3. Access to Financial Institutions (FIs). This sub-component would finance SPs, 
which have been developed by PCs under the Productive Partnerships established under sub-component C2. 

Based on a PC’s business plan, investment would cover collective investments through a Matching Grant aimed 

at improving the market reliability (commercial and safety standards) of the selected commodities. Collective 

investments would include post-productive investments (including processing technologies and facilities), as 

well as the associated technical assistance and training. A conditionality mechanism would be built into the 

Matching Grant to ensure that the Sub-Projects promote health and environmental services or at least do not 

generate negative externalities, and would be screened for potential adverse effects on the environment and 

public health. Selected SPs could be financed through a combination of an IDA-financing, a contribution from 

PCs, and short to medium-term credit provided by participating FIs. 

 

Component D: Project Management, Coordination, and Monitoring and Evaluation. The component 

would support project management at federal, regional, zonal and woreda level. In addition to routine 

functions, emphasis would be placed on a number of critical cross-cutting issues: 

 

41. Gender. The project would support the Government’s policy to mainstream the participation of women 
(both female headed households and women in male headed households) and youth into the livestock and 

fisheries sectors. This would include both targeted interventions (including support to women groups for 

appropriate enterprises) and ensuring inclusion in all project activities, backed up with an M&E system with 

disaggregated data.  

 

42. Nutrition. Although improved nutrition is not an explicit or measurable outcome of the proposed 
project, there would be many activities that would support aspects of the National Nutrition Program. For 

example, the support to the three selected commodity value chains would be coupled with extension/advisory 

services to increase households understanding of the high nutritional value and best uses of animal sourced 

foods (milk, meat, eggs and fish).  

 

43. Greenhouse gas emissions / Climate smart livestock (CSL). Livestock production critically 
contributes to the 3 outcomes of CSL: (i) it contributes directly and indirectly to food production and food 

security, (ii) it offers adaptation strategies, through assets diversification, coping mechanisms and water 

management, and (iii) it offers great potential for GHG emission intensity reduction and carbon sequestration. 

In terms of livestock production systems, Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) translates into four essential 

objectives: resource use efficiency, reduced conversion of natural habitats into agriculture, buffering and

connection to markets. Most technical and institutional interventions would have effects on more than one of 

the CSA outcomes. 

44. Capacity building. The design of the proposed project would include capacity building for a range of 
actors and organizations and through a number of approaches, including training. In a recent project (e.g. AGP 

1), the effectiveness of training was found to be relatively weak. A more focused and structured approach to 

capacity building would be developed for the project, drawing upon both good experience in Ethiopia (such as 

under the Productive Safety Nets Program or the Farmer’s Filed School in the Integrated Pest Management and 

forage development Programs) and international experience. This would emphasize strengthening core skills for 

delivering training and stronger processes for training needs assessment, continual training where appropriate 

and adequate follow up.  

 

45. Linkages and Coordination. The project would be one of the primary government program to support 
investments to achieve the strategic goals set out by the LMP. However, it would not function in isolation and 

coordination and complementarity with other initiatives would provide opportunities for increased impact. This 

is particularly important because Ethiopia is hosting a number of active projects in the sector –implemented by 

various ministries- that the new MoLF would have to monitor. Coordination mechanisms would need to be 

strengthened with a number of other on-going and planned programs, including the following IDA-financed 

projects and programs: Agriculture Growth Project 2, Productive Safety Net Program, Sustainable Land 

Management Program, and Regional Pastoral Livelihoods Resilience Project (RPLRP) and the WBG’s Ethiopia 

Livestock-MIRA project. 
 

 
 
    

  SAFEGUARDS 

 
A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 

 
Tentatively, the project might be implemented in the following regions/places in Ethiopia: Amhara, Addis Ababa, 

Oromiya, SNNR, Tigray, Harari, Benishangul Gumuz, Dire Dawa and Gambella 
 
B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 

 
The MoLF is a new ministry with a significant capacity weakness. Therefore, efforts would be required throughout the 

project, in particular in the areas of safeguards due diligence. Given the institutional and management innovations that is 
expected from the project, three distinct value chains are targeted, including the newly supported fisheries sector, and 
the multiplicity of actors involved from the public, private and associative sectors, capacity constraints are likely to 
represent the biggest challenge of the project. To address these gaps, it has been proposed to formulate a capacity 
building strategy for the MoLF during the preparation phase. The Bank would undertake a safeguards capacity 
assessment as part of the project preparation, which would outline the detailed risks and mitigating measures. The 
project would further explore to provide systematic and regular training to targeted the Regions and Woredas as well as 
undertake regular supervision to ensure that challenges with regards to environmental and social safeguards are 
identified and addressed in a timely manner. Overall, the project will avoid where possible adverse impacts on people, 
land and other economic resources and on livelihoods; will prepare both a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) and

Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) to address potential scope of impacts, since the project sites 
are not known. The ESMF and RPF will be reviewed and cleared by the World Bank before it is disclosed publicly in 
Ethiopia and the Bank’s Info shop prior to project appraisal. Site specific Resettlement Action Plan and ESMPs, will be 
prepared, reviewed and cleared by the World Bank, as needed based on the guidance and standards set forth in the RPF, 
prior to implementation of any compensation actions or civil works.

D. Policies that might apply 

 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

The project is proposed as a Category B project, given 
that it would finance activities, especially those related 
to veterinary services to detect and respond quickly to 
major disease outbreaks, improved animal health 
services, production of quality forage and feed, 
including feed production and processing, small scale- 
products’ collection/ processing units, waste 
management systems to minimize greenhouse gas 
emissions, pollution and dissemination of pathogens. 
Since the scope and nature of the sub-projects and 
their site-specific locations are not known at this time 
of preparation, the specific instrument proposed for 
analyzing potential environmental risks is an ESMF. 

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 TBD 
 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 TBD 
 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

Project funds may be used to purchase and distribute 
pesticides for control of vectors of livestock /animal 
diseases and agrochemicals for improved production 
of forage and feed, and it is likely that more generally 
support through the Project will encourage small 
holder farmers, and veterinary service providers to use 
more pesticides and chemicals. The ESMF will contain 
a section on PMP/IPMP that would elaborate on what 
actions need to be undertaken to minimize 
environmental, health and safety impacts. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 No 
 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 Yes 

The Project triggers OP 4.10 as the vast majority of 
people in the lowland area of the project area meet 
the criteria for the Indigenous People or underserved 
groups.  The project will conduct Social Assessment 
and enhanced public Consultation with the affected

Since the project sites are not known, therefore, to 
address potential scope of impacts on loss of 
economic activities, land acquisition and/or relocation, 
the project will avoid adverse impacts on people, land 
and other economic resources and on livelihoods by 
preparing a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF). The 
RPF will be consulted upon and reviewed and cleared 
by the World Bank before it is disclosed publicly in 
Ethiopia and the Bank’s Info shop prior to project 
appraisal. In cases where impacts are known, the 
project will Resettlement Action Plan, based on the 
guidance and standards set forth in the RPF, and the

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 
 

Following its independence, Côte d’Ivoire occupied a unique place in Africa. For two decades, the country experienced political stability, high 

growth and sustained poverty reduction.  Ample natural resources and favorable terms of trade for its main agricultural exports helped the 

country achieve a strong economic performance which, by the end of the 1970s made Côte d’Ivoire the major player of the West African 

Monetary and Economic Union. By 1980 the country was the world's leading exporter of cocoa and Africa's leading exporter of pineapples, 

palm oil, rubber and bananas. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew steadily during that period at average 6 percent per year. The surpluses 

generated by agriculture alone have enabled the country to have a relatively large industry, whose contribution to GDP reached 23 percent in 

1982. It is also principally due to agriculture that Ivoirians enjoyed the highest annual per capita income in the West African sub-region, 

including Nigeria. A sharp reversal began in 1980 as terms of trade deteriorated precipitously and the CFAF became increasingly overvalued. 

From 1981 to 1992, annual GDP growth averaged -0.2 percent and Côte d’Ivoire slipped from the rank of middle income countries into the low

income group. The devaluation of the CFAF in 1994 triggered an economic rebound, but this was soon undermined by the political crisis which 

began in 1999
1
. During this period which lasted until 2011, the increase in the depth and severity of poverty was dramatic all over the country. 

Côte d’Ivoire’s economic performance over the past four years has been impressive. Renewed political stability, concurrently with structural 

reforms

 to improve the business climate

3
 and supportive fiscal policy enabled a strong pickup in economic activity. Over the last 4 years, 

economic activity expanded by 9 percent a year on average translating, into an increase in real per capita income of more than 20 percent. In 

2015, real GDP grew by 8.6 percent driven by strong investment and private consumption. Inflation remained subdued, reflecting ample 

domestic food production and imported consumer products. In response to the rebound of economic growth, the poverty incidence in the 
country slightly diminished from an estimated 51 percent in 2011 to 46 percent in 2015

4
, but other human development indicators have been 

slow to improve. Efforts were made during the period 2012–15 to make growth more inclusive by increasing the farm price for coffee and 

cocoa and other agriculture products and improving basic infrastructure in rural areas. Nevertheless, the country is still facing several 

challenges, including significant disparities across the country in terms of education attainment, heath services, employment, and income.  

Challenges ahead – poverty and inequality. Poverty continues to be overwhelmingly rural with disparities in access to basic services, and 

gender disparities across wealth and urban-rural groups. People living below the poverty line tend to be unemployed and are from large 

households, the agricultural sector, and weak educational background. Poverty is also found to be more common among the young: 51.4 

percent of Ivoirians younger than 25 years are classified as poor, while poverty rates in other age groups vary from 35 to 39 percent. The 

recently concluded Bank Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) shows that poverty is significantly concentrated in rural areas and in the 

Northern parts of the country (where the potential for agriculture has not yet been realized), while greater Abidjan is becoming ever more 

dominant in the country’s economy. Poverty rates are 69 percent in North versus 25 percent in the South (within the southern regions, poverty 

rates tend to increase from East to West). While spatial inequality worsened during most of the crisis period, the rural-urban divide continued 

to grow even during the recent recovery. Such unbalanced - mostly Abidjan centric - development is unsustainable; both economically, because 

it relies on too few sectoral and regional drivers and socially, because it does not tackle the roots of fragility in the cou ntry. The 2015 Human 

Development Report ranked Côte d’Ivoire at 172 out of 188 countries (far below neighboring Ghana in 140
th

 place), with an overall Human 

Development Index below the average for sub-Saharan Africa. 

Côte d’Ivoire ambitious development agenda - making the country an emerging market economy. Following last October’s peaceful 

presidential elections, political uncertainties have diminished, paving the way for continued economic progress. The medium-term outlook is 

favorable. Economic activity is projected to remain strong at 8.5 percent in 2016, and 7.4 percent per year on average in 2017–20. The 

Government has recently adopted a new 2016–20 National Development Plan (NDP)
5
 aimed at achieving strong and inclusive growth - halving 

poverty and fostering structural transformation. To support the structural transformation foreseen under the NDP, the Government intends to 

pursue further reforms to improve the business climate and strengthen the private sector contribution in the economy, including in the form of 

a public-private partnership. This will involve creating new opportunities for diversification based on the country’s comparative advantages and 

fostering sustainable integration into regional and global value chains. A greater impetus will be given to stimulating industrial production - 

moving to higher domestic value-added products through the local transformation of a larger share of agricultural products (especially cocoa 

and cashew). The Government has set a target of at least fifty percent of cacao beans domestically processed and eventually more for cashew 

nuts by 2020. In attaining this targeted, the Government is also seeking to increase the participation of nationally domiciled entities in cacao 

and cashew processing, and is assessing options regarding policies that could encourage growth of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) 

in both sectors. Successful NDP implementation will depend on the pace at which the main structural barriers are removed and productivity-

enhancing reforms are carried out, as well as on financing conditions and how domestic and external risks are addressed.  The authorities have 

expressed an interest in a new Fund arrangement to support the NDP objectives, including the IBRD-Enclave financing mechanism.

 Between 1985 and 2008, the estimated share of the population living below the poverty line increased from around 10 percent to about 49 percent.

 The Government has undertaken a number of important economic reforms and reached the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries completion point in June 2012.

 According to the World Bank “Doing Business Index”, Cote d’Ivoire has gained some 25 places in the world ranking, from 2011 to 2016 and ranked among the 10 best 

reformers in 2014 and 2015. Côte d’Ivoire was also ranked among the fastest improving countries on Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index, rising 
from 154

 The NDP is based on four strategic pillars: (i) enhancing the quality of institutions and governance; (ii) stepping-up the development of human capital and promoting 

social well-being; (iii) speeding up structural transformation and industrialization; and (iv) strengthening the infrastructure base while preserving the environment.

Sectoral and Institutional Context 
 

Cote d’Ivoire’s economy and growth have been driven by commodity-based exports and this will remain the key in the medium-term. The 

most important export crops – cocoa, rubber, palm oil, cotton and cashew – are also the main sources for smallholders’ income as well as the 

center-piece of the country’s major farming systems. Cocoa, rubber and oil palm are at the center of the forest zone’s diversified production 

mix with smallholders generally maintaining a wide variety of cash and food crops (rice, cassava, plantain). Cotton and cashew are the main 

cash crops and drivers of the savanna economy and farming systems (which include maize, rice and livestock), where cotton in particular has 

important spill-over effects on food crop productivity through the use of improved technology.  

The agricultural sector currently accounts for 22 percent of GDP, over three-quarters of non-oil exports, and provides employment and 

income to two-thirds of all households. Côte d’Ivoire is the world’s largest producer of cacao and has become the largest producer and 

exporter of raw cashew nuts (RCN). The country remains also the largest exporter of rubber, oil palm, bananas, pineapples and copra in Africa 

and is self-sufficient in a variety of staple foods – maize, sorghum, millet, yam, cassava, plantain banana – with some small exports to the sub-

region. The impact of production of export commodities extend to several other sectors through forward and backward linkages - inputs, 

processing, transport, financial services, taxes, energy and final consumption and therefore play a key role in the country for the creation of job 

opportunities and poverty reduction. In fact, the domestic trade and transport industry (trucking and port) depends to a large extend on 

agriculture for its business. Similarly, agro-processing industries such as cotton ginneries, rubber, palm oil and sugar factories provide the base 

for rural industry, while an important component of urban industry is made up of cocoa processing plants, textile cottonseed oil operations, 

packaging materials, second stage transformation of oil palm into soaps, cosmetics, etc.  

While significant results have been achieved in improving the agriculture sector’s performance in recent years, it is facing several constraints 

that negatively impact its sustainable development. These include a range of technical and circumstantial issues, such as limited access to 

inputs; weak extension services; considerable post-harvest handling, transportation and storage losses; inadequate exposure to modern 

farming techniques, and aging and poor maintenance of existing plantations. These limitations are compounded by structural economic factors, 

such as access to finance (in particular for SMEs), deteriorating physical infrastructure, and limited public goods, all of which have contributed 

to the long-term stagnation of productivity and low value addition. Tackling these constraints can unleash the agricultural sector potential and 

increase its participation into global value chains involving many agro-food items and agro-industries in high demand regionally and/or 

worldwide - attracting major investments which can stimulate economic growth along with creating value, scaling-up innovation, and achieving 

the country’s overarching objective to ensure the population’s wellbeing by reducing poverty and inequality, through structural transformation 

of the economy. 

THE CASHEW SECTOR: COTE D’IVOIRE – AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT ORIGIN FOR RCN AND PROCESSING. In 2015, Côte d’Ivoire became 

the world’s largest producer of RCN, with a production of 702,000 tons, or 21 percent of the world’s total production. The value of 2015 

cashew exports is estimated at over US$ 650 million, which makes cashew the third most important export commodity after cacao and refined 

petroleum products, but ahead of rubber, cotton and coffee
6
. The importance of cashew production is even more critical when viewed in a 

regional and poverty reduction context. It is grown by about 250,000 households (about 1.5 million persons) in the poorer, northern half of the 

country, where cashew has become the most important source of rural cash income. It is clearly an exciting source of growth with the added 

advantage of having the potential to generate better and inclusive rural employment through farming and rural industrialization. Provided that 

a comprehensive strategy addressing the Ivoirian cashew value chain competitiveness constraints is put in place, overall growth in the value of 

cashew exports by 15 percent p.a. over the next decade seems feasible
7
.  

However, the cashew value chain in Cote d’Ivoire faces several constraints hindering its development. Figure 1 below summarizes these 

constraints and their level of intensity. They concern: (i) the governance of the value-chain; (ii) the quality of the nuts that are heterogeneous in 

size and often of bad quality due to inadequate harvesting and post-harvesting methods; (iii) the high investment cost, including equipment 

and spare parts; (iv) the lack of technical and managerial skills and the low productivity of the labor force; (v) the difficulty in accessing credit, 

for both investments and working capital, and the high cost of this credit when available; (vi) the international buyers’ perceived risk of 

sourcing kernel supply from African processors; (vii) the investor’s perception of a relatively unfriendly sector policies and business 

environment; and (viii) the poorly developed rural infrastructure.

 Gross farmer receipts in 2015 are estimated at US$ 400 million (CFAF 250 billion), now way ahead of those of cotton (US$ 180 million), the traditional cash crop of 

the north. A comparison in terms of net farmer receipts would be even more favorable, since cotton involves much higher input costs (about 1/3 of gross receipts).

Fig. 1 Cashew value chain competitiveness main constraints in Cote d’Ivoire 

 

                             (Source: Adapted from Technoserve, 2010) 

 

The past expansion of Cote d’Ivoire cashew production has been extraordinary. Production has been growing by over 20 percent per annum 

over the last two decades (from 6000 tons in 1990 to 63,000 tons in 2000 to over 702,000 tons in 2015). However, this rapid increase in RCN 

production has been largely driven by an expansion in the planted area rather than by productivity gains. Although plantations are in general 

relatively young (66 percent less than 25 years old), they have been established with low-productivity planting material (unimproved tree 

varieties from home saved seeds) and farmers tend to apply virtually no inputs apart from family labor. Treatment for disease and insects is 

rare, harvesting practices leave much to be desired, and drying and storage are poorly done. As a result, productivity is low (300kg/ha) 

compared with other producers in South and South-East Asia (India 850kg/ha and Vietnam 1,000kg/ha) and Ivoirian cashew nuts suffer an 

average price discount of about 15 percent compared to the average price for African cashew exports to India. While this low intensity 

approach is well suited to low income, risk adverse decision making processes, there is clearly room for significant improvement in productivity 

as knowledge is shared and internal market linkages strengthen. In addition, low productivity at the production base increases aggregation 

costs over poor road networks. Low levels of pruning and tree maintenance increase harvesting time and negatively impact nut size and 

quality.  

Despite being a major producer of RCN, Cote d’Ivoire only processes around 5 to 7 percent of its production. The vast majority of RCN 

exported goes to India and Vietnam with 85 percent exported by foreign owned companies based in India, Singapore and Vietnam. The balance 

is traded by 10 domestic cooperatives/enterprises who in turn have pre-finance links with foreign companies
8
. While some competition 

between buyers may exist, there are also suspicions of anti-competitive practices, and this dependence on two countries could be a problem. 

The existing installed processing capacity of RCN in Cote d’Ivoire is estimated at 75,000Mt (with an actual use of only 50 percent). Moreover, 

nearly all processed cashew in 2015 came from two factories with a combined capacity of 42,000Mt. These numbers highlight not only the 

huge imbalance between RCN exports and processed quantities but, the socio-economic losses to the Ivorian economy. If only 50 percent of 

the harvest was processed locally, over 100,000 jobs could be created (of which at least 60 percent women), delivering more than $100 million 

                                            
8
 The dominance of foreign based companies is explained by the historical significance of India as a processor of RCN from origins worldwide. Foreign processors and 

trading companies are often multi-commodity and spread trading/market risk and overheads over a number of value chains. Larger companies have international 
credit lines that underwrite borrowing from local banks for working capital needs through the buying season. Companies trading into India have established links to 
large domestic consumer markets as well as developed trading relationships with roasters and retailers in the US and Europe.

in wage per years to the local economy and primarily in the impoverished north
9
. Other gains will be obtained for the country in the form of 

foreign exchange value of exports
10

 and the cashew shells could be processed into biofuel and used for electricity generation in rural areas.  

It is time to move from raw cashew exports to domestic processing. Clearly there are solid socio-economic reasons for expanding the 
processing sector in Cote d’Ivoire on a number of fronts, including a vibrant market and a strategic cashew supply chain context: (i) The high 

dependence on Vietnam (70 percent) is seen as a risk factor for international buyers of cashew kernels
11

. An alternative is needed accentuated 

by the loss of supply from India (exports falling as domestic consumption grows) and Brazil (falling production); (ii) the growing weight of Cote 

d’Ivoire in the overall supply of the market and its proximity from both the European and US markets, are focusing the attention of processors 

and end-users on Ivoirian producers; (iii) the possibility to create shorter, more traceable value chains, is a very powerful incentive for 

consumers to source their kernels directly in Cote d’Ivoire. Currently, kernels processed in India and Vietnam come from a variety of sources 

and reach the European and US markets indirectly, after a long and largely untraceable chain. Local processing means a significant cut in 

transport costs by eliminating the shipping of raw cashews to Asia for processing and shipping the kernels back to the European and US market. 

The more direct route, and the sourcing from a unique producer also permit to better meet the European market’s increasing emphasis on 

traceability from farm to fork. Downstream in the supply chain, food manufacturers and retailers are generally shortening their chains as well 

(in terms of supply networks and relations), thus operating increasingly with a limited number of preferred suppliers (importers and producers) 

to which they transfer the responsibility for traceability and product safety and quality
12

. In addition, shorter transportation lines diminish the 

carbon footprint of the cashew value chain, which is an interesting environmentally-friendly proposition and a definite competitive advantage 

of Ivoirian processors; and (iv) there is yet an untapped potential opportunity in organic cashew certified production. The current lack of use of 

chemical inputs would facilitate a fast transition to organic production and make Cote d’Ivoire unique in the World with premium product at 

lower cost.  Finally, in term of RCN production, future impact of climate change on crops such as cacao is expected to lead to a reduction of the 

areas suitable for cocoa which will then become suitable for cashews as it is drought and wind resistant. 

However, even with an abundance of raw material, levels of investment in processing have been very low and existing capacity 

underutilized. The debate about the competitiveness of the processing cashew in Cote d’Ivoire has evolved over the past 10 years. The broad 

conclusion drawn by sector experts is that processing locally could be competitive provided a number of key criteria are met. These include: 

selection and use of efficient semi-mechanized processing equipment, management by experienced and specialized staff and a well-trained, 

disciplined workforce. Studies also highlight potential competitive risks to a domestic processing sector in the form of high labor costs, lower 

productivity, access to and cost of capital, food safety and traceability standards, constantly evolving improvements in technology at processing 

centers of India and Vietnam driving competitive advantage and un-hedged risks in differentials between RCN and processed kernel prices
13

. 

Promoting domestic processing will therefore require implementing a comprehensive value-chain development approach with some 

incentives, carefully managed to avoid penalizing the farmers or protecting inefficient enterprises. If an export tax is used, its proceeds should 

be channeled into a program not only to promote domestic processing, but also to raise crop yields which are far below those of competing 

Asian countries. Public research and extension should be strengthened as well as the regulatory framework which is needed to improve 

coordination without hampering the dynamism of the private sector.  

THE CASHEW WORLD MARKET CONTEXT. The international global trade in both raw and processed cashew nuts has evolved greatly over the 

last 15 years.  Trade in processed nuts (kernels) has grown from around 234,000Mt in 2000 to over 680,000Mt in 2015. This represents an 

annual growth rate of 9.3 percent over the period. The main consumption markets are India, the USA and Europe that account for 75 percent 

of total consumption.  Demand is driven by a combination income-economic growth and dietary trends related to health and lifestyle. Global 

kernel demand is predicted to increase over the following decade, albeit at lower rates than the recent past. The US and European markets 

where cashew is essentially a snack food are price sensitive and are substituted with nuts such as almonds. Indian consumption is largely as a 

cooked food ingredient where broken nuts are widely used and increasingly as a festival related gifts. Demand in East Asia is predicted to 

remain strong as a growing middle class consumes higher value food products. Raw cashew nuts are produced in four main geographical 

regions: South East Asia, West Africa, East Africa and Brazil. World production reached an estimated 3.5 million Mt in 2015 with around 45 

percent originating in Asia, 45 percent in West Africa and the balance from East Africa and Brazil. Global RCN production is estimated to grow 

                                            
9
 Calculation based on 350,000 MT of RCN. It is estimated that RCN processing creates around one full time job per 3-4Mt of nuts processed.   

10
 The raw cashew nut accounts for 34 percent of the final product value, while shelling adds another 8 percent and roasting and salting an additional 16 percent. 

11
 Today Vietnam depends on imports for 70 percent of its needs of RCN. There is a highly risky chain where the US for example buys 70 percent of its needs from 

Vietnam which in turn buys 70 percent of its needs in West Africa. The US buyer depends on the West African farmer but has no influence in that market.   
12

 Although they don’t require full traceability, EU buyers expect suppliers to know and document their own buyers and suppliers (one step forward and one step back 
in the chain), which products are used during production process, and to label final products for traceability in case of a food safety problem. 
13

 Increasing quality and traceability demands are not being met by Vietnamese processors. There are multiple quality problems and food safety issues (especially 
foreign matter) and much confidence has been lost among buyers. In addition, labor conditions in Vietnamese factories constitute a risk for buyers.

to around 4.5 million Mt by the year 2020.  RCN production has been growing at an annual rate of around 5.7 percent per annum, noticeably 

slower than that for processed kernels.   

Future predictions of supply and demand suggest continued growth in both parameters.  However, two key factors are likely to impact 

significantly on Ivorian (and West African) growers and processors. Firstly, it is expected that demand for processed kernels will out-strip supply 

of RCN globally. This will continue to drive RCN prices higher with increased volatility as the gap widens. Secondly, production of RCN is either 

flat or declining in other origins with the result that Africa, and in particular Cote d’Ivoire, will become increasingly a dominant player in RCN 

production. West Africa RCN production is rising in response to higher prices internationally although will inevitably lag behind due to the four-

year establishment period of the crop.  

The international price for cashew kernels (quotes in USD/Lb) is a “spot price” derived through open market negotiations between buyers 

and sellers. There is no formally quoted futures market contract and there no derivative or proxy hedges available. International prices have 

been stable over extended periods but with two significant upward spikes in 2008 and 2011. The first spike was brought to an end due to the 

turmoil in financial markets worldwide and the second resulted from concern about RCN availability due to poor crops in east and west Africa. 

In 2011 prices peaked at over $4.00/Lb ($8,800 per Mt) only to fall back to the current range of $3.50-3.90/Lb or $7,700-8580 Mt for 

benchmark grade WW320. The international kernel price in processing countries is translated back to a farm gate RCN price at origin though a 

series of complex interactions. The current supply/demand situation appears to be driving up RCN prices to levels where highly efficient 

processors in India and Vietnam can make adequate profit margins. Processors at origin in West Africa operating at lower processing efficiency 

and poorly developed relationships with consuming markets, claim to be in negative gross margin territory when RCN prices reach 500 CFAF 

per kg (or $841 Mt).   

CASHEW SECTOR INSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT. The Government of Cote d’Ivoire has recognized the potential for job creation and value addition 

through expansion of domestic cashew processing. It has included the development of the cashew sector, and cashew processing in particular, 

as a national priority in its NDP 2016-20 and its National Agricultural Investment Plan (NAIP). In 2013, the authorities has adopted a reform of 

the sector and the main lines of a strategy for the promotion of domestic cashew processing (prepared jointly by the Ministry of Industry and 

Mines, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Environment).  

The 2013 reform focuses on improving on-farm productivity, marketing of RCN and strengthening the management of the value chain. It 

includes the following main pillars: (i) The establishment of a public Agency “Council for Cotton and Cashew - CCA”
14

  in charge of coordinating 

and promoting the development of the cashew (and cotton) sector, by providing the necessary regulations of all activities in the sector, 

organizing the provision of  critical services, supporting the strengthening of producer associations and the creation of a strong 

Interprofessional body for the management of the value chain; (ii) Programs for strengthening research, the production and distribution of 

improved planting material, the improvement of advisory services for providing technical support to farmers on good agricultural practices and 

harvest/post-harvest methods to improve quality of RCN; (iii) The establishment of efficient quality control and traceability mechanisms; (iv) 

The establishment of a new producer price mechanism guaranteeing a farm-gate price of at least 60 percent of the CIF
15

 price of RCN; (v) The 

rationalization of domestic marketing through the establishment of a network of licensed warehouses; and (vi) The rehabilitation of rural roads 

in the main producing areas. Most of these activities are already under implementation, financed by the levies imposed on the value chain (and 

with the support of the IDA-financed PSAC
16

 and IFC). However, the implementation of these activities remain unfunded and should be 

accelerated to be able to respond to the Government’s objective of increasing the percentage of domestically processed RCN by 2020. 

Especially attention must also be paid to building the capacity of the CCA and improving the governance of producers’ organizations. There are 

many cooperatives and other village-level groups, but they are mainly focused on collecting the harvest. They offer few other services, have 

little knowledge of the market, and are generally poorly governed. There are also several federations of producers’ organizations but they do 

not do much better, so that producers’ interests are poorly represented in the inter-profession. A considerable effort will be needed to build a 

legitimate structure to support improved practices and to speak on behalf of farmers, starting with a census of sector. 

The Ministry of Industry and Mines is implementing a parallel set of reforms and policies aimed at developing the processing sector.  These 

include clarification of the regulatory framework, public infrastructure development, assistance in processing technology procurement and 

                                            
14

 The CCA was created in 2013 to take over the functions of two previous bodies: The Autorité de Regulation du Coton et de l’Anacarde, created in 2002 as the sector 
regulatory body, and Intercajou, the value chain Interprofessional body responsible for the management and coordination of value chain private actors.  The CCA has 
the mission of developing the productivity of the entire value chain from production to the processing sector. It plays a regulatory role in the sector, in addition to its 
development and price stabilization mandates. 
15

 CIF: Cost Insurance and Freight - Seller must pay the costs and freight includes insurance to bring the goods to the port of destination. However, risk is transferred to 
the buyer once the goods are loaded on the ship.

facilitating access to finance. Specific measure taken include reduction of duty on imported capital equipment and spare parts, exemption from 

“Benefice Industrial et Commercial – BCI” and land acquisition taxes, reduced costs of environmental and social impact assessment studies, 

plans for the creation of agro-industrial parks in Yamoussoukro, Bouake and other regional centers, developing a cooperative research Centre 

with FHB Technical Institute and Ho Chi Minh University for the transfer of technologies, technical staff training and technical assistance to 

private sector investors. Furthermore, CCA and the Ministry of Industry and Mines are working with commercial banks and IFC to establish a 

“Risk-Sharing” guarantee fund to provide working capital to processors primarily for RCN purchase and inventory funding. IFC and WB are also 

working with Government Agencies to finalize laws regulating the issue of warehouse receipts that will lower the cost of holding processing 

inventory.   

The need for additional incentives and reforms. The measures already taken to improve the incentives in favor of cashew processing, although 
a necessary and significant first step, may not be sufficient to mobilize the volume of private investments necessary to achieve Government’s 
very ambitious objective. At the present time, Côte d’Ivoire is not competitive with India and Vietnam in the processing of raw cashew nuts. 
Operating large processors in the country, although using the most efficient technology, are facing difficulties to make a profit at the price they 
have to pay in order to be competitive with raw nut exporters. Lack of technical and managerial skills, labor productivity, building and utility 
costs, interest rates, and taxes (official and unofficial) provide part of the explanation. But a bigger problem is the need to constitute a large 
stock of raw material, and finance it at prevailing high interest rates, in order to keep the factory running during the eight months between the 
end of one harvest and the start of the next one. Indian firms can avoid most of this expense by purchasing from different regions of the world 
at different times.  
 
Promoting more processing of raw cashew nuts in Cote d’Ivoire - the way forward. The Government has reviewed what other measures may 
be taken to spur the development of the Ivorian processing industry, on the basis of the lessons learned from other cashew processing 
countries. It is a fact that all other countries with a significant processing capacity have provided some protection in order to promote value 
addition. Brazil has adopted a ban on the export of raw cashew nuts while India, Vietnam, and Mozambique have relied on export taxes on raw 
cashew nuts in the range of 18 to 40 percent, combined with other fiscal incentives. Once such reforms and policies are in place in Cote 
d’Ivoire, a number of significant barriers to entry will be removed. However, some of the main issues causing a lack of competitiveness such as 
labor cost and productivity, technological/processing efficiency and inventory management will take time to overcome. To address these 
issues, CCA is proposing a processing subsidy on exported processed kernels of 80CFA per kg ($135 per Mt) to generate sufficient margins to 
bridge the competitiveness gap and provide a return on invested capital. This processing subsidy is to be funded from a 30 CFA per kg tax on 
RCN exports (about 4 percent of 2016 CFR prices

17
) which will be passed down the value chain to the farm gate. As a result, it will be RCN 

growers who are in effect funding the establishment of the processing sector. There are equity issues associated with this transfer of value 
between a large number of poor rural families to factory owners and their workforce that policy will need to balance. It would thus be 
necessary to use part of these proceeds for the benefit of the producers (who are financing them) to mitigate the negative impact of the levy 
on farm-gate prices and rural incomes. Factories located in the production areas may well employ family members of producing households. 
Higher disposable income from processing workers will also increase other economic activities in the immediate rural economy. But, additional 
investments in the value chain should be considered such as:  (i) boosting agricultural productivity by distributing improved planting material 
and promoting GAPs; and (ii) reducing marketing/transport costs by rehabilitating/constructing rural roads and/or financing other rural 
infrastructure (storage, access to water, etc.)

18
. These investments will increase producer’s productivity (yields and quality) and will lower 

transaction costs in aggregation. This assumes an institutional structure capable of managing significant sums in a transparent matter and 
accountable to the farmers, avoiding the neglects experienced in the coffee-cocoa sector. The industry should be also monitored closely to 
ensure that firms are becoming competitive and that the tax is not serving to protect inefficiency. Ideally, this form of infant-industry 
protection should decline over time to keep the pressure on its beneficiaries to improve their productivity. This principle should be retained, 
especially as the investment climate improves and the profitability of this activity is confirmed.  
 
Ultimately, the development of a processing industry through limited protection and support may be justified as a risk-mitigation measure 
in view of the fact that the alternative is continued dependence on two importing countries. Not to build up local processing capacity could 
mean jeopardizing the entire sector, a sector in which Côte d’Ivoire has proven its comparative advantage in producing the raw material, and 
where it should be competitive in processing under the right conditions and with appropriate incentives in place. Against this background, the 
proposed World Bank loan aims to support the Ivorian Government’s plan to expand RCN processing in Cote d’Ivoire from the current estimate 
of 5-7 percent of production to over 30 percent. Crop production estimates foresee the national crop levelling at around 1.2m Mt of RCN per 
year which implies domestic processing of 400,000 Mt RCN or about 80,000-96,000 Mt of processed kernels depending on the outturn of 
cashew nut kernels

 Cost and freight (CFR) is a trade term requiring the seller to arrange for the carriage of goods by sea to a port of destination, and provide the buyer with the 
documents necessary to obtain the goods from the carrier. 
18

 This practice is already being implemented in the case in the cacao, the rubber and the oil palm sectors.  
19

 The outturn of cashew nut kernels is equal to the amount of usable kernels after shelling the cashew nuts. Generally, outturn ranges between 20 and 24%, but can 
be much higher as well

Succeeding on achieving the Government objective of enhanced value-added transformation will depend not only on increased domestic 

processing, but most importantly on improving the whole cashew value-chain performance and competitiveness. This will entail priority 

setting and funding to increase on-farm yields that remain low, continued strengthening of sector institutions, modernization of marketing, and 

prepare and adapt cashew processing industries and their environment to the requirements of the international markets. Specifically, the 

following key factors will need to be taken into account: (i)  Supply of cashew nuts to processing at competitive costs and adequate quality 

which will depend on overcoming on-farm production challenges and developing basic rural and post-harvest/marketing infrastructure; (ii) For 

domestic processors (and for exporters), clarity of vision on how on-farm productivity will evolve – geographically and with what pace - impacts 

the efficiency of subsequent value chain activities and the profitability of investment decisions. Scale and location of additional processing 

facilities, and building of input supply networks, depend on whether farm production remains low productivity and dispersed, or will begin to 

concentrate geographically and amongst fewer, more professional farmers. Bringing the current spectrum of views closer together therefore 

offers the potential for lower risks and higher interest in additional processing investment, or at the least, lower risks of inefficiently placed 

investment (in space and time); (iii) Local processing industries and enterprises will require to be modernized with the aim to improve their 

competitiveness in terms of price, quality and innovation and also their ability to follow and assimilate the development of technologies and 

markets. This will involve promoting a process of upgrading, modernizing of production tools and industrial subsystems, strengthening 

managerial capacities, developing quality and adopting international standards; (iv) Support measures tailored to SMEs (including taxes and 

other policy adjustments) will have be promoted to enhance their contribution to domestic processing and to boost the creation of jobs for 

young people. Innovation and skill development will contribute significantly to this process by making the most of the demographic dividend; 

and (v) Support in the improvement of other essential infrastructure for industrial activity (access to energy, roads networks, technology 

centers, etc.) is also essential, particularly in disadvantaged regions in northern Cote d’Ivoire. 

 
Relationship to CPF 
 

The proposed Cashew Value Chain Competitiveness Project is aligned with the Country Partnership Framework for the Republic of Cote 

d’Ivoire and supports the achievement of the WBG’s twin goals of reducing extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity. Côte d’Ivoire 

wants to promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work in agriculture, 

manufacturing and selected services. To help the country reach its potential as world‐class agricultural commodity producer, the CPF program 

FY16-FY19 proposes to address low productivity and jobs in the agriculture, agribusiness and manufacturing value chains, among other within 

the cashew value-chain, which offers high potentials for economic growth, jobs creation and poverty reduction.  

In this respect, the proposed project supports the CPF main Focus Area 1 “Accelerating sustainable private sector-led growth in Cote d’Ivoire” 

and its Strategic Objective 1 “Improve productivity in Agriculture/Agribusiness value chains” to achieve inclusive growth and reduce poverty. 

It supports also the Strategic Objective 3 “Improve business regulatory framework and access to finance” to promote investment in 

agriculture/agribusiness, help spur entrepreneurship and growth opportunities, especially for SMEs.  

The proposed project addresses also the World Bank Africa Region priorities of Agri-business and is well aligned with the Agriculture Global 

Practice’s key priorities areas of inclusive value chains, jobs and partnership with the private sector. It is also consistent with the IFC‐WB Joint 

Agribusiness Strategy, which supports agriculture and agri‐business competitiveness in selected value chains, by improving access to markets, 

provision of technology and training of smallholders, and sector governance reforms.

D. Concept Description 

 
Cote d’Ivoire is the largest exporter of RCN in the world but only process 5-7 percent of this volume into higher value edible nuts. The Ivorian 

processing sector has remained small in the face of intense competition for RCN supply from established processors in India and Vietnam. This 

processing competitive disadvantage is compounded by the presence of internationally financed foreign trading companies who are deeply 

integrated into to processing sector in Asia. The proposed interventions under this loan aim at reversing the current situation by achieving 

transformational changes in the whole Ivoirian cashew value chain in a manner that accelerate its development and performance with a focus 

on increased domestic processing and added-value.  

The Government of Cote d’Ivoire recognizes that expansion in processing capacity will be driven by private sector investment facilitated by a 

clearly defined enabling environment. Key steps have already been put in place to achieve this in the form of an export tax on RCN to fund 

investments in the value chain, a processing subsidy on exported processed kernels that addresses immediate factors of low competitiveness, 

laws and regulations to facilitate working capital requirements and numerous fiscal incentives to reduce investment costs – for instance, the 

WRS regulations adopted recently by the council of Ministers (decrees specifying the terms of application of Law No. 2015-538 of 20 July 2015). 

This Concept Note proposes interventions complementing existing sector policies that tends to lower the barriers to investment in new 

processing capacity and enhance the competitiveness of existing processing capacity. It supports additional investments at critical point along 

the value chain that will: (i) increase RCN productivity on-farm, improve quality and lower aggregation costs; (ii) accelerate private investment 

in new processing capacity through the provision carefully designed and located physical infrastructure that increases operational efficiency 

and significantly lowers the initial cost of investment; (iii) improve the policy and regulatory framework for the sustainable development of the 

cashew value chain in Cote d’Ivoire, including build capacity in all functions along the value chain (technical and managerial skills, knowledge 

and innovation); and (iv) facilitating market development and trade. It is taking into consideration the lessons learned from the WBG 

agriculture portfolio experience and analytical work recently completed in Cote d’Ivoire. These include: (i) learning from the PSAC/IFC and

related analytical work; (ii) the findings of the study “Overview of the cashew sector in Cote d’Ivoire:  Current situation and development 

potential” which provided critical insights and inputs for the preparation of the proposed project; and (iii) other key analytical work carried-out 

by development partners and the Government related to the sector diagnostic, reform and development strategy (see Annex 2 of list of 

references).  

COMPONENT 1: IMPROVING THE ORGANIZATION AND GOVERNANCE OF THE CASHEW VALUE CHAIN ($14.5 MILLION). This component aims 

at improving the organization and governance of the value chain to be able to reduce costs of marketing (from producer to port and to 

consumer) and make the value chain ultimately more competitive. This also includes the strengthening of the various organizations that are 

engaged in the governance of the chain. Building on PSAC/IFC on-going program, the main investments under this component will include the 

following:  

(i) The assessment of existing capacity for public/private sector dialogue (PPD) on the cashew sector, contribution to/co-funding of 

relevant discussion fora, and capacity building of value-chain actors in advocacy for improved business environment. A particular focus will be 

on strengthening: (a) the capacities of the CCA in managing the cashew sector. This would involve measures of organizational development, 

capacity building on leading and managing stakeholder processes, lobbying for a better endowment with staff and financial resources, and 

training on quality control and marketing so staff is able to provide better services to producers, processors and traders. Emphasis should be 

less on control and regulation and more on guidance, advisory services and support; (b) the Ivoirian cashew interprofession, including the 

Union of Cashew Processors
20

. This would also engage measures of organizational development, promotion of benefits to members (e.g. 

political lobbying, service provision and sourcing of equipment in bulk), and capacity building in administration; and (c) the cashew 

cooperatives and their unions and enable them to provide more effectively services and benefits to their members. This involves capacity-

building in all aspects of technical and managerial skills - from good governance, the structure and principles of a cooperative, operational 

management, financial and auditing techniques, business development, marketing plans, and creditworthiness (so that participants can more 

easily obtain loans).  

 

(ii) Promoting an improvement of the relationships between producers/cooperatives/groups and processors/buyers through the 

introduction of more elaborated contracting. This would require sensitization of all actors about the benefits of such contracts, the 

development of contract documents fitted to the conditions in the chain, and support in monitoring compliance. 

 

(iii) Exploring options for combined finance of production and processing. This would involve setting up contractual relationships between 

producers and processors, use of the warehouse receipts as collateral, and educating bankers on the nature of the businesses in the value 

chain. 

 

(iv) Promoting the provision of value chain support services such as technical and business advice and R&D with a focus on cashew 

processing and value-added. Measures to improve such services include fostering the setting up of a network of private service providers, their 

training and their accreditation. 

 

(v) Establishing a geo-referenced information system for the sector to allow for better planning and management of the value-chain - 

collection of reliable information on the number of producers, number of trees/age, volume of production, market evolution and other socio-

economic and ecological factors to facilitate decision-making). 

The actors to be engaged in the implementation of this component include the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Industry and Mines, CCA, 

the Union of Cashew Processors, cooperatives, potential private training and advisory service providers, and the Banks. 

COMPONENT 2: PRODUCTIVITY ENHANCEMENT AND IMPROVED MARKET ACCESS TO RCN PRODUCERS (US$48.5 MILLION). This component 

intents to boost cashew farmers’ productivity on an economically and environmentally sustainable basis. Main outcomes here are in the form 

of an increase in volume and quality of marketable produce in the project areas so as to increase incomes and employment and reduce 

poverty. Direct beneficiaries of the component are 250,000 smallholder cashew producers, mainly in the northern impoverished regions of 

Cote d’Ivoire. To this end, the project will support investments focusing on: (i) support to smallholder production; and (ii) improvement of 

feeder roads and post-harvest infrastructure. Specific interventions will include the following: 

Sub-component 2.1: Support to smallholder production (US$28.5 million). This sub-component will aim at increasing the production (including 

quality) and productivity of cashew producers in the project areas. This will primarily be achieved by facilitating access to: (i) improved planting

materials, fertilizers and agro-chemicals; (ii) training in good agricultural practices; and (iii) extension services to advise on harvest and post-

harvest practices. The following major activities will be implemented: (a) providing support to the national research institutes and nurseries for 

preliminary selection of improved cashew varieties and production of new higher yielding varieties for replacement of old plantations and the 

establishment of new acreage. This will include facilitating access to equipment and inputs, and building the capacity of the national 

agronomists in preliminary selection of improved cashew varieties, handling, storage and distribution; (b) capacity building and training of 

extension staff and cashew producers on improved on-farm practices such as establishment techniques, plant nutrition, planting densities, 

ideal inter-cropping combinations, pruning plans, harvesting, post-harvest storage and quality control, pest and disease management, soil 

conservation/mulching/green residues, book keeping/farm accounts; and (c) launching a fertilizer and phytosanitary treatment program. Given 

the considerable area to be covered by the project, an efficient training scheme across a large population of farmers will need to be 

established. While emphasizing the importance of skills development and capacity building for increased agricultural productivity, the project 

will identify and strengthen potential training and advisory service providers. Capacities among trainers will be also strengthened and these will 

be motivated and equipped to reach farmers. The training content will feature good agricultural practices and environmentally safe use of 

pesticides and will be adapted to local needs, and farmers will be encouraged to organize field days and training events.  

The actors to be engaged in this sub-component include the Ministry of Agriculture, CCA, farmers, cooperatives, agricultural development 

officers on the district and village level, potential private training and advisory service providers, research institutions, seed and plant 
multipliers, and input providers.  

Sub-component 2.2: Improvement of feeder roads and post-harvest infrastructure (US$20 million). This sub-component will aim at improving 
the connection of the main cashew production areas to markets and promote forms of improved storage technology and management of 

stocks based on the Warehouse Receipt System (WRS) being implemented under the PSAC/IFC. Activities related to the feeder roads 

rehabilitation/construction will take into account the national strategy for roads maintenance which includes a partnership between the State 

and private operators (Inter-professional bodies) for the selection of priority roads for rehabilitation/maintenance or construction and the 

parallel co-financing of these activities. Following an inventory of the existing network of rural roads in project areas, a rural road improvement 

program will be developed jointly with the CCA and AGEROUTE (the roads management national agency). The Project will rehabilitate/maintain 

around 1000 km of existing feeder roads and eventually construct about 200 km of new roads. It will also rehabilitate/construct required 

infrastructure representing a critical bottleneck in selected spots (small bridges and culverts). A community-based road maintenance strategy 

will be developed and related road maintenance associations strengthened/formed at community level. In addition, low-cost hand tools and 

equipment will be provided to the community to undertake routine maintenance. The project will learn from the outcome of the joint WB-AFD 

project (PSAC) implementing similar activities in the project areas.  

Activities related to post-harvest technologies will involves an assessment of existing storage facilities
21

, identification of best practices and 

development of a store keeping manual for practitioners, and upgrading and/or developing new storage facilities. To the extent possible, the 

rehabilitation of existing “public” warehouses will reply on public-private-partnership business models. 

COMPONENT 3: SUPPORT TO PRIVATE INVESTMENT IN PROCESSING CAPACITY AND MARKET LINKAGES (US$95 MILLION). This component 

aims at increasing the volume and value-addition of RCN locally processed. Project interventions consist of an integrated mix of activities at 

four different levels: (i) improving the business environment; (ii) facilitating access to investment capital and risk management instruments to 

producers and domestic processors; (iii) supporting for the development of an adequate infrastructure for the establishment of the cashew 

industry; and (iv) market development and trade.  

Sub-component 3.1: Improving the business environment (US$10 million). The cashew industry operating in Cote d’Ivoire faces market failures 

that need to be addressed if this “nascent” industry is to develop and contribute to economic growth, jobs creation and poverty reduction. 

Cooperatives and SMEs are affected more than large firms are by regulation and transaction burdens (business environment constraints), have 

little access to credit (finance constraints), and have limited access to information, advisory services, technology, and innovation (knowledge 

constraints). Under this subcomponent, the project will:  

(i) Revise the existing regulations on cashew nut levies so that their distribution could strengthen CCA and be reinvested into the 

development of the processing sector - for example in capacity strengthening of processors and R&D on technical solutions. 

 

(ii) Assess the regulations and licenses that are required to sell, buy and trade cashew products with the objective to reduce the costs of 
marketing (from producer to port and to consumer) and make the value chain ultimately more competitive. This involves a revision of the 

                                            
21

 Updating the inventory of warehouses and of storage facilities needs which was carried-out under the PSAC/Veritas in 2015.

current procedures in relation to other sectors and practices in other countries, the identification of opportunities for simplification, 

digitalization and streamlining and the testing and implementation of such measures. The project will also support the implementation of the 

new WRS regulations recently adopted through capacity-building benefiting the WRS Regulatory Authority.  
 

(iii) Promote other improvement in the business environment such as: (a) fiscal incentives defined in terms of duration, duty exemptions on 

processing CAPEX, and duty exemption on spare parts and consumable; (b) regional payroll tax exemptions to lower employment costs in 

production zones; (c) subsidy based on kernels produced/exported which should be clarified and defined in terms of duration (currently set by 

the CCA at 80 CFA per kg of RCN processed); and (d) a Fast-track “window” for processing investment incentives. 

 

(iv) Support the creation of new and/or improvement of existing business development services and technology centers that are targeted 

at cashew ago-enterprises for the provision of services such as technical and business advice, R&D, etc. In particular, the project will strengthen 

the Cashew Technology Center currently being established in Yamoussoukro, in partnership with the FHB Technical Institute and the Ho Chi 

Minh University, for the transfer of technologies, the training of the labor force and the provision of technical assistance to private investors. 

The actors to be engaged in this sub-component include the Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Industry and Mines, Ministry of Commerce, 

CCA, Union of cashew processors, the Warehouse Regulatory Authority and national technology centres and business development services.   

Sub-component 3.2. Facilitating access to investment capital and risk management instruments to domestic processors  (US$33 million). This 

sub-component will aim at improving access to term finance for investments as well as working capital for the cashew domestic industry and 

will consist of a Financing (line of credit) and a Risk Sharing Facility (RSF). Targeted end-beneficiaries will include new and domestic cashew 

enterprises in need of financing to upgrade/modernize their technology or establish new processing plants (including financing for capital 

investment, capacity expansion and working capital). Selection of PFIs for the line of credit and RSF would be based on clearly defined eligibility 

criteria that would ensure minimum performance and capital, profitability and portfolio quality standards of the PFIs and their ability to 

promote cashew industry development at national level. The volume, lending rates and arrangements of the line of credit and RSF will be set 

appropriately to minimize any potential market distortion, and in compliance with OP requirements for lines of credit. 

 

The project will combine the provision of appropriate financing instruments to banks (line of credit and risk sharing facility) with commitments 

from participating banks to strengthen their lending capability over time to the cashew processing industry. A technical assistance will be 

available under both facilities to support: (i) training for the banks that will benefit from the credit line or RSF, in order to help build capacity in 

lending services to the cashew industry (and agro-industry in general) and ensure that benefiting industry has sufficient capacity to effectively 

utilize loans from the banks for the growth of their businesses; and (ii) advisory services at the industry level to increase their “bankability” – 

preparation of sound business plans (including choice of technology and support for procurement) and loan applications.  

 

Based on preliminary discussions with the stakeholders (government officials, local banks and cashew industry) as well as prior studies, there is 

an acute shortage of financing availability; and the volume of the proposed line of credit as well as RSF is relatively modest yet adequate to 

have meaningful impact and create momentum for Cote d’Ivoire to move up the cashew nut value-chain.  Access, modalities and financial 

terms would include features such as competitive interest rates and maturities in line with on–going commercial practices and consistent with 

the OP10 guideline for LOCs, to ensure that no market distortions are created. The availability period of the LOC as well as RSF would be [5] 

years, and the maturity of loans would be set accordingly, based on further consultation with the stakeholders, to address the shortage of 

financing in particular for investments in the sector and the current gap in the financing offered in Cote d’Ivoire. The RSF will be used to reduce 

the banks’ risk of lending to cashew industry borrowers.  There are other past cases in the region where RSF was deployed effectively in 

agriculture sector (e.g., Mali) and the project will also draw lessons from these experiences.  

 

Sub-component 3.3. Supporting for the development of an adequate infrastructure for the cashew industry (US$42 million). This sub-

component aims at addressing important lacks of infrastructure that limit private investment and hinder the development of competitive and 

inclusive cashew processing industry in the country. It will complement on the forthcoming PIDUCAS project
22

 which plan investments in key 

economic and social infrastructure in Bouaké and San Pedro. It will particularly support the development of a concentrated agro-industrial zone 

in the main producing area of northern Cote d’Ivoire, mainly focused on value addition/agro-processing services of cashew products and by-

products (cashew nut shell liquid (CNSL)
23

, juice, biofuel, etc.). The zone will be developed based on a public-private partnership scheme aiming 

                                            
22

 Infrastructure for Urban Development and Competitiveness of Secondary Cities Project (P151324). 
23

 The cashew nut shell liquid (CNSL) has important properties which make it valuable for automobile brake linings and paint and varnishes. These by-products are fully 

used in the main processing countries (Brazil, India) and can bring as much revenue as the cashew nut itself.

at facilitating:  (i) access to basic infrastructure; (ii) shared common services and facilities and creation of economies of scale in service 

provision, including storage facilities, transport, quality control services, waste management, etc.; (iii) improved access to technical support and 

information and management services; and (iv) a platform for business linkages between and within value-chain actors through effective 

network between primary producers, agro-processors, traders, retailers and end markets.  

 

Under this sub-component, the project will finance the agro-industrial zone site development and promotion which will include the following 

investments: (i) site identification and assessment based on specific criteria including access roads, site-specific risks, key cost factors, private 

sector interest, etc.; (ii) in-depth technical and economic feasibility studies for the zone development, including a market demand assessment, 

sizing of necessary industrial land, master planning and development, business development plan, environmental and social safeguards, etc.; 

(iii) the construction of the zone’s critical infrastructure (access and internal road network, electricity, communications, and water supply) and 

common services (such administration building, storage facilities, workshop, quality control laboratory, waste disposal, etc.); (iv) investment 

promotion campaign for the site; (v) establishment of its management structure; and (vi) a network of linked sub-regional storage and primary 

processing satellite centres feeding into the agro-industrial zone. 

 
Sub-Component 3.4. Market development and trade (US$10 million). A sustainable outlet for RCN and kernels is a prerequisite to the 
realization of growth potentials in production and processing. Therefore, this component aims at an effective development of domestic, 

regional and international markets for cashew products, particularly kernels. The following interventions are planned: (i) A study related to the 

opportunities for marketing of cashew products (and by-products) locally and internationally. This would engage in a detailed analysis of 

existing domestic and international marketing channels and a projection on most viable options for marketing cashew products with the 

associated standards and quality requirements. Quality control needs to be introduced to the purchase of processed products for local and 

international markets; (ii) Launching a branding and marketing campaign through various channels of mass media (telephone, television, radio, 

billboards, newspapers) to promote cashew consumption among consumers in Cote d’Ivoire. An Ivoirian brand of kernels, eventually to be 

issued by the CCA, will also be promoted on international trade fairs; (iii) Introducing and promoting the application of principles of quality 

control and food safety into processing and marketing of cashew nuts including Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) and Good Hygienic 

Practices (GHP) as well as food safety standards such as Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP). This implies promotion of and training 

in good practices in cashew nut production and processing and enforcement of application of quality criteria at the buyer’s level (warehouse 

and retailers); (iv) establishing a market information system that provides efficiently information on prices for raw and processed cashew nuts 

to all stakeholders. This will involve the collection of price data at farm gates, factory gates, warehouse gates, at ports, at major trading places 

(e.g. India), and setting up of a price information service reachable by everybody via telephone and internet, and the continuous analysis and 

publishing of market intelligence; and (v) improving the efficiency in marketing/auctioning raw cashew nuts. This would require working out 

modalities to enable producers and processors getting more direct access to international buyers for raw nuts and kernels and vice versa.  

 

COMPONENT 4: PROGRAM COORDINATION, MONITORING AND KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT (US$17.5 MILLION). This component will 

facilitate: (i) administrative, technical, and financial management of the program; (ii) coordination among all institutional partners to ensure 

efficient flow of information and support to all value chain actors, in particular the small cashew growers and the processing industry; (iii) 

effective contractual arrangements with key implementing partners (CCA, CNRA, etc.) and other private sector operators; (iv) monitoring and 

evaluation of the performance and the financial, environmental, and social impact of the project; and (v) development of communication 

activities to publicize and disseminate the project results, best practices and success stories.

  SAFEGUARDS 

 
A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)       

 
The project main interventions will be mostly located in the Northern regions of Cote d'Ivoire, where cashew has 
become the most important source of rural cash income. 

 
B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies       

 
The Recipient has several years of experience in applying and implementing World Bank projects. There are 
considerable legal and institutional frameworks in the country to ensure compliance with World Bank safeguards 
policies triggered by the proposed project. In Cote d’Ivoire, the Ministry of Environment, and Sustainable Development 
(MINEDD) is responsible for setting policy guidelines on environmental issues and ensuring compliance with national 
environmental standards. It has different departments among which the National Agency of Environment (ANDE, 
Agence Nationale de l’Environnement) in charge of safeguards compliance of all projects in the country. The unit is 
well staffed and its capacities are acceptable. With regard to the PCU, capacity building efforts to support project 
implementation will be done by implementing recommendations contained in the safeguards instruments prepared 
for the project. The project will also receive guidance from the Bank’s environmental and social specialists in the 
Project team.

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

This project is planning to finance roads 
rehabilitation/construction with the aim to establish 
the connection of the main cashew production areas 
to markets. For instance, about 200 km of new roads 
will be built and other 1000 km will be rehabilitated 
(see sub-component 2.2). Besides, the project is 
going to support the development of a concentrated 
agro-industrial zone including basic infrastructures 
and storage facilities as well as waste management 
(sub-component 3.3). Based on all potential adverse 
impacts which may be significant and irreversible, the 
project is rated as a category A project. 
 
While the exact locations of these investments are 
not yet known, the proper safeguard instrument to 
be prepared in compliance with this policy is an 
Environmental and Social Management Framework

(ESMF). This ESMF will be reviewed, consulted upon 
and disclosed both in Cote d’Ivoire and at the 
Infoshop at least 120 days before the board 
presentation. 
 
In addition, the project aims at addressing important 
lacks of infrastructure that limit private investment 
and hinder the development of competitive and 
inclusive cashew processing industry in the country 
through the development of agro-industrial zone 
based on a public-private partnership scheme. 
Regarding potential environmental and social adverse 
impacts associated with such an investment, the 
appropriate safeguard instrument to develop is a 
sectoral Strategic Environmental and Social 
Assessment (SESA). The terms of reference for such a 
SESA will be developed, consulted upon and disclosed 
within Cote d’Ivoire and at the Infoshop at least 
120days prior to the board date. But the sectoral 
assessment itself will be carried out as part of the 
project implementation. 

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 Yes 

The project will be implemented on areas where 
forests still exist. This kind of environment 
concentrates various insects and others types of 
animals, whose natural habitat could potentially be 
affected by the project’s activities mainly with the 
opening of new road (200 km). However, there is no 
specific safeguard instrument to be prepared. This 
issue will be taken into account by the ESMF. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 Yes 

Areas where the project’s activities will be 
implemented comprise forested areas. That factor 
could possibly impact the health and quality of 
forests or the rights and welfare of people and their 
level of dependence upon the interaction with 
forests, and it may lead to changes in the 
management, protection or utilization of natural 
forests or plantations. So, special attention may be 
paid in order to avoid or unless minimize adverse 
impacts on forests resources. The ESMF that will be 
prepared in accordance with OP4.01 will provide 
guidance to address matters related to forests 
protection. During the implementation phase, a 
management plan will be prepared if necessary. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 
The sub-component 2.1 will aim at increasing the 
production (including quality) and productivity of 
cashew producers in the project areas. That means

even if the project does not purchase fertilizers and 
agro-chemicals directly, It will induce the use of those 
chemical products by cashew producers for pest and 
disease management. Furthermore, the project 
intends to launch a fertilizer and phytosanitary 
treatment program. Consequently an Integrated Pest 
Management Plan (IPMP) will be prepared, reviewed, 
consulted upon, approved and disclosed in the 
targeted areas, mainly in the north of Cote d’Ivoire 
and at the Infoshop at least 120 days before board 
date. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 Yes 

Activities supported by the ongoing bank’s funded 
operation such as roads construction/rehabilitation; 
agro-industrial zone, water supply facilities will 
unquestionably involve excavations with possibilities 
to underscore Physical cultural resources. However, 
the triggering of this policy does not entail the 
preparation of a specific safeguard instrument. Only a 
specific chapter will be included in the ESMF to 
provide guidance in case physical cultural resources 
will be discovered. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 No 
There are no indigenous people as defined by the 
policy in the project area. 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

The planned interventions such as rural roads, agro-
industrial parks, storage facilities are expected to lead 
to land acquisition or restriction of access to sources 
of livelihood. Therefore, a Resettlement Policy 
Framework (RPF) will be prepared for the activities 
triggered by the OP 4.12 as a due diligence given that 
the specific sites or impacts of planned physical 
investments are not known. The RPF will be prepared 
by the Borrower, reviewed and cleared by the team 
and disclosed in country and at Bank InfoShop prior 
to appraisal. The RPF will be used as a guide to 
conduct specific Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) as 
needed, as well as compensation measures to 
minimize negative impacts on Project Affected 
People (PAPs).The RAPs will be submitted to the Bank 
for approval prior to the commencement of the civil 
works. 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 No The project will not finance dams nor rely on dams. 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

No 
The project is not expected to affect international 
waterways. 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No The project will not be located in a Disputed Area.

E. Safeguard Preparation Plan        
 

Tentative target date for preparing the Appraisal Stage PID/ISDS 
 

Dec 30, 2016 
 
Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed. The specific studies and 
their timing should be specified in the Appraisal Stage PID/ISDS 
 
The following safeguard instruments are expected to be prepared during the preparation phase: (i) an Environmental 
and Social Management Framework (ESMF), (ii) a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF), (iii) an Integrated Pest 
Management Plan (IPMP) and (iv) a Physical Cultural Resources Management Framework (PCRMF) . All these safeguard 
documents will be reviewed consulted upon and disclosed by the Government of the Republic of Cote d’Ivoire, and by 
the World Bank’s Infoshop  at least 120 days prior to presentation of the Project to the Board.

Track II - The review did authorize the preparation to continue

I. Introduction and Context
Country Context
Since 2003, Nigeria has continued to record high, sustained economic growth driven by non-oil 
sector, whereas the performance of the oil sector has slowed down.  Over the last decade, reported 
GDP growth rate has consistently remained between 6 to 8 percent. Key drivers of this strong 
growth are trade (retail and wholesale), agriculture, and telecommunications sectors.  These three 
sectors alone accounted for about 80 percent of GDP growth during 2009-2012. However, annual 
GDP growth rate declined from 7 percent in 2011 to 6.6 and 6.4 percent in 2012 and in the first half 
of 2013 respectively.  Growth has slowed in oil and gas, agriculture and trade but growth in the oil 
sector is slower than in agriculture.  The slowdown in agriculture and trade is related to the impact 
of 2012 flooding which disrupted crop production calendar and growing security problems in some

parts of the country that continues to restrict flows of trade. Oil production has stagnated or declined 
since 2010 due to increasing oil theft in the Niger Delta, and destruction of pipeline infrastructure. 
As a result, oil output in the first half of 2013 was about 10% lower than during the same period of 
2012.   
Rising oil prices ushered in surplus Balance of Payments (BoP) since 2011.  Reserves declined 
however to US$45 billion between April and early October, 2013, reflecting lower oil output,  
weaker oil prices, and more cautious attitudes of investors. While these inflows have strengthened 
Nigeria’s balance of payment and reserve position, they also pose major risk because of its 
vulnerability to shocks or swings in oil prices. Therefore, diversification of the economy is critical if 
Nigeria is to sustain a strong balance of payment position. The Nigerian Government has achieved 
significant budget consolidation since 2011, but dwindling oil production outlook presents fiscal 
uncertainties.   Government fiscal consolidation program is yielding results. Government  deficit 
reduced from an estimated 5.7 percent of GDP in 2010 to 1.9 percent in 2012.  While oil output 
appears poised to recover somewhat in the second half of 2013, Nigeria faces an important 
challenge in that oil revenues are not expected to increase in the medium term at the nearly the pace 
of GDP or the population of the country, reinforcing the need to deepen  significantly other sources 
of Government revenues. 
Nigeria needs effective institutions and good governance to achieve sustainable and inclusive 
growth.  Good governance is critical for improving the effectiveness and efficiency of public 
expenditures and services. Although, some pockets of effectiveness and capability in actually 
implementing reform have emerged, as reflected, for example, in the macroeconomic consolidation, 
consolidation of the banking sector after 2009 crisis, progress in implementing the power sector and 
the agricultural reforms. Important weaknesses and risks that still need to be addressed include the 
enforcement of regulations, inter-agency coordination and supervisory capacity.

Sectoral and Institutional Context
The competitiveness of the agriculture value chains and diversification of the productive base of the 
economy away from oil is a key pillar of the Federal Government’s Agricultural Transformation 
Agenda (ATA). The ATA represents the Government’s renewed focus on value addition to targeted 
commodities for enhanced food security, employment creation and sourcing of raw materials for 
industries and generally for agriculture to serve as engine for a broad-based economic development 
in Nigeria. The ATA is designed to focus on self-sufficiency via import substitution, lowering of 
food costs, increasing real wages and driving down inflation, engendering a rapid transition to an 
export-oriented agricultural economy. It is also to diversify the economy thereby increasing foreign 
exchange reserves, stabilizing the exchange rate and significantly increase the level of foreign direct 
investment (FDI). Key policies and institutional reforms are aimed at: (a) broadening the reach of 
the fertilizer subsidy program and making it more efficient and business oriented; (b) improving the 
investment framework through the development of Staple Crop Processing Zones (SCPZs); (c) 
improving the marketing of agricultural products; (d) promoting investment in productivity-
enhancing technologies. In parallel, the Government seeks to expand and improve large-scale dam 
and irrigation infrastructure which has significant deficiencies that negatively impact agricultural 
productivity, notably in the North where the bulk of Nigeria’s dam and irrigation infrastructure is 
located. 
The agricultural sector is considered an engine of growth capable of generating broad-based 
development outcomes needed for rapid economic transformation. The sector has been central to 
Nigeria’s poverty reduction and employment generation efforts, and retained this importance in 
recent times as the largest contributor to  non-oil growth (40.2% and 34.5%  of GDP in 2011 and in 
the first quarter of 2012 respectively) and important in overall economic growth as well. Self-

sufficiency and import substitution are explicit policy goals of agricultural development strategies in 
Nigeria, resulting from the growing and substantial food import bills  (US$ 2 billion) and policy 
responses (export bans) from a number of exporting countries witnessed during the recent global 
financial and food price crisis.    
The agriculture sector has been growing over the last decade, but not fast enough to meet the food 
security, employment and poverty challenges. Indeed, in recent years, food imports have been 
growing at a faster pace than the population growth (about 11% against,  2.8%) , and though the 
country has met the MDG1 on hunger, still 8.5% of total population were leaving below the  
minimum level of dietary energy consumption in 2011. Low productivity of major staple crops  – 
measured as average yield per hectare - as a result of  very low use of improved inputs , limited 
access to extension services by farmers) and limited investment by the private sector confine the 
sector well below its potential for growth. Power and road infrastructure, low-cost and long term 
financing, access to competitive inputs and supplies, as well as inconsistent policy environment are 
consistently identified by the private sector  as major challenges to their engagement in the sector. 
Rather than trying to drive the entire agricultural sector forward at the same time as in many past 
strategy documents, the ATA focuses on a few key first moves - priority food staples and traditional 
export crops, and intends to develop these for growth and employment creation, with the 
expectation that the rest of the sector will subsequently follow. Within agriculture, a major driver of 
growth is staple food crops, which contributed 35.8 percent to the agricultural GDP in 2011. 
Although in Asia irrigated agriculture was more prominent than in Nigeria, the ATA approach is 
similar to the Asian Green Revolution (GR) strategy, where an initial focus on import substitution 
for wheat and rice in high potential irrigated areas led the successful rural transformation that 
followed. Like the Asian model, the ATA assigns a lead role to the state in driving and orchestrating 
the strategy within each of the selected value chains, and in using financial incentives and import 
charges to encourage this growth. Unlike Asia, however, the ATA aggressively promotes private 
sector-led growth and is relying on public-priva te partnerships rather than state run marketing and 
financial institutions.

Relationship to CAS
The proposed SCPZ Support Project is fully aligned with the World Bank group Agricultural Action 
Plan 2013-2014, and features in the mix of instruments proposed under the New CPS (2014-
FY2017). Indeed the WBG new Agricultural Action identifies agricultural productivity, linking 
farmers to markets, and increasing non-farm income as key areas to put emphasis in order to help 
countries meet the MDG1, in one hand. in the other hand, the overarching objective of the Bank 
new CPS is to support the Government's Visions 20:2020 and Transformation Agenda for inclusive 
economic growth,  through a strategic focus on energy and agriculture sectors as cornerstone to help 
the country reduce poverty and increase shared prosperity. More specifically,  and under the first 
pillar (Federally led structural reforms for growth and jobs), the new CPS aims inter alia at boosting 
agricultural productivity, improving farmers' linkages with agro-processors, and scaling up Nigeria's 
resilience to current and future climate variability. 
The proposed SCPZ support project would contribute to the achievement of Pillar I of the new 
Country Partnership Strategy on growth and competitiveness. The CPS recognized that diversified 
growth and increased productivity is a prerequisite for accelerated poverty reduction and shared 
prosperity. With the dwindling fortune of the oil sector in Nigeria, agriculture offers a sure pathway 
to a diversified and sustained economic growth. However, low productivity and lack of 
competitiveness of the agriculture sector is inextricably linked to poor infrastructure and limited 
access to the market that increases transaction cost and limit margin to the farmers. This project 
would therefore contribute to laying foundation for diversified growth by providing critical public

infrastructure necessary for improved market access and to attract private sector investment in 
agribusiness; a subsector that can offer inclusive and broad development impact. 
The Proposed SCPZ support project will be complemented by ongoing and upcoming operations in 
the World Bank portfolio such as Fadama III/Additional Financing, CADP, WAAPP, RAMP, the 
irrigation project (TRMING), the Development Financing support project, as well as non-Bank-
funded projects supporting  ATA (AfDB-ATASP2, IFAD- Cassava and Value chains support 
project). Those operations are mostly oriented toward improving productivity and ramping up 
production in the SCPZ catchment areas, critical to improving competitiveness of the processing 
segment of the value chains, recognizing that addressing the challenge of low productivity in the 
agriculture sector requires targeted investments in technology, irrigation, rural roads, market 
information, and increasing access to finance. It will also take advantage of sector reforms initiated 
under the series of DPOs; with the second operation focusing inter alia on improving the 
institutional framework and business environment for SCPZ through the preparation of SCZP 
Policy, legal and Institutional framework to foster a predictable business environment for the private 
sector. 
An effective institution is necessary for managing sustainable and inclusive growth and 
competitiveness. Governance represented by deficient institutions can explain the under-
performance of agriculture sector, and its lack of competitiveness. Governance represents the 
foundation for the two pillar of the CPS. The CPS emphasized the fact that the ways in which public 
functions are carried out, public resources are managed and regulatory powers are exercised 
strongly influence the performance of the main sector actors, the focus of sector policies and their 
concrete outcomes. The SCPZ project would support an aspect of this by providing institutional 
development as part of the project design.

II. Proposed Development Objective(s)
Proposed Development Objective(s) (From PCN)
The Project development objective (PDO) is to increase market linkages for farmers and strengthen 
the institutional framework for inclusive public and private investment in selected agribusiness 
clusters. 
 
The Project will contribute to the broader objectives of the FGN’s SCPZ Program consisting of 
‘increasing food production and reducing the demand for imports, adding value through processing, 
reducing cost of doing business for processors, and attracting new investment to create jobs, 
especially in rural areas, and to drive the economy’.  The expansion of the agribusiness- farmer 
linkage models under the SCPZ program through the right mix of public and private investments 
will ultimately, improve agricultural productivity, generate shared growth and substantially reduce 
poverty in rural areas.

Key Results (From PCN)
The mandatory corporate indicator on beneficiaries is as follow: Number of direct beneficiaries 
(directs: benefiting farmers, workers in the SCPZ processing area, and  holders of small and 
medium businesses along value chains in the SCPZ; disaggregated by gender). Indirect beneficiaries 
include family members of and beneficiaries from ancillary activities, estimated as the total 
population in hosting communities.   
PDO level results and indicators 
i. Total amount of  investment financing brought by private sector into the  SCPZ (NGN, $);  
ii. Increase in sales of agricultural products by project supported farmers within the SCPZ area

(disaggregated by gender). 
Intermediate results and indicators (disaggregated by gender as relevant) 
i. Units measurement of infrastructure  (power generated, roads constructed, water supplied) 
constructed or rehabilitated in the SCPZ area; 
ii. Number of agricultural businesses  established and operating in with project support ; 
iii. Number of farmers groups with off-take agreement in project intervention areas; 
iv. Number of  businesses successfully implemented in the SCPZ with Project support (with 
the aim at strengthening agribusiness-farmers linkages and creating economic opportunities for the 
communities along the value chains, disaggregated by gender).

III. Preliminary Description
Concept Description
The concept of the Staple Crop Processing Zones under ATA as proposed by the Federal 
Government of Nigeria  is based on the following three guiding principles: (i) take an integrated 
approach to the value chain by addressing critical upstream and downstream bottlenecks and 
facilitating market linkages; (ii) offer a superior operating environment that reduces the cost of 
doing business, and iii) take a private sector-led approach. The Operating Principles are the 
following; (i) investment-driven strategic partnerships with the private sector; (ii) integrated value 
chain approach; (iii) Self-sustaining, government-support and private sector managed. 
  
The SCPZ program aims to channel infrastructure investments to facilitate efficient value chain 
linkages and reduce the cost of doing business, and improve the competitiveness of Nigeria’s agro-
industrial production. By creating an enabling business environment around selected value chains 
clusters, the FGN and State Governments seek to attract private sector investors to set up processing 
plants in high food production areas, in order to boost import substitution, create wealth 
opportunities for farming communities, reduce post-harvest losses, create sustainable employment 
in agro-production, processing and related activities, and drive rapid rural development.  
 
The proposed Project will support the FGN to implement the first model SCPZ and assist in 
building blocks for its sustainable expansion. The project approach to the Government's SCPZs 
Program consists of test running the concept gradually in limited number of sites, as an integrated 
agribusiness supply chain project, with strong farmers –agribusiness linkages aim to overcome the 
multiple, interlocking constraints in infrastructure provision and productivity growth along 
agricultural supply chains. Project will focus its support on Cassava supply value chain in Kogi 
State (at least 70% of project funding), with an open window for limited support in the form of 
technical assistance for up to three other sites/States with strong business case, and  based one 
following minimum criteria :  alignment with Government priority value chains and located in one 
of the SCPZ sites, existing or ready-to-implement  private investment project(s) with sizable 
financing,  high potential for improving agricultural productivity and  generating benefits for 
farmers,  strong support of state Government and local communities, existence of other Bank 
assisted project or partnership with other Donors funded project, and possible IFC intervention. 
 
Project activities will be clustered around the following areas of intervention :  
 
(a) Support to public infrastructure development for the model SCPZ in Kogi State (around 
75% of project total cost) :  consists of  support to Government to develop off-site infrastructure and 
subsequently identify and attract private sector investors willing to invest in on-site development,

operations and maintenance of the zone. The Project is also considering  to  support part of the on-
site infrastructure to guarantee minimum utility services (internal roads, water, gas, power) for up to 
3 private investment projects (covering up to 40% of the 250 hectares of the core zones).  
 
(b) Support to farmers-agribusiness linkage and to economic opportunities along the value 
chains (around 15% of total project cost). In coordination with FADAMA III Additional Financing 
( FADAMA III AF) and other relevant operations in the portfolio, the project will provide support 
to link  farmers, SMEs and communities in the catchment areas with the processing units as  
follows: (i) Improving Farmers productivity: the project will work with agro-processors to 
develop off-take agreements with farmers , aimed at structuring their organizations, and facilitating 
their access to inputs and services, such as  financing, extension, mechanization, land clearing, 
equipment and small scale production and marketing infrastructures,  grading, quality and standards, 
as well as skills development. Project will partner with Fadama III Additional Financing which will 
provide on-farm support to assist farmers deliver on the contracts; (ii) Promotion of economic 
opportunities for the community: The Project will establish a matching grants scheme to support 
activities aim at strengthening agribusiness farmers linkages which could  create jobs and increase 
income for the communities, thus contributing to reducing poverty in the project intervention areas. 
This will include support to women and youths and their groups, promoting development of 
mechanization services, transport, application of chemicals, business planning for SMEs, training , 
financial literacy, and ancillary activities of the value chains. 
 
(c) Institutional development in SCPZ (around 10% of total project cost): (i) Structuring of PPP 
for zone development, operation and maintenance: project will provide support for the 
establishment of a Specific Purpose vehicle (SPV) with a Board inclusive of all relevant 
stakeholders (Federal Government, State Government, Local Government, Developer, and Tenants). 
It is envisioned that the PPP transactions will result in specific contracts between the SPV and 
private investors; (ii) Land and safeguards management: for appropriate management of farm land 
allocation to the nucleus farms and for coordinated implementation of the SCPZ Master Plan in the 
catchment areas, the project will assist the State Government in developing responsible land 
allocation and management procedures following World Bank and international guidelines and 
standards, as well as adequate instruments and M&E system for environmental and social 
safeguards; (iii) Technical assistance to FMARD: The proposed Project will provide institutional 
support to FMARD and the SCPZ-Authority being established to regulate the SCPZS, in terms of 
technical assistance (TA), training, and experience sharing of best practices from across the world, 
and for scaling up the program to other sites based on lessons learnt from the pilot SCPZ in Kogi 
State; (iv) Technical assistance selected States for development of agribusiness clusters: 
Specific TA might include market assessment, SCPZ detailed feasibility studies, attracting private 
investor and structuring PPP, promotion of the program within the country and abroad, etc. The 
project will also support FMARD to support selected States, and upon their request, in developing 
their SCPZ projects. 
 
(d)  Project coordination: dedicated project management and coordination structure will set up 
and early as before negotiations, to initiate the implementation of the project and until the SCPZ 
institutional framework is established and fully operational.

Gross Domestic Product (GDP) reveals that Kenya?s economy is the ninth largest in Africa and 
fifth largest in Sub-Saharan Africa (after Nigeria, South Africa, Angola, and Sudan)  . Kenya?s 
growth compares favorably with other countries. It no longer lags behind its regional peers or 
other lower-middle-income countries. Average growth between 2010 and 2013 was 6.2 percent?
significantly higher than the 5.3 percent average for Sub-Saharan Africa. Kenya?s 2013 growth 
rate of 5.7 percent was above the 5.0 percent average growth rate for lower-middle income 
countries.  In December 2014, Kenya?s GDP was estimated at US$55.2 billion (up from US$44.1 
billion before rebasing), with GDP per capita standing at US$1,246 (up from US$994). Kenya is 
now a lower-middle-income country, according to the World Bank classification, with Gross 
National Income (GNI) per capita of US$1,160 in 2013.   The economy was estimated to have 
grown 5.4 percent in 2014 and expected to grow by 6 percent in 2015 on the backdrop of 
significant improvement in external and internal balances, such as falling oil prices; and public 
investment, mainly in infrastructure (energy and the standard gauge railway). The World Bank 
projects that Kenya?s GDP will grow 6.6 percent in 2016, and 7.0 percent in 2017. 
 
2. Although poverty rates in Kenya seem to have fallen, formidable challenges at reducing 
poverty and increasing shared prosperity, in particular in rural areas, remain. Poverty reduction 
has been driven by solid growth across most sectors of the economy. But improvements in 
income are not evenly shared amongst people and inequality appears to be rising among regions.  
According to the World Bank Group Kenya Country Partnership Strategy (CPS 2014-2018), 
Kenya?s poverty rate has been falling?from 47 percent in 2005/06 to about 39 percent based on 
best estimates in 2012/13. But in the remote, arid, sparsely populated north-eastern parts of the 
country (Turkana, Mandera, and Wajir), poverty rates are above 80 percent.  The scale of 
consumption poverty in Kenya is staggering, and is concentrated in rural areas. Based on the last 
national household budget survey, close to half of the population (nearly 17 million Kenyans) was 
poor in 2005. The vast majority of the poor lived in rural areas and were more likely to depend on 
income and consumption from crops and livestock, as their main source of livelihood. Revised 
poverty estimates indicate that in 2013 nearly 4 in 10 Kenyans continue to live in extreme 
poverty.  
 
3. As the roles of national and county governments are restructured, and new county 
institutions are created, a fundamental challenge is to maintain the delivery of agricultural 
services. Under the new constitution adopted in 2010, the central government is devolving 
responsibility for multiple functions to 47 elected county governments and providing a minimum 
of 15 percent of national revenues to counties to carry out those functions. The main functions for 
agriculture (crop and animal husbandry services, extension, agricultural marketing and other 
related services) were transferred in August 2013 (the national government remains in charge of 
policy and research). With some exceptions, County agricultural services are in an embryonic 
state, with limited and in some cases no technical and/or operational capacity.
Sectoral and Institutional Context
4. In Kenya, agriculture remains one of the most important sectors of the economy. But 
about 83 percent of Kenya?s land area is in the Arid and Semi-Arid Lands (ASALs), which are 
mainly pastoral areas and the remaining 17 percent (where 80 percent of population lives) is 
classified as medium to high agricultural potential zone. In 2013, the sector contributed almost 27 
percent to the national GDP . The crops, livestock and fisheries sub-sectors contributed 
approximately 78, 20 and 2 percent to agricultural GDP respectively. The sector employs more 
than 75 percent of the workforce (also accounts for more than one-fifth of formal employment), 
generates most of the country?s food requirements, and plays a key role in poverty reduction. It

also generates nearly two-thirds (65 percent) of merchandise exports and roughly 60 percent of 
foreign exchange earnings.  
 
5. Overall, Kenya?s agricultural sector performance has been highly volatile with growth 
rates dipping into negative territory in nine years between 1980 and 2012 (Figure 1 below). 
Kenya?s agricultural growth rate has averaged between 3.4 percent during 1995-2003 and 
decreased to an average of 2.1 percent in 2003-2011 period. Recent years have witnessed 
increased volatility in agricultural growth rates with debilitating impacts on rural households 
incomes and employment; urban and rural food security, poverty reduction and the country?s 
overall economic growth. The sector?s growth in real gross value-added decelerated in 2013 to 
2.9 percent from a revised growth of 4.2 percent in 2012. The lowest agricultural GDP growth 
rate and value-added was noted in 2008, during a period which Kenya experienced the post-
election violence following the country?s 2007 general elections. 
   
6. Extreme weather events, largely droughts and to a lesser extent floods, have been the 
principal driver behind the volatility in the agricultural sector?s performance in Kenya.  The 
frequency and intensity of severe weather events have increased and this trend will be further 
amplified in the future as temperatures rise due to climate change . The World Bank?s agricultural 
sector risk assessment (2014) highlighted that recurring drought has profound effects on the 
agricultural sector, particularly in maize (main staple food) and livestock (in pastoral systems) 
production. Frequent drought events resulted in precipitous crop losses, livestock deaths, spikes in 
food prices, increased food insecurity and malnutrition for the poor and led to rural population 
displacement (temporary migrations).  
 
7. Kenya?s strong reliance on rain fed maize production system in meeting its food needs 
and growing consolidation of production toward maize (and dry beans) has rendered the country 
increasingly vulnerable to supply disruptions and food shortages. Amid declining yields, 
productivity gains have come largely through land expansion into marginal areas that receive 
lower and more variable rainfall. This trend, coupled with Kenya? increasingly erratic rainfall, 
has made the country?s maize production more susceptible to moisture stress and year-on-year 
yield variability, with significant implications for national food security.  This has contributed to a 
growing structural deficit in maize/food production, a gap currently filled by rising imports, 
aggravating the country?s exposure to globally-driven commodity price shocks. Emergency food 
aid and other ex-post responses has helped fuel growing dependency and declining resilience, 
particularly among the poorest and especially those in the ASALs. 
 
8. Livestock production plays an important socio-economic role in many areas across 
Kenya, particularly in the ASALs where it accounts for as much as nine-tenths of employment 
and family income. Extensive livestock systems and pastoralists in Kenya?s northern rangelands 
are particularly vulnerable to the effects of drought. Estimated losses to livestock populations 
from droughts that have occurred within the most recent decade amount to more than US$1.08 
billion. Ancillary losses related to production assets and future income and the costs of ex-post 
response measures are likely several times that figure. The increased incidence of droughts across 
the ASALs in recent years means that affected communities have less time to recover and rebuild 
their assets. This has weakened traditional coping mechanisms and handicapped household 
resilience against future shocks. 
 
9. Climate variability is already having an impact on agriculture and food security in Kenya,

as a result of increased prevalence of extreme events (especially droughts) and increased 
unpredictability of weather patterns.  For example, severe droughts that occurred in 1991/92, 
1995/96, 1998/2000, 2004/2005, and 2008-11, resulted in precipitous crop losses, livestock 
deaths, spikes in food prices, increased food insecurity and malnutrition for the poor, and led to 
rural population displacement (temporary migrations). Two noteworthy extreme climate events 
are the 1998 El Nino and the 2009 drought, which resulted in a combined total cost of US$2.8 
billion (about 7 percent of the 2010 GDP equivalent).   Frequent droughts also make Kenya 
significantly food insecure.  In 2015, it ranked 83rd of 109 countries, on the Global Food Security 
Index (GFSI).   Kenya is also highly vulnerable to climate change risks. The Center for Global 
Development ranks Kenya 13th out of 233 countries globally for ?direct risks? due to ?extreme 
weather? and 71st out of 233 for ?overall vulnerability? to climate change, even when adjusted 
for coping ability.  
 
10. Kenya?s average annual temperatures increased by 1Â°C between 1960 and 2003 , and 
by 1.5Â°C in the country?s drier regions.   Climate change is projected to reduce agricultural 
yields and livestock productivity, worsening the effect of climate shocks on the food system. 
Agriculture in Kenya is largely (98 percent) rain fed and thus extremely vulnerable to increasing 
temperatures and droughts.  Estimates of crop yield and livestock losses will vary greatly, but 
most global climate models project severe and adverse consequences, especially for the most 
food-insecure regions.  In Kenya, studies also show that by 2030, under a business as usual 
scenario, climate change will most likely reduce yields of staple crops (by 12 percent in maize, 23 
percent in rice, and 13 percent in wheat).  Crop land suitability is also expected to change, 
especially in wheat and maize. Depending on the region and types of production systems, water 
scarcity will result in less productive pastures, lower dairy yields, and higher risk of the spread of 
diseases.   
 
11. Climate change will exacerbate the vulnerability of Kenya?s agricultural sector as 
projections show increases in mean annual temperature of 1Â°C to 1.5Â°C by 2030. 
Consequently, changes in rainfall distribution and more frequent extreme events, such as 
prolonged drought and floods are predicted to result in more water shortages, especially in ASAL 
regions. While precipitation is projected to increase between 0.2 and 0.4 percent per year in 
Kenya, the direction and magnitude of change will vary considerably across regions, and 
warming-induced increases in evaporation rates are likely to offset the benefits of precipitation 
increases in some regions. Meeting this challenge will require both investments in building 
resilience to near-term shocks and in adapting to long-term climate change. In this context, 
climate smart agriculture (CSA) offers an appropriate strategic framework for responding to and 
reducing the adverse effects of climate change.  
 
12. Agriculture is the largest source of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions in Kenya, 
contributing about 58.6 percent to total GHG emissions. Contributions of other sectors to national 
GHG emissions are: energy (25.3 percent), industry (3.2 percent) and waste management (1.2 
percent).   The agricultural sector is also a key driver of deforestation and land degradation, which 
account for an additional 32 percent of national GHG emissions.  Agricultural emissions are 
likely to increase from 20 MtCO2e in 2010 to 27 MtCO2e in 2030, largely driven by livestock 
methane emissions, which account for 96.2 percent of agricultural emissions. Agriculture, 
therefore, needs to reduce its GHG emissions and become part of the solution to tackle climate 
change. The sector plays an important role in sequestering carbon in soil and trees on farms.  It 
has the biophysical potential to offset and sequester about 20 percent of total annual emissions

through improved soil management techniques.   Currently, the world?s soils hold three times 
more carbon than the atmosphere. Soils also have significant potential to absorb a larger amount 
of carbon from the atmosphere than they currently do.  Restoring this carbon to the soil will not 
only sequester carbon from the atmosphere, but also boost productivity, increase water retention 
(leading to greater resilience when droughts occur), bring land back into production (thereby 
reducing pressure on biodiversity and forests), and boost incomes (thereby benefiting the rural 
poor). Similarly, Kenya?s livestock GHG emission intensities (i.e. amount of GHGs emitted per 
unit of product) amongst the highest in the world; this is mainly due to low livestock productivity. 
With the continuing rising demand for livestock products this threatens to become a growing 
problem.  Increasing livestock productivity (e.g., through improved forages and providing 
adequate year-round feed resources) would increase incomes, protect people?s asset base, as well 
as reduce GHG e/unit of product.  
 
13. The proposed CSA project can help Kenya meet the rising demand for food; and attain 
the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of ending poverty (SDG1) and hunger (SDG2), and 
combating climate change and its impacts (SDG13). But this would require investing in 
agricultural technologies, innovations and management practices (TIMPs) that would lead into 
CSA?s triple-win: increased agricultural productivity, enhanced resilience to climate change, and 
reduced GHG emissions. 
 
14. Kenya has a wide spectrum of CSA policies, strategies and plans that would help secure 
the triple-win. The Vision 2030 recognizes the significance of agriculture to its goal of achieving 
an average GDP growth rate of 10 percent per year up to the year 2030. This level of growth will 
be crucial for attaining the SDGs 1 and 2 of ending poverty and hunger, respectively.  Kenya?s 
Agricultural Sector Development Strategy (ASDS, 2010?2020) operationalizes the Vision 2030 
by focusing on transforming smallholder agriculture from low-productivity subsistence activities 
to more innovative, agri-business oriented agriculture. Regarding adaptation to climate change, 
ASDS prioritizes investments in weather information systems, research on drought tolerant crop 
varieties, soil and water conservation, water harvesting, and strengthening integrated pest 
management systems. For livestock, it prioritizes improved management of grazing systems, 
biogas, livestock diversification, and improved breeding of animals.  
 
15. Kenya also has a National Climate Change Response Strategy (NCCRS, 2010) that 
provides a framework for integrating climate change into development priorities. The National 
Climate Change Action Plan (NCCAP, 2012)  operationalizes the NCCRS, and emphasizes low-
carbon, climate-resilient development pathway for the economy that is critical for achieving SDG 
13 of combating climate change and its impacts.  In the NCCAP, Kenya planned for a low-carbon 
Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs) pathway for six sectors, namely energy, 
transport, industry, agriculture, forestry and waste management.  The first activity undertaken 
under the NAMAs process was the analysis of emissions from the forestry and agriculture sectors. 
Selected practices for mitigation in the NCCAP included restoration of forest on degraded lands; 
REDD+; agroforestry; increase tree cover to 10 percent of total land area; conservation tillage; 
limiting use of fire in cropland; rangeland management; improved cook stoves; biogas; and 
management of agricultural wastes. The proposed Project will support these interventions, which 
are aimed at achieving the CSA triple-win of increasing productivity, building resilience to 
climate change, and reducing GHG emissions. 
 
16. The Kenya Climate Change Bill (2014) is about to be approved by the President, after

undergoing a public hearing and passing through the Senate. More recently, Kenya has developed 
a Climate-Smart Agriculture Program (CSAP, 2015?2030), that will be jointly implemented by 
MoALF, the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (MENR), and the Ministry of Water 
and Irrigation (MoWI). The Vision for the CSAP is a ?climate resilient and low carbon growth 
sustainable agriculture that ensures food security and contributes to national development goals in 
line with Kenya Vision 2030.?  In addition, Kenya has a National Policy on Climate Finance 
(2015) that seeks to position Kenya to better access climate finance through a variety of 
mechanisms. With support from the World Bank, the International Center for Tropical 
Agricultural (CIAT) recently developed a Kenya CSA Country Profile. The Profile systematically 
assesses the state of CSA nationally, including agricultural practices that deliver higher 
productivity, improved resilience, and lower emissions. It also assesses the institutional, policy, 
and finance entry points for taking CSA options to scale. The Profile will be an important 
mechanism for building awareness of country options, facilitating dialogue, and helping identify 
high-interest CSA options and opportunities for investments to deliver on the triple win. The 
Profiles coupled with prioritization tools  can provide in depth analyses of agricultural practices, 
detailed assessments of their ?climate-smartness?, and costs and benefits of various investments. 
The ongoing development of County-level CSA risk profiles and prioritization of interventions 
would bring this information to the relevant level of devolved governance in Kenya. 
 
17. At the international level, Kenya has been actively engaged in dialogue on mainstreaming 
climate change into agricultural policies, plans, and actions. The country is a signatory to the 
United Nations Conventions on Combating Desertification (UNCCD), Framework Convention on 
Climate Change (UNFCCC) and Conservation of Biological Diversity (UNCBD). Regionally, 
Kenya is implementing the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme 
(CAADP) Framework (2010) and the East African Community Climate Change Policy 
(EACCCP). Both of these frameworks emphasize sustainable land and water management for 
improved agricultural productivity through research, technology adoption and dissemination; and 
agricultural GHG emissions reduction. In July 2015, Kenya declared its Intended Nationally 
Determined Contributions (INDC) to UNFCCC that by 2030, the country seeks to abate its total 
GHG emissions by 30 percent relative to the ?business as usual? scenario of 143 MtCO2-e. It is 
suggested that US$40 billion would be required to finance the mitigation and adaptation efforts 
across six key sectors until 2030.
Relationship to CAS/CPS/CPF
18. The Kenya CPS (2014-2018) highlights achieving rapid and uninterrupted growth over a 
decade or more as the foundational challenge for Kenya. The CPS indicate that for Kenya to make 
a huge dent on poverty, support for the growth and realization of people?s potential must focus on 
sectors and locations where the majority of the poor can benefit. In rural areas, the single most 
sustainable impact would be to improve agricultural performance, both in terms of increased 
productivity and resilience to shocks, including climate change risks. The proposed KCSAP aims 
at fulfilling two priority domains of the CPS: (i) Domain 2 ? ?Protection and potential for shared 
prosperity?, KCSAP will contribute to Outcome 4 (Greater agricultural productivity), and 
Outcome 6 (Improved capacity to manage risks from Climate Change); and (ii) Domain 3 ? ?
Consistency and equity in delivering a devolution dividend?, KCSAP will contribute to Outcome 
8 (Better provision of agricultural extension services by counties) and Outcome 9 (Adequate 
systems to monitor performance of services delivery by counties). The proposed project is also 
well aligned with current GoK policies and priorities as articulated above.  
 
19. The proposed Project is also in line with the Africa Climate Business Plan: Accelerating

Climate Resilience and Low-Carbon Development. The Plan aims at boosting the region?s ability 
to adapt to the changing climate while reducing GHG emissions through a number of concrete 
actions in various sectors. For agricultural sector, the Plan is focusing on promoting climate-smart 
agriculture, creating climate-resilient landscapes, and promoting integrated watershed 
management. It underscores that there is a range of agricultural management solutions, which can 
improve crop productivity, enhance resilience to climate shocks and reduce carbon emissions.

C.  Proposed Development Objective(s)

Proposed Development Objective(s) (From PCN)
20. The proposed development objective is to increase agricultural productivity and build 
resilience to climate change risks in the targeted smallholder farming and pastoral communities in 
Kenya. 
 
21. The PDO is informed by the CSA concept; one that ambitiously aims to integrate climate 
change risks responsiveness into agricultural development activities. The CSA outcomes are 
increased productivity, enhanced resilience, and reduced GHG emissions. While the concept is 
new and still evolving, many of the practices that make up CSA already exist worldwide and are 
used by farmers to cope with various production risks – particularly droughts and floods. The 
utility of CSA then comes in as a way of explicitly integrating productivity, adaptation, and 
mitigation planning, often done in isolation; and understanding of expected outcomes of CSA 
investments on different users and locations over time.

Key Results (From PCN)
22. Achievement of the proposed PDO will be measured using the following outcome 
indicators: (i) Increased yields of selected crop and livestock value chains (percent); (ii) Direct 
project beneficiaries adopting TIMPs leading to CSA triple-win (percent);  (iii) Increased land 
covered due to adoption of agro-forestry and sustainable land management (SLM)  practices 
(percent); (iv) Improved access to agro-weather, technical and market information by direct 
beneficiaries(percent);  and (v) Direct project beneficiaries (number), of which female (percent).  
A detailed results monitoring framework and indicators will be developed during the project 
preparation, and enhanced by quantitative modeling of uncertainties along the impact pathway .

D.  Concept Description

A. Concept  
 
23. Climate resilient agriculture that increases productivity requires a major shift in the way 
land, water, soil nutrients and genetic resources are managed to ensure that they are used more 
efficiently, effectively and equitably. Making such a shift requires considerable investments in 
ongoing and new technologies, rural/production infrastructure, financing/credit mechanisms, as 
well as improving farmers? access to climatic information and markets. Actions to build climate 
resilience can, in many cases, also mitigate climate change by reducing GHG emissions or 
increasing carbon sinks.  
 
24. Kenya has three main agricultural production systems. The smallholder mixed crop-
livestock system found in areas that receive more than 1,000 mm of rainfall annually (high 
potential zones), spreading from central Kenya, through the central Rift Valley to western Kenya 
and the coastal strip. This system takes the form of a maize-based, dairy production system with 
or without cash crops, such as coffee, tea and horticulture. The crop-livestock-tree production

(Agro-silvo-pastoral) system found in areas that receive between 750 and 1,000 mm of rainfall 
annually (medium potential zones). This system focuses on integration of livestock and crops, soil 
and water conservation, and growing drought tolerant and early maturing crops. In some areas, 
irrigation schemes have also been set up to enhance crop production. The pastoral/extensive 
livestock production system  found in areas receiving 200?750 mm of rainfall annually (low 
potential zones), stretching from north and north-eastern Kenya to the southern parts bordering 
Tanzania. Livestock production, mainly beef animals and small ruminants, are the major 
enterprises under small-scale, but also some large scale ranches 
 
25. KCSAP will primarily focus on supporting interventions aimed at increasing productivity 
and building resilience to climate change, with reduction of GHG emissions as a potential co-
benefit , where possible and appropriate, through: (a) Promoting sustainable, community?driven 
rangeland management and improved access to quality livestock services in ASALs (i.e. in 
pastoral/extensive livestock production systems); (b) Improving water/soil management, 
especially within smallholder maize systems in the marginal rainfall zones (i.e. in smallholder 
mixed crop-livestock, crop-livestock-tree production (Agro-silvo-pastoral systems), and crop-
forest production (agro-forestry)); (c) Supporting the generation and dissemination of improved 
agricultural technologies,  innovations, and management practices, and building a sustainable 
seed system; and (d) Enhancing access to quality climate/agro-weather, advisory services, and 
market information among farmers/herders for improved decision making. 
 
26. KCSAP interventions will be concentrated in selected counties within the crop-livestock-
tree production system and pastoral/extensive livestock production system (mainly in ASALs), 
with high potential for increasing production, but ones that are also prone to droughts. To 
maximize the impact of project interventions, about 15 - 20 counties will be selected using these 
criteria: (a) vulnerability to climate change, extreme weather events, and variable rainfall; (b) 
potential for increasing agricultural and livestock production; (c) current share in national 
agricultural production; (d) climate change projections; and (e) poverty distribution and rates. The 
project design would be informed by the following seven main principles:   
 
(i) Prioritization of promising TIMPs: CSA is very context specific?what is CSA in one 
place is not necessarily CSA in another place?so there is a need to prioritize technologies that are 
most promising for specific places and provide the best value for money. The CCAFS-CIAT CSA 
Prioritization Framework is one such approach that entails a series of activities to filter a long list 
of possible CSA options into a set of best-bet practices and services for an area ;   
 
(ii) Scaling-up promising TIMPs: The Bank and other donor-funded projects in Kenya, such 
as the Kenya Adaptation to Climate Change in Arid and Semi-Arid Lands (KACCAL) and Kenya 
Agricultural Productivity and Sustainable Land Management Project (KAPSLMP) have used 
participatory and community-driven development (CDD) approaches to pilot a number of 
adaptation and mitigation TIMPs including financing options, such as the Payment for Ecosystem 
Services (PES). While existing TIMPs are a good starting point and their broader application 
needs to be scaled up, new technologies must be developed to achieve the CSA triple-win;  
 
(iii) Value chain (VC) approach:  An approach that focuses on developing priority, promising 
agricultural and livestock commodities in the respective counties, through interventions covering 
production, value addition and links to markets will be taken. This approach will look at supply 
chains, delivery channels, and enabling environment issues, to identify and address bottlenecks

and leverage points in the chains. Innovation platforms and methodologies, such as LINK  
developed by CIAT provides approaches for developing innovative business models that take a 
value chain approach and link smallholder farmers to markets; and IFC can finance private sector 
investments, such as in animal health services, commercial-scale bio digesters, solar-pumps, 
micro-and-drip irrigation, seed production and distribution, on-farm storage, weather info/
advisory/climate services, rural credit, and processing facilities; 
 
(iv) Gender sensitivity: Looking at various interventions through a gender lens to ensure that 
the project benefits women as much as possible. Alternative livelihood interventions would be 
primarily geared for women participants. Special care would be paid to ensure that intervention 
do not contribute to increased drudgery and burden for women; 
 
(v) Nutrition informed: Favoring those interventions and leveraging activities that have a 
direct and indirect links with improving the nutritional outcome (dietary/nutrients diversification 
using fruit tree and vegetables ) of the project beneficiaries, particularly women and children 
under the age of five;  
 
(vi) Collaboration with other World Bank Group Agencies: The VC development approach 
will require a close collaboration with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the 
Multilateral International Guarantee Agency (MIGA), which have greater roles to play in 
agricultural value addition, linking smallholder farmers to markets (i.e. inputs, outputs and 
financial markets); and abating political risk for local and international private investors, 
respectively; and 
 
(vii) Complementarity with other interventions: Ensuring that synergies and alignment with 
other Bank-funded projects, such as the National Agricultural and Rural Inclusive Growth Project 
(NARIGP), and the Rural Roads Project (RRP), given that could be operating in the same 
counties, will allow for greater complementarity and impact. 
 
27. Although reduced GHG emissions might be co-benefits, these will nonetheless be 
measured. At appraisal stage, the project will undertake GHG accounting to estimate the impact 
of project interventions against a baseline. It is expected that by improving per unit efficiency, the 
project will have a positive impact on GHG net emissions.  
 
Project Components  
 
28. The proposed project will comprise four components briefly presented below: 
 
Component 1: Upscaling Climate-Smart Agricultural Practices (US$100 million) 
 
29. This component aims at supporting and incentivizing smallholder farmers to implement 
TIMPs that provide triple-wins: increased productivity, stronger resilience and reductions in GHG 
emissions, as co-benefits. It will comprise two subcomponents. 
 
Subcomponent 1.1: Supporting Pastoral/Extensive Livestock Production Systems (US$40 
million) 
 
30. Livestock production is a key contributor to CSA?s three strategic outcomes: (i)

agricultural productivity and food security - animals contribute directly (through meat and milk 
output) and indirectly (through fertilization, draft power) to food production and also to income 
diversification; (ii) adaptation to climate change - livestock represents a diversification asset, a 
coping mechanism for households (risk management tool, that contributes to household 
resilience), and a contributor to the management of organic matter in soils (through manure), 
which improves water retention and drought resistance; and (iii) mitigation - there is typically a 
great potential for reducing GHG emission intensity among low productivity ruminant systems, 
and carbon sequestration in pastures.  
 
31. This subcomponent will therefore support interventions aimed at: (a) increasing 
productivity of livestock (e.g. feeding practices, animal health, herd management and off-take 
rates); (b) promoting integrated soil fertility and SLM practices based on crop-livestock 
integration (e.g., manure management, biogas production, use of crop residues and food products) 
and modern inputs; and (c) supporting market access (e.g., stock routes/migratory corridors, 
watering points, quarantine or holding grounds and animal markets). 
 
32.  In the arid lands, ensuring that pastoralists can access feed and water resources at critical 
times is essential to resilience. Demography and increased pressure on land and water are greatly 
challenging the traditional arrangements through which sedentary and mobile populations have 
managed resources. The project will thus support the development of new management practices 
and institutional arrangements that can secure pastoralists? access to resources, especially during 
drought and the dry season. In the semi-arid lands, interventions may aim at increasing the 
efficiency of animal production (e.g., feeding practices, animal health, herd management and off-
take rates), increasing crop-livestock integration (e.g., manure management, use of crop residues 
and food by-products), and increasing institutional mechanisms and markets for resilience.  
 
33. Interventions inter alia could promote: (i) innovative rangeland co-management (state and 
local community) approaches that leverage customary forms of collective action and economic 
instruments to reward sound pasture management; (ii) development of fodder production, storage 
and marketing; (iii) small-scale fattening operations managed by pastoral communities, to which 
young animals from mobile herds could be sent for fattening before commercialization; and (iv) 
sustainable resource use practices, including  contour ridges and barriers, cisterns for storing 
rainfall and runoff water, controlled/rotational grazing, grazing banks, homestead enclosures, 
residue/forage conservation and other practices ensuring access to feed and water resources 
during drought. ILRI has relevant research outputs to contribute to these interventions.  
 
Subcomponent 1.2: Supporting Smallholder Mixed Crop-Livestock-Tree Systems (US$60 
million) 
 
34. The smallholder mixed crop-livestock-tree systems account for more than 70 percent of 
total maize output in Kenya. Characterized by low productivity, these systems are increasingly 
vulnerable to extreme and variable weather. Thus, achieving national food security will require 
concerted efforts and targeted investments to improve yields and strengthen their resilience. 
 
35. This subcomponent will therefore focus on: (a) improving water and soil management; 
(b) promo ting livelihoods and crop diversification, including drought-tolerant crops (e.g., 
legumes - beans, cowpeas, pigeon pea etc.,), intensive dairy production and agro-forestry systems; 
(c) investing in small-scale irrigation development; and climate risk mitigation initiatives,

including exploring the smallholder adapted crop insurance options.  
 
36. KCSAP support under this component will aim at promoting sustainable intensification 
and increasing climate resilience of Kenya?s small-scale, rain fed production systems. This will 
be achieved through myriad, yet mutually-supportive interventions designed to improve crop 
yields and reduce losses (pre-and post-harvest) in the near-term, and to mitigate climate change 
impacts via adaptation over the long-term. Project interventions will focus on, inter alia, curbing 
rainfall run-off, improving soil nutrition and moisture holding capacity, and strengthening 
fertilizer- and water-use efficiency. This will be achieved via incentivizing broad farmer adoption 
of improved water, soil and land resource TIMPs. To promote income diversification, the project 
will promote take-up of animal husbandry, micro-gardening, agro-forestry and other income 
generating activities less dependent on rainfall. 
 
37. KCSAP investments will be guided by County Integrated Development Plans (CIDPs)  
and community priorities. Integrating project activities within the CIDPs will ensure alignment, 
sustainability and optimization of outcomes. In the case of high agricultural (medium-to high 
rainfall) potential areas in the central and western highlands, interventions will broadly focus on 
improving maize yields and farm-gate prices via quality, drying and storage upgrades. In more 
marginal, more variable rainfall zones, greater emphasis will be placed on stimulating farmers? 
uptake of more robust, drought-tolerant crops (e.g., cowpeas, cassava, millet and sorghum). 
Project interventions will also aim to enhance risk-sharing and strengthen smallholder access to 
markets across target food commodity chains via catalyzing upgrades (i.e. product, process) and 
downstream linkages (horizontal and vertical).   
 
38. Matching grants will be provided to common interest groups (CIGs) organized along the 
VCs to finance community micro-projects. The grants will enable smallholder farmers adopt 
TIMPs developed under Component 2. Making direct payments to farmers conditional on 
adoption of climate adaptation and mitigation practices will lead to better CSA triple-win 
outcomes.  
 
Component 2: Strengthening Climate-Smart Agricultural Research and Seed Systems (US$60 
million) 
 
39. Building strong research capacity and seed systems at the national level is critical for 
achieving the CSA triple-win: increasing productivity, building resilience and reducing GHG 
emissions. Strong and sustained support to agricultural research and development (R&D) can 
have large payoffs as evidenced by R&D?s significant contribution to the impressive agricultural 
growth achieved in Brazil, China and India. More broadly, returns to investment in agricultural 
research have been high and the benefits will only rise as the losses from climate-induced crop 
and livestock systems failure increase. Investments in seed and animal breeds research and their 
market-driven distribution systems will better equip farmers and livestock keepers with timely 
access to quality, affordable seeds (also for forage crops - grasses, legumes, herbage, fodder trees 
and regeneration practices) and planting materials; and animal breeds that respond to their 
specific needs (e.g., higher-yielding, fast maturing, drought resistant, and heat tolerant breeds) 
and that would help them better manage growing climate change risks. This component will have 
two subcomponents ? supporting CSA research and innovations, and building competitive and 
sustainable seed system.

Subcomponent 2.1: Supporting Climate-Smart Agricultural Research and Innovations (US$40 
million) 
 
40. A renewed urgency, and international and national commitment, is needed to sustain CSA 
research to deliver needed science-based solutions. Kenya should act now given that developing 
improved TIMPs can take many years. Developing improved seeds, planting materials and 
livestock breeds that are more adapted to changing climates to meet rising food demand, while at 
the same time reducing GHG emissions will need significantly more investment in agricultural 
research and development.  It also requires commitment to strengthen the Kenya Agricultural and 
Livestock Research Organization (KALRO); build partnerships with international research 
institutes (e.g., CGIAR institutes, such as the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF) and the 
International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI), International Center for Tropical Agriculture 
(CIAT), ICRISAT, which operate in Kenya) and local universities (e.g., University of Nairobi, 
Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT), Moi and Egerton); and 
engage the private sector (contracted extension services delivery model) to facilitate the uptake of 
TIMPs at local levels.  But agricultural research and innovation processes require long-term 
political commitment, financial stability, human resources, and institutional strength. Thus this 
subcomponent would finance activities aimed at strengthening national agricultural research 
system (NARS) and competitive collaborative research grants focusing on CSA research and 
innovations. 
 
Subcomponent 2.2: Building a Competitive and Sustainable Seed Systems (US$20 million) 
 
41. Kenya has one of the more developed cereal (maize and wheat) seed systems in Africa 
with over 70 registered seed merchants. But legume seed systems are poorly developed. Highly 
regulated, the formal cereal seed system produces over 30,000 tons of seed per annum. But only 
supplies about one-quarter of the country?s total seed needs. The remaining supply mostly comes 
from recycled seeds. While robust seed research by KALRO and CIMMYT, among others, have 
resulted in the release of dozens of improved maize and other varietals (e.g., drought-tolerant, 
high-yielding, disease-resistant, and short-season) that can help farmers better respond to climate 
and market signals and manage uncertainty, adoption among smallholders remains low. Even in 
ASAL regions that receive less than 500 mm of rainfall per annum, farmers continue to grow 
maize rather than drought-tolerant crops, such as sorghum and millet.  Such areas could benefit 
more from short duration legumes, such as beans, cowpea and pigeon pea. As a result, the 
productivity of many staple crops (e.g., wheat and maize) remains below regional averages.  
 
42. The project will promote pluralistic seed systems model depending on level of crop 
development. Working with KEPHIS , Kenya Seed Company (KSC), KALRO, CIMMYT , 
ICRAF  and other stakeholders, KCSAP will finance activities geared towards strengthening seed 
research (e.g., seed production and processing equipment, TA and training, grants for community-
level seed multiplication, etc.,), as well as promoting commercially viable multiplication and 
distribution systems to ensure that farmers and pastoralists have access to the right seeds at the 
right time. Specifically, KCSAP will finance interventions related t o: (i) strengthening the 
capacity of KALRO?s research centers/institutes in the production of foundation seed; (ii) 
supporting private sector companies involved in the commercial seed production and community-
based seed multiplication systems; (iii) promoting the use of selected drought-resistant seeds; (iv) 
strengthening seed associations and inter-professional organizations; (v) supporting innovative 
mechanisms of seed marketing; and (vi) strengthening seed policy, production and distribution

strategies and institution al support to the national seed control and certification agency.  
 
Component 3: Supporting Agro-weather, Market, Climate and Advisory Services (US$30 million)
 
43. Improving productivity and resilience of smallholder farmers requires access to timely, 
cost-effective, and personally relevant information on improved agricultural practices, markets, 
prices, inputs, weather?and news of impending disasters. Integrating information on weather and 
markets into planning for CSA interventions and sustainable agriculture development entails: (a) 
use of modern tools for climate data sourcing and analysis, including automatic meteorological 
measurements and satellite data products on a near real-time basis; (b) analysis of weather risks 
and assessment of impacts using advanced crop?weather interactions modeling; (c) formulation of 
highly practical advice that farmers can apply directly to their operations; and (d) dissemination 
of weather and market advisories to farmers using modern information and communication 
technologies (ICT). 
 
44. The quality of these climate and market information services are critically low or non-
existent in many parts of Kenya. Under this component, KCSAP will address this obstacle by 
developing modern agro-weather forecasting and dissemination tools, as well as marketing 
information system to help farmers address the challenges of climate variability and change and 
enhance their resilience. 
 
45. Building on infrastructure already provided to KALRO under the Kenya Agricultural 
Productivity and Agribusiness Project (KAPAP), as well as experiences of BNPP-funded Agro-
weather Tools for Climate Smart Agriculture pilots in Embu, Kenya,  this component will finance 
interventions related to the following: (i) improving agro-meteorological forecasting and 
monitoring; (ii) developing climate-smart, location-specific agro-weather and market information 
system and advisories using ?big data?; and (iii) building institutional and technical capacity for 
agro-meteorological observation, forecasting and market advisory dissemination.  
 
Subcomponent 3.1: Improving Agro-meteorological Forecasting and Monitoring (US$15 million) 
 
46. One of the main obstacles to effective meteorological forecasting is Kenya?s limited 
agro-meteorological observation network. To improve data collection and geographic coverage, 
existing agro-meteorological and hydro logical stations will be upgraded, whilst modern, near real 
time automated weather stations (AWS) will be installed in areas lacking the facilities. KCSAP 
will work with other initiatives that are already in-place to expand the country?s agro-
meteorological and hydrological network to meet international standards. This subcomponent will 
therefore finance the following investments: (a) installation of new AWS, hydrometric stations 
and rain gauges to complement existing weather infrastructure; (b) upgrade and modernization of 
the existing agro-meteorological network and priority hydrological stations country-wide; (c) 
establishment of agro-meteorological centers in targeted counties to improve drought and flood 
forecasts; and (d) development of the Kenya Meteorological Services (KMS) early warning 
system (EWS), and building institutional capacity for disaster preparedness and mitigation.  
 
Subcomponent 3.2: Developing Integrated Weather and Market Information System (US$5 
million) 
 
47. Systems that integrate agro-weather and market information are either non-existent or

rudimentary in Kenya. KCSAP will address this problem under this subcomponent by financing 
activities related to: (a) developing ?big data? for CSA; (b) developing Market Information 
Systems (MIS) and services; and (c) delivering integrated weather and market advisory services 
using ICT.  Big data  crop-weather analytics help farmers in making decisions on what, when, and 
where to plant. Using advanced statistical and data mining/machine learning algorithms,  time 
series data of crop yields will be combined with weather observations at daily resolution  from 
agro-meteorological stations and satellite data,  soil and management factors to reveal climate and 
weather patterns, and detect the limiting factors for crop production. This would subsequently be 
used to generate timely and site-specific recommendations on crop cultivars, soil preparation, 
sowing rate and time, fertilization, irrigation, pest and diseases control, harvest time, and storage 
options. Access to reliable market information from the MIS using ICT empowers farmers to 
obtain and negotiate fair market prices for their crops subsequently improving their income and 
livelihoods. It also reduces their overall risk and results in greater price stability in supply and 
demand, in addition to improving overall market transparency. Using multiple ICT channel to 
reach target users will allow bi-directional information exchange - allowing the collection of data 
from farmers, as well as information delivery to farmers. Rapid and geographically targeted agro-
weather information will be disseminated using SMS and smart phone applications, and through 
more conventional radio, television, bulletins and print messages. Interactive Voice Response 
(IVR) systems that render weather conditions into human speech will also be incorporated. 
 
Subcomponent 3.3: Building Institutional and Technical Capacity (US$10 million) 
 
48. The capacity for agro-meteorological observation, forecasting and advisory dissemination 
needs to be strengthened at the MoALF, KMS, KALRO, and at county governments. KCSAP will 
finance activities related to human and institutional capacity building at these agencies. This will 
include: (a) defining proper configuration of the main elements of the system; including 
automated monitoring, new forecast techniques, big data analytics and modernization of 
management; (b) analyzing and utilizing big data for various purposes; and (c) providing the 
hardware and software needed for interaction of data from a variety of sources in a way that is 
efficient and scalable. Capacity of scientists at national and county levels will be strengthened in 
the area of crop modeling, using both deterministic and statistical models of different complexity 
levels. KCSAP will partner with national and international research and academic institutions to 
provide state-of-art training in agro-meteorology, climate science, including downscaling and 
weather predictions, artificial neural network and machine learning applications, seasonal 
forecasting, ICT, GIS and remote sensing. KALRO?s capacity to implement a national soil 
information service based on soil spectroscopy and remote sensing technology to help target 
interventions and monitor impacts on soil health will be further enhanced . 
 
Component 4: Project Coordination and Management (US$20 million) 
 
49. The Project will be implemented by MoALF with close collaboration with MENR and 
MoWI at the national level and county governments at subnational level. Activities financed 
under this component will comprise coordination, fiduciary aspects, M&E, safeguards monitoring 
and compliance, and day-to-day implementation of the project; and consists of three 
subcomponents. 
 
Subcomponent 4.1: Project Coordination (US$15 million)

50. The purpose of this subcomponent is to ensure that the project is implemented in 
accordance with the Financing Agreement. A Project Coordination Unit (PCU) and a small team 
of experts located at the national and participating county levels will be established. Costs related 
to national and county level project coordination (i.e., salaries of the contract staff, operations and 
maintenance (O&M), office space rental, fuel and spare parts of vehicles, office equipment, 
furniture and tools, among others) will be financed. Safeguards monitoring and compliance will 
be carried out under this subcomponent.  
 
Subcomponent 4.2: Monitoring & Evaluation and Impact Evaluation (US$5 million) 
 
51. An M&E system will be established to collect and process appropriate information, to 
verify the output, effects and eventually the impacts of project activities over time. Baseline 
information for M&E will be collected as part of the preparation process. In addition to the 
routine M&E functions (e.g., data collection, analysis and reporting), it will also finance the 
baseline, mid-point and end of project impact evaluation of the project; and the development and 
operation of the ICT-based Climate Smart Agriculture Information System. Where possible, 
M&E approaches will be harmonized with continental and global efforts (e.g., Global Alliance for 
CSA and the Alliance for CSA in Africa) to build robust and harmonized evidence of the impacts 
of TIMPs supported by the project to achieve CSA triple-win.  
 
Subcomponent 4.3: Contingency Emergency Response (US$0 million) 
 
52. This subcomponent will finance natural disasters risk management (DRM) activities in 
the agriculture sector. The contingency emergence response financing will be triggered through 
formal declaration of a national emergency and upon a formal request from the GoK.  In such 
cases, funds from unallocated category and other project components could be reallocated to 
finance emergency response expenditures and meet crises and emergency needs.  
 
53. The subcomponent will finance the training and capacity building for disaster risk 
management (DRM); community-managed disaster risk reduction (CMDRR) interventions; 
development of an EWS; and response, mitigation, recovery and reconstruction following 
climate-induced natural disasters. Implementation of this subcomponent will follow the 
provisions of the DRM Manual. 
 
54. Annex 3 outlines in more detail some key interventions envisioned under each project 
component.

II. SAFEGUARDS
A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis (if known)
29. The project will be implemented at selected locations on a national scale. The activities will 
be implemented in the rural areas and will include projects in rural infrastructure, such as watering 
points, quarantine or holding grounds and animal markets of fodder production, storage and 
marketing sustainable resource use practices, including  contour erosion and barriers, cisterns for 
storing rainfall and runoff water, controlled/rotational grazing, grazing banks, homestead enclosures, 
residue/forage conservation and other practices ensuring access to feed and water resources during 
drought, agro-forestry projects and hydromet systems/stations.

B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
30. The MoALF will the implementing agency of KCSAP. MoALF will work closely with 
MoENR and MoWI. These ministries have adequate capacity and experience of implementing Bank-
funded projects, including knowledge for implementing World Bank safeguards in the devolved 
context. However, the implementation of previous projects identified a number of significant 
capacity issues in monitoring and enforcement of environmental and social safeguards compliance. 
KCSAP will allocate resources to build the counties’ capacity in for safeguards implementation, 
based on institutional capacity assessment that would be carried out at the project preparation stage.

D. POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional)
Environmental Assessment 
OP/BP 4.01

Yes The initial scoping of the proposed project 
interventions suggests that due to the nature of 
proposed activities, the potential environmental and 
social impacts will be moderate, largely reversible 
and site-specific. The identification mission noted 
that the potential project investments in rural 
infrastructure and agriculture VCs will trigger the 
Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01). 
 
Given that specific micro-project designs and 
locations would not be known at the time of project 
preparation, the project will take framework 
approach to managing safeguards. There are three 
framework reports that will need to be developed by 
GoK: (a) Environmental and Social Management 
Framework (ESMF); (b) Resettlement Policy 
Framework (RPF); and (c) Vulnerable and 
Marginalized Group Framework (VMGF). These 
frameworks will need to cover the types of activities 
envisioned; identify potential impacts of these 
activities; propose screening mechanisms and 
processes of assessing their impacts; and designing 
mitigation measures. The scope of these frameworks, 
the exact implementation arrangements and costs 
will be identified during project preparation. The 
preparation of ESMF, RPF and the VMGF will 
include wide public consultations and will be 
disclosed prior to project appraisal. During project 
implementation, based on the screening, an 
Environmental Assessment (EA)/ Environmental 
Management Plans (EMPs), Resettlement Action

Plans (RAPs) and Vulnerable and Marginalized 
Group Plans (VMGPs) will be developed for 
individual subprojects.

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 TBD Applicability of this policy will be confirmed during 
project preparation, based on the target areas of 
project interventions.

Forests OP/BP 4.36 TBD Applicability of this policy will be confirmed during 
project preparation, based on the target areas of 
project interventions.

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes The project is envisioned use of agrochemicals to 
implement activities such as fodder production and 
agro-forestry projects. A Pest Management Plan 
(PMP) will be prepared to promote the adoption of 
an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, 
which stresses non-chemical pest management 
methods as much as possible, with use of 
agrochemicals only as a “last resort” when  
other methods are not sufficiently effective. The 
PMP would describe specific actions needed to be 
implemented, timeframes, estimated costs, 
monitoring indicators, institutional and beneficiary 
roles and responsibilities etc.).

Physical Cultural Resources 
OP/BP 4.11

TBD Applicability of this policy will be confirmed during 
project preparation, based on the target areas of 
project interventions.

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 
4.10

TBD Applicability of this policy will be confirmed during 
project preparation, based on the target areas of 
project interventions. Should it be confirmed during 
the project preparation that the implementation will 
cover the areas where vulnerable and marginalized 
groups are present, the project will prepare the 
VMGF, which will then guide the preparation of 
VMGPs, where required.

Involuntary Resettlement OP/
BP 4.12

Yes The project activities may require land acquisition 
and may result in the loss of community resources. 
To guide the process of compensation, the project 
will prepare the RPF and publicly disclose it in 
Kenya and in the World Bank InfoShop prior to 
project appraisal.

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 TBD

 Country Context 

1. Pakistan has achieved continued GDP growth and substantially reduced poverty. 
GDP growth was 5.3% in FY16/17, largely owing to gains in the agricultural and services 

sectors. The national poverty headcount declined from 64.3% in FY02 to 29.5% in FY14.  

 

2. Amid these gains, evidence is emerging that Punjab—a major driver of the national 
economy and an agricultural stronghold—is experiencing rising inequality. Punjab accounts 

for more than half of Pakistan’s GDP, and the majority (63%) of Punjab’s population of 110 

million is rural. Although poverty declined even more within Punjab than nationwide over 2002–

14 (from 61% to 25%), Punjab is the most unequal province in Pakistan, with a Gini coefficient 

of 29.7 in FY14. Four out of five of Punjab’s poor live in rural areas, where 8.7 million 

households earn an average of PKR 28,517 per month through farming alone (35%), a mix of 

farm and non-farm employment (31%), and non-farm employment (34%). The average rural 

household has 6.49 individuals but merely 1.66 income earners. Farm size continues to decline. 

Two-thirds of farms were smaller than 2 hectares in 2010 (versus less than half in 1990). 

 Sectoral and Institutional Context 

3. Agriculture is a key contributor to the economy in Pakistan in general and Punjab 
in particular, yet agricultural growth is languishing. Nationally, agriculture—crops, 

livestock, fisheries, forestry—accounts for 21% of GDP, employs 44% of the labor force, and 

directly and indirectly delivers nearly 80% of the total value of Pakistan’s exports (worth about 

US$ 12 billion). Growth is evaporating in the sector; it was 3.3% over the last decade but nearly 

zero in FY16 (0.3%). Crop and livestock productivity are lower than in other Asian countries. 

Except for maize, crop yields have barely risen in decades. In Punjab, where agriculture

contributes 26% of GDP and provides 40% of employment, growth in agriculture has been 

highly erratic as well as low, although the livestock subsector has exhibited encouraging signs. 

Punjab encompasses 72.6% of national cropped area and 77.7% of national irrigated area. 

Approximately 62% of Punjab’s area (20.63 million hectares) is cultivated, and about 60% of 

cultivated area lies within the Indus Basin Water System. The province provides large shares of 

the country’s primary crops: maize (78%), wheat (77%), cotton (73%), sugarcane (63%), and 

rice (52%). The factors limiting agricultural growth include poor adoption of modern 

technologies, poor service delivery, and poorly functioning agricultural markets.  

 

4. Above all, however, flagging agricultural and economic growth in Punjab can be 
traced to current agricultural and irrigation policies. Ample evidence confirms that 

subsidies, agricultural support prices, caps on meat and milk prices, low investment, and 

weakening institutions support investment in traditional crops at the expense of high-value 

agriculture (HVA), discourage efficient water use, and ultimately suppress agricultural growth.  

 

5. Subsidies dominate public spending on agriculture in Punjab. These subsidies—US$ 
1.25 billion in FY17 (Table 1)—are largely regressive, generate significant negative 

environmental externalities, and focus almost exclusively on major crops rather than HVA. The 

provincial government (GoPunjab) pays more than 40% (US$ 515 million) of these subsidies, 

which are about 2.5 times higher than the funding for agriculture in the provincial Annual 

Development Plan (ADP). Not all of this largesse reaches the producer; for example, a 

substantial share of fertilizer subsidies benefits fertilizer companies and the bulk of wheat 

subsidies goes to banks. Few subsidies target small-scale producers.

Total subsidy on electricity for tubewells is US$ 257 million, and 85% of tubewells are located in Punjab. e Total subsidy for imported fertilizer 
is budgeted at US$ 48 million, of which 70% can be assigned to Punjab. f Total subsidy is US$ 14.3 million, of which 70% is Punjab. 

 

6. The costs of current policies and subsidies extend beyond their fiscal cost. Because 
most subsidies are embodied in inputs or input prices, they promote excessive or imbalanced use 



3 

 

of inputs such as water and fertilizer, resulting in negative externalities and sustainability issues 

(for instance, salinity, sodicity, and waterlogging from water pumping or overuse have degraded 

about 25% of formerly fertile land in Punjab). Wheat subsidies are embodied in the wheat price, 

which is governed by a procurement price set far above import parity, to the detriment of net 

wheat buyers (Box 1). Current policies and subsidies encourage farmers to produce more of the 

same surplus commodities rather than to provide a more diverse range of other products 

demanded by the market. Ninety percent of the cropped area in Punjab remains under major 

crops (dominated by wheat), while only nine percent is planted to higher-value crops. Significant 

benefits are sacrificed by this misallocation of resources: export earnings; the jobs that would 

otherwise be created downstream through value chains; the value added by agro-processing 

beyond milling alone; the higher incomes for producers; the production of nutrient-dense crops 

that reduce malnutrition; and the efficiencies in water use that promote diversification, 

sustainable use of scarce water (Box 2), and resilience to climate shocks and climate change. 

 

Box 1: The high costs of wheat procurement in Punjab  

Since the late 1950s, the government has purchased up to 25% of the wheat crop and up to 50% of the marketed 

wheat surplus. The costs of this procurement system are passed on to urban consumers and to the rural poor who 

are net buyers of wheat. Patronage and rent-seeking are endemic, particularly in the distribution of gunny bags, 

delivery of wheat to purchase points, and releases to flour mills). The system has other enormous costs. The 

direct costs of buying, storing, and releasing wheat at a fixed price over the year are estimated at US$ 333 million 

per year, of which more than 90% consists of interest payments on current borrowing and accumulated debt. As 

of July 2017, the wheat debt of GoPunjab to the State Bank of Pakistan stood at US$ 3.36 billion, against a 

collateral wheat stock worth half of that amount at best. Efforts to dispose of excess wheat stocks in export 

markets have been largely unsuccessful, despite generous export subsidies. Indirect costs include physical losses 

owing to poor storage, high spoilage, and pilferage; over-production of wheat and the consequent under-

production of higher-value commodities; diversion of credit from the banking system; and a lack of incentives for 

private actors to build storage facilities that could also serve other crops. The high procurement price has caused 

wheat production to surpass domestic needs, even as annual average per capita consumption of wheat continues 

to decline. 

 

Box 2: Irrigation price policy and inefficient water use in Punjab 

Irrigation has delivered notable agricultural productivity gains to Punjab in the past, but the irrigation sector 

suffers from major financial deficits. Water charges (abiana) fail to reflect actual water use or cover maintenance 

and repair (M&R) costs. Abiana rates typically represent less than 0.2% of crop budgets. The flat water rate per 

acre implemented in 2003/04 gives farmers little reason to conserve water and use it more efficiently. At best, 

current M&R spending (about US$ 65 million per year) is one-third of the minimum amount required. 

 

7. Now that Pakistan has achieved self-sufficiency in wheat, it seeks to spur further 
agricultural growth and transformation, a process in which Punjab will have a major role. 

The goal of becoming self-sufficient in food grain (especially wheat) production has long 

underpinned policies, investment priorities, and public expenditures in agriculture, but now 

Pakistan must evaluate options for future growth in light of: (1) the rapid shift in domestic 

demand away from food grains to high-value agricultural products; (2) the significant yet largely 

unexploited comparative advantage for several of those products, which can provide 

opportunities to generate export revenue and jobs; (3) the exhaustion of options for new sources 

of irrigation water (productivity improvements depend on obtaining “more crop per drop”); and 

(4) the need for production systems to become more resilient as climate change progresses. 



4 

 

 

8. Agriculture requires a paradigm shift in Punjab to unlock opportunities for future 
growth. Punjab should restore its agricultural competitiveness through innovations that renew 

growth in on-farm productivity and improve efficiency and quality throughout the post-harvest 

value chain. At 0.18% of agricultural GDP, Pakistan’s public expenditures on agricultural 

research are the lowest in a region that is already lagging others. Most agricultural research 

expenditures still go to food grains and other “major” crops (rice, maize, sugarcane, cotton) 

rather than to high-value crops and livestock products. Few resources are dedicated to post-

harvest management, including value addition, quality, food safety, and nutrition. A high 

potential pay-off is associated with redirecting public expenditures and associated policies 

toward the best potential investments for outcomes, with a focus on reforms in wheat, irrigation, 

fertilizers, and marketing, and concomitant investments to improve service delivery, agricultural 

R&D, and insurance. 

 

9. The rural non-farm sector is a neglected source of overall economic growth for 
Punjab. Half of Punjab’s 14.6 million households are classified as agricultural (5.3 million farm 

households and 2 million livestock households). These farm households on average earn almost 

half of their income from non-farm activities, including agriculture value adding and 

agribusiness. But poor access to and high cost of finance, inefficient markets, limited skills, 

insufficient power (electricity), and a weak enabling environment hinder growth in the rural non-

farm sector, including agribusiness. Most rural non-farm employment (77%) remains informal. 

 

10. Lack of funds limits the size of most rural enterprises and 30-40% of them make 
very small fixed investments. Lack of credit at reasonable interest rates and appropriate 

maturities, is also a key constraint for most rural enterprises including agribusinesses. Major 

barriers to institutional credit include lack of collateral, poor financial records and an inability to 

prepare business plans. 

 

11. In assessing sources of economic and agricultural growth, the issues of gender and 
climate change cannot be overlooked. Agriculture in Pakistan suffers from serious gender 

inequality and discrimination. According to the Global Gender Gap Report 2016, Pakistan ranks 

143
rd

 out of 144 countries for women’s economic participation (labor force participation is 22% 

for women, compared to 68% for men). Agriculture is the main source of income for 75% of 

economically active women in Pakistan, yet women are less likely than men to own income-

generating assets (land, equipment), obtain credit, and exercise power in financial or economic 

decisions. Poor access to new farming technologies and techniques, the lack of female extension 

workers, and high illiteracy among rural women further discourage success in agriculture.  

 

12. Punjab agriculture is increasingly feminizing. The share of female employment in 
agriculture has grown steadily as male employment has shifted to more productive sectors. In 

2014, women accounted for 47% of agricultural employment. Anecdotal evidence suggests that 

women work mostly on small farms and engage predominantly in horticultural and livestock 

production. It is vital to recognize how much of this agricultural work is unpaid (67% in 2014 

based on Labor Force Survey data). The Punjab Livestock & Dairy Development Department 

recognizes women’s primary role in livestock production and has invested in improving the 

capacity of female producers (including training and hiring 45,000 young extension assistants 

http://reports.weforum.org/global-gender-gap-report-2016/economies/#economy=PAK


5 

 

who will work on a part time basis, half of them women), but often women’s significant 

contributions to agriculture are poorly reflected in plans and programs. 

 

13. Pakistan’s climate change risk is magnified by growing water scarcity, uncontrolled 
urbanization, and rapid population growth. The Global Climate Risk Index places Pakistan 

among the top 10 most climate-vulnerable countries. Pakistan increasingly experiences droughts 

and cyclones; since 2010 floods have caused damages approaching US$ 14 billion. Climate 

change heightens the pressure to manage water resources with utmost care. The melting Hindu 

Kush–Karakoram–Himalayan glaciers could affect water flows into the Indus River system, with 

implications for energy and food security. Agriculture produces approximately 41% of all GHG 

emissions in Pakistan, mostly through livestock production, and Pakistan has a growing 

population with an increasingly animal-based diet. To continue to reduce poverty and increase 

shared prosperity, Pakistan requires technologies and practices for climate-smart agriculture 

(CSA), which will sustainably improve productivity in agricultural systems (particularly 

livestock systems), enhance resilience, and reduce GHG emissions. 

 

14. The proposed SMART Punjab Program aligns with the World Bank objectives of 
private sector development and inclusion in the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 

(FY2015–19) and the twin goals of ending extreme poverty and promoting shared 

prosperity. The CPS recognizes that proper water resource management is the next key 

development challenge in Pakistan, particularly Punjab. The SMART Punjab Program 

specifically supports CPS Outcomes 2.2 (Increased Productivity in Farms), 3.1 (Increased 

Financial Inclusion for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Women), 3.2 (Reduced 

Vulnerability for Groups at Risk), 4.1 (Improved Public Resources Management), and 4.4 

(Adoption of Performance and Transparency Mechanisms in Selected Institutions). The Pakistan 

Performance and Learning Review 2015–20 approved by the Board on June 15, 2017 also 

recognizes the need for additional attention to agricultural productivity and creating markets for 

high value commodities. 

 

15. A Program for Results (PforR) is the most suitable instrument for the SMART 
Punjab Program. A coherent package of policy change, institutional strengthening, and 

reorientation of public investments in agriculture is required to attain fundamental improvements 

in the policy regime, stronger institutions in the agricultural sector, and improved post-harvest 

value addition through increased private investment in agribusiness. The PforR instrument 

appears uniquely suited for delivering this kind of package through a clearly articulated results 

chain, while further building the GoPunjab’s capacity and deepen and develop its own systems. 

The US$300 m provided by the PforR will be co-financing a much larger government program 

of US$1.6 billion This PforR mobilizes experience from World Bank Global Practices and 

solution areas (Agriculture, Trade & Competitiveness, Water, Social Development, Environment 

& Natural Resources, disaster risk management/climate change) and the International Finance 

Corporation. Although the PforR is a comparatively new instrument, GoPunjab is familiar with it 

under the Bank-supported Jobs & Competitiveness PforR (P155963). 

 Program Scope 
 

16. The GoPunjab program for agriculture and rural transformation (the “broader 
Government program”) emphasizes enabling productivity, increasing competitiveness in 



6 

 

agricultural marketing and trade, and enhancing resilience as reflected in planning 

documents
1
 and the Medium-Term Development Framework (MTDF). The broader Government 

program is supported by a capital investment for agriculture, livestock, farm to market roads, and 

irrigation of US$3.797 billion over five years (FY18–22), including US$1.145 billion to 

agriculture and livestock. In addition, there is a recurrent budget allocation of US$0.330 billion 

for irrigation M&R and US$0.115 billion for human resources, bringing the size of the 

expenditure framework of the broader Government program to US$4.242 billion. Recall that the 

GoPunjab also spends an estimated US$515 million each year on agricultural subsidies including 

wheat (US$333 million) as part of its recurrent expenditures. 

 

17. The SMART Punjab PforR will support selected parts of the broader Government 
program over a five-year period (Table 2). These selected parts will be referred to as the 

“PforR-supported Program” and consist of 14 out of the Government’s 25 focus areas with a 

focus on increasing crop and livestock productivity, research and extension policy, transition 

towards HVA and CSA, improving the functioning of crop as well as livestock markets 

including food safety, livestock breed and preventive care, agribusiness, and enhancing resilience 

and inclusiveness. 

 

18. There are several GoPunjab investments that are part of the broader Government 
program but not part of the PforR-supported Program. These include the Extension 2.0 

program; agricultural finance, mechanization and education; livestock census, feed, marketing, 

and women programs; government farms and experiment stations; the on-going rural roads 

program; development and rehabilitation of irrigation infrastructure; and on-farm water 

management (including high-efficiency irrigation systems) which is already funded by the Bank 

through the Punjab Irrigated-agriculture Productivity Improvement Project (PIPIP – P125999). 

 

19. The SMART Punjab PforR will help the government promote transformational 
change in the crop and livestock subsectors by focusing on activities contributing to three 

Results Areas: (1) increased on-farm productivity and value of agriculture and livestock; (2) 

increased value addition and competitiveness of agriculture and livestock; and (3) enhanced 

resilience of smallholder farmers to climate change and natural disasters. Each Results Area 

involves a specific combination of policy reforms, institutional strengthening, and public 

investments.

 Program Development Objective 
 

20. The development objective for the SMART Punjab Program (referred to here as the 
“Program Development Objective” or PDO) is to increase the productivity of crop and livestock 

farmers, improve their climate resilience, and foster agribusiness development in Punjab. Box 3 

lists the PDO-level indicators by Results Area. 

Box 3: PDO-level indicators for the SMART Punjab Program, by Results Area 

Results Area 1—Increased on-farm productivity and value of agriculture and livestock 

PDO Indicator 1: Farmers reached with agricultural assets or services 

PDO Indicator 2: Annual increase in Punjab AgGDP 

Results Area 2—Increased value addition and competitiveness of agriculture and livestock 

PDO Indicator 3: Beneficiaries reached with financial services 

PDO Indicator 4: Number of private wholesale markets and collection centers established 

Results Area 3—Enhanced resilience of smallholder farmers to climate change and natural disasters 

PDO Indicator 5: Number of farmers covered by agricultural insurance 

PDO Indicator 6: Number of farmers adopting CSA packages 

PDO Indicator 7: Improvement in irrigation water service delivery 

 

21. To achieve the PDO, the SMART Punjab PforR supports the implementation of a 
coherent package of policy reforms, institutional change, and reorientation of public 

resources toward productive public investments and smart subsidies. Specific key reforms 

include a shift from universal to targeted subsidies through an E-voucher Scheme for 

smallholders (< 5 hectares), modernization of wheat marketing by phasing out public wheat 

procurement, reducing strategic wheat reserves from 4 million metric tons (MT) to 1 million MT, 

removing distortions in output markets for crops and livestock products, and reforming 

provincial crop and livestock research. SMART Punjab will also improve the financial 

sustainability and efficient use of irrigation systems, promote agribusiness, and improve the 

resilience of producers by designing and implementing an area yield index-based crop insurance 

system, which could potentially leverage access to production credit. 

 

22. Progress toward each of the three Results Areas that contribute to the PDO will be 
measured through 12 Disbursement Linked Indicators (DLIs). Each DLI involves one or 

more specific actions required for agricultural and rural transformation in Punjab. Each DLI was 

selected based on: (1) the criticality of the activity, output, or outcome in the results chain; (2) 

the need to introduce a financial incentive to deliver the activity, outcome, or output; (3) 

measurability and ease of verification; and (4) the capacity of GoPunjab to achieve the DLIs over 

the period that SMART Punjab is implemented. Table 4 represents the Results Area and brief 

description of DLI.  

 

23. The four DLIs under Results Area 1 (increased on-farm productivity and value of 
agriculture and livestock) will be achieved by supporting SMART reforms in the policy regime 

for agriculture (crops and livestock) and reorienting public expenditures from subsidies toward 

targeted investments to improve crop and livestock productivity.  
 DLI 1: Improving access to quality farm inputs. Better targeting of subsidies, particularly for fertilizers, to 

small-scale farmers would increase overall production; it would also help smallholders to close the yield gap 



11 

 

with larger producers and reduce poverty. This DLI will be measured by tracking the number of small farmers 

(<5 hectares) enrolled in the E-voucher Scheme for fertilizers. 

 DLI 2: Revitalizing provincial crop and livestock research and extension systems. A comprehensive, 
strategically relevant policy for agricultural and livestock research and extension will be designed. Over time, 

funding for public research would increase (measured as the percentage of AgGDP spent on research), along 

with the role of the private sector (measured by the composition of the Punjab Agriculture Research Board and 

the percentage of research grants awarded on a competitive basis).  

 DLI 3: Improving livestock health and breeding. Resources will shift from curative to preventive animal 
healthcare (measured by the ratio of expenditures on preventive and curative medicine) to reduce losses to 

disease. Good breeding stock is essential to improve productivity (measured by the number of breeding animals).  

 DLI 4: Modernizing the wheat marketing system and transitioning to high-value agriculture. Deregulating 
the wheat market would reduce wheat and flour prices and free land for HVA (substantially raising farm incomes 

and employment)—measured by the official notification that GoPunjab is withdrawing from the wheat market, 

subsequent phasing out of government wheat procurement, and the percentage of the Agriculture allocation in 

the ADP to HVA schemes. An additional measure is approval of the Punjab Agriculture Policy, which is 

expected to provide further strategic directions for agricultural policy.  

24. The four DLIs under Results Area 2 (increased value addition and competitiveness 
of agriculture and livestock) will be achieved through policy and institutional reforms, as well 

as by marshalling public support for private investors, mainly through a matching grant scheme. 
 DLI 5: Providing incentives to agribusiness for investment in value addition. SMART Punjab will contribute 

US$ 10 million to an Agribusiness and Innovation Fund to be set up by GoPunjab. The fund will award matching 

grants, with particular consideration for women and young people, on a competitive basis (measured by the 

number of matching grants awarded for agribusiness). 

 DLI 6: Deregulating the livestock sector. Removing meat and raw milk price caps (measured by the 
discontinuation of notification of meat and milk prices) would stimulate production and marketing of better 

quality and safer livestock products, raising producers’ incomes and increasing supplies for urban areas.  

 DLI 7: Modernizing agricultural markets. Reforming wholesale market legislation to allow greater private 
sector participation and enhance transparency (measured by approval and notification of the Punjab Agricultural 

Marketing Regulatory Authority Act) would reduce margins taken by middlemen and commission agents and 

reduce the government’s role in controlling these markets.  

 DLI 8: Improving food safety. Better food and agricultural standards, backed by testing and enforcement 
mechanisms, would improve the quality of food products and public health, and address concerns about 

contaminated or adulterated products. This DLI will be measured by tracking progress in establishing and 

operationalizing a provincial food testing reference laboratory as well as regional and mobile laboratories.  

25. The four DLIs under Results Area 3 (enhanced resilience of smallholder farmers to 
climate change and natural disasters) will be achieved by improving the management and 

sustainability of water resources, designing and extending the coverage of improved agricultural 

insurance products for different kinds of producers, and public investment in CSA. 
 DLI 9: Improving sustainability of irrigation M&R. More equitable access to water and better assessment and 

collection of abiana would encourage producers to use water more efficiently with no increases in overall water 

use, and increase funds for M&R. Adoption of a provincial water policy and groundwater act are important first 

steps in addressing the overexploitation of water, falling groundwater tables, and increasing salinization. This 

DLI would be measured by approval of the Punjab Water Policy, notification of the 2017 Punjab Groundwater 

Act, improvements in the area assessed for abiana, tracking abiana collection rates, and water delivery 

performance ratios (defined as actual amount of water delivered divided by amount delivered as per canal 

design, measured at different points along the canal and relative to the delivery performance at the head of the 

canal). 

 DLI 10: Rolling-out an agricultural insurance system. Crop insurance can help crop producers stabilize 
incomes and sustain resilience when natural events deplete harvests. The World Bank submitted a feasibility 

report detailing a suitable crop insurance scheme to GoPunjab in July 2017. This DLI will be measured by 

official government approval of the report, development and notification of a workplan aligned with the report’s 

recommendations, piloting a crop insurance scheme in two districts, and rolling out the scheme in all districts.  



12 

 

 DLI 11: Increasing public investment in CSA. Enhancing public investment in CSA would help farmers adopt 
new technologies and approaches and reduce potential losses related to climate change, measured by tracking the 

percentage allocation of Agriculture in the ADP for CSA schemes. 

 DLI 12: Communications, capacity building, and monitoring and evaluation (M&E). A substantial 
communications strategy and capacity-building program will mobilize support for agricultural and rural 

transformation among stakeholders into the future. Strengthening M&E capacity in participating departments 

will facilitate monitoring of progress. This DLI will be measured by development and implementation of annual 

capacity development plans. 

 

 Environmental and Social Effects 

26. An Environmental and Social Systems Assessment (ESSA) was prepared for 
SMART Punjab. The assessment incorporates feedback from all stakeholders (governmental, 

non-governmental, producers) and presents recommendations and actions to address 

environmental and social risks associated with the Program. The main actions are included in the 

PAP and some of these constitute dated legal covenants. 

 

27. Environmental risks are Moderate. In general, the expected environment impacts from 
Program activities are assessed as medium to low. Environmental concerns include the 

possibility of increases in use of chemicals due to the shift from conventional crops to HVA; 

institutional capacity for effective environmental management; and environmental compliance 

by micro and small enterprises and food safety testing laboratories. SMART Punjab promulgates 

reforms and related actions that promote balanced fertilizer use, improved water resource 

regulation and efficiency, increased land productivity, agricultural insurance, and CSA. The 

Program is not expected to support large infrastructure except wheat storage facilities which are 

subject to EIA preparation. The Program will involve no expansion of the irrigation network but 

rather promote water resource efficiency. The Program will also not support expansion of 

agricultural land but contribute to increased land productivity. Improvements in animal health 

combined with deregulation of livestock prices would benefit public health. Improvements in 

animal breeding will relieve pressure on rangelands. Crop residue burning and application of 

untreated wastewater for irrigation are important environmental issues related to agriculture but 

not targeted by the proposed Program. 

 

28. Social risks are Substantial. The key social risks include (i) access to program benefits 
for vulnerable and marginalized groups, and (ii) potential social conflict. Smallholders and 

marginalized or vulnerable groups may find accessing some elements of SMART Punjab more 

challenging than other stakeholders — e.g. HVA, the E-voucher scheme, and matching grants. 

These groups may require special support, ranging from technical assistance, training, two-way 

communication, and social mobilization strategies. Phasing out of the wheat procurement system 

while lowering the wheat price thus benefiting the >90% of households who are net wheat 

buyers, may face strong opposition from large wheat growers. The Bank has agreed to provide 

significant technical assistance to assist the Food Department in mitigating social risk associated 

with wheat market reform. Attempts to improve abiana assessment and increase abiana 

collection are likely to meet resistance. Removal of price caps while having beneficial impacts 

on public health and incomes of livestock owners (most of them women), may also negatively 

impact consumption of fresh milk in low income households, unless preceded by an engagement 

strategy in which stakeholders are informed of the benefits of deregulation well in advance and 

milk producers can move towards increasing supply capacity in anticipation of better prices. An 



13 

 

effective conflict mitigation and awareness strategy must be in place to ensure that reforms do 

not lead to marginalization and conflict. No significant land acquisition is envisioned under the 

Program. 

 

29. With regard to grievance redress mechanisms, communities and individuals who 
believe that they are adversely affected as a result of a Bank-supported PforR operation, as 

defined by the applicable policy and procedures, may submit complaints to program grievance 

redress mechanisms or the World Bank Grievance Redress Service. The Grievance Redress 

Service ensures that complaints are promptly reviewed to address pertinent concerns. Affected 

communities and individuals may submit their complaint to the Bank’s independent Inspection 

Panel, which determines whether harm occurred or could occur as a result of the Bank’s non-

compliance with its policies and procedures. Complaints may be submitted at any time after 

concerns have been brought directly to the World Bank's attention, and Bank Management has 

been given an opportunity to respond. To submit complaints to the World Bank’s corporate 

Grievance Redress Service, visit www.worldbank.org/grs. To submit complaints to the World 

Bank Inspection Panel, visit www.inspectionpanel.org.  

 

30. In sum, although the proposed operation will undertake or support no activities of high 
risk from an environmental or social perspective, and although federal and provincial 

environmental and social management systems are appropriate, social management procedures 

require strengthening with respect to gender and the poor, conflict management, and two-way 

public engagement. Certain departments need to strengthen their grievance redress systems. The 

Environmental Section of P&D should be strengthened because P&D, having primary 

responsibility for coordinating and monitoring the Program, is in charge of environmental 

screening. For activities that require an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) or an Initial 

Environmental Examination (IEE), the relevant implementing agencies should coordinate with 

District Environment Officers. 

 Financing 

31. The financing framework for the activities under the three Results Areas includes 
two sources of finance: (i) GoPunjab budget; and (ii) SMART Punjab PforR (Table 3). 

32. In addition, a significant portion out of 
GoPunjab’s spending on subsidies is expected to 

be diverted towards investment in agriculture 

and livestock when the program is fully 

implemented by 2021. The GoPunjab has already 

substantially increased the capital investment 

allocation for agriculture and livestock in 

anticipation of such savings becoming available. 

33. Budgetary allocations for agriculture and livestock are considered sufficient and 
together with acceptable historical budget execution rates provide enough confidence that 

the intended results of the SMART program will be achieved. The government’s expenditure 

framework is sufficiently aligned with the SMART program to achieve the intended results.

 Program Institutional and Implementation Arrangements 

34. The Departments of Agriculture, Livestock & Dairy Development, Food, Irrigation, 
Industries, Finance, and P&D are responsible for implementing the SMART Punjab 

Program. Each department will have a dedicated Program Delivery Unit (PDU) or a Focal 

Person, depending upon the workload. Each PDU will include current departmental staff, 

supplemented by consultants as needed. Some departments have dedicated PDUs; others will 

establish them.
2
 The Member Agriculture (P&D Department) will act as the Program 

Coordinator for SMART Punjab in the Program Coordination and Monitoring Unit (PCMU), 

assisted by the Chief Agriculture as Deputy Manager. The PCMU which has been established 

under the Punjab Resource Management Program in the P&D Department and also coordinates 

the Jobs & Competitiveness PforR, will coordinate with the seven implementing agencies, 

monitor and evaluate implementation, and report to the Bank in accordance with the terms and 

conditions of the Financing and Program Agreements. It will consolidate reports of all 

implementing agencies and communicate them to the Bank; to do so, it will develop a standard 

template for monitoring and reporting progress. The PCMU will also coordinate with the 

Independent Verification Agency for verifying achievement of DLIs and reporting, and will 

establish an Assignment Account to manage technical assistance funding supported by the 

PforR. The Finance and P&D Departments will ensure that PforR resources are adequately 

budgeted for in their annual budget and disbursed in line with the expenditure framework to 

accomplish the DLIs.   

 

35. A SMART Steering Committee (SC) was established in September 2016. The SC has 
played a constructive role throughout preparation, especially in guiding and confirming policy 

reforms and institutional changes. Headed by the Chief Minister, Punjab, it includes 

administrative heads from all implementing agencies, other key stakeholders, and representatives 

from the Bank (including the Senior Director and Country Director) as observers. The SC will 

provide strategic guidance and direction, facilitate coordination between the seven implementing 

agencies, and oversee progress in all three Results Areas and DLIs on a quarterly basis as 

reported by the PCMU. To ensure effective implementation, the SC may refer any major 

implementation challenge or matter requiring a policy decision for guidance to the three high-

level committees (Secretaries’ Committee, Commissioners’ Conference, and DCO Committee) 

chaired by the Chief Secretary. 

 

36. SMART Punjab will coordinate and collaborate with other programs. It will create 
synergies with Bank projects in Punjab—including the Punjab Irrigated-agriculture Productivity 

Improvement Project (PIPIP) and the Jobs & Competitiveness PforR (P155963)—and operations 

of development partners.
3
 National entities with supporting roles include: (1) the Auditor 

                                                 
2
 The Agriculture Delivery Unit (ADU) will act as PDU in the Agriculture Department; the Statistical Planning and Reform Unit will act as PDU 

in the Irrigation Department; and the Food and Livestock & Dairy Development Departments will establish PDUs or (in the case of the Industries 

and Finance Departments) Focal Persons before appraisal. At a minimum, PDUs will be staffed by a Procurement Specialist, Financial Specialist, 

Communications Specialist, M&E Specialist, and Internal Audit Specialist, aside from the appropriate technical specialists. PDUs are responsible 
for procurement (tender documents, advertising, bid evaluation and award of contracts), FM, internal audit, communications, M&E, and 

environmental and social management. PDUs will report as required to the PCMU, including: (1) an annual investment plan for their department; 

(2) Terms of reference (ToRs) for consultancy services; (3) an annual procurement plan; (4) reports on implementation progress for each DLI 
under the Program; (5) Program Financial Statements, including procurement, if any; (6) internal audit reports; and (7) implementation of the 

communications strategy. 
3
 For example, the Food and Agriculture Organization (with the recently approved Technical Cooperation Project—Support for the formulation 

of projects for Strengthening Markets and Rural Transformation (SMART) Initiatives in Punjab, Pakistan), USAID (particularly the Punjab 



16 

 

General of Pakistan for the annual external audit of the Program; (2) the Punjab Public 

Procurement Regulatory Authority, which will provide technical guidance on public 

procurement and monitor compliance with procurement standards and practices; and (3) the 

National Accountability Bureau, which will investigate complaints on fraud and corruption (if 

any) relating to the Program.

B. Introduction and Context

Country Context
India in recent years witnessed impressive economic growth and poverty alleviation. During the 
past decade, India's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew at 7.6% annually and poverty incidence 
reduced on average by 1.5 percentage points per year during 2005-10. Also,improvements in key 
development indicators have been remarkable: life expectancy increased from 31 years in 1947 to 
68 years in 2015 and adult literacy increased from 18% in 1951 to 71% in 2015. 
 
Despite such impressive progress in economic growth, poverty alleviation, and improved human 
development indicators, India remains home to 263 million poor people (80% of whom reside in 
rural areas) living on less than US$1.90/day and the country is still at the bottom of the group of 
middle-income countries. To address these challenges, the Government of India (GoI) through its 
12th Five-Year Plan (FY2013-17) put forward an ambitious goal for economic growth, poverty 
reduction, job creation, and environmental management. The plan foresees during this period an 
annual GDP growth of 8.2%, a reduction in poverty rate by 10 percentage points, and 50 million 
of new jobs.
Sectoral and Institutional Context
Tamil Nadu is the second largest state economy in India with one of fastest growth rates: over the 
past three years its Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) grew at 9.2% per annum.  The average 
annual per capita income of the state is around INR 61,500 (at 2010/2011constant prices), which 
is around 42% higher than the national average. Tamil Nadu is also the most urbanized state in 
India with around 48% of population living in cities. 
 
Agriculture and allied sectors in Tamil Nadu account for 12% of the state's GSDP. About 40% of 
state's population is dependent on agriculture for their employment and more than two thirds of 
state's poor people live in rural areas and are engaged in predominately in agriculture activities. 
The majority of farmers are small and marginal with average family landholdings of 0.83 ha. The 
main crops are rice, maize, pulses, groundnut, sugar cane, vegetables, and banana. Rice dominates 
both consumption and agriculture production accounting for 34% of total gross cropped area and 
60% of irrigated area. Due to seasonality and scarcity of water supply, cultivation is mostly 
limited to only one crop per plot per year. 
 
Tamil Nadu is one of the driest and most water stressed states of India with average annual 
rainfall of 925 millimeters, which is well below the national average of 1,200 millimeters. Per 
capita availability of water in the state is around 900 cubic meters a year compared with the 
national average of 2,100 cubic meters.  The agriculture sector in Tamil Nadu is highly exposed 
to climatic risks, especially droughts, floods, cyclones, and erratic rainfall, which have frequently 
affected the performance of agricultural sector in the past. The dry season lasts five months 
(January through May) even in good years, and droughts occur in three out of ten years.  Climate 
change is likely to exacerbate the vulnerability of agricultural sector with increasing erratic 
weather patterns and climatic shifts.  A clear example is the consequence of devastating floods 
that occurred in November-December 2015, which severely damaged irrigation infrastructures in 
three districts and affected Chennai, the capital city of Tamil Nadu as well. 
 
The state is heavily dependent on irrigated agriculture and over the years an impressive inventory 
of irrigation and water infrastructure was built in the state. There are 89 major reservoirs, 39,000 
tanks (traditional water harvesting structures) and 3 million wells. Irrigated agriculture is the

largest consumer of water in the State accounting for 75% of total water usage. About 3 million 
ha of land (54% of total crop land) is under irrigation with different sources of water: 30% of total 
irrigated area is under canal irrigation, 21% is under tank irrigation, and 49% is irrigated by wells. 
 
In recent years the state's agriculture sector has grown modestly at less than 3% per annum 
compared with 6-9% growth of the state's economy. The productivity of major crops has largely 
stagnated:  the current average yields of rice and maize are slightly higher than the national 
average, the average yields of vegetables, cotton, and pulses are lower than the national average. 
To unlock the full potential of agriculture sector growth, there is a strong need for policies and 
programs to focus on: (i) improvement of water use efficiency; (ii) intensification of cropping 
systems and diversification into high value crops; (iii) enhancement of post-harvest management 
and value addition; and (iv) improvement of the resilience of agriculture system in order to deal 
with increasing threats of climate change. 
 
The Bank-supported Tamil Nadu Irrigated Agriculture Modernization and Water-Bodies 
Restoration and Management Project (TN IAMWARMP), which was concluded in 2015, has had 
a significant development impact in the state by modernizing irrigation infrastructure, improving 
water use efficiency, enhancing yields and productivity of agriculture, livestock and fisheries, and 
promoting diversification to high value crops. It also supported the introduction of participatory 
irrigation management in the state and the establishment of water users associations (WUAs). 
Under the project 5,300 tanks and irrigation supply canals were rehabilitated and modernized, and 
2,800 WUAs were established resulting in increases of fully irrigated areas by 39% and water 
conveyance efficiency by more than 30%. The total area under high value crop was also doubled. 
Moreover, the project helped the state improve its water resource planning and implementation 
capacities.  These achievements and lessons learned during implementation of TN IAMWARMP 
serve as a good base for further enhancing the performance of irrigated agriculture in the state 
through the proposed project.
Relationship to CAS/CPS/CPF
The proposed project is fully consistent with the India Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for 
FY2013-17 to support poverty reduction and shared prosperity in India. In line with the pillar for 
Transformation, the project promotes inclusive rural growth, development and dissemination of 
new agricultural technologies, climate-resilient agriculture, enhanced market linkages for small 
and marginal farmers, and improved water and natural resource management. Further the 
proposed project will have a positive impact in terms of environmental protection, and reduced 
greenhouse gas emissions by disseminating high efficiency irrigation systems, and promoting 
diversification into high value crops, which significantly reduce water consumption. 
 
The proposed project will contribute to the Inclusion pillar of CSP by enhancing the livelihoods 
of small and marginal farmers through crop diversification, enhanced market access, and also by 
improving disaster management abilities of GoTN and the local communities through the 
enhanced design and restoration of irrigation infrastructure with better flood protection features.

C.  Proposed Development Objective(s)

Proposed Development Objective(s) (From PCN)
To enhance agriculture productivity, water use efficiency, climate resilience of irrigated 
agriculture and increase post-harvest value-addition for smallholder farmers and agro-
entrepreneurs in Tamil Nadu.

The project beneficiaries are farmers, including small and marginal, water users associations, 
farmer producer organizations, and other entrepreneurs.

Key Results (From PCN)
The key project indicators (KPI) will be: 
 
(i) Increase in water use efficiency (resilience, water use efficiency); 
(ii) Increase in agricultural productivity (productivity); 
(iii) Increase in areas cultivated by non-paddy crops (diversification and value added);  
(iv) Adoption of resilient technologies and practices (resilience); and  
(v) Total number of project beneficiaries (including number of female beneficiaries).

D.  Concept Description

The design of the proposed project will include innovative aspects that build on lessons learned 
from TN IAMWARMP and also reflect the evolving needs of the state when it comes to 
modernization of irrigated agriculture. These include improved designs of irrigation 
infrastructure, stronger focus on the demand-side of irrigation with aim to improve water-use 
efficiency, further advances in agricultural diversification, agri-entrepreneurship, and movement 
toward climate resilient agriculture with relevant agriculture-water related investments and 
substantial improvements of participatory irrigation management practices by beneficiaries.  
Improved resilience of agriculture production systems is expected to be achieved under the 
project through e.g. higher water use efficiency, increased adoption of sustainable technologies 
and practices, and enhanced diversification of production systems. Activities under the project 
will be duly complimented by use of innovative ICT and new media technologies for enhanced 
efficiencies and faster turnaround time for delivering services to project beneficiaries.  As 
requested by GoTN, the project is also expected to finance on-retroactive basis, rehabilitation and 
modernization of tanks and other irrigation infrastructures damaged by the flooding of 
November/-December 2015 floods in three districts of Tamil Nadu. 
 
The total project cost is expected to be around US$454 million, of which the Bank will finance 
$318 million (70% of total project cost) and the GoTN will finance US$ 136 million (30% of total 
project cost). The project activities will cover the entire state of Tamil Nadu (its individual 
components will cover different geographic areas) and will be implemented over seven year 
period.    The project activities would be grouped into three main components: (i) Agriculture 
Water Management; (ii) Agriculture Productivity Enhancement, Diversification, and Value 
Addition; and (iii) Project Management Support. The individual components are summarized 
below: 
 
Component A: Irrigation and Water Management 
 
This component addresses irrigation and water management in a holistic fashion by covering both 
supply and demand simultaneously.  It consists of four inter-related sub-components, including: 
(i) institutional strengthening and capacity building of water management; (ii) irrigation systems 
modernization; (iii) participatory irrigation management;   and (iv) converged service delivery at 
the grass-root level.     
 
Sub-component A.1: Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building of Water Management

This subcomponent aims to assist the GoTN in addressing the pressing water sector issues, 
including: (i) need for integrated water resources planning, bulk water allocations  and 
management in a basin context, involving all water using sub-sectors to improve the efficiency 
and productivity of limited water resources; (ii) need to improve the knowledge base and 
instruments; (iii) need to improve the financial sustainability of water sector assets, and cost 
effective reliable service delivery; and (iv) need to promote participatory irrigation service 
management. These will be done through strengthening of capacities for enhancing policy 
analysis and implementation, knowledge base, analytical capacity, staff mobility, filling of subject 
matter specialists/experts gap, technology induction, office facilities, and related technical/
logistical support.  
 
Sub-component A.2: Irrigation Systems Modernization 
 
This sub-component will modernize irrigation infrastructures, including tanks, and irrigation 
canals.  The modernization of irrigation infrastructure will focus on improving the bulk water 
delivery to irrigation systems through rehabilitation and modernization of approximately 4,800 
tanks, and 477 anicuts in 66 sub-basins out of total 127 sub-basins.  Activities under this sub-
component will be carried out based on individual sub-basin development plans specifically 
developed and tailored to local conditions, and will aim to revive traditional water bodies (tanks) 
that are either part of or outside the state➢❨ s irrigation systems network.  The sub-component 
will finance civil works, equipment, consultancies, training and incremental operational costs 
associated with modernization of the schemes, and the work will be carried out by WRD, and as 
required  with direct involvements of WUAs.  
 
Sub-component A.3:Participatory irrigation Management 
 
This sub-component aims to integrate participatory irrigation management (PIM) practices into 
the operations of the Water Resource Department as a distinct unit within the Department in order 
to improve Operation and Maintenance (O&M) of modernized and rehabilitated irrigation 
infrastructures.  The sub-component will assist in strengthening and establishing new water users 
associations (WUAs), including operationalizing WUAs to undertake O&M, water distribution, 
and asset rehabilitation works within their command areas.  
 
Sub-component A.4: Converged Service Delivery at Grass-Root Level 
 
For effective service delivery to farmers, all departments involved in the water sector need to 
collaborate. This convergence for service delivery will be promoted through establishing and 
strengthening Single Window Information and Knowledge Centers (SWIKCs), and facilitating 
Community Collaborative Water Management (CCWM) at village level. CCWM will sensitize 
local communities about the water situation and enable them to draw community level action 
plans for sustainable use of water in their villages for all water users. 
 
The overall component will be supported by information and communication technology (ICT) 
Innovative ICT and new media solutions coupled with robust monitoring and evaluation systems 
for real time submission of information related to the project activities will be designed, 
developed and deployed under Component A in addition to leveraging on the existing ICT 
solutions developed during IAMWARM.  In particular, specific ICT interventions to be 
undertaken under this components will be:  (i) Operationalization and enhancement of Enterprise

Information Managemenget System platform developed under IAMWARMP through retroactive 
financing and (ii) Implementation of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition systems based 
upon sensors based inputs for automation of at least one canal network. 
 
Component B: Agriculture Productivity Enhancement, Diversification, and Value Addition 
 
The interventions of this component are aimed at increasing productivity, promoting 
diversification of agriculture production systems, and improving farmers➢❨  access to markets in 
project sub-basins. The component will adopt climate-resilient approaches that promote 
sustainable use of land and water resources. The component will consist of two sub-components:  
(i) sustainable intensification and diversification of agriculture production systems; and (ii) 
marketing, value-addition and post-harvest management.  
 
Sub-component B.1: Sustainable intensification and diversification of agriculture production 
systems 
 
Sustainable intensification and diversification of agriculture production systems will be achieved 
through a large scale program of awareness creation and on-farm demonstrations on new seeds 
and promising technologies, capacity building and training activities; and by leveraging private 
sector investments in water management and farm mechanization.  Climate risk resilience will be 
built into crop and horticulture production systems by:  (a) promoting cultivation of short 
duration, high yielding, drought-, pest- and disease-tolerant crops/varieties of pulses, maize, 
oilseeds, millets, vegetables and fruits; (b) installation of micro irrigation drip and fertigation 
systems; and (c) promoting water saving agronomic practices like the system of rice 
intensification and the sustainable sugarcane initiative.  For linking production with market 
demand, farmers will be supported and trained to grow those crops and commodities for which 
significant market demand exists, including a shift from paddy to crops with low water 
consumption in which Tamil Nadu is deficient.  ICT-based leveraged activities will be introduced 
like E-velanmai, Farmer Cropping Advisory.  
 
Animal husbandry activities will aim at improving production potentials of livestock through 
adoption of sustainable and climate resilient animal husbandry practices (including fodder 
cultivation) technologies, strengthening of input, extension, and service delivery systems, 
establishing ICT based MIS and infrastructure strengthening and capacity building in breeding, 
disease surveillance and food safety. 
 
Fisheries activities will aim at improving fish productivity mainly in reservoirs, tanks and ponds 
through demonstration of climate resilient modern technology packages such as: short production 
cycle models involving improved fast growing fish varieties; improved reservoir fisheries 
management; introduction of suitable formulated fish feed using locally available ingredients; 
promotion of innovative technologies such as cage fish culture and pen fish farming in an 
environmentally sustainable manner; and facilitation of suitable market linkages for better access 
to markets.   
 
Related to above activities, the project will finance the incremental requirements of contractual 
subject matter experts and support staff, goods and equipment, consultancies, studies, trainings, 
civil works, and incremental operating costs. The Project will also support the GoTN in 
improving existing policies, regulations, and procedures to achieve a climate-resilient and

sustainable agriculture system by commissioning feasibility studies, preparing detailed action 
plans and implementation guidelines.  
 
Sub-component B.2: Value Addition and Post-Harvest Management 
 
This subcomponent will aim at enhancing farmers' linkages to markets by providing alternative 
marketing channels and improving farm level post-harvest management and value addition.  The 
project will support the setting up of an Agribusiness Promotion Facility, development of farmer 
producer organizations/companies, integration of commercial value chains of agricultural 
commodities, and will facilitate public-private partnerships to enable direct buying arrangements.  
Support will also be provided for modernization and upgrading of selected Regulated Markets 
dealing with project produces and weekly farmers➢❨  markets/rural markets (Varashanthais) on 
cost sharing basis, innovative pilots, institutional strengthening and capacity building of 
Agriculture Marketing and Agribusiness Department. The GoTN is currently in the process of 
amending the Agriculture Produce Market Act of 1987, which would bring in substantial reforms, 
and among others, would create a conducive environment to development of more efficient 
markets with extensive usage of latest ICT technologies. 
 
Component C: Project Management Support 
 
The project will adopt the model of multi-departmental coordination and convergence, and will 
follow the general institutional structure of IAMWARM. The Multi-Disciplinary Project Unit 
(MDPU) established under the IAMWARM will also serve as the management and coordination 
unit for the proposed IAMP, with modifications as needed to be considered during project 
preparation. The MDPU will be responsible for ensuring support to preparation and 
implementation of overall project budget, sub-basin development plans, and implementation 
progress reports by the line departments. The MDPU will provide M&E, procurement and 
fiduciary support as needed to the project implementing agencies. 
 
The activities to be undertaken under the component will also be supported by: i) implementation 
of mobile application and associated back-end software tools for Geo Tagging and remote sensing 
based monitoring of project outcomes and  ii) Implementation of GIS based data acquisition and 
analysis system for studying emission of Methane and other Green House Gases (GHG) in project 
area. Citizen Engagement including Grievance Redressal is to be done by respective department 
as per agreed system.

II. SAFEGUARDS
A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis (if known)
The project will be implemented in 66 sub-basins, including the areas experiencing droughts, floods 
and other climate/natural shocks, particularly in coastal areas. The project activities might  influence 
a diverse set of habitats/ecosystems, including, coastal, plains, hilly, wetlands, rivers and sub-river 
basins as explain below.

B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
The primary implementing agency has developed some capacity in managing social and 
environmental impacts under IAMWARM Project, which is the first phase to this project    but 
remain weak when it comes to monitoring and reporting of environmental and social manageent

aspects. Moreover, officials, particularly engineers, who were engaged in the previous project may 
move out due to transfers and this may require additional capacity building measures for the current 
staff. The implementing agency has some familiarity in preparing secondary data based 
environmental atlas for sub-basins, undertaking minor Social and Environmental Assessments, 
preparing Environmental Status Reports and contracting special studies of the river basins in the 
State. However, the second phase project will cover new sub-basins, a fresh full environmental and 
social assessment would be required for which the borrower will prepare and share with the Bank a 
detailed Terms of Reference. A multi-disciplinary project unit (including environmental and social 
experts) is being set up to facilitate the preparation and implementation of this project and based on 
experience of the previous project, will require additional support of external experts to facilitate the 
assessment both during preparation and then during operational phase for implementing the 
mitigation measures.

D. POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional)
Environmental Assessment 
OP/BP 4.01

Yes Significant physical investments are expected under 
the project and although the nature of these 
investments would be largely rehabilitation of 
existing assets, improper construction could result in 
adverse impacts. An Environmental and Social 
Assessment will be undertaken and an 
Environmental and Social Management Plans would 
be developed for managing risks and maximize 
environmental and social opportunities. These will 
take into account earlier work and experiences of the 
TN WRCP project and consideration of new 
activities proposed in the TN IAMWARM project.

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 Yes This is triggered, as a large number of tanks will be 
rehabilitated, including carrier system, which may 
impact natural habitats, particularly wetlands. 
Careful mapping using remote sensing will be 
undertaken as part of conducting the environmental 
assessment.

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No No impacts on forests are expected and the project 
will not affect existing forest management practices.

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes No pesticides and fertilizers are expected to be 
financed directly by the project; however, there may 
be induced impacts of increased fertilizer and 
pesticide use due to improved agricultural 
intensification and diversification. The project will 
support scaling-up state-wide Integrated Pest

efforts and support for safer and organic food 
production and marketing. A pest management plan 
will be prepared as part of the EA.

Physical Cultural Resources 
OP/BP 4.11

TBD No significant adverse impacts on cultural property 
expected, but this issue will be examined during the 
ESA (particularly in relation to proper management 
of any religious and other physical cultural property 
associated with tanks during rehabilitation).

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 
4.10

TBD A Tribal Mapping of 66 sub-basins to identify areas 
in the sub-basins that are categorized as belonging to 
Schedule 5 areas where GoTN's Tribal Sub-Plans 
and where Forest Rights Act are implemented  will 
be undertaken as part of Social Assessment to 
determine whether or not the OP/BP 4.10 is 
triggered.

Involuntary Resettlement OP/
BP 4.12

Yes Modernization of irrigation systems and 
rehabilitation and required civil works are likely to 
involve involuntary resettlement. Though efforts will 
be made to avoid this, necessary structures and 
processes to mitigate adverse impacts, if any will be 
put in place in the Social Management Plan.

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 Yes The dam safety policy is triggered as some tanks 
may have embankments higher than 15 m, though it 
will be confirmed once tanks are identified. The 
proposed project will draw technical resources from 
the ongoing World Bank funded Dam Rehabilitation 
and ImprovementProject (DRIP) in the State of 
Tamil Nadu, including the participation of the Dam 
Safety Review Panel. During preparation, the 
specific needs for supporting safety of Dams and 
tank systems will be assessed comprehensively and 
interventions needed will be determined. This 
includes the necessary monitoring system.

1. India is one of the fastest growing economies in the world, ranked among the top ten highest GDP countries, and is 

the world’s second most populous country. During the past two decades, India’s GDP grew at an average of 7 

percent annually. Poverty incidence declined on average by 1.5 percentage points per year during 2005–10 and 

improvements in key development indicators have been remarkable. However, following years of impressive 

economic growth and poverty alleviation, India is now at a critical juncture in its paths towards becoming an 

economic powerhouse and is facing important development challenges and structural constraints to a more 

inclusive growth and a more sustainable development. India remains home to 263 million poor people (most of 

which reside in rural areas) living on less than US$1.90/day and the economic growth has not generated jobs fast 

enough to absorb labor out of agriculture and low productivity rural jobs. To address these challenges, the 

Government of India (GoI) through its 12th Five-Year Plan (FY2013-17) put forward an ambitious goal for accelerated 

economic growth, poverty reduction, job creation, and environmental management. The plan foresees during this 

period an annual GDP growth of 8.2 percent, a reduction in poverty rate by 10 percentage points, 50 million new 

jobs – and an annual growth in the agriculture and allied rural sectors of 4 percent. 

 
2. Climate change may impede socioeconomic development within India and increasing investment in adaptation 

measures to reduce vulnerability will be essential to maintaining economic growth. India’s rapid growth has 

increased its prominence on the global stage and drawn attention to its climate mitigation and adaptation efforts. 

The country has shown leadership in global efforts to limit climate change and is among the early countries to have 

ratified the Paris Agreement on Climate Change (in October 2016). Analyses of the country’s historic climate data 

support the extent of the change taking place: an increase in mean annual temperature (0.56°C between 1901 and 

2007), as well as a decrease in seasonal mean rainfall with more frequent extreme rainfall events. Looking ahead, 

temperatures are projected to increase further and at a faster rate than before (by 1.7-2.0
o
C by the 2030s), coupled 

with an overall increase in monsoon rainfall (with an increase in geographic variability) and extreme precipitation 

events (with an increase in rainfall intensity). India shows an increasing trend in its per capita emission of GHGs, 

though current per capita levels are still among the lowest in the world (2.44 tCO2 equivalent per capita in 2012, 

against global average of 5.5 tCO2 equivalent). In absolute terms, India remains one of the largest GHG emitters, 

with its agriculture sector the second largest contributor (around 18 percent of the country’s total GHG emissions).  

 
3. Agriculture sector growth is essential in achieving India’s development goals: the sector currently accounts for 14 

percent of national GDP and is a source of livelihood for more than half of the population. More than two thirds of 

the country’s poor live in rural areas, and their chance of getting out of poverty directly depends on the 

performance of agriculture and allied rural sectors. The success of ongoing massive rural-urban transformation will 

also depend on improved connectivity of rural areas to cities, enhanced agriculture productivity and value chains for 

agricultural products and off-farm job creation in rural areas, which would temper down current massive migrations 

to urban areas. The agriculture sector also has a major potential for reducing GHG emissions and improving 

environmental management through enhanced soil and water conservation and climate-resilient farm management 

practices.  

 
4. Over the past two decades, the agriculture sector has performed below its potential and has not yet met the 

envisaged growth targets. In the 1990s and 2000s, the annual agriculture growth rate was around 3-3.5 percent, and

dropped even below 2 percent per annum during 2013-15, due to low productivity, growing water and land scarcity, 

rising labor costs, and declining international commodity prices, exacerbated by the late onset of monsoon rainfall 

and increase rainfall intensity. While overall rainfall is projected to increase, its distribution over time and space is 

likely to become much more erratic, thereby leading to increasingly frequent droughts and floods. Unless significant 

efforts to capitalize on the projected increase in rainfall are made to improve water conservation and soil moisture 

management, water scarcity at farm level will remain a key impediment to achieving higher levels of crop and water 

productivity. 

 
5. Going forward, five inter-related and strategic shifts are required to achieve the 4 percent annual growth target 

set by GoI for agriculture and transform the sector into a modern food system: (i) a shift away from food grain 

production targets towards diversification into high-value horticulture and livestock products; (ii) a shift away from 

pure focus on physical productivity (yields) towards resilience and stability of agriculture to deal with the effects of 

climate change and short-term weather anomalies; (iii) a shift away  from a focus on on-farm production towards 

value addition in the post-harvest segments of the food value chains; (iv) a shift away from a calorie focused 

production structure towards nutrition sensitive agriculture, and (v) a shift away from increasing irrigation water 

supply towards improved water use efficiency. The proposed project is designed to directly contribute to this 

structural transformation process by supporting several of those strategic shifts with a focus on building climate 

resilience in the agriculture sector in the State of Maharashtra.  

 
Sectoral and Institutional Context 
 
6. The State of Maharashtra is one of the economic growth engines of the country:  it is the top-ranked state in terms 

of contribution to the national GDP (14.4 percent, 2014-15) and has witnessed an average economic growth rate of 

over 8 percent per annum over the last decade. With 9.3 percent of country’s population and 9.4 percent of the 

country’s geographic area, Maharashtra is also the second largest state in India. Structurally, Maharashtra is more 

urbanized and industrialized compared to the rest of the country and economic contributions of the industries and 

of the services sectors are much larger than that of agriculture and allied sectors (which account for only 11 

percent). However, the agriculture sector remains central to Maharashtra’s economic and political landscape, and 

growth in the sector is critical for the state as over 50 percent of its population depends on agriculture.  

 
7. In Maharashtra, agriculture has grown at an annual average of 6.4 percent from 2004-05 to 2011-12, but growth in 

the sector fluctuates heavily and is depending on highly erratic rainfall during any particular year and rainfall 

variability over time. The distribution of rainfall is highly uneven within the state and ranges from over 4,000 mm per 

annum in coastal areas to less than 400 mm in some of the most arid districts. Agriculture remains the highest user 

of freshwater, withdrawing more than 80 per cent of the surface and groundwater (“blue water”) available to the 

state. Since the continuation of the State’s strong economic growth performance would have to be supported by 

higher water availability in all three sectors of the economy, there is a need for Maharashtra to better manage its 

water resources and in particular to enhance the efficiency of the water used for agriculture and focus on increasing 

the availability and use by the agriculture sector of “green water” (rainwater stored in the soil as soil moisture). 

Severe consecutive droughts experienced in large parts of Maharashtra over the last two years have considerably 

affected the state’s agricultural performance and social fabric in rural areas, and have prompted the highest-level 

state authorities to declare “drought-proofing” of agriculture a key development priority for Maharashtra.

8. Maharashtra’s agriculture is dominated by small and marginal farmers with an average farm size of 1.44 ha. Most 

of the agricultural production is rain-fed, with less than 20 percent of the arable land under irrigation. Farmers’ 

annual production covers two seasons: kharif crops planted at the onset of the monsoon rainfall and ravi crops 

planted at the beginning of the winter season. Due to the broad range of agro climatic zones and soil types 

encountered, the state’s agricultural production is fairly diverse. Crop production is dominated by food grains, i.e. 

cereals (mostly rice, sorghum or jowar, maize) and pulses (chickpea or gram, pidgeon pea or tur). For oilseed crops, 

soybean remains by far the most important commodity. Cotton and sugarcane, whose production is relatively 

water-intensive, are the two cash crops most commonly found in Maharashtra’s farming systems (the State is 

among the largest producers of cotton and sugarcane in the country).  

 
9. The area under cultivation for cereals has declined since 2000, with a considerable drop in the production of 

sorghum (though naturally better adapted to dryer conditions than other cereals) and a shift from food grains 

towards cash crops has been observed, with an increase in the area for cotton and sugarcane. Since 2000, an 

upsurge in the production of high-value horticulture crops has been observed, and today, the State of Maharashtra 

has emerged as one of the country largest producers of fruits (mango, citrus, grapes, pomegranate) and vegetables 

(onion, tomato). Overall, crop productivity has increased over time but remains at relatively low levels (2013-14, 

non-drought year:  sorghum 814 kg/ha; soybean 1,214 kg/ha; cotton 361 kg/ha). Yield gaps for several key crops are 

still significant, reflecting the need for a mix of sector policies and investments to promote research on climate-

adapted varieties, irrigation for a more efficient on-farm use of water, and extension services for the adoption of 

climate-resilient agronomic practices and technologies – i.e. for building climate resilience in Maharashtra’s farming 

systems.   

 
10. In 2008, GoI released the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC), and directed the States to develop 

State Action Plans on Climate Change guided by and consistent with the structure and strategies of the NAPCC. The 

GoM took a pioneering step towards formulating the Maharashtra State Adaptation Action Plan on Climate Change 

(MSAAPCC) by commissioning a comprehensive vulnerability assessment study which included the task of 

generating model-based climate projections specific to the State’s geography. The MSAAPCC seeks to address the 

urgent need to integrate climate change concerns into the State’s overall development strategy, thus assisting in 

building long term climate resilience and enabling adaptation to the likelihood of risks arising from climate change. 

The MSAAPCC climate modelling results for 2030, 2050 and 2070, show that temperature and rainfall are projected 

to increase across the State of Maharashtra, with important regional variations – resulting, on balance, in potentially 

significant adverse impacts on agriculture performance.  

 
11. The annual mean temperature in Maharashtra is projected to increase by around 1.3-1.5

o
C by the 2030s; the 

projected increase in monsoon rainfall by the 2030s ranges from 13-30% across the state. These analytical findings 

from the MSAAPCC are consistent with the findings of the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel 

on Climate Change (IPCC). The effects of these longer term climate trends on sectors like agriculture or water, 

effectively signaling a shift in climatic conditions, will be further aggravated by the projected increase in the 

frequency of extreme climate events (droughts, hailstorms, floods, delays in the onset of monsoons, higher rainfall 

intensity) already experienced in Maharashtra over recent past, as illustrated by the 3 severe droughts that hit the 

state over the past 5 years.

12. The GoI has designed a number of policy initiatives and programs aligned with the recommendations from the 

NAPCC program and the state-level action plans, including the National Initiative on Climate Resilient Agriculture 

(NICRA) to promote the development of climate-resilient villages; the Pardhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana 

(PMKSY) Program to promote efficient irrigation practices and improve water use efficiency; the Jalyukt Shivar 

Abhiyan (JSA) Program on watershed and drought management; the Integrated Watershed Management Program 

(IWMP) on natural resources conservation; as well as India’s Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) as 

presented to the COP21 in Paris to address the adverse effects of climate change. Against this background, the GoM 

is committed to further support and implement those policies in Maharashtra and sees the proposed project as an 

opportunity to contribute to the implementation of policies in support of the climate agenda. 

 
13. Higher level authorities in the state of Maharashtra have recently embraced a new paradigm for the agricultural 

sector which now needs to be mainstreamed across institutions and stakeholders. It is built around the recognition 

and understanding of climate change and climate variability as the “new normal”; this in turn, requires a structural 

shift in the approach to sustainable agriculture growth based on longer-term adaptive interventions (reforms, 

investments, capacity development) to build climate-resilience in agriculture – in addition to focusing primarily on 

shorter-term emergency responses to recurring natural disasters. The Bank is very well placed to provide value-

added to the GoM in establishing this new paradigm through its experience with climate-resilient agriculture 

elsewhere, its capacity to work multi-sectorally, and to apply cutting-edge knowledge at scale in support of changes 

in policies and strategies to promote climate adaptation and mitigation, and generate climate co-benefits.  

 
Relationship to CPF 
 
14. The proposed project is fully consistent with the India Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY2013–17 to 

support poverty reduction and shared prosperity in India. In line with the pillar for Transformation, the project 

promotes inclusive rural growth, development and dissemination of new agricultural technologies, climate-resilient 

agriculture, enhanced market linkages for small and marginal farmers, and improved water and natural resource 

management (Outcome 2.4). Further, the proposed project will have a positive impact in terms of: (i) environmental 

protection by enhancing the management of soil and water resources, (ii) reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 

disseminating high efficiency irrigation systems, and (iii) promoting diversification into high value crops (Outcomes 

2.5 and 2.6). The project will also contribute to the Inclusion pillar of the CPS by enhancing the livelihoods of small 

and marginal farmers through crop diversification, enhanced market access (Outcome 3.6), and by improving local 

communities’ ability to manage droughts and floods through enhanced design and restoration of irrigation 

infrastructure with better flood protection features (Outcome 3.8).  

 
15. The project is fully aligned with the Bank’s Climate Change Action Plan (CCAP) which explicitly highlights climate-

resilient agriculture and water management as key priorities for climate adaptation in the South Asia Region (SAR). 

CCAP also advocates that transformative action on climate change requires partnerships with client countries to 

mobilize additional capital for mitigation and adaptation action, which the project proposes to achieve with 

potential co-financing from the GoM as well as from the Green Climate Fund (GCF) through IFC’s 2030 Water 

Resources Program. The project will directly contribute to WBG’s commitment to increase the climate-related share 

of its portfolio from 21 to 28 percent by 2020 in response to client demand.

16. The project is based on a multi sector approach and will require close collaboration across the Bank’s Global 

Practices and Units (Agriculture, Water, Trade & Competitiveness, Climate Change, and Disaster Risk Management) 

in the design and throughout implementation. Close collaboration during planning and implementation will be 

sought with thematically related on-going/pipeline projects and initiatives (e.g. Maharashtra Agricultural 

Competitiveness Project - MACP, P120836; India Climate Change Mitigation Action Support, P162119; National 

Groundwater Management Improvement Program, P158119). Collaboration with IFC is secured through the 

inclusion on the project team of technical staff from IFC’s 2030 Water Resources Group (2030WRG) and efforts to 

develop co-financing arrangements with possible funding from the Green Climate Fund (GCF).  

 
C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  

 
17. The PDO is to enhance climate-resilience and profitability of smallholder farming systems in selected districts of 

Maharashtra. 

 
18. Direct project beneficiaries will be small farmers (households with 1.0 to 2.0 ha of farm land) and marginal farmers 

(less than 1.0 ha), who will gain from knowledge and technology transfer, and access to assets to enhance climate 

resilience on their farms, as well as increased revenue from crop diversification and participation in emerging value 

chains. Farmer producer companies (FPCs) and small and medium agro-entrepreneurs (SMEs) will also benefit from 

the project through climate-resilient investments in value chain development, support with the promotion of 

backward and forward linkages, and access to business development and incubation services. The project will also 

directly benefit local institutions and agencies (e.g. agricultural research and extension, technical advisory services) 

through capacity development on climate resilience. State Agriculture Universities (SAU), various line departments, 

government agencies and other institutions at district and sub district level will also benefit through a strategic 

partnership with the project towards mainstreaming climate resilience in agriculture.  

   
B. Key Results 
 

19. The following Key Performance Indicators (KPI) are proposed for measuring the core outcomes of the project:  

a. KPI #1 - Resilience: Farmers adopting climate-resilient agricultural technologies [Corporate Results 

Indicator] 

b. KPI #2 - Resilience: Area provided with micro irrigation systems [Corporate Results Indicator]  

a. KPI #3 - Resilience: Average on-farm soil organic carbon content 

b. KPI #4 - Profitability: Average farm income  

c. KPI #5 - Direct beneficiaries: Farmers reached with agricultural assets or services (by gender) [Corporate 

Results Indicator] 

 
D. Concept Description 

 
20. Project area. The proposed project will be implemented in the 15 districts of the Mrathwada and Vidarbha regions 

that have been most affected by the recurrent monsoon failures of recent years. These districts account for a total 

population of 30.2 million people and a project area of around 3.5 million ha. Out of a total of 18,000 villages in the 

districts selected, the project will cover 5,000 villages characterized by a high climate-vulnerability index and low 

HDI; this includes about 1,000 villages located in the Purna river basin tract and showing very high levels of soil

salinity and sodicity. Managed spill-over effects are expected for a range project activities and outputs to villages not 

covered by the project. Most of the project area is located in Maharashtra’s semi-arid agro climatic zones. The vast 

majority of rural households in the project districts are small and marginal farmers whose livelihood depends for 

more than 90 percent on rainfed agriculture.  

 
21. Cropping patterns in the selected districts are dominated by cereals (mostly sorghum and millet), pulses and 

oilseeds (soybean). While cotton remains the main cash crop, more and more farmers are growing fruit trees to 

secure their farm income. Unlike in some other parts of Maharashtra where groundwater shortage has become an 

acute problem, in the project area only 55 percent of the total groundwater potential has been harnessed. However, 

poor management of surface water and lack of in situ storage in the project area have aggravated the impact on 

agriculture from the severe consecutive droughts that have hit Maharashtra in the past couple of years. 

 
22. Project rationale and alternatives considered. The proposed project results from a clear understanding at the 

highest level of authority in the state that Maharashtra needs a comprehensive, long-term and systematic approach 

to managing and coping with climate change and variability. In the past, emergency responses to increasingly 

frequent climate events have yielded only limited results: such short-term approach did not significantly boost 

agriculture sector performance, prevent further deterioration of the socio-economic fabric in rural areas (exodus, 

farmer suicides), or lead to an increase in farmer income and prosperity. Thus, given the climate projections that 

indicate severe impact on the agriculture and water sectors in Maharashtra under status quo, the new paradigm to 

addressing climate adaptation and mitigation in the agriculture and food system is essential.  

 
23. In addition to the short-term disaster management approach, a policy-based project approach was considered to 

address the impact of climate change on agriculture. Such approach would aim at reforming policies, including those 

that encourage the rapid expansion of water-intensive crops resulting in the depletion of groundwater resources. 

This approach was not pursued, since the selected project area presents distinct agro-hydrological features (e.g. no 

rice is grown in the project area and the sugarcane grown in the selected districts represents less than 3 percent of 

the state-level production). Importantly, the key policies impacting the selected project area relate to markets, and 

on these, Maharashtra has been among the most progressive states in terms of implementing policy reform. The 

remaining policies are beyond the State mandate, controlled by the central government, and these mostly relate to 

the distorting minimum support prices for selected commodities, which by and large are not growth in the project.  

 
24. Finally, a watershed-based approach was considered for the project, with a stronger focus on natural resources 

management. This approach was eventually discarded since it would not sufficiently focus on farm-level adaptation 

and mitigation issues nor would it provide the support for value chain development, a key part of the 

comprehensive approach needed to provide the market outlets and input supplies required to incentivize farmers to 

adopt resilient crops and agronomic practices. 

 
25. In line with GoM request, the proposed project, as represented in the graph below, is built around a comprehensive, 

multi sector approach that focuses specifically on building resilience in agriculture through the scaling up of tested 

technologies and practices, while generating the following interdependent triple win solutions:  

a. enhanced water security at farm level - through the adoption of technologies for a more efficient use of 

water for agriculture, and the increase in water storage capacity (surface and sub-surface) and

Maharashtra Project on Climate Resilient Agriculture (P160408)

improvement in water distribution structures to address on-farm water availability and reduce the risks 

associated with intra- and inter seasonal climate variability;  

b. improved soil health - through the adoption of good agricultural practices to improve soil fertility, soil 

nutrient management, and promote soil carbon sequestration; and  

c. increased farm productivity and crop diversification - through the adoption of climate-resilient seed 

varieties (short maturity, drought and heat resistant, salt tolerant) and market-oriented crops with a 

clear potential for income security derived from the integration of farmers in corresponding value-

chains.  

 

Strategic Overview, Thematic Linkages and expected Achievements of the PoCRA  

 

 
26. Sustainable pathways to resilience. Enhancing climate-resilience in agriculture involves the integration of 

adaptation, mitigation, and other practices in agriculture that increase the capacity of the farmer and his/her 

production system to respond to various climate-related disturbances by resisting or tolerating the damage and 

recovering quickly. To ensure the sustainability of the comprehensive on-farm and off-farm interventions required 

to build resilience in agriculture, there is a need to strengthen institutions, in particular at the local level, and 

improve their capacity to plan for adaptation to evolving climatic conditions and induce a change in local practices.  

 
27. In addition, the successful adoption of climate-resilient farming practices will largely depend on the farmer’s 

perception of income gains from the new technologies, as profitability remains the most important incentive for 

change at farm level. To that effect, crop diversification, access to knowledge and farm assets needs to be 



 
The World Bank  
Maharashtra Project on Climate Resilient Agriculture (P160408) 

 
 

  
Dec 21, 2016 Page 10 of 19  

     

accompanied by more market opportunities, which can be achieved through improved participation of organized 

smallholders in the corresponding value chains and the mobilization of private sector (e.g. agri business SMEs).  

 
28. Finally, generating cutting-edge knowledge on climate change and its impact on key sectors such as agriculture and 

water is key to providing strong analytical underpinnings for policies on climate adaptation and mitigation – which 

still need better implementation in Maharashtra (and the rest of the country), despite the state being a frontrunner 

in India on the reform agenda for climate change.      

 
29. Leveraging financial resources. Implementing climate-resilient practices at a scale to cover the targeted 5,000 

villages in a saturation mode with watershed treatment and on-farm technologies requires an estimated total costs 

of well over US$2 billion. The tentative budget for the proposed project is US$600 million, with US$480 million from 

IBRD and US$120 million from GoI/GoM. This represents an average budget envelope of US$20,000 per village and 

year. A contribution from project beneficiaries towards technologies adopted and assets acquired from the project 

will be subsequently factored in, on the basis of the cost-sharing norms applied in other GoM programs and 

projects. Therefore, a major task during project preparation will consist in strategically prioritizing interventions 

planned in each cluster of around 10 villages, selecting results-based investments to be financed, and phasing in 

activities to be implemented in a given cluster.  

 
30. Against this background, the GoM is seeking to leverage its own resources and the IBRD funding with 

complementary funding from the Green Climate Fund (GCF). IFC’s 2030 Water Resources Group is currently 

supporting the GoM’s efforts to access GCF grant funding in the range of US$250 million to scale up climate 

adaptation in Maharashtra rain-fed agriculture. During project preparation, Bank and 2030WRG staff will work as 

one project team and explore with counterparts possible co-financing arrangements between the IBRD funding and 

the GCF grant.  

  
31. Project overview. The proposed project seeks to introduce transformational changes in the agriculture sector by 

scaling-up proven technologies and good agricultural practices that contribute to building climate resilience and 

enhancing farm income. The project will promote the transfer of technologies for climate adaptation and mitigation 

at farm level and will support targeted interventions and limited physical investments in the catchment area to 

promote the use of surface water over groundwater. To enhance farmer income, the project will support activities 

aimed at linking organized smallholders with agri-food SMEs and accessing new market opportunities enhancing 

their participation in commodity value chains.  

  
32. Finally, for the sustainability of the comprehensive approach proposed to build resilience in agriculture, the project 

will enhance the capacity of institutions and agencies at various levels to mainstream resilience (in particular in 
agricultural services for smallholders), develop strategic partnerships with national and international entities, and 
help generate evidence-based knowledge to advance the policy agenda on climate change and vulnerability.  To 
achieve the PDO and KPI targets, the project is designed around the four components described below.    

 
Component A: Promoting Climate-resilient Agricultural Systems (US$ XXX million) 
  

33. The objective of this component is to build climate-resilience in agricultural production systems through a series of 
activities at farm level, complemented by interventions in catchment areas. Mini watershed plans will be developed 
early to provide a road map for investment priorities and the implementation of related activities. This component 



 
The World Bank  
Maharashtra Project on Climate Resilient Agriculture (P160408) 

 
 

  
Dec 21, 2016 Page 11 of 19  

     

will focus on: (i) scaling-up the adoption by farmers of climate-resilient agricultural practices aimed at improving soil 
health and water-use efficiency; and (ii) catchment area treatment to promote the use of “green water” for 
agriculture over “blue water”, and improve the availability of water at farm level. This component contributes 
directly to the PDO by promoting the transfer of climate resilient technologies at farm level (KPI #1), supporting the 
development of micro-irrigation systems (KPI #2) and encouraging farmers to adopt practices that enhance soil 
health (KPI #3). 

  
34. Participatory development of mini watershed plans. In line with the Maharashtra Groundwater Development and 

Management Act (2009, effective from 2013) which promotes the watershed as participatory planning unit, this 
component will finance the development of some 500 mini watershed plans, each covering a cluster of 8 to 12 
villages and an area of around 5,000 ha. Mini watershed plans are comprehensive multi-year activity and local 
investment tools for planning and monitoring. They include a comprehensive resource mapping, a rapid appraisal of 
stakeholders taking into account gender specificities, and participatory water budgeting to inform on possible 
investments in irrigation and drainage, and water resources management. Those plans will serve as a road map for 
the implementation of subsequent activities and investments under the proposed project. 

  
35. Technology transfer and climate-resilient agriculture practices for a sustainable soil and water management.  To 

enhance increase water productivity and achieve water security at farm level, the component will scale-up the 
adoption of technologies and practices aimed at maximizing the use of surface water for agriculture, at managing 
groundwater resources in a sustainable manner, and at getting “more crop per drop”. To that effect, the component 
will finance the adoption of in-situ soil moisture conservation practices, and the expansion of micro irrigation 
systems (primarily drip and sprinkler irrigation), including water supply structures and drainage facilities. The 
component will also help improve on-farm water availability through selected investments at catchment level (as 
prioritized in the mini watershed plan) to increase surface and sub-surface water storage capacity. To that effect and 
in close coordination with the Chief Minister’s Program on watershed and drought management (Jalyukt Shivar 
Abhiyan), the project will finance drainage line treatment, the improvement of water courses, the construction of 
new and desilting of existing water harvesting structures (e.g. farm and community ponds), and the construction of 
groundwater recharge structures. Agronomic practices promoted under this component in support of improved soil 
moisture management will include, among other, contour bunding, broad-bed furrow and conservation furrow 
cultivation. The component will also support efforts towards a more rigorous monitoring of the quality of the water 
available for agriculture. 

 
36. To improve on-farm soil fertility and micronutrient management, the component will scale-up the adoption of 

climate-resilient agricultural practices aimed at: (i) increasing the soil organic matter content, and (ii) sustaining a 
viable agriculture on the naturally saline and sodic farm soils prevailing in parts of the project area. Conventional 
methods to address soil salinity and soil sodicity (i.e. land reclamation with widespread application of gypsum or 
lime) will be reviewed for their economic sustainability and financial viability in the local context, and used only 
where significant and long term net benefits can be expected. Good agricultural practices aimed at improving soil 
health have been successfully tested in other programs in Maharashtra and beyond (e.g. NICRA) and include 
biomass mulching, residue recycling, manure management, conservation tillage, in-situ moisture conservation and 
others.  

  
Component B: Climate-resilient Post-harvest Management and Value Chain Promotion (US$ XXX million) 
 

37. The objective of this component is to enhance climate resilience beyond farm gate and provide end-to-end solutions 
in selected commodity value chains. To ensure successful crop diversification, the component will help: (i) develop

Maharashtra Project on Climate Resilient Agriculture (P160408)

smallholder-inclusive value chains for climate-resilient commodities, and (ii) overcome constraints in the seed supply 
chain. In line with GoM priorities, this component will focus on Farmer Producer Companies (FPCs) as major drivers 
of change in the agri-food system. An increase in farm income remains the key driver of change and a pre-
requirement for the adoption of the climate-resilient technologies and good agricultural practices promoted under 
Component A. Thus, this component will directly contribute to the PDO by creating opportunities for increasing the 
revenue of small and marginal farmers (KP #4) through crop diversification and their participation in selected value 
chains.  

   
38. Promoting Farmer Producer Companies. This component will build on the outcomes of other GoM programs and 

projects that have focused on FPCs as agent of change (e.g. MACP). A rapid appraisal exercise, with mapping, 
profiling and capacity needs assessment of the 420 FPCs in the project area (most of them in early development 
stage), will provide the basis for a series of activities tailored to the growth potential of existing FPCs. The 
component will also support the development of farmer-group based organizations into entrepreneurial, market-
oriented, financially sustainable companies with the capacity to perform selected value-adding activities and deliver 
a range of services (e.g climate-related technical advisory services, training on climate adaptation and mitigation 
practices in post-harvest management). The component will support viable mechanisms to further consolidate and 
set up new business linkages for FPCs with private sector (e.g. exporters, seed companies, farm machinery, agro-
input suppliers, and financial institutions). For the professionalization of FPCs, the project will explore a 
collaboration with IFC’s Agribusiness Leadership Program and/or Business Edge Program. Eligible FPCs will also 
benefit from participating in the incubation program of the proposed Climate Innovation Center (see Component C). 

  
39. Strengthening emerging value-chains for climate-resilient commodities. The selection of agricultural value chains for 

end-to-end solutions (from agricultural research to consumer markets) will be finalized by the PMU during project 
preparation. Pulses and oilseeds are emerging as potential priority commodities for end-to-end solutions. In 
addition, the component will support value-chains emerging in the project area following farmers’ production 
diversification to include higher-value commodities, in particular fruit trees (more climate-resilient than annual 
crops given their deeper root system). The component will also support viable investments in product aggregation, 
handling, transformation and marketing (e.g. collection centers, grading and packaging units, cold storage facilities, 
ICT-based market information systems). Priority will be given to investments that promote the use of green 
technologies (including solar energy). Value-chain financing and specifically access to finance and financial services 
for value chain actors will be explored under this component 

  
40. Improving the performance of the supply chain for climate-resilient seeds. The adequate supply of seeds with short 

duration, drought-, salinity- or heat-tolerant features, is a key priority for the GoM’s in its strategy to build climate 
resilience in the agriculture sector. The seed industry in MH is largely segmented, with private seed companies 
mainly focusing on the high value, low volume seeds (e.g. cotton, sugar cane, GM and hybrid varieties), while public 
sector seed corporations dominate the market for low value, high volume seeds (e.g. cereals, pulses and oilseeds). 
The component will address the need for increasing the availability of seeds, given farmers’ evolving demand 
resulting from the recommendations of the district-level contingency plans triggered by climate events (e.g. delays 
in onset of monsoon rains call for different crop mix). To address the shortage of breeder seeds, the component will 
assess the SAU’s breeder seeds programs and support solutions aimed at enhancing their performance (including 
developing linkages with FPCs for seed multiplication). This component will also seek to support key actors in the 
seed supply chain such as the Maharashtra State Seed Corporation who plays a unique role in the production and 
distribution of climate-resilient certified seeds for small and marginal farmers (e.g. pulses and oilseeds). It will also 
finance the development of a limited number of seed processing and storing hubs in strategic locations of the 
project area.

Component C: Institutional Development, Knowledge and Policies for a Climate-resilient Agriculture (US$ XXX million) 
 

41. The objective of this component is to ensure sustainability in the approach proposed for building climate resilience 
through a longer term adaptive management of agriculture, soil and water resources, by: (i) strengthening the 
capacity of existing institutions to design and deliver agro-technical and climate advisory services, (ii) establishing a 
Climate Innovation Center, and (iii) promoting an evidence-based policy dialogue on climate resilience. Successful 
implementation of the activities in this component will contribute to achieving the PDO by increasing the outreach 
of institutions and agencies promoting climate-resilient agriculture in the project area (KPI #5) and generating 
spillover effects to farming communities from other villages in the project area not covered by project activities.   

 
42. Sustainability and institutional capacity development. To ensure the sustainability of the comprehensive approach 

on climate-resilient agriculture proposed in this project, this component will support the development and 
implementation of a capacity development program for district and local level stakeholders. This component will 
mainstream climate-resilience in the strategic objectives of institutions and agencies involved in the delivery of 
services to small and marginal farmers. At district level, the project will work closely with the Superintendent District 
Agricultural Offices (SDAOs) and build their capacity to coordinate and monitor the implementation of the climate-
resilience agenda on the ground. At state level, the project will develop partnerships with the SAUs and support 
existing programs for the development and field-testing of emerging agricultural technologies and practices for 
climate-adaption of dryland farming systems. The component will also promote knowledge and learning exchanges 
on climate-resilience with national/international entities such as ICRISAT, CRIDA, the Indian Institute of Science, the 
Indian Meteorological Department, the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR), the 
Australian Water Partnership (AWP), and the Carbon Management and Sequestration Center (CMASC, Ohio State 
University).  

 
43. Maharashtra Climate Innovation Center (CIC). This component will finance the planning, launch and start-up phase 

for a CIC until it operates in a self-sustained manner. The CIC will support local private sector capacity – with focus 
on entrepreneurs and SMEs – to commercialize and deploy emerging technologies and business models in growing 
climate sectors (e.g. climate-resilient agriculture, water, energy) to provide local solutions to climate change. The CIC 
will offer services tailored to local needs and conditions among a suite of tools which includes: access to latest 
technology information and market intelligence, fee-based business advisory and other incubation/coaching support 
services, and tailored proof-of-concept grant and seed investment financing to prove and scale early-stage firms and 
concepts. The CIC will draw on local and international expertise to support the GoM with the review and formulation 
of policies and strategies relevant to climate change and climate resilient, in particular as linked to the agri-food 
sectors. During project preparation, the PMU will commission a feasibility study for the CIC; it will be followed up 
during early project implementation with the development of a detailed CIC business and financial plan to be 
submitted for approval to the relevant authorities.  The CIC will be established with technical guidance from the 
Bank’s Climate Technology Program. 

  
44. Knowledge and policies. This component will finance a range of analytical studies aimed at updating and 

disseminating existing knowledge on a range of issues related to climate resilience and agriculture. Such studies will 
provide the analytical underpinnings to improve the policy and strategy framework required to further enhance 
resilience in the agri-food system in Maharashtra (and beyond). This component will support efforts towards a multi 
stakeholder dialogue on policies promoting climate resilience in agriculture, as well as direct payments to farmers 
for environmental services (e.g. soil carbon sequestration, groundwater conservation). This component will also  
look at reliable ways to quantify potential mitigation benefits from activities promoted by the project and aim at 



 
The World Bank  
Maharashtra Project on Climate Resilient Agriculture (P160408) 

 
 

  
Dec 21, 2016 Page 14 of 19  

     

providing a pathway to carbon financing. The component will also finance the development of a state-of-the art 
climate and agro-hydrological model that supports policy-makers Maharashtra by: (i) making projections on the level 
of sustainable withdrawal of surface and groundwater in a given watershed under various climate and land use 
scenarios, (ii) generating suitability maps for Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR), and (iii) assessing the magnitude of 
MAR in the project area.  

  
Component D: Project Management (US$ XXX million) 
 

45. This component will primarily finance the project’s incremental operating costs.  A PMU has been set up by the 
Department of Agriculture (GoM) and tasked with the overall management of the project, while ensuring smooth 
coordination of activity implementation by various agencies and strategic partners. Given the transformative nature 
of the project, institutional coordination within and across the relevant sectors is emerging as a critical task in 
developing an effective project implementation mechanism. The PMU will be responsible for compiling an annual 
Activity Plan and Work Program and develop the corresponding budget proposal to be submitted for approval to the 
Project Steering Committee.  

 
46. The PMU will ensure that all project activities are implemented in line with the provisions in the official project 

documents; in particular, the PMU will be in charge of financial management, project procurement, and safeguards 
compliance. The component will support all activities related to project communication, public awareness and 
outreach, including the development of a comprehensive project web site. It will finance the services of specialized 
consultant firms to develop and implement a comprehensive project impact evaluation (including all surveys). 
Further, the project will promote the intensive use of ICT across components; to that effect, this component will 
finance both ICT goods and specialized consultant services. The project’s M&E system will be ICT-based, enabling the 
PIU to access project information and data from the field in real-time. ICT will also be used to facilitate the feedback 
from project beneficiaries on project activities planned/under implementation (citizen engagement), and will be 
mainstreamed in the project’s grievance and redress mechanism. 
 

 
    

  SAFEGUARDS 

 
A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 

 
Maharashtra is one of India’s most prosperous states, with a population of 114 million. Yet, it has some of India’s poorest 

people, four of its 36 districts are among India’s 106 most backward. Agriculture and industry form the mainstay of the 
state's economy. Most of the cultivable land is still rain-fed, relying heavily on the southwest monsoon rains. Districts in 
eastern Maharashtra on the Deccan plateau are particularly prone to drought. The net irrigated area is only 30.77 million 
Ha or about 16% of cultivable land. In Maharashtra, main crops include rice (although not grown in the project area), 
jowar, bajra, pulses, vegetables and onions. The main cash crops include cotton, sugarcane (though the project area 
accounts for only 3 percent of the state sugar cane production), turmeric, and several oilseeds. Amravati and Yavatmal, 
respectively in Vidharba region are the largest orange and cotton growing districts. 
The Project will be implemented in two main regions:  Vidharbha  and Marathwada comprising some 5,000 villages - 

selected for their high climate vulnerability index and low HDI; in addition, about 1,000 of these villages are characterized 
by high levels of soil salinity and sodicity. The project area is characterized by a substantial spatial and temporal rainfall 
variation and scarcity of water resources . These are increasingly exacerbated by frequent droughts associated with 
climate change and high human pressure on natural resources.

The proposed project is premised on the fact that climate changes are quite inevitable and that it affects all the 
households  much more on the livelihoods of the poor and vulnerable sections. Further, it is well recognized that the 
households/ communities in the rain fed agriculture are quite diverse and heterogeneous with several sub groups 
identifiable based on several factors – resource endowment, gender, ethnicity ( scheduled tribes), castes (scheduled 
castes), religious minorities and geographical setting ( forests, hills, coastal areas). Each of these subgroups gets affected 
differently and has differential capacity for participation. Lastly, to ensure a village/ community spread resilience, group / 
collective action would be essential which demands substantial outreach efforts. Given this scenario, following issues 
emerge as significant: local participation, institutional linkages and communication outreach. 
 

 
B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 

 
GoM has established a PMU, with a full time environmental specialist, to guide and coordinate preparation of 

environmental and social management framework (ESMF) of the project. A consultant firm has also been brought on 
board by GoM to prepare the ESMF together with the project implementation plan (PIP). During project implementation, 
there will also be environment specialists at the District PMUs in Akola and Aurangabad. GoM has experience with 
implementing World Bank funded projects, in similar sectors, such as Maharashtra Agriculture Competitiveness Project 
and Maharashtra Water Sector Improvement Project. For these projects, GoM is already implementing various tools for 
managing environmental and social issues, such as ESMF. Therefore, there is good borrower orientation and sensitivity to 
implement Bank’s safeguards. 
The project, through the safeguards instruments, will also put in place a capacity building program for staff, and project 

beneficiaries to ensure successful implementation of ESMF and IPM plan, and compliance with the Bank’s safeguards 
policies. A full understanding of the capacity-building need is expected once the draft ESMF is prepared.

D. Policies that might apply 

 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

OP 4.01 is triggered because the project involves a 
series of interventions for increasing productivity, 
enhancing resilience, and agriculture value chain 
development.  Investments to be supported under the 
project will not lead to any major irreversible impacts, 
however, if not designed effectively,  may generate 
impacts such as soil degradation, water pollution, 
biodiversity conservation, labor safety issues. (these 
are mostly temporary by nature and site specific).  
 
The project will also have positive impacts on the 
environment and natural resource base of the project 
area such as drought-proofing rain-fed agriculture in 
the semi-arid regions, prevention of soil degradation, 



 
The World Bank  
Maharashtra Project on Climate Resilient Agriculture (P160408) 

 
 

  
Dec 21, 2016 Page 16 of 19  

     

increase of soil moisture and in biomass and organic 
matter of soil, decrease of run-off and soil losses, 
increased climate resilience and annual water 
availability. All mitigation measures would be carefully 
designed in order to enhance the positive impacts, and 
ensure sustainability of investments. 
 
Overall, the project related impacts are mostly 
positive, hence it has been classified as category B. At 
this very juncture, the scope and location of the 
interventions are not known. Hence, an Environmental 
and Social Management Framework (ESMF) is being 
prepared which outlines the process for future 
subprojects to ensure that they are environmentally 
and socially sound, sustainable, and in line with GoM 
and World Bank operational safeguards policies. 

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 Yes 

Project financed investments are not expected to 
intervene in any critical natural habitats. The project 
areas contain some essential ecosystems with rich 
biodiversity, and a number of wildlife sanctuaries such 
as Jayakwadi Bird Sanctuary, in Marathwada, and 
Bhamragarh, Bor, Charpala, Chikhaladara Wildlife 
Sanctuary. There are also a number of tiger habitats 
such as Tadoba Andhari Tiger Project, Melghat Tiger 
Project, Pench Tiger Reserve located in Vidarbha 
region. 
 
As details of the exact sites of the proposed 
investments are yet to be known, and investments 
involving civil works may be located within the 
proximity of these areas OP 4.04 is triggered. The 
ESMF would include all adequate measures for 
avoidance, mitigation of impacts and preventive 
measures for negative effects on natural habitats.  
 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No 

Project financed activities will not support 
afforestation, reforestation or pasture improvement 
activities. The project will not encroach on forest land 
or change the management of forest resources. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

The policy is triggered because investments targeted 
at increasing agricultural productivity and climate-
resilient agronomic practices may encourage the use 
of pesticides. There is therefore a need to promote the 
use of integrated pest management techniques, 
including the safe use, storage and disposal of agro-
chemicals. The ESMF will aim at providing as much 



 
The World Bank  
Maharashtra Project on Climate Resilient Agriculture (P160408) 

 
 

  
Dec 21, 2016 Page 17 of 19  

     

information as possible on biological approaches to 
pest management. The project will prepare and 
promote an Integrated Pest Management Plan. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 TBD 

The project is not expected to have an impact on 
physical cultural resources, as it will be implemented 
in areas where agriculture is already practiced. 
However, the project area comprises of Aurangabad 
district, which contains many historical structures and 
UNESCO world heritage sites.  
The project will ascertain through preparation, if there 
is evidence that the project location sites would 
contain features of archeological, historical or cultural 
significance.  Following which, the ESMF would include 
provisions of chance finds to be followed by 
implementing partners, on the proper management of 
physical cultural resources if discovered during project 
implementation.  
 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 Yes 

There are 2.7 million Scheduled Tribe population in 
the 15 project districts which account to about 8% of 
the total population. Further, 27 Tehsils spread across 
11 districts are covered under the Fifth Schedule of 
the Indian Constitution which provides a variety of 
safeguards for the tribals. Given this, the project 
triggers the Bank’s Operational Policy (OP) 4.10 on 
Indigenous Peoples.  However, the next step on 
deploying the instrument- Tribal Peoples Plan (TPP) or 
Tribal Peoples Planning Framework (TPPF)— needs to 
be decided. 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 TBD 

Once the project interventions are firmed up and the 
Social Assessment Study is completed, a decision can 
be made on whether lands are required and the 
methods of scuring thereof. 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 No 

OP 4.37 is not triggered as the project investments will 
not support construction, or rely on performance of an 
existing dam >15m height. The project will not  
support rehabilitation of existing or building any new 
irrigation schemes originating from existing dams in 
the State 
 
The project may include construction of small check 
dams. The potential adverse safety and security 
impacts will be addressed in the ESMF which will 
include adequate measures to ensure that the design, 
construction and the maintenance of the small dams 
will be done by qualified engineers.

are involved. 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No NA 

 
E. Safeguard Preparation Plan  
 
Tentative target date for preparing the Appraisal Stage PID/ISDS 
 
May 05, 2017 
 

Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed. The specific studies and 
their timing should be specified in the Appraisal Stage PID/ISDS 
 
Project has initiated efforts towards the conducting a comprehensive Environmental and Social Assessment. This is 

expected to result in: (i) Integrated Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF); (ii) Tribal People Plan/ 
Framework, as appropriate; (iii) Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF), if need be; (iv) IPM/IPNM plans.  A Terms of 
reference (TOR) for the conduction of assessments and preparation of the ESMF  has been prepared by the PMU.  
 
The ESMF will provide essential baseline data, confirm policies that are triggered, assess likely impacts of the project 

interventions. The ESMF will also propose mitigation measures for any adverse impacts that may be envisaged through 
the design and construction phases of various interventions. Recommendations for strengthening institutional capacity, 
and estimate the budget required for the implementation will also be included. While the assessments will be 
participatory with due and extensive consultations with all the stakeholders, especially, the poor and vulnerable farming 
community. Further, the ESMF will also outline arrangements for consultations with the stakeholders and disclosures 
thereof both during preparation as well as implementation phases.   
 
 All safeguards studies shall be completed and the ESMF publicly disclosed by April 15, 2017.

A. Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) - The PDO of the Enhancing Shared Prosperity 

through Equitable Services (ESPES) program is to improve equitable access to basic services and 

strengthen accountability systems at the decentralized level. The program is anchored around four sets 

of key results: (a) ensuring equitable access to basic services; (b) enhancing citizens’ engagement, 

environmental and social risk management capacity; (c) deepening fiduciary aspects of basic service 

delivery; and (d) ensuring quality data access and results.

 B. Proposed Project Development Objectives - Additional Financing (AF) 

 The PDO of the ESPES AF remains the same as the parent program. 

 3. Project Description 

 

ESPES supports Ethiopia’s Intergovernmental Fiscal Transfer Program (woreda block grant system) 

which provides funding to close to one thousand woredas all over the country which are responsible for 

delivering basic services in health, education, agriculture, water and rural roads. The block grant 

program is a decentralized system of governance that supports flows of information, resources and 

accountability between different levels of government and between service providers and citizens. This 

system has been found to be effective in improving equitable access to services as indicated in the 

Systematic Country Diagnostic, the Poverty Assessment and the technical assessment undertaken as 

part of the preparation of the ESPES. Government ownership and commitment to the program also 

continues to be very strong. 

 

This proposed additional financing is sought to help finance the expenditures associated with the 

Government of Ethiopia’s Intergovernmental Fiscal Transfer Program which provides block grants to 

region and woreda levels for delivering Basic Social Services such as health care, education, agriculture 

services, rural roads, and water and sanitation. The additional financing would (a) scale up existing 

Disbursement Linked Indicators (DLIs) DLR targets; and (b) introduce new DLIs especially in the areas 

of citizen engagement and fiduciary management. Alongside the AF, the operation is also being 

restructured into a hybrid PforR to include an investment component to provide capacity building 

support for citizen engagement, fiduciary management, environmental and social safeguards 

management systems (ESMS), improved data production and dissemination, and program management. 

Performance of the operation has been satisfactory over the last 12 months. The closing date will also 

need to be extended from May 1, 2019 to December 31, 2022 to cover the implementation of the new 

DLIs and the capacity building component. 

 

The objective of the system strengthening and capacity building Investment Project Financing (IPF) 

Component is to improve the Government’s federal, regional and woreda level administrative systems 

for implementing and monitoring the block grant program, thereby improving the efficiency and 

effectiveness of the country in delivering basic services to all woredas. For instance, the safeguards 

capacity building element is relevant to all sectors because the woredas are responsible for 

implementing resettlement, compensation and grievance redress for all infrastructure projects 

implemented in their respective woredas. These projects will benefit greatly from enhanced local-level 

capacity citizen engagement, fiduciary management, environmental and social management, and data 

production and dissemination. 

 

The proposed AF includes an allocation of US$100 million for the IPF component which aims at 

complementing the PforR by providing technical assistance and capacity building for service delivery 

system performance. The IPF component is made up of 3 sub-components which are described below. 

 

 Sub-component 1: Strengthening Systems and Sectors (US$30 million): This component 
provides support to the service delivery systems at the federal, regional and Woreda levels. 

Support to sectors is closely tied to the availability of quality data to monitor sectoral outputs 

and outcomes (including monitoring ESPES DLIs). The component will finance key activities 



such as (a) strengthening sectoral MIS for Education, Health, Agriculture and WASH, (b) 

providing finance and TA to the SARA health survey
1
, and (c) costs related to undertaking 

behavioral change campaigns for improving human development outcomes in the bottom 20 

percent of Woredas. The component will also finance activities that strengthen the procurement, 

financial management, governance, and social and environmental systems at decentralized 

levels.  

 Sub-component 2: Citizens Engagement (US$30 million): This component will finance three 
key areas of CE, namely (a) Financial Transparency and Accountability (US$5 million), (b) 

Grievance Redress Mechanisms (US$5 million), and (c) Social Accountability (US$20 

million). In FTA, the activities include support to budget literacy, media campaigns, support for 

audit and procurement information disclosure, related training assessing the effectiveness of 

FTA, strengthening FTA/GRM/SA linkages; capacity building support to the EIO and support 

to grievance management GRM offices. With regard to Social Accountability, to inform the 

implementation of the social accountability activities, the government is undertaking a study to 

determine the best institutional arrangement. It would involve that the government hires a 

national consultancy firm to manage the individual social accountability implementers. The 

choice will depend on technical expertise and capacity as well as independence to undertake 

social accountability activities. Overall, the technical design of the on-the-ground 

implementation of social accountability in the ESPES program will be informed by the ongoing 

design on the ESAP II successor program provided that those design details are agreed within 

the timeline of the preparation schedule of the ESPES AF. 

 Sub-component 3: Capacity building and M&E (US$40 million): The objective of the 
support is to strengthen the capacity of the Central Statistics Agency to produce and disseminate 

timely and reliable statistics to monitor progress under the second Growth and Transformation 

Plan. Some support will also be provided to VERA to improve vital statistics and especially the 

interface with CSA. The capacity building support for CSA and VERA will focus on 1) data 

production and dissemination, and 2) organizational and soft statistical infrastructure and 

capacity building; and 3) improving the quality of vital statistics. This component will also 

support M&E, management and operational costs including (a) incremental staffing costs, (b) 

operational costs including audits and program monitoring and evaluation, and (c) costs 

incurred by the DLI verification agencies.  

 

 
4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis 

(if known) 

 

 

The physical setting is not relevant for safeguard analysis as the IPF component does not involve any 

capital investment or civil works and will strengthen the system by (a) enhancing citizens’ engagement, 

environmental and social risk management capacity; (b) deepening fiduciary aspects of basic service 

delivery; and (c) ensuring quality data access and results. There will be no land acquisition or restriction 

of access in this IPF component. 

The ESPES AF will be implemented throughout the country. The objective of the system strengthening 

and capacity building IPF component is to improve the government’s federal, regional and woreda level 

administrative systems for implementing and monitoring the block grant program and for improving the 

efficiency and effectiveness of the country in delivering basic services to all woredas in environmentally 

and socially sustainable manner. For instance, the safeguards local capacity building element is relevant 

to all sectors because the woredas are responsible for implementing community consultation, land

mechanism, etc. for infrastructure development such as rural roads project regardless of funding 

sources. These projects will benefit greatly from enhanced local-level capacity in safeguards, especially 

in relation to social impacts and aspects, which are typically weaker than biophysical aspects, at woreda 

level.

 II. KEY SAFEGUARD POLICY ISSUES AND THEIR MANAGEMENT 

 A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 

 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and 

describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 

 
There will not be any large scale and significant and/or irreversible impacts associated with this project. 

It will actually enhance local capacity in safeguards, which will be beneficial not only to basic sectors 

but also to all sectors implementing projects in woredas.  

 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in 

the project area: 

 
The long term impacts of the project activities are positive in terms of environmental and social 

management. The safeguards capacity building at local level will contribute towards improved 



environmental and social management in project design, implementation and monitoring in both the 

public and private sectors. 

 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse 

impacts. 

 Not applicable 

 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an 

assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 

 

A series of legal proclamations form the basis for the environmental and social assessment and 

management framework in Ethiopia: The Proclamation on the Establishment of Environmental 

Protection Organs (No. 295/2002); the Proclamation on Environmental Impact Assessment (No. 

299/2002); and the Proclamation on Environmental Pollution Control (No. 300/2002).  

 

As part of the Management Action Plan, in response to the PBS 3 Inspection Panel investigation, (a) the 

Government has developed Environmental and Social Management Operational Manual, and (b) a 

screening tool to manage the interface between Bank-financed projects and Commune Centers, was 

developed, and it is being rolled out. An Incremental ESSA was carried out as part of the preparation of 

the ESPES AF. It identified changes or improvement to the systems in place for environmental and 

social management at all levels, including taking stock of implementation capacity and performance at 

woreda level and the identification of any areas for improvement, based on the review of the original 

ESSA and any developments since then. This has informed the preparation of the safeguards IPF 

component with regard to local capacity building. 

 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on 

safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 

 
The key stakeholders are the MoFEC, MoEFCC, basic sector ministries, BoFEDs and regional 

environmental agencies and basic sector bureaus. Consultation on the Incremental ESSA will be held, 

and it will be disclosed on the infoshop and in-country before appraisal.  

 B. Disclosure Requirements 

 
If the project triggers the Pest Management and/or Physical Cultural Resources policies, the 

respective issues are to be addressed and disclosed as part of the Environmental 

Assessment/Audit/or EMP. 

 If in-country disclosure of any of the above documents is not expected, please explain why:
