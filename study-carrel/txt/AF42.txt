Project Executive Summary 

Overview: the Project to Develop and Promote Agricultural Sub-sectors (PDPFA) will be 

implemented in the Zaghouan Governorate, which covers a surface area of 282 000 hectares 

and has a population of 186 210 (INS, 2018). This region has an average poverty rate of 20% 

(15.2% nationwide), an illiteracy rate of 26.4% (18.8% nationwide) and a rural poverty rate of 

34.2%. The unemployment rate is 16.9% compared with 14.8% nationwide. Women are more 

vulnerable as they lack access to resources and formal employment. 

After the 2011 revolution, Tunisia adopted a Strategic Development Plan (PSD 2016-2020) to 

revive and enhance the attractiveness of its economy and incorporate it into global value chains 

in order to address the challenge of achieving sustainable and inclusive development. This 

vision is reflected in the country’s resolve to increase investments (25% of GDP by 2020) in 

specific niches with competitive advantages and where there is a growing international market 

that offers more opportunities for the generation of value-added. In this regard, agricultural 

subsectors have been identified according to agro-ecological zones and their potential to 

increase high value-added agricultural exports. The Project to Develop and Promote 

Agricultural Sub-sectors in Zaghouan Governorate (PDPFA-GZ) falls within this framework. 

It seeks to promote agricultural subsectors whose development requires significant public and 

private investments to enhance production and productivity, and increase opportunities in terms 

of product development (processing, packaging, certification, etc.). Besides improving their 

competitiveness, the subsectors selected will have an overall impact on economic recovery and 

the reduction of unemployment, poverty and inequalities. 

PDPFA-GZ was prepared under a UA 412 000 Middle-Income Countries Technical Assistance 

Fund (MIC-TAF) grant awarded by the Bank in 2014. The grant resources were used to design 

the related technical studies and evaluate the Integrated Agricultural Development Project 

(PDAI) in Tunisia. It complements the first phase of the Integrated Agricultural Development 

Programme in Zaghouan Governorate financed by the International Fund for Agricultural 

Development (IFAD) to the tune of USD 16.05 million. PDPFA-GZ, whose total estimated cost 

is EUR 43.86 million, of which EUR 25.21 million provided the African Development Bank 

(AfDB), aims to develop priority agricultural subsectors (olive oil, tomato, dairy and other local 

organic products) selected in conjunction with regional authorities based on their economic, 

social and environmental impact. The project comprising three components will be 

implemented over five years. The components are: (i) Rural Infrastructure Support; (ii) 

Sustainable Agricultural Development and Promotion of Agricultural Value Chains; and (iii) 

Project Coordination and Management. It will benefit more than 90 650 people (12 500 

directly), 50.2% of them women, in the project impact area (PIA). 

Needs Assessment: the financing needs of the agricultural sector in Tunisia for the 2016-2020 

period are estimated at about TND 9 000 million or UA 2 000 million (Strategic Development 

Plan 2016-2020). This investment will contribute to achieving the objectives of the Strategic 

Development Plan (SDP) in terms of reducing unemployment and social/regional inequalities. 

Agricultural investments during the first three years of the Plan amounted to TND 4 400 million 

(TND 1 870 million in public investments), representing a financing gap of more than TND 2 

500 million. AfDB resources of about TND 86.24 million will help to reduce the financing gap 

in Zaghouan Governorate. 

Value-added for the African Development Bank: the agricultural sector plays a vital role in 

the national economy and the Bank contributes to its development within the framework of the 

Country Strategy. The Bank’s active portfolio comprises seven operations (UA 69.804 million), 

representing 6% of the portfolio whose performance is deemed satisfactory with a score of 3.5 



 

vi 

 

on 4 (2017/2018 Country Portfolio Performance Review). The Bank has also acquired 

considerable experience in financing integrated agricultural development projects (IADPs) in 

similar areas such as Gafsa and Kairouan. The evaluation of IADPs conducted within the 

framework of the Middle-Income Countries Technical Assistance Fund (MIC-TAF) grant 

confirmed that the Bank has a strong comparative advantage by participating in financing the 

Project to Develop and Promote Agricultural Sub-sectors in Zaghouan Governorate (PDPFA-

GZ). It has developed skills and technical expertise in the design and formulation of agricultural 

projects, particularly the development of irrigation schemes and catchment ponds, the proper 

targeting of vulnerable areas and environmental and social protection. It has also acquired 

experience in Tunisia and other countries by promoting subsectors and value chains, youth and 

women’s entrepreneurship, and building national capacity for more effective official 

development aid  (ODA) in terms of alignment and ownership. 

Knowledge Management: a baseline situation based on field surveys (including value chains) 

was established during project preparation. The project will provide the agricultural map of 

Tunisia with geo-referenced data on the sites of the schemes and infrastructure developed. It 

will also support training and strengthen the knowledge of various local actors, particularly 

farmers in irrigation schemes and women involved in agri-food product marketing. The project 

will disseminate best practice, particularly in organic agricultural product certification and the 

development of local expertise. The same will apply to the socio-economic and environmental 

impacts of the organic production system (OPS) to be promoted by the project by ensuring that 

producers (upstream and downstream of subsectors) introduce and adopt good agricultural 

practices.

PROJECT TO DEVELOP AND PROMOTE AGRICULTURAL SUBSECTORS IN 

ZAGHOUAN GOVERNORATE  

APPRAISAL REPORT 

Management hereby submits the following appraisal report and recommendation concerning a proposal 

to grant a EUR 25.21 million AfDB loan to the Republic of Tunisia to finance the Project to Develop 

and Promote Agricultural Sub-sectors in Zaghouan Governorate (PDPFA-GZ). 

I. Strategic Thrust and Rationale 

1.1. Project Linkages with Country Strategy and Objectives 

1.1.1 The project is consistent with Tunisia’s Strategic Development Plan (PSD) 2016-2020, which 

hinges on five pillars: (i) public administrative reform and fight against corruption for improved 

governance; (ii) human development and social inclusion; (iii) higher value-added activities; (iv) reduction 

of regional disparities; and (v) development of a green economy. The PSD seeks to achieve a 5% growth 

rate to reduce the unemployment rate to 12.2% in 2020. In this regard, the strategy envisages an increase 

in the investment rate to 25% of GDP, driven by a significant growth in public investment and a build-up 

of public-private partnerships (PPPs). The overall objectives of the PSD in the agricultural sector are to 

promote competitive and sustainable farming by creating value added, ensuring the judicious and 

sustainable exploitation of natural resources, and securing decent income for farmers. 

1.1.2 The project will also contribute to the implementation of the Zaghouan Governorate Planning 

and Development Master Plan 2030. Besides making substantial investments in the development of 

irrigation and water-saving infrastructure, it will help to promote and enhance the competitiveness of 

priority agricultural subsectors (olive oil, tomato, milk and other local organic products). The project will 

promote the conservation and development of natural resources by ensuring their sustainability and 

minimising the effects of climate change; improving land tenure entities, combating the fragmentation of 

landholdings and developing farmlands; develop a regional green economy and promote gender-based 

human development and social inclusion by strengthening women’s empowerment. The project will help 

Tunisia to honour its low-carbon sustainable development commitments (nationally determined 

contribution target of reducing carbon intensity by 41% by 2030 compared with 2010) by launching a 

large-scale tree planting operation, water and soil conservation (WSC) works, and to achieve the 

sustainable development goals (SDOs), particularly poverty reduction, the elimination of inequalities, the 

promotion of gender equality, the empowerment of women, and the creation of decent jobs. 

1.2. Rationale for Bank Involvement 

1.2.1 The agricultural sector plays a major role in Tunisia’s economy. Over the last decade, the 

Tunisian olive oil sub-sector has been one of the country’s leading foreign exchange earners, generating 

TND 2 billion, i.e. 10% of all exports in 2017-2018 (ONH, 2018). Consequently, the country is the 

second olive oil producer after Spain and the world’s leading exporter of olive oil, with about 200 000 

tonnes of olive oil in 2017. Similarly, it ranks among the world’s ten largest tomato processing countries 

and is Africa’s leading exporter of organic products. Agriculture accounts for 10% of GDP, 16.9% of 

employment and about 10% of export earnings. Despite the progress made, the overall performance of 

the agricultural sector remains inadequate in view of its potential. Agricultural productivity remains low 

and the high inter-annual variability of production greatly impedes steady supply. Agricultural products 

are not sufficiently competitive and developed. Consequently, investment in the agricultural sector has 

dropped. The outcome has been a decline in farmers’ income, which does not exceed 50% of the national 

average income. As a result, the sector is increasingly less attractive to youths (43% of farmers are aged 

above 60). 



 

2 

 

1.2.2 The Bank’s intervention targets disadvantaged areas in Zaghouan Governorate, a region with a 

high agricultural potential and one eligible for various government investment incentives. In this region, 

the project will contribute to developing irrigation and water-saving infrastructure, promoting transition 

to organic agriculture and expanding agricultural entrepreneurship in order to boost the value chains of 

promising agricultural subsectors. Therefore, the Bank’s intervention will help to render the regional 

and national economy more attractive, thus contributing towards achieving inclusive growth, reducing 

unemployment, poverty and inequalities. It will also build the resilience of agro-ecological systems and 

improve the region’s agri-food positioning in local and global value chains.  

1.2.3 The subsectors targeted by the Bank’s intervention (see detailed analysis in Annex C3) were 

selected given their strategic importance in terms of food security, their potential to generate more value 

added and the constraints identified. In Tunisia, olive growing is the main agricultural activity and plays 

a key socio-economic role in terms of the area under cultivation (1.8 million hectares) and the number 

of farmers (309 000 farmers) employed in the different olive oil subsector chains (mechanisation, 

pruning, harvesting, transportation, crushing, storage, marketing, etc.). It is a source of direct or indirect 

income for more than one million people and generates 34 million days of work per annum, which is 

equivalent to more than 20% of employability in the agricultural sector. However, olive oil production 

fluctuates significantly from year to year due to the alternate bearing of olive trees and very irregular 

climatic conditions. In addition, 90% of olive oil exports consist of bulk oil, 70% of which is extra-

virgin olive oil. This provides the country with a significant head room in the packaging value chain to 

create more value added and ensure product traceability. In the tomato subsector, the dried product 

constitutes a growth niche in terms of employment and exports, and can generate foreign exchange 

earnings for the country. Exports could be better leveraged by shifting from the current stage of supplier 

of semi-finished bulk products to another stage as supplier of finished products delivered directly to the 

final consumer. In the dairy sub-sector, there is a deficit in the feed balance with limited quantity and 

quality of feed resources and a partial and inadequate use of agricultural and agro-industrial by-products 

upstream. There is a shortage of collection centres and chillers, as well as inadequate promotion of 

traditional dairy products downstream. Organic farming is now the engine of regional development in 

view of its linkages with agri-food industries, environmental tourism, handicrafts and renewable energy. 

However, the cumbersome process of converting and certifying organic products continues to impede 

its full development. 

1.2.4 The project plugs into the Bank’s Ten-year Strategy (2013-2022) by aligning with the High 5s. 

It is consistent with the Bank’s Strategy to Address Fragility and Build Resilience in Africa (2014-2019) 

since it strengthens the role of communities in building resilience and raising awareness among all 

stakeholders on inequality and fragility issues. It is in keeping with the main thrusts of the Bank’s 

Climate Change Action Plan and Gender Strategy for 2014-2018 (extended to 2019), by promoting 

women’s right to land and resources (in irrigation schemes) and economic empowerment through 

income-generating activities, management and entrepreneurship capacity building. At the national level, 

the project is consistent with Tunisia’s Country Strategy Paper (CSP) 2017-2021, particularly Pillar 2 

“Improve the quality of life for the people of the priority regions”. In this respect, the project will ensure 

the qualitative and quantitative transformation of regional agriculture by developing irrigation schemes 

(PIP); supporting targeted agricultural subsectors and certifying organic products to promote their 

export; supporting agricultural entrepreneurship (MSME), especially for women and youths; developing 

a regional green economy; and building local capacity and governance in land tenure and water resource 

management. By addressing the critical feeder road link under Pillar 1 “Industrialisation and local value 

chains development”, the project will ease the movement of people and goods in this region, which is a 

transitional space between the country’s coast and hinterland. 

1.3. Aid Coordination 

1.3.1 In Tunisia, official development aid reached USD 5.5 billion during the 2011-2017 period, 

representing an increase of 128% compared with the pre-revolution period (2004-2010) (WB, 2019;

oecd.org/dac/stats/idsonline). The Ministry of Development, Investment and International Cooperation 

(MDICI) is responsible for coordination. The African Development Bank is contributing to this process 

through the country dialogue spearheaded by its North Africa Regional Development and Business 

Delivery Office (RDGN). Therefore, the Bank harmonises its operations with the World Bank and the 

European Union within the framework of budget support based on the same matrix of measures and 

identical disbursement conditions. It has also concluded mutual trust and confidence agreements, 

particularly with the European Investment Bank, to use the procurement procedures of a single donor 

during co-financing. Lastly, it participates in the Agricultural Sector Working Group set up by Tunisia’s 

technical and financial partners. At State level, the Ministry of Agriculture, Water Resources and 

Fisheries (MARHP) is responsible for the technical coordination of agricultural projects. Similarly, the 

Ministry of Development, Investment and International Cooperation (MDICI) coordinates and monitors 

the activities of development partners. The table below presents the main amounts by source of financing

II. Project Description 

2.1 Project Components 

2.1.1 The overall objective of PDPFA-GZ is to contribute to reducing poverty, unemployment 

and inequalities (gender, socio-economic and rural/urban) in Zaghouan Governorate. The project’s 

specific objective is to create more value added by promoting priority1 agricultural sub-sectors such 

as “olive oil”, “tomato”, “dairy” and “other local organic products”, which are niches with a high 

potential in terms of employment, revenue generation and foreign exchange earnings for the 

country. In this regard, the project will carry out major irrigation, water resource mobilisation 

(boreholes, shallow wells and catchment ponds), and natural resource protection works (water, soil 

and forests) in order to improve production and productivity as part of efforts to accelerate transition 

to organic farming. An “agricultural value chains (AVCs)” approach will be used as guideline for 

the project to address the challenges of linking various chains in the targeted agricultural subsectors, 

                                                 
1 Priority subsectors were defined in a concerted manner based on environmental (soil conservation, water use and biodiversity), social (local job 

creation and improvement of the status of rural women) and economic criteria (level of value added, stability of income and adaptability to 

growth markets).

creating value added and building resilience of the people’s agro-ecological and socio-economic 

systems. The “aggregation2” model will be adopted to remove constraints on MSME financing, 

promote agricultural entrepreneurship especially for women and youths, and open access to markets 

at remunerative prices, while complying with new requirements regarding hygiene, food safety, the 

environment, and social equity. 

2.1.2 The project will be implemented over five years and will comprise three components: (A) 

Rural Infrastructure Support; (B) Sustainable Agricultural Development and Promotion of 

Agricultural Value Chains; and (C) Project Coordination and Management. The project activities 

are summarised in the table below.

2.2 Technical Solutions Adopted and Alternatives Explored 

2.2.1  The technical solutions adopted are based on lessons from the Bank and IFAD’s 

experience, particularly in financing integrated agricultural projects (IAPs) in Tunisia. The region’s 

technical services, local businesses and communities have acquired experience in the development 

of irrigation, water and soil conservation facilities that are easy to design. The subsectors to be 

supported were selected in consultation with the regional authorities and communities based on 

their potential to create more value added and ensure the sustainability of investments as well as 

agro-ecological considerations. Thus, the promotion of a watermelon sub-sector, which was 

initially envisaged, was abandoned because of its negative impact on water resources. Similarly, in 

the tomato subsector already established in the region, the project will ensure water saving on the 

parcels of land under cultivation in order to economise water, while intensifying production in a 

bid to improve the downstream production sub-sector, particularly tomato drying, packaging and 

export. Resilience measures are based on vulnerability analysis and strategies to reduce factors of 

fragility. Lastly, the “aggregator” approach has yielded positive results in other public-private 

partnership (PPP) operations, opening up access to financing and guaranteeing higher producer 

prices. 

Table 2.2: Alternatives Explored and Reasons for their Rejection 

Alternative Brief Description Reasons for Rejection 

Extension of the 

areas devoted to 

tomato cultivation 

and promotion of a 

watermelon 

subsector 

The option considered was 

to increase the areas 

devoted to tomato 

cultivation and to promote 

a watermelon subsector. 

The project will not promote a watermelon subsector in the 

region because of the high water consumption of these two 

plants. Concerning the tomato subsector already established and 

for which the regional authorities are requesting support, project 

activities will focus on measures to save water and improve the 

downstream sub-sector, particularly the drying, packaging and 

export of tomatoes. 

2.3 Project Type 

2.3.1. PDPFA-GZ is an investment project in a key sector of the Tunisian economy. Its approach 
guarantees the achievement of outcomes and the efficient use of the resources allocated. 

2.4 Project Cost and Financing Arrangements 

2.4.1 Project cost: the total project cost, taxes included, is estimated at TND 153.38 million 
(EUR 44.84 million). The cost was estimated based on the prices prevailing in April 2019. This 

cost includes the cost of land that will be occupied by the project for the construction of facilities 

planned. Provisions equivalent to 5% and 7% of the base cost have been made respectively for 

physical contingencies and price escalation, based on local and global inflation trends. Tables 2.3, 

2.4 and 2.5 below present a summary of the estimated project cost by component, expenditure 

category and year, while details are presented in Technical Annex B2 of the project appraisal report. 

 

Furthermore, the cost sharing (borne 56.2% by AfDB, 5.3% by the beneficiaries and 38.5% by the 

State) is in line with the financing parametres for Tunisia as approved by the Board in 2017, 

according to which the Bank could finance 60% of the cost of social projects (education, health, 

employment, gender, etc.), with limited and/or gradual economic benefits. The social nature of 

PDPFA is reflected in: (1) the importance of activities dedicated to women, especially the 

development of women’s entrepreneurship; and (2) the emphasis on the development of 

employment and self-employment in the project area by targeting youths and smallholders. 

Moreover, the gradual profitability of the project resides in the the very nature of tree cultivation 

(mostly olive trees), which requires nearly ten years to reach maturity.

2.5 Project Target Area and Beneficiaries 

2.5.1 The project impact area (PIA) covers Zaghouan Governorate, particularly the vulnerable 

areas of the 6 delegations (Zaghouan, Zriba, Saouef, Nadhour, El Fahs and Bir Mchargua), which 

make up 44 out of the 47 administrative sectors of the Governorate. Despite its enormous 

agricultural potential (272 000 hectares of arable land), the region’s agro-ecological systems are 

highly vulnerable to climate change: water resources are decreasing and soil erosion is severe, 

affecting nearly 52 000 hectares of arable land and taking various forms ranging from topsoil 

stripping to gullying of varying intensity. In addition, extreme weather events such as floods and 

droughts are increasing, resulting in an average poverty rate of 20% and an unemployment rate of 

16.9% compared with the national rate of 14.8%. Women are more affected by illiteracy (37% of 

rural women) and generally by precariousness since only 19% of them own resources. The 

Governorate is among the regions eligible for various investment incentives intended to reduce the 

factors of environmental and social fragility as well as intra-regional inequalities. Despite the 

fragility of its specific mountain ecosystems, this Governorate has a multitude of major agro-

environmental functions and a considerable ecotourism, cultural and local product production 

potential. 

2.5.2 PDPFA-GZ will benefit more than 90 650 people (12 500 directly), 50.2% of them women. 

The people will be supported to improve production and productivity through successful land 

consolidation and conversion to organic farming. Special attention will be paid to women 

(particularly women heads of households) and youths who constitute the bulk of vulnerable groups. 

They will benefit from about 40% to 45% of newly developed PIPs and 75% of actions related to 

product processing and marketing, particularly organic products. Direct beneficiaries will be 

selected in close collaboration with the CRDA, SMSAs, GDAs and UTAP through a participatory, 

inclusive and collaborative approach. Financing in the form of subsidies to agricultural cooperatives 

(SMSAs) will be based on eligibility criteria set out in the project procedures manual and validated 

by the National Coordination Committee (CNC). 

2.6 Participatory Approach for Project Identification, Design and Implementation 

2.6.1  The Bank adopted a participatory, inclusive and collaborative approach throughout the 

project preparation process, which helped to involve all stakeholders in the identification of major 

issues and appropriate solutions. The stakeholders are representatives of the population, the 



 

9 

 

decentralised technical services of the CRDA, other public institutions, producer organisations and 

civil society, including gender-focused organisations, the private sector and TFPs. This approach 

also made helped to achieve a broad consensus on the “agricultural value chains (AVCs)” approach 

to address the challenge of incorporating the different links of the subsectors selected. Furthermore, 

the “aggregation” model has been adopted to remove constraints on local financing, promote 

agricultural entrepreneurship and open access to remunerative markets amid increasingly strict 

quality, environmental, social, hygiene and food safety requirements. Against this backdrop, 

farmers underscored the need for them to switch to organic farming and for land consolidation with 

the issuance of titles for their plots. One of the challenges to be addressed is the improvement of 

access to land and financing by rural women and youths. This will promote their settlement as 

agripreneurs targeting growth markets. During project implementation, this participatory approach 

will be maintained to enable stakeholders to own project activities and ensure the sustainability of 

investments. For the various development and WSC works, the participatory development plans 

(PDPs) that are being prepared will underpin all project interventions in each territorial unit. 

2.7 Bank Group Experience and Lessons Reflected in Project Design 

2.7.1 In April 2019, the Bank’s portfolio in Tunisia comprised 43 operations, of which 19 loans 

and 24 grants totalling UA 1 057 million (EUR 1 148 million). The agricultural sector has seven 

(7) operations (UA 69.804 million or EUR 82.251 million), representing 6.8% of the portfolio, 

implemented in similar regions such as Gafsa and Gabès. The performance of the national public 

portfolio is deemed satisfactory with a score of 3.4 (3.5 for agriculture) on 4 (CPPR 2017/2018). 

However, specific weaknesses were noted in procurement, late submission of audit reports and 

difficulties in evaluating the impact of projects. In addition, the Bank has had a rich experience in 

financing integrated agricultural development projects (IADPs). The evaluation of this experience 

conducted in 2018 (January 2019 Summary Report) within the framework of the MIC-TAF grant 

highlighted the following points: (i) the need to better organise agricultural sub-sectors, particularly 

the downstream subsector; (ii) the need to build the institutional capacity of CRDAs and clarify 

partnerships; (iii) the need to define an exit strategy; and (iv) the need to strengthen ADPs and 

establish a baseline situation. In addition, there is lack of innovative mechanisms for financing 

agricultural entrepreneurship, particularly for rural women. 

2.7.2 PDAPF-GZ design took into account lessons from the Bank’s experiences and those of its 

key partners such as IFAD, IBRD, SFD and FAO. A Project Management Unit (PMU) set up within 

the Zaghouan CRDA will oversee the implementation of project activities. PMU staff will be 

selected from the CRDA and will be trained “in situ” by Bank experts on allotments to reduce the 

number of contracts and cut transaction and financial management costs, in order to accelerate the 

preparation of financial statements. The CRDA and the PMU will be provided with equipment, 

logistics and other teaching aids for technical training, agricultural advisory schemes and extension 

services. Similarly, clear agreements will be concluded with its key partners (AVFA, OEP, CTAB, 

INRAT, Mograne School, the Chott Mariem Horticulture and Organic Agriculture Research Centre 

- CRHAB). The project will promote agricultural subsectors that constitute important niches. It will 

finance training, stakeholder organisation, and product processing, packaging and marketing 

activities, thus helping to incorporate various subsector links, generate value added and create the 

desired jobs. The MIC grant mobilised by the Bank was tapped to conduct engineering studies (APS 

and APD), particularly those on irrigation schemes, collection ponds and rural roads, establish the 

project’s baseline situation and guarantee project quality at entry assessment. Support for the 

development of SMEs and income-generating activities as well as pursuit of the “aggregator” 

approach will help to fund training and incubation programmes in support of financial resource 

mobilisation for the development of agricultural entrepreneurship.

2.8 Key Performance Indicators 

2.8.1 The key performance indicators monitored based on the baseline situation are presented in 

the results-based logical framework. In terms of facilities, monitoring will concern the number and 

areas of PIPs developed or rehabilitated (and property owned by men and women, to track the 

gender gap), boreholes and collection ponds developed, acreage planted with fruit trees, fodder 

species, water and soil conservation works. The main production and marketing indicators relate to 

additional production (tonnes), yields (t/ha), the number of farmers by type of gender-disaggregated 

development works, increase in income, including those of men and women in order to monitor 

gender gaps, the number and quality of jobs for youths and women created through entrepreneurial 

initiatives, the number of producers, processors and traders trained and organised, as well as the 

number of producers who have adopted best agricultural and production practice that comply with 

environmental, hygienic and food safety rules and standards. The project will also monitor the level 

of women’s participation in decision-making bodies and access to land after development, the 

amount of rural financing mobilised and the rate of increase in gender-disaggregated gross margins. 

III. Project Feasibility 

3.1 Economic and Financial Performance 

3.1.1 Project financial and economic outcomes were determined based on an analysis of 

expected project costs and benefits over a 20-year investment lifespan using the reference pricing 

method, comparing the project and no project situations from the financial standpoint (impact on 

farmers and the various project direct beneficiaries) and from the community standpoint by 

considering socio-economic benefits generated by the project. The expected project benefits will 

stem from improved productivity of existing farm areas and additional production of crops, 

livestock, fodder and income-generating activities. At full development, the project will enable the 

production of 18 000 tonnes of olives, 4 000 tonnes of peaches, 6 000 tonnes of citrus fruits, 26 600 

tonnes of tomatoes, 1 000 tonnes of market garden products, 1 800 000 litres of milk, 21 000 bales 

of fodder, and the establishment of 200 micro and small projects. Profitability analysis was 

conducted based on investment costs plus physical contingencies, and covered irrigation facilities, 

boreholes, plantations, water and soil conservation (WSC) measures, value chains promotion, a 5-

year project implementation period and a 20-year service life. It took into account periodic 

replacement and regular maintenance of equipment. Calculation assumptions took into account 

recent agricultural product prices, yields and production costs. Financial profitability analysis was 

carried out for all types of farms and for each agricultural subsector and income-generating activity. 

Economic profitability was calculated using the elements of financial profitability after deducting 

financial transfers and assessing costs and benefits in relation to their economic value. Based on 

these assumptions, the financial and economic rates of return presented in detail as annex are 

summarised in Table 3.1 below. 

Table 3.1: Key Economic and Financial Data 

NPV (baseline scenario) TND 30.6 million 

IRR (baseline scenario) 15.6 % 

Economic NPV (baseline scenario) TND 47.9 million 

ERR (baseline scenario) 18.8 % 

3.1.2  Financial performance:  the financial rate of return is higher than project financing costs, 

which justifies the implementation of operations in various subsectors selected with variable 

margins according to the type of farm. Additional project income broken down by type of farm and 

activity will mainly come from improved yield of existing olive plantations, new plantations and 

other crops, livestock production and income-generating activities. Additional income in a peak 



 

11 

 

year are estimated by subsector and in TND million as follows: olive (22.9); peach (1.037); citrus 

fruit (1.170); tomato (1.29); dairy (0.486); market gardening (2.36); fodder (0.85); and income-

generating activities (1.00).  

3.1.3 Economic performance: based on a 12% opportunity cost of capital, the economic rate of 

return and the net present value stand at 18.8% and TND 47.9 million, respectively. These values 

would be higher if it were possible to quantify benefits such as improved standard and quality of 

life of the beneficiary population, impact on women and their integration into the development 

process, job creation, reduction of rural exodus, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions through 

new plantations, development of organic farming and building of the capacity of the units and 

bodies involved at various stages of project implementation and operation.    

3.1.4 Sensitivity analysis: an analysis of project sensitivity to potential risks of variation in 

yields, production costs and farm prices was carried out. Simulations based on a 10% increase in 

investment costs reduced the ERR to 17.2% and the NPV to TND 39.5 million. A 10% decrease in 

income reduced the ERR to 16.3% and the NPV to TND 29.4 million. A combination of the two 

events reduced the ERR to 14.2% and the NPV to TND 16.3 million. The outcomes of the financial 

and economic analysis show that the PDPFA-GZ is financially justified, and is viable socio-

economically and environmentally. 

3.2 Environmental and Social Impact 

3.2.1. Environment:  based on the Bank's Integrated Safeguards System (ISS), the PDPFA-GZ 
is classified under Environmental Category 2 because the negative environmental and social 

impacts were deemed moderate to low. Therefore, in accordance with national and Bank 

procedures, the Regional Office for Agricultural Development (CRDA) prepared and submitted an 

Environmental and Social Impact Notice (ESIN). The Environmental and Social Management Plan 

(ESMP) prepared in 2014 was also updated and submitted. The summary of the ESMP has been 

posted on the Bank's website.  

3.2.2. The main project positive environmental and social impacts identified include: (i) land 
consolidation in several irrigation schemes, which will allow for better agricultural development; 

(ii) promotion of income-generating activities (IGAs), which will diversify income sources and 

support small farms, especially those run by women and youths. This will also raise the income of 

rural dwellers, increase job supply and reduce rural exodus; (iii) facilitation of access to micro-

project financing through the assistance that the project will provide to beneficiaries (studying their 

projects, monitoring project implementation and training in the activities to be promoted); (iv) 

development of organic farming, which reduces the use of fertilisers compared with conventional 

farming techniques. Chemical pollution that affects the quality of groundwater will be mitigated 

through the implementation of organic farming projects; (v) study on sylvicultural and pastoral 

development, which will aim to improve the profitability of the livestock sub-sector, while ensuring 

better management of resources and preventing their degradation: (vi) enhancement of the role of 

the Zaghouan National Park in the dissemination and entrenchment of the environmental culture 

among the population and improvement of the living environment; and (vii) improvement of the 

service quality of the soil laboratory, which will contribute to preventing soil degradation to allow 

for optimal use of the soil.  

3.2.3. The negative impacts on biophysical environments are of various forms, including: (i) 
natural and anthropogenic degradation of irrigation schemes and their infrastructure; (ii) upsurge in 

the loss of water distributed in the canals; (iii) reduced fertility of farmland and agricultural 

production; (iv) sharp drop in groundwater level leading to reduced availability of irrigation water; 

(v) land degradation and erosion with silting, gullying and glacis formation, and appearance of crust 



 

12 

 

soils; (vi) gully slopes, shoreline erosion and silting of temporary streams and wadis; and (vii) 

relative pressure of livestock on crops, in the absence of open spaces and pasture areas. 

3.2.4. The ESMP submitted includes: (i) a waste management plan; (ii) a risk management 
programme; (iii) an environmental surveillance and monitoring programme; and (iv) an institution-

building plan. 

3.2.5. The main mitigation measures recommended for implementation by works contractors 
under the responsibility of CRDA are: (i) protection of soil and groundwater resources; (ii) 

preservation of soil stability, prevention of uncontrolled rainwater run-offs and protection of 

drainage networks; (iii) protection and restoration of existing infrastructure; (iv) protection of 

dwellings and other personal property; (v) protection of the archaeological heritage; (vi) solid waste 

management; (vii) prevention and reduction of atmospheric emissions of gaseous pollutants and 

dusts; (viii) prevention and reduction of sound levels and vibrations; and (ix) reduction of 

vegetation destruction areas and restoration of the landscape after works. The estimated overall cost 

of the ESMP (excluding the resettlement action plan) is USD 355 000. It will be fully funded by 

the project. 

3.2.6. The project will also protect and sustain water resources by: (i) mobilizing surface water 
through catchment ponds and the cleaning of river beds; (ii) ensuring the integrated recharge and 

management of groundwater; (iii) improving the water cycle through soil stabilization; and (iv) 

providing support for water saving through the development of drip irrigation and the improvement 

of on-farm management. In addition, it should be noted that the Bank, through the ongoing Water 

2050 Project, is involved in the improvement of water governance in Tunisia. This project will help 

to prepare a national strategy by 2020, the thrusts of which will be taken into account during the 

implementation of PDPFA-GZ activities.  

3.2.7. The environmental and social surveillance and monitoring programme will focus 
respectively on: (i) the monitoring of construction site activities during the construction phase by 

the Consulting Engineer; (ii) environmental monitoring, which will notably concern ambient air 

quality, groundwater and receiving environment water quality, as well as noise and vibration. 

Monitoring will cover the construction and operation phases.  

3.2.8. The recommendations and measures ensuing from the environmental and social 
assessment should be set out and inserted: (i) for contractors, in the bidding documents (BDs) 

through environmental clauses, obligations, responsibilities and penalties, in the Climate Change 

Action Plan (CCAP) as well as in the price schedule (PS) and the bill of quantities (BoQ); (ii) for 

the Consulting Engineer, who shall ensure the presence of two environmental and social/gender 

development experts. 

3.2.9. Climate change: the project is classified under Environmental Category 2 following the 
assessment of the Climate Safeguards System (CSS), in accordance with the Adaptation Review 

and Evaluation Procedures (AREP). In Zaghouan region, climate parameters are highly variable in 

time and space. Rainfall is moderate and very irregular (245 to 625 mm/year). Owing to torrential 

rains, exacerbated by extensive overgrazing, deforestation and poor conduct of agricultural works, 

water erosion is one of the major factors of soil degradation that has reached worrying levels. 

Climate change results in increased average annual temperature and a decrease in average rainfall, 

which affect water resources, ecosystems, agriculture, infrastructure and the occurrence of extreme 

weather events such as floods, snow and hailstorm. Thanks to its activities, PDPFA-GZ is a project 

for climate change adaptation and risk mitigation. It will enhance the climate change resilience of 

vulnerable groups, especially women and youths, as well as production systems. The project will 

significantly reduce water erosion, improve land production capacity and preserve biodiversity. It 

will confine farmers to the irrigation schemes developed, thus reducing their relocation from 



 

13 

 

farming areas in the south to the north of the Governorate. The PMU and CRDA will work to 

incorporate climate information into participatory development plans (PDPs) and encourage 

farmers to take into account climate information in the agricultural calendar. 

3.2.10. Gender issues: the project is classified under Category II of the Gender Marker (existence 
of gender effects and need for an action plan and budget to ensure gender action). In Zaghouan 

Governorate, women are massively involved in agricultural activities. They represent 46% to 51% 

of the family farm labour force, 25% of the permanent paid labour force and 51% of the casual paid 

labour force. They play a particularly important role in livestock production-related activities, 

especially milk production which employs 43% of working women. However, there are gender 

inequalities regarding decent and sustainable jobs, access to land and credit, and differences in 

wages. Women are also poorly represented in professional organisations and rarely access decision-

making bodies. The project will implement special measures for women (and other vulnerable 

groups) to ensure that they benefit from the positive impacts of the project in terms of developing 

their economic activities, creating jobs, reducing the workload and economic empowerment. Thus, 

the project will promote rural activities for which women have proven expertise (olive oil, market 

gardening, aromatic and medicinal plants, organic and local products, etc.) and from which they 

can earn decent income.  

3.2.11. Specifically, the project will ensure that women have access to 40% - 45% of plots with 
land titles in the new public irrigation schemes (PIPs), against 10% -15% currently. The training 

and coaching programme for agricultural entrepreneurship, viable business incubation and support 

for settlement in the new PIPs will concern at least 200 women entrepreneurs who will benefit from 

funding worth about TND 1.5 million set up. It will target women-owned micro-, small- and 

medium-size enterprises (MSMEs) with high growth potential organised within mutual agricultural 

service companies (SMSAs) and agricultural development groups (GDAs). In addition, there will 

be intermediation with local financing entities to enable the greatest number of women (at least 

60%) and vulnerable people to benefit from credit facilities to develop a business. Furthermore, the 

project will support the marketing and commercialisation of women’s products through the 

development of product sales points. In addition to this specific support, the project will closely 

monitor the inclusive and equitable participation of women and youths in implementing all 

activities, sharing the benefits and enhancing their economic empowerment and decision-making 

power. This will give women better social visibility and strengthen their socio-economic status. 

3.2.12. Social issues: one of the objectives of PDPFA-GZ is to reduce inequalities within 
Zaghouan Governorate and raise the region to align with the level of national economic and social 

development indicators. As a result, it will promote social cohesion in the Governorate. The 

strengthening of associations (GDAs) and cooperatives (SMSAs) promotes consultation and the 

development of a solidarity-based economy. There will be a remarkable impact on food and 

nutrition security. The expected outcomes in terms of employment are significant. The project will 

strengthen the employability of women and young people through vocational training. The 

combination of irrigation facility development works, technical training, access to means of 

production for the poorest, financing of IGAs and entrepreneurship, WSC works, promotion of 

local organic subsectors and products will generate additional income for the population (estimated 

to be at least 50% of current income). This will encourage the consumption of social services such 

as education and health, and thus enhance the value of social capital. 

3.2.13. Youth employment and promotion of agricultural entrepreneurship: access to credit 
is one of the major constraints facing rural MSMEs in the region. Investment in agriculture is a 

risky activity that requires risk sharing by all stakeholders in the value chain. The project will 

promote agricultural entrepreneurship among young people (men and women) and initiators of 

innovative projects by providing more flexible financing adapted to the constraints of each operator 



 

14 

 

involved in the value chain through the establishment of a strategic partnership with financial 

institutions. In this connection, 300 young people (girls and boys) will be trained in agricultural 

entrepreneurship and set up in all the lin ks of the value chain, namely: production in the developed 

PIPs, processing, trade and services. This initiative ultimately seeks to reach nearly 1500 people 

through its multiplier effect. In terms of support and to optimise project sustainability and the 

conquest of new markets, the project will build the capacity of promoters and enhance aspects 

related to the improvement of development and sales techniques, marketing conditions, required 

quality standards, facilitation of the “organic” certification process, visibility and access to 

profitable markets. Incubation centres (Mograne School Nursery, the Zaghouan Business Centre, 

etc.) will also be solicited for training in entrepreneurship and development of business plans to 

foster easy access to available financial resources. Lastly, the project will support the constitution 

of potential aggregators (SMSAs, private companies, etc.).  

3.2.14. Involuntary resettlement: considering that the engineering studies carried out with Bank 

financial support did not take into account the aspects related to the freeing of the rights-of-way for 

the execution of works planned and the possible risks of expropriation, the Bank requires the review 

of the said studies to take these aspects and risk mitigation into account (selecting the appropriate 

variant and clearly defining the indemnification/compensation measures envisaged in such a case). 

Meanwhile, the CRDA has with Bank assistance submitted a Comprehensive Resettlement Action 

Plan (CRAP) outlining the general principles that will guide all expropriation operations under 

PDPFA-GZ. It defines the procedures to be followed for prior recognition of expropriation and 

indemnification/compensation rights. It specifies the indemnification/compensation mechanism 

and the redress mechanism, and identifies the institutional arrangement and capacity building for 

the implementation of expropriation and complaint processing procedures. CRAP is a contractual 

document by which the Tunisian Government, in collaboration with the local authorities and in 

accordance with SO2 requirements and procedures, formally undertakes to respect the 

indemnification/compensation rights of any potential project affected person or entity. The cost of 

implementing CRAP (RAP implementation, indemnification/compensation, operation, capacity 

building, implementation monitoring, etc.) will be fully funded by the Borrower. 

3.2.15. CRAP will be set out as a resettlement action plan (RAP) latest prior to project launching, 
for implementation by the CRDA. The submission of the final RAP will be the subject of a specific 

disbursement condition precedent to financing the specified works. 

IV. Project Implementation 

4.1. Implementation Arrangements 

4.1.1. Implementation arrangements: the Zaghouan Regional Office for Agricultural 
Development (CRDA) will manage and coordinate the project. It will set up a Project Management 

Unit (PMU) comprising a Project Coordinator, an Administrative and Financial Officer assisted by 

an Accountant, a Procurement Specialist, a Monitoring and Evaluation Officer and a team of 

consultant facilitators. The PMU will be responsible for coordination and planning, monitoring and 

evaluation, preparation of annual programmes and budgets, financial management, procurement 

and preparation of project progress and audit reports. It will rely on the various technical 

directorates and sub-departments of the CRDA for technical supervision, extension services, works 

control/monitoring, and regular evaluation of ESMP implementation. It will also rely on dedicated 

facilitators to be deployed routinely at the local level closest to beneficiaries (GDAs, farmers, 

women and youths). In addition to equipment and logistics, the PMU will benefit from technical 

support, training and capacity building in environmental and social management and monitoring as 

provided for in the ESMP. 



 

15 

 

4.1.2. Based on agreements to be concluded for some activities, the PMU will use specialised 
institutions and NGOs, notably the Chott-Mariem Organic Agriculture Centre (CTAB) for organic 

agricultural support, the Chott-Mariem Horticulture and Organic Agriculture Research Centre 

(CRRHAB) for the development of rosehip cultivation, the Office of Livestock and Pasture (OEP) 

for the development of the dairy sub-sector, genetic improvement, creation of an insemination 

circuit, training and supervision of stock breeders, the National Institute of Agronomic Research, 

Tunis (INRAT) for the development of fodder crops and improvement of nutritive value, and the 

Mograne School and AVFA for the supervision of farmers, CRDA technicians and business 

incubation.  

4.1.3. The project will be coordinated at the national level by the National Projects Coordination 
Committee (CNC) chaired by the Minister of Agriculture, Water and Fishery Resources or his/her 

representative and comprising representatives of the general directorates of the Ministry of 

Agriculture, representatives of the Ministry of Development, Investment and International 

Cooperation, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Equipment and Housing, and the Ministry 

of Local Affairs and Environment, among others. Project activities will be coordinated at the 

regional level by the Regional Development Board (CRD) chaired by the Governor and comprising 

elected representatives of the region as well as regional government representatives.  

4.1.4. Procurement arrangements: all procurement of Bank-financed works, goods and 
consultancy services will be in accordance with the Procurement Framework for Bank Group-

Funded Operations (“AfDB Procurement Policy”), October 2015 edition, and with the provisions 

set forth in the Financing Agreement. Pursuant to this policy and considering the various 

assessments conducted, the following groups of transactions have been identified for 

implementation using the various systems below: 

(a) Bank Procurement Methods and Procedures (BPMPs): all selections of consultants will be 
in accordance with the Bank’s procurement system (AfDB System) using Bank bidding 

documents (BDs). The use of the Bank system for such procurement is attributable to the 

weaknesses identified in the national system, including the inappropriate mechanism for 

opening consultants’ bids, the absence of a minimum technical qualification score in some 

methods, etc. 

(b) Tunisia’s Procurement System (TPS):  the procurement of works and goods will be done in 
accordance with Tunisia’s procurement system (National System) embodied by Decree No. 

2014-1039 of 13 March 2014 regulating public procurement ("DMP"), via bidding 

documents (BDs) commonly used in Tunisia.  

4.1.5. Details on this procurement and related control mechanisms are presented in Annex B.5 

4.1.6. Procurement risk and capacity assessment: the country, sector and project procurement 
risks were assessed and the outcomes used to guide the selection of the procurement system 

(Borrower or Bank) to be used for specific activities or group of similar activities under the project. 

The assessment of the Executing Agency’s procurement capacity was carried out. Appropriate risk 

mitigation measures have been included in the action plan presented in paragraph B5.9 of Annex 

B5. 

4.1.7. Advance contracting:  considering the Borrower's tight schedule, and to address the issue 
of accelerating project implementation pursuant to PD 02/2015, studies prior to the procurement of 

works planned for the first year of the project may, at Government’s request, be implemented 

through advance contracting, in accordance with the provisions of Article 11.2 of the AfDB 

Procurement Policy. The procedures and methods to be used for these advance actions will be the 

same as those chosen for the project. In this regard, a request stating the reasons (indicating the 



 

16 

 

procurement concerned), together with a procurement plan, will be submitted to the Bank. In turn, 

the Bank will analyse the reasons mentioned and take a decision. 

4.1.8. Specific conditions arising from the use of the National Procurement System - Additional 
Waiver on Eligibility: 

(i) Eligibility-related waiver: the Bank’s resources for financing the project will come from the 
AfDB window. As a result, the eligibility rules specific to the window are a priori 

applicable. Following the assessment of procurement risks and capacity, it was decided that 

the National Procurement System will be used for part of this project. Given that the 

eligibility rules for public procurement under Tunisian law are not the same as those of the 

AfDB window, it is necessary to avoid any practical incompatibility. To this end, and for 

the component implemented using the national public procurement system, PDPFA-GZ will 

benefit from a partial waiver (only contracts of a specified size are concerned) granted by 

the Bank's Board of Directors (“the Board”) in March 2017 (see Document 

AfDB/BD/WP/2016/184/ Rev.(2) for the non-application of the rule of origin of the AfDB 

window (as provided for in Article 17.1.d: “Operational Principles” of the Agreement 

Establishing the African Development Bank (so-called Rule of Origin) for all goods 

contracts of up to UA 1 million, all consultancy contracts up to UA 300 000 and all works 

contracts below or equal to UA 6 million financed by AfDB window resources and 

concluded in accordance with a national procurement system. Given that no contract 

exceeding the above thresholds is provided for under PDPFA-GZ, no additional waiver will 

be required. Thus, the eligibility rules applicable to all contracts concluded under this project 

according to the Tunisian public procurement system will be the national eligibility rules, 

in addition to the provisions of paragraphs 5.2 to 5.10 of the AfDB Eligibility Policy. 

Consequently and for information purposes, even if the national system is used, Bank loan 

resources would not be used to finance a contract awarded to a bidder under AfDB Group 

sanctions. In the event where, these provisions notwithstanding, a contract is concluded with 

a bidder under Bank Group sanction, the contract will not be financed by AfDB loan 

resources. The list of companies under sanction can be consulted at 

http://www.afdb.org/debarred. 

(ii) Other specific conditions proposed: to be able to perform its fiduciary obligations in 
connection with the use of the National System, the Bank has agreed with the Borrower on 

a series of measures the reasons, objectives and details of which are presented in paragraph 

B.5.7.2 of Annex B5.  

4.1.9. Financial management:  the Zaghouan CRDA will ensure project financial management 
through the Project Management Unit (PMU) to be created within it. Financial execution will be 

based on the budgetary system, the public expenditure execution and control system in force at the 

CRDA governed by the Code of Public Accounts, and the circulars on public fund management. In 

this regard, the PMU will benefit from the technical support of the subdivisions of the 

Administrative and Financial Division, the collaboration of the subdivisions of CRDA’s Technical 

Divisions, the Pay Accountant (Comptable Payeur) under the authority of the Regional Treasurer, 

and the Regional Controller of Public Expenditure under the supervision of the Head of 

Government. The project's financial management staff will comprise a Project Manager and an 

Administrative and Financial Officer assisted by an Accountant, all appointed from among CRDA 

staff. The PMU will be responsible for preparing annual work programmes and budgets (AWPBs), 

implementing the AWPB and preparing interim financial reports and annual financial statements. 

To better incorporate the PMU into the CRDA management system, the duties of its members 

should be clearly defined. 



 

17 

 

4.1.10. Disbursements:  the loan will be disbursed in accordance with Bank rules and procedures. 
The special account method and the direct payment method defined in the disbursement manual 

will be used to withdraw loan funds. The use of the special account method will be subject to the 

opening of a special account in the name of the project at the Central Bank of Tunisia (BCT). This 

account will only receive loan resources. During negotiations, a draft disbursement letter will be 

presented and agreed upon by the Bank and the Borrower. It will be sent to the Borrower’s 

representative upon loan approval by the Bank’s Board of Directors. In accordance with the 

provisions of the disbursement manual, and subject to prior Bank approval, it is possible, during 

project implementation, to change the disbursement methods adopted.  

4.1.11.  Auditing: the General Finance Control (CGF) will conduct the external audit based on the 

terms of reference approved by the Bank. The Borrower will transmit the audit report to the Bank 

within six (6) months following the end of the financial year audited. The PMU will be responsible 

for implementing audit recommendations aimed at improving sound project financial execution. 

An annual procurement audit will be conducted for contracts awarded in accordance with the 

national system. 

4.2. Monitoring 

4.2.1. Monitoring mechanisms: the project monitoring and evaluation mechanism will be 
designed taking into consideration the specific project objectives and the expected outcomes of the 

Strategic Development Plan (SDP) for the agricultural sector, and aligned with the public projects 

monitoring system (“INJEZ”) currently used by the Ministry of Agriculture, Water Resources and 

Fishery (MARHP). A participatory monitoring and citizen control mechanism provided by the 

SMSA and GDA will also be set up in line with the principle of accountability now recommended 

within the context of results-based management.  

4.2.2. Internal monitoring and evaluation will be carried out by the PMU and will cover project 
physical (overall and component implementation rate) and financial (commitment rate and 

disbursement rate) monitoring, gender mainstreaming in activities and inputs, and their adequacy 

with projections.  The project monitoring/evaluation officer will collect and compile information 

on the physical and financial outcomes. This information will be used to prepare the project 

progress reports. The key reports that will be prepared during the project implementation phase 

are indicated in Table 4.1 below.

Development Board (CRD), in addition to the two annual supervision missions fielded by the 

Bank. The mid-term review will be conducted in Year 3. At project closure, the Bank and the 

Government will produce a completion report within the prescribed deadline. The main project 

implementation phases are summarised below.

4.3. Governance 

4.3.1. Tunisia is making significant progress in governance. With a score of 63.5 against an 
African average of 49.9, the country occupies the 9th position out of 54 countries in the Mo Ibrahim 

Index of African Governance (IIAG-2018). Similarly, with Bank assistance, the country embarked 

on the implementation of a public procurement reform action plan that resulted in the adoption in 

2014 of a new decree on the regulation of more transparent public procurement. The country 

fiduciary risk assessment (CFRA) carried out showed that the internal public finance management 

control system is appropriate. Generally, economic governance has improved and competition 

enhanced. Under the PDPFA-GZ specifically, land tenure governance will be promoted through 

land consolidation support and the issuance of land titles to farmers (both men and women) in the 

new public irrigation schemes. Transparency measures will also be applied in the selection of 

beneficiaries with the full participation of farmers’ representatives. Likewise, a participatory 

monitoring and citizen control mechanism will be set up in line with the principle of accountability 

recommended within the context of results-based management. 

4.4. Sustainability  

4.4.1. The project has adopted the participatory approach, which enables greater ownership of 
development activities by project beneficiaries who will contribute significantly (about 30%) to 

infrastructure financing and management (PIPs, boreholes, catchment ponds, product development 

units, etc.). Sustainability also relies on water and soil conservation (WSC) and water-saving 

measures, including groundwater recharge, sealing of the entire water transport and drip irrigation 

system to save water and control flow rates recorded. The PMU will conclude collaboration 

agreements with specialised institutions for organic agricultural support, rosehip research and 

development, development of the diary sub-sector and genetic improvement, fodder crop 

development and supervision of farmers and CRDA technicians. To enable these entities to play 

their role fully, they will be supported through specific training in agricultural advisory schemes, 

farmers’ organisation, management, monitoring and evaluation. The use of the “value chain” 

approach with the mainstreaming of product processing, storage and marketing aspects will help to 

incorporate all subsector links and further connect production to markets. Thus, setting up small 

economically, financially and ecologically viable product processing units will guarantee the 

sustainability of project achievements. Furthermore, the project will ensure crosscutting integration 

and mainstreaming of environmental and social aspects, hygiene and food safety, in line with the 

Bank's environmental and social safeguards, and the standards and requirements of profitable 

markets. The sustainability of project operations will also be guaranteed through the effective 

involvement of the local private sector, financial institutions and enterprises in the “aggregation” 



 

19 

 

model to ensure the sustainable establishment of young agricultural entrepreneurs and their access 

to financing and markets.

and the issuance of land titles, following an 

inclusive process, will mitigate this risk.  

Climatic hazards that can worsen the degradation 

of ecosystems and property, increase natural 

disasters and render the population more 

vulnerable 

Moderate Drip irrigation, protection of vulnerable areas, 

opening up of roads and incorporation of climate 

information into the design of facilities will 

mitigate this risk.  

Lack of transparency in the selection of 

beneficiaries, weak monitoring of technological 

innovations by the communities and weak 

capacity of technical services and companies 

Low The definition of beneficiary selection criteria 

with the active participation of farmers’ 

representatives, the adoption of a participatory, 

inclusive and collaborative approach, and the 

building of the capacity of all stakeholders will 

mitigate this risk 

Limited access of farmers to financial resources 

that can annihilate project efforts to create 

sustainable jobs and generate decent income 

Moderate Training in agricultural entrepreneurship and 

forging of partnerships with MFIs for rural 

financing will mitigate this risk. 

4.6. Knowledge Building  

4.6.1. The project will finance a study to update groundwater balances. It will support the 
strengthening of the piezometric measuring network for groundwater level monitoring and control. 

The findings of these studies and measurements will feed a database at the CRDA to enable 

appropriate programming of future agricultural development operations, especially irrigation. The 

project will also build CRDA's capacity to make an optimal use of all the knowledge acquired 

mainly from experts, and finance stakeholder exchange sessions for better sharing of information 

collected. The PMU and CRDA will work to incorporate climate information into participatory 

development plans (PDPs) and encourage farmers to include climate information in the agricultural 

calendar. Such information will also be shared with the weather monitoring networks to identify 

risks of natural disasters and contribute to the rational and predictive management of such risks. In 

addition, gender-based monitoring and evaluation will contribute to the development of knowledge 

in this sector and help to advance gender considerations in other bank operations in the agricultural 

sector. Lastly, the project will establish an integrated system for managing and sharing knowledge 

on project activities through regular dissemination on MARHP’s website, in order to build on and 

manage the knowledge and experience acquired.
