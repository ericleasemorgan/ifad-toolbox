PROJECT SUMMARY 

1. The Savannah-Based Agricultural Value Chains Development Support Project 
(PADECAS), jointly financed with the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) 

seeks to sustainably grow food and beef production. PADECAS, which will span five years (2019-

2023) and cost UA 22.1 million (CFAF 17.3 billion) including an UA8.28 million grant from the 

Bank, will be implemented in the Prefectures of  Lobaye, Ombella-Mpoko and L’Ouham Péndé. The 

project will target around 60,000 households with over 500,000 direct beneficiaries.  

2. The agricultural sector employs 66% of the labour force and accounts for 23% of GDP. The 
agricultural and livestock sectors together employ 63% of poor households. Thanks to the agricultural 

sector assessment and ongoing operations, the project intervention will target five promising sectors: 

cassava, beans, maize and rice for plant production and cattle for animal production. The value chains 

approach was adopted to boost productivity and agriculture production through the introduction of 

innovative technologies that will enhanced the competitiveness of the sectors. The project will also  

involve the development  of infrastructure to support the sector. Lastly, the project aims to boost 

inclusive development in the sectors, particularly by encouraging the involvement of women and 

young people and improving access to affordable financing and the marketing of productions.  

3. CAR went through an unprecedented political and security crisis between 2012 and 2015. 
Two years after a return to constitutional order and the establishment of all democratic institutions, 

the security situation remains extremely fragile. Indeed, less than 40% of the territory is controlled 

by the Central African State. The crisis had devastating effects on the agricultural and livestock 

sectors,  and led to food and nutritional insecurity as well as increased poverty. In this context, 

improving agricultural and livestock production became an urgent priority for the Government. 

4. PADECAS stems from the CAR Government’s desire to make the agriculture and livestock 
sectors participate actively in the quest for economic growth capable of generating jobs and 

substantial incomes for rural communities. The project is perfectly in line with the Bank’s Ten-Year 

Strategy (2013-2022), especially 2 of High-fives: “Feed Africa” and “Improve the quality of life for 

people in Africa. It is also consistent with the Strategy for Agricultural Transformation in Africa, 

2016-2025; the Strategy to Address Fragility and Strengthen Resilience in Africa (2014-2019); the 

Youth Employment Strategy in Africa; and the Bank’s Technologies for African Agricultural 

Transformation (TAAT) Programme which seeks to disseminate agricultural technologies to boost 

productivity and agricultural production in the selected five sectors.  

5. PADECAS will experiment on a pilot basis: (a) new technologies for increasing 
productivity; (b) inclusive funding mechanisms; and (c) youth entrepreneurship. In addition, a 

mechanism will be put in place to monitor dynamics of the food and cattle sub-sectors as well as the 

initiative designed to extend social protection to rural areas. The sum of these interventions will serve 

as pilot experiments for the Bank in the Central African Republic and generate invaluable knowledge 

for the future development of agricultural sub-sectors in the country and elsewhere in Africa. These 

interventions will be documented and will enable the Central African Government to redirect and 

better entrench its agro-pastoral development policies and strategies.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION BY BANK GROUP MANAGEMENT TO THE 

BOARD OF DIRECTORS CONCERNING A PROPOSAL TO AWARD A TSF AND 

ADF GRANT TO CAR TO FINANCE THE SAVANNAH AGRICULTURAL VALUE 

CHAINS DEVELOPMENT SUPPORT PROJECT  

(PADECAS) 

 

Management hereby submits this report and recommendations concerning a proposal to award 

UA 7.0 million and an ADF grant of UA 1.28 million to the Central African Republic (CAR) to 

finance the Savannah-Based Agricultural Value Chains Development Support Project in 

(PADECAS). 

 

I. STRATEGIC THRUST AND RATIONALE 
 

 National Context 

1.1.1 The outbreak of the March 2013 crisis 
led to the most serious security, political and 

humanitarian crisis in CAR's history. This 

political crisis gave rise to a difficult three 

years’ political transition, supported by the 

international community. The return to 

constitutional order, notably with the elections 

of February 2016, made it possible to form a 

Government regrouping several political 

parties. With the exception of the Senate, all 

republican institutions were set up within the 

constitutional period. The last reshuffle of the 

Government in September 2017 was 

representative, taking into account all the 

sociological and political diversity of the 

country, including representatives of armed 

groups. 

1.1.2 On the security front, the presence of 
the UN peacekeeping force (MINUSCA) of 

nearly 12,000 men has stabilized the country, 

despite the fact that less than 40% of the 

territory is controlled by the Central African 

Government. Community tensions and regular 

clashes between armed groups are common 

across the country. In addition, the formation of 

several armed groups, who now clash for 

control of some areas of the country's mineral-rich territory, hold back hopes of a swift 

appeasement of the situation. On the other hand, in rural areas, especially those with significant 

mineral resources, insecurity remains persistent and could continue until disarmament of armed 

groups is effective. Several mining sites have been taken over by these groups and the resulting 

looting of resources is funds the war and further weakens the capacity of the state to meet the 

urgent needs of the population. 

1.1.3 Despite this relatively volatile security situation, the Central African authorities remain 
strongly committed to implementing the Disarmament, Demobilization, Reintegration and 

Repatriation (DDRR) program, whose success is a key element of the Government's strategy to 

Text box 1: Summary of the main fragility factors in 

CAR 

The key factors of CAR’s  persistent fragility are many, 
complex, and intertwined. The country’s violent political 
history, malfunctioning institutions, previous failed 
disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration 
programmes and social exclusion have hindered social 

and national cohesion. The main challenges the country 
must tackle include: 

Restore security throughout the national territory and 

consolidate peace and national cohesion. Despite the 

return to constitutional order in 2016 and the 

establishment of key democratic institutions enshrined in 

the Constitution, insecurity persists and inter-community 

confrontations have continued in several localities of the 

country. Today the CAR Government controls only a 

very small part of its territory, and armed groups have 

split into numerous uncontrolled rebel factions, which 

has multiplied criminal activities. 

Limited productive capacity of businesses and their 

financial situation depressed by the plunder and 

destruction of their production tools. CAR is particularly 

vulnerable to external shocks because of poor economic 

diversification, including specialisation in primary 

products. Developing the private sector is crucial for the 

expansion and diversification of the economy. 

Poor development of economic infrastructure (transport, 

energy, ICT, water and sanitation). In the context of a 

vast landlocked country like CAR, the availability of 

infrastructure in quantitative and qualitative terms is a 

major factor for reducing fragility and poverty.

work for an inclusive peace. The process launched on August 30, 2017, allowed, the collection 

of weapons, the insertion of more than 200 ex-combatants in the socio-economic process and the 

incorporation of more than 200 others in the national army. 

 Project Linkages with Country Strategy and Objectives  

1.2.1 The country's medium-term development and socio-economic objectives are contained 
in the National Plan for Recovery and Peacebuilding (RCPCA, 2017-2021), adopted in October 

2016. This plan aims to create the foundations for 'sustainable and inclusive economic and social 

development, in particular through' the restoration and extension of the State throughout the 

national territory and massive public investment, in order to consolidate peace. 

1.2.2 PADECAS activities align with the pillars of the RCPCA. In addition, the project is in 
line with the two pillars of the CAR Country Strategy Paper (CSP) 2017-2021 Country Strategy 

namely: (i) Support for agriculture development and for social inclusion support infrastructure; 

and (ii) Strengthening of institutional capacity and governance. The project is also in line with 

the National Agricultural Investment and Food and Nutritional Security Programme (PNIASAN) 

and the National Employment and Vocational Training Policy Framework Paper (PNEFP).  

 Rationale for the Bank’s Intervention 

1.3.1 The agricultural sector employs 66% of the labour force and accounts for 23% of GDP; 
livestock is practiced by more than 80% of the rural population. The two sectors occupy 63% of 

poor households, and are thus crucial for improving food security and reducing poverty. The 

security crisis led not only to the loss of all inputs for agricultural and livestock production and 

the destruction and plunder of socio-economic facilities (storage facilities, markets, 

slaughterhouses, agricultural processing centres, etc.). The necessary support services for 

agricultural and livestock activities also declined during the crisis years. For example, only 4% 

of communes indicate that trade in inputs as fertilizers, seeds and phytosanitary products is 

conducted in their headquarters, which represents a 10% drop compared to the pre-2013 crisis 

period. Approximate 41% report the existence of veterinary services in their communes, 

representing a nearly 60% drop compared to the pre-2012 crisis situation.  

1.3.2 The food security situation remains disturbing. According to the 2016 National Food 
Security Survey (ENSA), about half of the population (48%), making up 2.1 million people, live 

in food insecurity. The crisis takes a heavier toll on women since 22% of urban women declare 

that their income sources are aid, gifts and family transfers, against 14% of men. For their part, 

rural women mostly depend on petty trading, agriculture and processing of natural products. The 

main income-generation- related constraints mentioned by households are the lack of capital to 

invest (61%), the lack of job opportunities (31%) and the lack of land /production equipment 

(27%).  

1.3.3 AfDB’s comparative advantage to implement PADECAS is that the project is in line 
with the Bank’s Ten-Year Strategy (2013-2022), especially 2 of High-fives: “Feed Africa” and 

“Improve the quality of life for people in Africa. It is also consistent with the Strategy for 

Agricultural Transformation in Africa, 2016-2025; the Strategy to Address Fragility and 

Strengthen Resilience in Africa (2014-2019); the Youth Employment Strategy in Africa; and the 

Bank’s Technologies for African Agricultural Transformation (TAAT) Programme which seeks 

to disseminate agricultural technologies to boost productivity and agricultural production in the 

selected five sectors.

 Donor Coordination 

1.4.1 In CAR, aid is the main source of financing for Government programmes. Aid 
coordination has been strengthened under the RCPCA. A Technical Secretariat has been 

established to monitor the implementation of TFP commitments. The Bank, through COCF 

played a key role in putting this mechanism in place.

II. PROJECT DESCRIPTION  

 Project Components 

2.1.1 PADECAS complements IFAD's Agropastoral Production Revival Project (PREPAS). 
It will be implemented through three components as follows: (i) Development of agricultural and 

animal sectors; (ii) Institutional support to the agricultural sector; and (iii) Project Coordination 

and Management. 

2.1.2 Component 1 aims to develop value chains for the cassava, maize, rice, bean, and 
bovine value chains. The project will introduce technologies to improve the productivity, 

processing and marketing of agriculture products. Through this component, the project will 

support farms and groups through an approach focused on the development of a strategy for the 

inclusion of women and youth in selected activities. The project will contribute to the 

establishment of the necessary agricultural and rural infrastructures that will allow the opening 

up of the production areas, as well as the storage, marketing of plant and animal productions. 

This component also aims to provide livestock farmers with the knowledge, skills and material 

resources to increase livestock productivity and production. 

2.1.3 Component 2 supports coordination and dialogue among actors in value chains through 
capacity building of support institutions (the Central African Institute for Agronomic Research 

(ICRA), the National Agency for Development of Agricultural Livestock (ANDE), National 

Federation of Central African Herders (FNEC), Central African Agency for Agricultural 

Development (ACDA)) and through support for partnership between stakeholders, including 

public-private partnerships. The Project will support the preparation, adoption and 

implementation of detailed policy documents, with the aim of improving governance and 



 

4 

 

enabling an effective transformation of the rural environment. These supports will target in a 

non-exhaustive way, seeds being the most decisive factor of production on which the efficiency 

of the other inputs depends. The project will work with the International Labor Office (ILO) to 

create conditions for youth and women's participation in value chains. 

 

2.1.4 Component 3 provides technical, administrative and financial management of the 
project.

 Technical Solutions Adopted and Alternatives Explored 

2.2.1 Discussions with the ministries responsible for agriculture and livestock and various 
stakeholders allowed for the consensual adoption of the project’s technical design centred on 

support for the vegetable and cattle sub-sector with private sector participation. The option 

adopted is to introduce proven technologies in the different value chain segments to increase 

their productivity and agricultural production. In addition, the project aims to stimulate and 

support private initiative and lend impetus to inclusive sub-sector development by encouraging

Titre   Brief Description Reasons for Rejection 

Integrated rural 

development project 

A rural development project 

encompassing all sub-sectors 

A traditional rural development project that 

does not rely on market-oriented and non-

market-related sectors will have limited 

effects on the incomes and employability of 

rural communities. young people and 

women 

Use of natural 

breeding 

Use of natural and uncontrolled 

breeding 

The results of natural breeding are usualy 

modest. The choice to use artificial 

insemination to improve cattle productivity 

is based on numerous advantages offered, 

namely:  

 Better disease control under tropical 
conditions;  

 Post-weaning performance improved 
 Carcass value improved and  
 More productive dairy replacement 

heifers 

Development of 

livestock as a 

dominant sector 

Implement project activities focused 

on intensive stockbreeding (imported 

breeds, close veterinary monitoring, 

feeding based on concentrates and 

cultivated fodder)  

 Veterinary treatment and intensive 
feeding cannot be afforded by most 

stockbreeders 

 Poor adequacy between human and 
institutional capacity and the practice of 

intensive stockbreeding 

 

 Project Type 

This intervention is an autonomous investment project.  

 Project Cost and Financing Arrangement  

2.4.1 The indicative project cost, net of taxes and customs duty, is estimated at about UA 
22.1 million (CFAF 17.3 billion), 52% of which in foreign exchange and 48% in local currency. 

The project financing includes UA 7 million, or CFAF 5.5 billion, by a TSF grant; UA 1.28 

million or CFAF 1.6 billion by an ADF grant; UA 12.8 million or CFAF 10 billion by an IFAD 

grant; and the rest, UA 1 million or CFAF 784 million constitutes the in-kind contribution of 

Government and beneficiaries. Project activities will span a period of five (5) years. The 

summary of project costs, financing distribution and expenditure schedule is presented in Tables 

4-8. 

2.4.2 The IFAD co-financing comes in the form of a project that will be implemented 
concurrently with PADECAS. IFAD is in the process of developing the project concept note 

which, once approved, will enable the preparation mission to undertake the studies for the 

proposed infrastructure. According to IFAD’s provisional schedule, these studies will be 

conducted at the end of 2018 or at the latest beginning of 2019.

 Project Target Area and Beneficiaries 

2.5.1 PADECAS will intervene in the prefectures of Lobaye in the southwest; Ombella 
Mpoko in the center-west and Ouham Pandé (Bozoum) in the north-west. With regard to support 

to the vegetable and animal sectors; the project area includes the following: (i) for Ombella-

Mpoko: Bimbo, Boali, Bossembele, Damara-Bogangolo; and (ii) for Lobaye: Boda-Mbaiki and 

Boganda-Boganangone. Added to this is Bozoum and Sakai for rice. The choice of these zones 

is justified by their accessibility to the security plan. The project will target about 30,120 

households to be added to the other 30,000 households of the PREPAS Project, making a total 

of 60,120 households with more than 500,000 direct beneficiaries. 

2.5.2 The main areas of the project, Ombella Mpoko and Lobaye, cover an estimated 
beneficiary population of about 1.5 million inhabitants, or 32% of the total population of the 

country. The young make up 61% of this population while women make up 50%. The prefecture 

of Ouham Pandé, which is predominantly young (63% of the total population) and female (51% 

of the population), is estimated at more than 60,000 inhabitants. Agriculture, which mobilizes 

more than 85% of the population, is the predominant sector for the prefecture's economy. Fishing 

Livestock and trade are also practiced. 

2.5.3 A landlocked area whose economy is essentially based on agriculture, the Préfecture of 
Lobaye has enormous potentialities that remain poorly exploited. In fact, of the nearly 2.3 million 

hectares of arable land, only 2% are cultivated each year. The region has a dense hydrographic 

network, 1.750 million ha of forest, 2.75 million ha of pasture and 2 800 km of road and rural 

roads of which only 12% are accessible by vehicle. The prefecture of Ouham Péndé, like the 

whole country, enjoys considerable assets. Its abundant rainfall and very fertile lands that 

facilitated the development of groundnut economy, earned it its former name of "the lung of the 

Central African economy." 

2.5.4 Lobaye belongs to the Guinea forest zone with 9 months of rainy season and 3 months 
of dry season and annual rainfall exceeding 1,600 mm. Mean annual temperature is 23° with 

relatively low thermal amplitude. Ombella Mpoko occupies the Guinean forest zone to the South, 

the Sudano-Oubanguian zone in the Centre and the Sudano-Guinean zone to the North. Peak 

rainfall varies between 1,200 to 1,500 mm per year. Temperatures range between 23 and 24°C, 

making the thermal gap low. Ouham Péndé (Bozoum) sits astride the Sudano-Oubanguian and 

Sudani-Sahelian climates. Rainfall ranges between 900 and 1,200 mm per year. This zone is 

typified by relative humidity with a more contrasted regime and longer periods of sunshine in 

the year, considering the country’s latitudinal position. Mean annual temperature is 25°C while 

the annual thermal amplitude is 6°C. 

 Participatory Approach in Project Identification 

2.6.1 This project was designed using an integrated participatory approach to improve 
beneficiary ownership and build the resilience of the rural poor. PADECAS design is the result 

of popular consultations (meetings and discussions) with stakeholders (rural population, NGOs, 

institutions, etc.) who expressed their views and concerns about the project’s objectives and 

technical choices during the identification, preparation and appraisal phases. Thanks to the 

participatory approach adopted, stakeholders supported the project objectives and technical 

choices. This same approach, used during the formulation stage, will be continued during project 

implementation. Different agricultural sector actors, State agents, the Chamber of Agriculture, 

NGOs, commercial banks as well as MFIs (micro-finance institutions) were all consulted.

 Consideration of Bank Group Experience  

2.7.1 The Bank’s portfolio is being implemented in an unstable security context, 
characterised by the occupation of three-quarters (¾) of the country by rebel factions. In these 

circumstances, project activities will preferably by located in safe areas to guarantee proper 

implementation with real impacts for the beneficiary population. The July 2017 review noted 

shortcomings in terms of project commencement time frames. The above lessons are reflected 

in the project design. This can be seen in the targeted choice of value chains and consequently a 

better concentration in terms of geography and actors. Government also took measures for final 

design studies to be completed and for the coordination team to be established as soon as possible 

to facilitate the commencement of the project.  

 Key Performance Indicators  

2.8.1 In the long term (2030), the key performance indicator is the rate of food and nutritional 
insecurity and the poverty rate. The rate of food and nutritional insecurity is expected decrease 

to 40% from 48% in 2016. In the medium term (in terms of outcomes), PADECAS will 

contribute to increase agricultural production marketed from 8 to 10t/ha for cassava; 1.5 to 4t/ha 

for rice; 0.85 to 1.5t/ha for maize; and 0.86 to 1.3t/ha for red beans. For animal production, 

additional milk production will increase to 10 liters/day from 1.5 liters per day in the optimal 

year of production. Commercial operators’ incomes (producers, agripreneurs, cooperators, 

collectors, processing operators, traders, etc) will also increase by over 100%. Similarly, the 

project will bring the creation of 1,500 permanent jobs and 3,000 temporary jobs, including 75% 

for women and youths through the creation of about 500 local businesses, making it possible to 

improve the quality and living conditions of the poor. 

III. PROJECT FEASIBILITY 
 Economic and Financial Performance 

3.1.1 Economic and financial performance concerned the trading results of the main selected 
foodstuff and animal products (milk and cheese) based on models integrating both project 

support for each value chain segment (production, collection, marketing and processing) and the 

promotion of agricultural entrepreneurship, especially for the youth.  

3.1.2 In terms of profitability, the project posts a satisfactory rate of economic rate of return 
(ERR) of 19% and a net present value (NPV) of CFAF 10.728 billion at 12% capital opportunity 

cost. A test was conducted to measure ERR sensitivity test to cost and revenue fluctuations. It 

revealed that raising investment costs or reducing project revenue by 10% will not have a very 

significant impact on the  economic rate of return of at least 13%. In contrast, this rate is sensitive 

to a simultaneous variation of 10% of costs and revenue. Indeed, if costs increase while revenue 

drops, the effect will be to reduce ERR to 12.4%.  

3.1.3 The real situation is far better because other economic benefits exist which are not 
quantified. These can be summarized as follows: (i) the upstream effects of additional revenue 

on providers (NGOs, businesses, suppliers, consultancy firms); (ii) the downstream effects of 

the generation of additional revenue on producers, traders and processing operators, most of 

whom are women. Foreign exchange costs will also reduce thanks to the significantly smaller 

import bill of food products in the balance of trade; and wealth will be created in the country due 

to the higher GDP induced by the generation of additional value added. For households, the 

project’s benefits include better feeding of vulnerable groups (children, women of child-bearing 

age and the elderly), a reduction of the medical bill and the painfulness of the work of the 

agricultural labour force, especially the female workers.

 Environmental and Social Impact  

Environment  

3.2.1 PADECAS is classified in Category II. The implementation areas for the infrastructures 
are defined and the project will not involve the resettlement of populations nor the restriction of 

their access to resources or means of life. considering the limited scope of the facilities that will 

be constructed and/or rehabilitated. An Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) 

was prepared from 6 to 21 August 2018 and posted on the Bank’s website on 3 September 2018. 

The PADECAS infrastructure will not generate any major negative environmental and social 

impacts. Most will not only provide an answer to real social issues (fight against unemployment, 

socio-economic integration of underprivileged persons, diversification of agricultural and 

pastoral production etc.), but also improve the beneficiary population’s living conditions and 

boost the rural, semi-urban and even national economy.  

3.2.2 No irreversible or large-scale negative impact was reported. Most impacts are 
temporary and time-bound (local nuisances and the dangers confronting workers and the public) 

during the construction phase (flow of waste water from slaughtering areas and the proliferation 

of solid and liquid wastes.). Possible negative impacts include: (i) air pollution by balls and rice 

sounds, transportation of construction materials (sand, gravels), carbon monoxide emissions 

from gasoline-driven rice hulling machines ; (ii) soil pollution linked to cattle and the 

immoderate use of fertilizers and/or pesticides by framers); (iii) risk of water pollution by the 

worksite, use of pesticides and fertilizers, wastes from slaughtering areas); (iv) destruction of 

plant cover; and (v) destruction and moving away of wildlife. 

3.2.3 To prevent these risks, the ESMP already developed will guide the various stakeholders 
in managing the impacts resulting from the activities in question. The cost of implementing the 

ESMP is 70,000,000 XAF. The project management unit will be responsible for the 

implementation of the ESMP. 

3.2.4 At the institutional level, the monitoring of the ESMP is under the responsibility of the 
Directorate General for the Environment and includes the monitoring, impact control and 

evaluation activities. The coordination of the monitoring of the implementation of ESMP is 

ensured by the Ministry in charge of the environment in collaboration with the administrative 

and local authorities of the project area, the Ministries in charge of Agriculture and Livestock 

and as well as local civil society organizations working in the project areas. 

Climate Change Adaptation 

3.2.5 The sectors considered the most vulnerable to climate change in CAR are in order of 
importance: agriculture, health, fishing, energy, water resources, livestock, forestry, wildlife, 

habitat, transport and industry. Although there is no baseline data on GHG emissions in project 

zones, a rise in these emissions is to be expected due to the development of agriculture, intensive 

stock-breeding, and increased road transport due to the production of agricultural and livestock 

products and sub-products and their evacuation to markets.  On the other hand, two mitigation 

actions will be carried out : (i) setting up of rice hulling units running on an energy-mix (gasoline 

and solar power) which can reduce CO2 emissions by 50% to process paddy into polished rice; 

and (ii) planting of hedges to demarcate areas allocated for intensification of stock-breeding as 

these will contribute to the sequestration of part of the carbon emitted. Other actions to be carried 

out  include: (i) the establishment of prairies for cattle fodder; (ii) the introduction of varieties of 

rice, maize, beans and cassava that are adapted to extreme weather risks; and (iii) the restitution 

of crop residues to cultivated soils.  The use of green fertilizers, the reduction of work on land 

and sprinkling of organic fertilizers will contribute to replenish the soil’s carbon stocks. 



 

10 

 

3.2.6 Weather vagaries (floods, late arrival of the rainy season, prolonged drought, etc.) will 
negatively affect the production level and hence, the products of processing. To remedy this 

situation, the project will need to set up on a concerted basis an early warning and control system 

to monitor these vagaries and build the capacity of stakeholders involved in the implementation 

of activities. As recommended, these actions are consistent with the Strategic and Operational 

Plan for CAR’s Climate Change Response for the 2017-2020 period. 

Gender   

3.2.7 Agriculture and livestock breeding are the main activities in the project intervention 
area. Although these activities employ men, women and youths, it should be noted that men 

control these two sub-sectors since cultivated land and cattle herds are mostly owned by them. 

The plant and animal sub-sectors have great economic potentials to create wealth and generate 

significant revenue.  That is why women and youths are excluded from their control. The 

discrimination women suffer in both sub-sectors is further heightened by social roles which 

determine the position of the woman. She is considered as a chattel belonging to her husband’s 

lineage if she is married or that of her father if unmarried. On the strength of that, she is 

recognized to have the right to only use but not to own property of any kind.  

3.2.8 Although empirical data shows that women and youths are present in different 
segments of the selected value chains, no reliable statistical data exists for characterizing their 

involvement in these sub-sectors. PADECAS will support the conduct of preliminary surveys on 

the participation of women and youths in the plant and cattle value chains. The aim is to collect 

as much information as possible to prepare strategies for action. Therefore, the project will help 

to prepare a gender profile in the selected value chains. Besides, the project plans to construct 

markets for agricultural and dairy products mostly controlled by women.  

Social  

3.2.9 PADECAS will have a sure impact on the population’s food insecurity, seen in 
increased production and better product quality from the five sub-sectors concerned. It will also 

improve the nutritional status of the direct beneficiaries of the support comprising about 60,000 

households including 55,000 children who are under 5 years old and 22,000 pregnant women 

and breast-feeding mothers who are the most vulnerable to malnutrition. Improving the 

nutritional status of women and children will contribute to reducing mortality and morbidity in 

the project areas. Indirectly, all nutrition-sensitive activities such as water/sanitation 

interventions will also contribute to the better nutrition of the population.  

3.2.10 The success of PADECAS’ advocated approach consisting in concentrating activities 
by intervention site will induce a process of self-satisfaction and popular support among the 

population. Due to proximity, this will allow for endogenous development throughout the project 

area, the only factor that can, in the medium-term, roll back poverty, unemployment and rural 

exodus. Youth and women’s entrepreneurship will help to reduce unemployment in the project 

area and increase the incomes of the most vulnerable segments of the population.  

 

IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION  
 

 Implementation Arrangements 

4.1.1 PADECAS will be placed under the joint supervision of the Ministry of Agriculture 
and Rural Development. MARD will supervise the project and, as such, coordinate interactions 

with other sector ministries, technical and financial partners as well as coordinate monitoring 



 

11 

 

and evaluation activities in relation to PREPAS. National-level consultation will be handled by 

a National Steering Committee (CNP) which will be established by a joint order of MADR and 

MESA. At the devolved level, consultation will be done within sub-prefectural Consultative 

Committees (CC) which will approve investment plans at their level and supervise 

implementation in order to ensure that they are aligned and consistent with regional strategies 

and other sector interventions. 

4.1.2 The project will be managed by the PPF Coordination Unit under way for the Support 
for the CAR Agricultural Transformation Strategy and Youth Agriculture and Agri-Business 

Entrepreneurship Promotion (PASTAC-PEJA) whose capacity will be strengthened by recruiting 

new experts. An Order of MADR to broaden the mandate of the PASTAC-PEJA Coordination 

Unit into the PADECAS Management Unit (UCG) must be signed before project 

commencement. Three area offices will be created in the project area within the sub-prefectures 

of Boda, Bouali and Damara. 

 Procurement Arrangements 

4.2.1 Applicable Procurement Policy and Framework :All procurement of goods, works and 
consultancy services financed with Bank resources will be done in accordance with the 

Procurement Policy for Bank Group-Funded Operations (AfDB Policy), October 2015 edition 

and the Methodology for the Implementation of the Procurement Policy of the African 

Development Bank. Details of procurement performance (system, cost, schedule, method, 

review type) agreed between the Borrower and the Bank are described in Technical Annex B.7.  

4.2.2 Procurement implementation: Project procurement will be carried out by a 
procurement expert of the Project Management Unit to be recruited through an open call. This 

expert will be recruited as soon as the project commences in order to carry out procurement 

activities as defined in Technical Annex B7 with the support of a Procurement Assistant, civil 

servant of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development to be appointed. To this end, the 

Central African Government has submitted to the Fund a request to authorize early actions for 

the following acquisitions: recruitment of an administrative and financial manager, a 

procurement specialist and an expert in monitoring and evaluation. 

4.2.3 Procurement Capacity and Risk Assessment (ERCA): In order to take the 
specificities of the project into consideration, the Bank assessed: (i) risks at the national, sector 

and project level; and (ii) the capacity of the executing agency. The results of these assessments 

concluded that the risk level for procurement is high and made it possible to determine that all 

project procurements will be carried out according to the Bank’s system, subject to the 

application of the mitigation measures proposed in paragraph 5.9 of Technical Annex B.5. 

 Financial Management  

4.3.1 The evaluation concluded that the Project Coordination Unit does not have the 

adequate and satisfactory financial management capacity to provide, with reasonable 

assurance, accurate and complete information in a timely manner on the status of the 

project as required by the Bank. The initial level of fiduciary risk related to aspects of 

financial management is considered high due to: (i) the absence of a manual of procedures 

incorporating the specificities of the PADECAS project; (ii) the size of the current fiduciary team 

which is not adequate to manage project funds. In fact, apart from the accountant, the team does 

not have an administrative and financial manager; (iii) lack of refresher training for the existing 

team (revised SYSCOHADA, cash management, disbursement procedures, internal control, 

etc.), this situation may cause the project to risk significant errors in the financial statements for 

the 2018 financial year; (iv) the absence of accounting software; and (v) the absence of an 



 

12 

 

independent internal inspection mechanism within the Unit (internal audit and / or financial 

controller). As a reminder, some of these weaknesses were identified by the evaluation mission 

of the PPF of July 2017, without a satisfactory evolution being observed. Arrangements have 

been formulated to reduce this level of risk. 

4.3.2 Financial Management Arrangements: The fiduciary responsibility for the 
implementation of the project lies with the Central African Republic through the Ministry of 

Agriculture and Rural Development. The Coordination Cell set up under the PPF will be 

responsible for the overall coordination, technical coordination and financial management of the 

project. 

4.3.3 Financial management of the project will be ensured through the implementation of the 
following system: (i) development of the manual of administrative, financial and accounting 

procedures in order to integrate the improvements provided by the new provisions of the revised 

SYSCOHADA standard. It should also describe the organization chart of the project with all the 

actors involved in its implementation, the roles and responsibilities and activities of each actor, 

(ii) organize training in the revised SYSCOHADA, cash management and internal control for 

the benefit the entire Project fiduciary team; (iii) recruitment of an administrative and financial 

manager; (iv) validation of financial reporting formats within three months of effectiveness to 

improve the quality and timeliness of financial statements required by the Bank, (v) in the 

absence of an internal auditor, ensure the involvement of the financial controller of MADR in 

the chain of validation of expenditure and disbursement. In addition, the Coordinator should be 

personally involved in the proper functioning of the internal control system. Before the 

disbursement of resources for capacity building, ensure the implementation, and control by users, 

management tools for the periodic establishment of accounting, budget, and financial reports and 

financial statements closing date. 

 Disbursements  

4.4.1 Disbursement of the FAD and TSF resources under the project will be done pursuant to 
the provisions of the Disbursement Handbook in force at the Bank. For ADF resources: the direct 

payment method for the payment of goods and works. For TSF resources: (a) the special account 

method (for operating expenses, capacity building activities, and the management of certain 

partnership agreements) and (b) the direct payment method for the payment of works , goods 

and service contracts. 

4.4.2 The opening of the XAF-denominated special account for TSF resources, for 
PADECAS, under the responsibility of MADR will be carried out in a local bank deemed 

acceptable to the Bank. All supporting documentation for project expenditures (all funding 

combined) will be filed and maintained in a secure location and in accordance with the Law. 

These supporting documents must be available and accessible for review / audit / audit by 

periodic Bank supervision missions, external audits and internal audits. 

 Audit Arrangements 

4.5.1 Pursuant to the general conditions of the Bank, an annual audit of financial statements 
including, will be performed by an independent audit firm which will be recruited on a 

competitive basis. MADR’s PMU will be responsible for recruiting the independent audit firm 

with the support of the Unit’s Procurement Expert. The selection of the firm will be done 

according to Bank procedures. The auditor’s terms of reference will comply with the model in 

force at the Bank, and submitted for the latter’s approval.  



 

13 

 

4.5.2 The contract with the auditor will not exceed three years and the acceptance by the 
Bank of the first audit report is a prerequisite for the auditor to continue his work. The scope of 

the audit will cover all project activities, all sources of funding, as well as the activities of the 

value chain development fund. Audits reports shall be transmitted six months after the end of the 

fiscal year at the latest. 

 Project Monitoring and Evaluation   

4.6.1 The basic tool for monitoring and evaluation of this project is the logical framework 
that details the impact, effect and product measurement indicators. The PADECAS monitoring 

and evaluation officer who will be recruited after approval by the Bank of his qualifications and 

experience will be placed under the authority of the coordinator. He/she will be responsible for 

the monitoring and evaluation of project activities and the implementation of the ESMP. He/she 

will also be responsible for establishing a diagnosis and baseline situation for the project as well 

as developing specific tools for planning and data collection 

4.6.2 The PMU will be required to provide the Bank with a quarterly report showing progress 
in implementing the approved program and annual budget. This report should include the 

following information for each activity: the physical objectives, the level of achievement and the 

explanation of any discrepancies, the expected costs and actual costs, and the explanations of 

any discrepancies, the financial data of the project. The Bank will carry out two (2) supervisory 

missions per year to assess progress in terms of realization of products and effects as well as 

administrative and financial performance. The mission will then make recommendations to 

improve project implementation. A performance status report will be written after each 

supervision mission. A review will be scheduled mid-term and a project completion mission at 

the end. The project implementation schedule is summarized below.

 Governance 

4.7.1 The multi-sector good governance challenges (environment, agriculture, livestock etc..) 
to be tackled include lengthy time frames and transparency in procurement, the establishment of 

a reference framework for planning investments, transparency in the financial management of 

works maintenance associations and obstacles to the implementation of sub-regional and 

regional policies. However, the management of public resources and the state of corruption in 

the country require that greater attention be paid to procurement mechanisms. In this framework, 

PADECAS should be implemented to strengthen local institutions and improve citizen control 

through better involvement of civil society and farmers’ organisations. 

 Sustainability 

4.8.1 The fact of carrying out activities that meet stakeholder demands, global sub-sector 
needs and priority national and local guidelines while empowering national partner institutions, 



 

14 

 

is the main guarantee of the project’s sustainability. Since the selected value chains indeed exist 

already, the project places emphasis on strengthening their segments and on integrating them 

with a view to upgrading and professionalizing these sub-sectors. Besides, the targeted value 

chain actors (producers, stock-breeder, transporters, processing operators, research, supervision 

and support/advice structures, etc.) participated in project design and are committed to being part 

of its implementation and steering. The involvement of sub-prefectural consultative committees 

makes project ownership possible at the decentralized level. 

4.8.2 The works will be managed and maintained by the beneficiaries or communes. The 
sustainability of the project largely depends on the quality of the works and adequate 

management and maintenance conditions. It also depends on the level of ownership by actors 

and beneficiaries as well as the desire and commitment displayed by Government and devolved 

structures, mostly sub-prefectures, to provide long-term support for the management of 

structures and facilities constructed by the project. There are plans to mobilize technical 

assistance support under PREPAS to define a viable model for the management of all 

infrastructure that will be constructed as part of AfDB and IFAD projects to ensure their 

profitability and sustainability.  

4.8.3 Project actions will also serve to lay the foundations for the promotion of 
entrepreneurship within small foodstuff and market-gardening cooperatives as well as animal 

production cooperatives. In the same vein, project actions in areas such as capacity-building in 

entrepreneurial culture, business management, organisational dynamics of beneficiary groups 

and the management and maintenance of works will stimulate the emergence of small and 

medium-sized enterprises also taking into consideration the technical, financial and 

organizational dimensions. They will also foster inclusive and responsible growth. All these 

support packages taken together constitute additional guarantee of the sustainability of outputs 

while enabling the dynamic initiated to continue after the project ends. 

 Risk Management  

4.9.1 The risks that could limit the achievement of project objectives are related to: (i) the 
deterioration of the country's political and security situation and its spread in the project area; 

(ii) looting of project assets by armed groups; (iii) extreme weather events. The risks identified 

above will be mitigated by strengthening the efforts of the Government and the International 

Community to fight against insecurity and by integrating the adaptation dimension into the 

project activities. 

 Knowledge Building 

4.10.1 PADECAS will experiment on a pilot basis: (a) new technologies for increasing 
productivity; (b) inclusive funding mechanisms; and (c) youth entrepreneurship. In addition, a 

mechanism will be put in place to monitor dynamics of the food and cattle sub-sectors as well as 

the initiative designed to extend social protection to rural areas. The sum of these interventions 

will serve as pilot experiments for the Bank in the Central African Republic and generate 

invaluable knowledge for the future development of agricultural sub-sectors in the country and 

elsewhere in Africa. These interventions will be documented and will enable the Central African 

Government to redirect and better entrench its agro-pastoral development policies and strategies.
