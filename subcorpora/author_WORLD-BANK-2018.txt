B. Introduction and Context  
 
Country Context  
Benin is one of the world’s least-developed countries, with an annual per capita income of approximately US$830 in 
2017.  Poverty remains widespread, with a poverty rate of about 50 percent (US$1.90 a day poverty line – 2011 
purchasing power parity) in 2016. With an average per capita gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate of 1.4 percent 
(2007-2016) driven primarily by the services sector, poverty reduction has been limited, highlighting the need to ensure 
a broad-based and stronger growth. There are significant regional disparities in poverty rates and rural poverty rates 
are higher than those in urban areas. Fewer female-headed households fall below the national poverty line than male-
headed households. However, women continue to suffer from a lack of economic opportunity and are under-
represented in politics and in other high-level decision-making positions. 
 
The macroeconomic policy framework provides an adequate basis for the proposed operation. This assessment is 
affirmed by favorable medium-term growth prospects underpinned by continued strength in agricultural production 
and sustained investments. It is further strengthened by the Government commitment to meet the 2019 West African 
Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) fiscal deficit target; and the participation to the WAEMU and the prudent 
monetary policy at the union level. The Government macroeconomic and fiscal framework is supported by an 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) External Credit Facility (ECF) supported program which aims to address Benin’s 
balance of payments needs, and alleviate the impediments to inclusive growth and poverty reduction by creating fiscal 
space for infrastructure investment and priority social spending.  While public debt has risen in recent years, the results 
of the external debt sustainability analysis (DSA) show that Benin’s debt dynamics are sustainable, facing a moderate 
risk of debt distress. 
 
The operation supports Benin’s efforts to strengthen fiscal management; increase agricultural productivity and 
strengthen the financial viability of the power sector; and improve equitable access to education and health services.  
The introduction of a Policy Based Guarantee (PBG) as a part of the second operation aims to improve debt 
management. 
 

 
Relationship to CPF 
 
DPFs are a key instrument in the World Bank’s ongoing policy dialogue with the Government of Benin and its 
development partners. The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY13-17 (Report No. 75774-BJ) noted the importance 
of relying on a combination of development policy and investment operations in order to encourage a coherent 
approach to supporting structural reforms. The new Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for FY19-FY23 explicitly 
includes the current DPF series as a key IDA instrument for supporting Benin's structural transformation for 
competitiveness and productivity and notes that development policy operations (including the proposed operation) will 
target domestic revenue reforms designed to reduce Government reliance on revenues generated from imports 
informally re-exported to Nigeria.  Furthermore, the recently completed PLR, which extended the CPS for an additional 
year, and the forthcoming Country Partnership Framework (CPF 2018-2023) identified the need for new investments 
and reforms in agriculture as a priority – an area supported under this series. 
 
The success of Benin to attain the WBG twin goals in the coming years is highly dependent on its capacity to promote 
private sector development, which is the most efficient channel to create jobs and to reduce poverty. Achieving this 
goal will require an increase in the productivity of the agriculture sector and also require a regular and affordable supply 
of electricity, which is frequently noted as a leading constraint to private sector growth, particularly in the light 
manufacturing and agricultural processing sectors.  The DPF series aims at supporting the Government in its efforts by 
focusing on two main objectives. The first is to increase the productivity of the agricultural sector through a series of 
measures aimed at developing high value chains and improving the quality of agricultural products. The second 
objective is to strengthen the power sector financial viability and the reliability of electricity supply, which is consistently 
viewed as one of the key constraints by firms operating in Benin. 
 

 
C. Proposed Development Objective(s) 
 
The proposed operation supports Benin’s efforts to strengthen fiscal management; increase agricultural productivity 
and strengthen the financial viability of the power sector; and improve equitable access to education and health 
services. 

 
Key Results  
 
The measures supported by this DPF series are expected to strengthen fiscal management; increase agricultural 
productivity and strengthen the financial viability of the power sector; and improve equitable access to education and 
health services. The measures supported by the first pillar are expected to strengthen fiscal management by having a 
positive impact on tax compliance and revenue mobilization and by strengthening human resource management and 
promoting more efficient wage spending. The measures supported by the second pillar will have a short-term impact on 
technology for food processing, quality of agricultural products, and their market access; and a medium-term impact on 
the productivity of the agriculture sector. In addition, they will strengthen the country’s power sector financial viability by 
increasing the energy utility revenues and reducing arrears in the sector. Finally, the measures supported by the third 
pillar will are expected to improve access to education and health services in an equitable manner through a more effective 
deployment of newly recruited education and health personnel. 
 

D. Project Description   

 
In the context of rising public debt, this series supports stronger fiscal management (Pillar 1) through measures to 
increase revenue and use public resources efficiently. In the run-up to the 2016 Presidential elections, uncontrolled 
increases in the wage bill and off-budget expenses led to significant increases in public debt (by almost 20 percent of 
GDP) and in the fiscal deficit (from 1.9 percent of GDP in 2014 to 8 percent in 2015, including grants).  The fiscal deficit 
was reduced from 8 percent of GDP in 2015 to 5.9 percent in 2017 by containing public spending. The DPF series 
supports the authorities’ efforts to strengthen fiscal management by improving revenue collection and by managing 
public expenditure more efficiently, particularly wages and transfers. 
 
Increasing agricultural productivity and value addition and strengthening the power sector’s financial viability (Pillar 
2) is a Government’s priority. Addressing the challenges of the agriculture and power sectors is key to promote private 
sector development, which is the most efficient way to create jobs and to reduce poverty. Agriculture employs about 
50 percent of the population and is the economy’s leading formal sector foreign exchange earner. The country has a 
large endowment of arable and fertile land and adequate water resources. However, Benin’s comparative advantage in 
agriculture remains largely unexploited. The sector’s productivity can be improved, once deficiencies in the agriculture 
policy framework and governance structure are addressed and constraints to farming, such as limited access to input 
and output markets and food safety and quality are tackled. As for the power sector, the inconsistent supply of 
electricity is noted as a leading constraint to private sector growth, particularly in the light manufacturing and 
agricultural processing sectors. Strengthening the financial viability of the power sector is essential to increase 
electricity production capacity in a fiscally sustainable manner.  
 
A new third pillar will support to the reforms necessary to improve access to education and health services. This pillar 
is consistent with the new national development strategy that emphasizes the need to strengthen the delivery of social 
services with. While access to education and health care has improved over the last decade, it varies considerably across 
income groups and locations. A key challenge is the disparity in the allocation of primary school teachers and key health 
care staff (doctors, nurses and midwives) across regions, with a relatively low number of them allocated in poor and 
marginal areas of the country.  
 
The introduction of a Policy Based Guarantee (PBG) as a part of the second operation aims to improve debt 
management. The PBG is expected to partially guarantee a Euro-denominated commercial loan extended by 
international commercial banks at more favorable terms than existing CFA-denominated short-term debt. The PBG 
would support the Government’s debt management strategy which aims at increasing the diversification of public 
borrowing and reducing refinancing risks by extending tenor. The Government has expressed its intention to use the 
proceeds of the commercial loan to prepay existing and more expensive short-term debt accumulated on the domestic 
and regional markets. This would reduce the Net Present Value of public debt and lead to reduced interest payments 
over time.  
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

E. Implementation  
 
Institutional and Implementation Arrangements  
 


The Ministry of Economy and Finance is responsible for overall implementation of the proposed FRG series. The 
ministry’s Monitoring Unit for Economic and Financial Programs (Cellule de Suivi des Programmes Economiques et 
Financiers – CSPEF) leads the Government's technical team, with additional representatives from sector ministries 
participating as required. The Government has determined that the monitoring and evaluation of the DPF series and 
other externally financed budget-support operations will be based on performance indicators and targets set out in 
sector program budgets. Sector ministries collect data and transmit it to CSPEF, which analyses the data and produces 
periodic reports. This framework, which builds on the mechanism put in place for Benin’s PRSPs, supports the coordinated 
action and synergies between stakeholders involved in the monitoring and evaluation of the Government’s strategy and 
the provision of donor support. The donor community and the Government have agreed to an annual review process 
that includes quarterly review meetings, additional meetings on special subjects as needed, a mid-year progress review 
on the previous year’s aide memoire, individual sector reviews, a joint donor-government review mission and the 
preparation of a new aide memoire for the coming year. The World Bank is fully involved in this process, participating in 
and contributing to every element of it. 

 

F. Poverty and Social Impacts and Environmental Aspects 
 
Poverty and Social Impacts 
 

The FRG series is expected to have a positive impact on poverty reduction through different channels. Some of the 
measures supported will have a mostly indirect through stronger fiscal managemnet, improved public spending efficiency 
and productivity gains as well as job creation in the agricultural and no-farm sectors. This impact has been strengthened 
by the inclusion of the third pillar on human capital development that could have both a direct and indirect influence on 
the level and distribution of poverty.  
 
Prior Actions 1,2 and 3 support measures to strengthen fiscal management. These measures are expected to facilitate 
the delivery of essential public services and to contribute to a macroeconomic environment conducive to economic growth 
and private sector employment creation. Prior actions 4, 5, and 6 focus on increasing agricultural productivity and 
contribute to the Government’s poverty reduction goals. In 2015, 60 percent of the rural population lived below the 
US$1.90 per day poverty line. Limited agricultural growth (around 3.5 percent per year, which is approximately the rate 
of population growth in the country) has weakly contributed to poverty reduction. The development of value chains and 
diversifying production into more valuable crops should boost incomes of households involved in agriculture.  Prior actions 
supported in the power sector pillar (Prior actions 7 and 8) promote reliable access to electricity and a more cost-
effective electricity provision and should have a direct and positive impact on the poor. Only 29 percent of Benin’s 
households have access to electricity, and due to the significant disparities between urban and rural areas, only 6 percent 
of the rural population has access to electricity. The measures supported under this series will support the financial 
viability of the power sector. Furthermore, access to electricity liberates non-paid family time demands, particularly for 
women and girls, and further increases quality of life and opportunities for investment in human capital, including in girls 
and women. Increased and more reliable access at affordable prices should also have a significant impact on firm creation, 
firm growth and resultant employment opportunities, particularly in the higher productivity formal sector.  Prior action 9 
supports equitable access to education services and is expected to have indirect positive effects on poverty reduction. 
Schools quality play a determinant role in education outcomes. Improving school quality (through lower pupil to teacher 
ratios) is likely to improve learning outcomes and increase grade attainment. As education outcomes improve for the 
poor, they will have better job opportunities that offer higher earnings and security.  Prior action 10 supports equitable 
access to health services through the deployment of new health workers to underserved areas. Providing affordable 
health care service to the poor remains a challenge in Benin particularly in the rural areas.  Addressing health care needs 


of the poor requires a multidimensional strategy integrating availability of health services, their quality, and financial 
accessibility.  
 
Environmental Aspects 
 

The reforms and policy actions supported by the proposed operation are not likely to have significant negative impacts 
on the country’s environment, forests and other natural resources. In addition, all the potential environmental and social 
adverse impacts associated with activities supported by the current DPF will rely on the existing National legal and 
regulatory framework and then, will be monitored and addressed through the national procedures in place in Benin.  Over 
the last 20 years, the Government has made significant strides in mainstreaming environmental sustainability in projects. 
Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) is a legal requirement and it is widely applied to all developmental 
projects. Environmental assessment is a necessary condition to obtain the approval to implement any development 
project. It has been set up in Law N° 98-30 relating to the environmental framework and in Decree N° 2001-235 relating 
to the environmental assessment procedures. 
 
The prior action of strengthening the financial viability of the power sector is likely to produce climate change mitigation 
co-benefits since strengthening the financial viability of the sector is likely to promote the development of new energy 
efficient production capacities. In the agricultural sector, measures intended to diversify agriculture away from a reliance 
on cotton could have a potentially positive environmental effect as agriculture becomes less mono-culture based and 
increasingly diversified. 
 

G. Risks and Mitigation 

 
The overall risk level associated with this operation is substantial. Substantial governance, institutional capacity, and 
macroeconomic risks could adversely impact the PDO. Despite the substantial risk rating, staff believe that the potential 
benefits of the proposed operation outweigh the risks involved and warrant IDA’s assistance in proceeding with the 
operation and in implementing the critical reforms and policy actions supported by this operation, in coordination with 
other donors, along with appropriate risk mitigation actions.

INTRODUCTION AND CONTEXT 

 
A. Country Context 
The Independent State of Samoa (Samoa) is a small remote Pacific Island Country (PIC) with a population of 
approximately 197,000 people1. Samoa consists of two large islands (Upolu and Savai’i), and several smaller islands, it 
has a total land area of approximately 2,830 km2 and an exclusive economic zone of 131,000km2. Samoa is a stable 
democracy with steady growth supported by the tourism and agriculture sectors.  

 
Like many PIC’s, Samoa faces unique challenges to its economic growth, due to its small size, remoteness, high 
exposure to shocks and environmental fragility. Economic growth has picked up in recent years, and in FY2016 real GDP 
expanded by around 7 percent, much faster than originally forecast and a significant acceleration from growth of 
between 1 and 2 percent in the previous two years. Growth in FY16 was driven by tourism arrivals, lower fuel prices, 
and new fish processing facilities, as well as two major sporting events. Over the medium term, real GDP is expected to 
increase at an annual rate of around 2 percent2. However, it’s important to note that frequent natural disasters can 
distort this picture. Samoa was hit by Tropical Cyclone Evan in late 2012 and, according to the Damage and Loss 
Assessment3 caused an estimated US$210 million (30% of annual GDP) in damages and losses, including a loss of 49 
percent in crop and livestock GDP, and 5 percent in fisheries GDP. While Samoa has largely recovered from the effects 
of TC Evan, Category 5 Cyclones have been a 1 in 10-year event for Samoa.  
 
Samoa’s growth is also constrained by the high instances of obesity and noncommunicable diseases. Fifty-four percent 
of Samoa’s population is obese and 25 percent of people smoke and it is predicted that the economic burden of NCDs 
will reach as high as 8.5 percent of GDP by 20404. 
 
Samoa faces persistent challenges in securing prosperity for all and the incidence of hardship remains high. While 
extreme poverty is low, at 0.6 percent, basic needs poverty or ‘hardship’, is at 26.9 percent. Eighty-one percent of 
Samoa’s population live in rural areas and most households are engaged in some form of agricultural activity. While 
strong traditional family and community based safety nets are still effective in preventing extreme hardship, these 
traditional networks cannot manage local or country-wide shocks that affect most of their members, such as natural 
disasters. 

 
B. Sectoral and Institutional Context 
Sectoral context: In Samoa, and across the Pacific, agriculture and coastal fisheries play an important role in meeting 
subsistence needs. The most commonly produced crops are taro, banana and yam, and many households have small-
scale subsistence livestock production. In February 2017, ‘food and live animal’ imports were the top category of 
imports, accounting for 27.5 percent of total imports5, and in 2015, approximately 67 percent of all retail beef and 95 
percent of chicken meat was imported. Low cost and low quality food imports often crowd out domestic production 
and contribute (together with irrelevant food behaviors) significantly to the non-communicable disease crisis 
experienced in the region. On the other hand, fresh fish, particularly tuna, still constitutes one of the largest export 
commodities, accounting for 39 percent of exports in 20166, however in terms of contribution to GDP, fishing 
accounted for only 3.2 percent of nominal GDP in the July to September 2017 quarter.

According to the 2015 Samoa Agriculture Survey, 97 percent of households grow some crops or raise some livestock. 
For most of these households, agriculture is a secondary activity, growing crops for subsistence purposes only. Despite 
this, agriculture in Samoa is becoming more market-oriented; between 2009 and 2015, there was a 5.2 percent 
increase in agriculture households selling ‘some produce’ and a 4.4 percent increase in major crop households 
producing mainly for sale7.  
 
Based on the same survey, 21 percent of all households are engaged in fisheries activities, with the highest rate (37 
percent) in Savaii. Home consumption is the main purpose, representing 70 percent of those households in 2015. As a 
result of destructive fishing practices, near shore fish and fishery products had a steep decline in the early 1990’s, 
however conservation and management plans were put in place and anecdotal evidence suggests the sector is 
gradually recovering.  
 
Samoa’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is the smallest in the Pacific region and tuna longline fishery, particularly 
albacore, is the main offshore fishery. While tuna used to be the country’s largest export earner, recent years have 
seen a decline in the overall tuna catches, with a more than 50 percent reduction between 2009 and 2013.  
Transshipment operations by Taiwanese longliners began in Apia, Samoa in 2010. As of April 2012, there had been 34 
such operations, with 6 occurring in 2012.  Numerous smaller domestic longliners also transship in Samoa with the 
target market being the cannery in neighboring American Samoa. In 2014 Samoa signed onto the Tokelau Arrangement, 
a joint approach to managing the South Pacific Longline Fishery. 
 
Currently only 1 percent of Samoan’s are formally employed in the agriculture and fisheries sector, one third of these 
are women8. While female labor force participation overall increased between 2011 and 2015, paid farm work for 
women is still low, at its lowest comprising only 12 percent in Savai’i9. However, in line with the rest of Samoa, women 
engaged in farm work tend to have higher levels of education than men; in 2015 the percentage of women in farm 
households with tertiary qualifications was double that of men. It is also more likely that an educated farm labor force 
will be open to modern farming techniques and tools10. 

 
Agriculture in Samoa is very vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. Climate change is predicted to 
manifest itself in more frequent and extreme rainfall events, longer dryer spells and drought events, rising sea levels, 
extreme winds, and high air and water temperatures. According the World Bank’s Climate and Disaster Risk Screening 
Tool, this project is likely to face (i) a high level of exposure to climate and disaster hazards, (ii) high impact on physical 
infrastructure and assets as a result of those hazards and (iii) a high level of risk to the outcomes and service delivery of 
the project. More on the results of the Climate and Disaster Risk Screening tool can be found under the ‘Overall Risk’ 
section. 
 
The limited access to: (i) extension and veterinary services for farmers, (ii) markets, and (iii) financing services 
constitute the key bottlenecks to unlocking the agriculture potential in Samoa. Currently only one state Veterinarian 
services the entire country’s livestock needs and there is limited knowledge and available training for farmers wanting 
to try new or innovative practices. New regulations around food labelling and health and safety standards coming into

coconut trees; or more than 20 banana plants; or more than 20 other tree crops. 

effect will also create additional requirements for market access. However, if well accompanied, smallholders farmers 
could also benefit substantially from these. 

 
Institutional context: The Government of Samoa’s Agriculture Sector Plan 2016-2020 provides the framework to guide 
coherent programs and actions from all key stakeholders to achieve the goal of increased food, nutrition and income 
security in Samoa. Under this plan, additional attention is being paid to build the institutional capacity of the Ministry of 
Agriculture and Fisheries (MAF) to manage the sector-wide program. A lack of data was identified as a challenge to 
planning and monitoring in the agriculture sector, so the MAF is working closely with the Samoa Bureau of Statistics to 
strengthen data collection systems, analysis and reporting. 
 
A key outcome in the Plan is to increase the supply and consumption of competitively priced, domestically produced 
food. Fish and Taro are the top two agriculture exports (accounting for 38 and 9 percent of exports respectively in July-
September 2017 quarter). Chicken legs, followed by sugar and mutton were the biggest food imports in 2017 – poultry 
and sheep production therefore present substantial potential for import substitution. Building on the achievements of 
SACEP, the Plan looks to extend and scale up adoption of new technologies, strengthen farm business management 
skills and producer linkages to sustainable and profitable markets. Improving access to productive resources, financial 
services and business skills particularly for women is also key, noting that global experience has shown where women 
have increased access to income generating opportunities and social decision-making empowerment at community 
level, household nutrition improves. 

 
C. Relationship to CPF 
The Regional Partnership Framework (RPF) for FY17 to FY21, which was approved in February 2017, covers nine small 
Pacific Island countries (PIC9), including Samoa. The RPF identifies four areas of focus: (i) fully exploiting the available 
economic opportunities; (ii) enhancing access to employment opportunities; (iii) protecting incomes and livelihoods; 
and (iv) strengthening the enablers of growth and opportunities (macro-economic management, infrastructure and 
addressing knowledge gaps). Alongside this, the Pacific Eight Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD), found very 
important solution areas for Samoa include increasing incomes from agriculture and coastal fishing, preventing 
noncommunicable diseases and strengthening disaster risk preparedness.  
 
The proposed Samoa Agriculture and Fisheries Productivity and Marketing Project (SAFPROM) generally supports both 
the RPF focus areas and the Samoa-specific solution areas in the SCD. More commercially-viable farming practices and 
better access to markets will make use of economic opportunities available to most Samoans, and increase incomes for 
those involved; providing more climate-resilient crops, education and farming infrastructure will protect incomes and 
livelihoods in the face of natural disasters and a changing climate, and; promoting locally produced food will support a 
healthy diet and less dependence on food imports.  
 
The FY2017 to FY2020 Strategy for the Development of Samoa highlights increased agricultural production as a priority 
area for Samoa, which the Samoa Agriculture and Marketing Project will also contribute to. The project is also aligned 
to the Government of Samoa’s Agriculture Sector Plan 2016-2020, aimed at increasing the food, nutrition and income 
security in Samoa. 
 
The SAFPROM will also allow Samoa to join the Pacific Islands Regional Oceanoscape Program (PROP). The PROP 
Program was developed as a Series of Projects (SOP) to be implemented in three phases, each six years’ in duration. 
Phase 1 began in 2014 and is being implemented with four countries (Federated States of Micronesia, Republic of 
Marshall Islands, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu) and one regional institution, the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency 
(FFA). The Phase I country projects all share the same Regional Program PDO and Results Framework. They also reflect 

the same component design drawing on a pre-set menu of investment activities. By allowing Samoa to join the PROP, 
this project meets key criteria for utilizing the regional International Development Association (IDA) funds. The program 
(i) involves three or more countries; (ii) has benefits, economic, social and environmental, that spill over country 
boundaries (tuna / pelagic fishes’ stocks and fisheries management); (iii) requires coordination with regional bodies 
(SPC and FFA) and with other countries in the region; and (iv) provides a platform for a high level of policy 
harmonization among countries. 
 
As the PROP Program expands into Phase II with Tonga and Samoa operations, it has been decided that the regional 
project with FFA will not incorporate these new countries in Phases II and III, as it was found that the regional 
implementation approach is not the optimal model with which to secure regional support and coordination of the 
national projects.  Rather, a soft technical assistance model bilaterally to each of the four main regional fisheries 
agencies11 will be employed during Phase II of PROP to ensure that each of these agencies pro-actively engage in 
supporting the national projects to strengthen their commitment and collaboration toward shared management of 
their oceanic and coastal fisheries resources.  
 
 

PROPOSED PDO/RESULTS 

 
A. Proposed Development Objective(s) 
 
To increase the productivity and access to markets of targeted beneficiaries in selected crops and livestock value-chains 
and to improve management of targeted fisheries.  
 
B. Key Results 
 
Progress will be measured against the following PDO-level indicators: 

(a) Increased yields in selected crops and livestock value-chains 

(b) Increased value of sale in selected crops and livestock value-chains 

(c) Number of fisheries management plans implemented 

(d) Total number of beneficiaries, disaggregated by gender 

 
Direct beneficiaries are expected to be semi-commercial and commercial farming households and farmers, as well as 
small and medium enterprises (small agribusiness involved in collecting, processing, packaging and marketing activities, 
but also inputs suppliers). MAF will also directly benefit from capacity building activities. 
 
A detailed results framework will be developed during preparation.

PROJECT CONTEXT 

 
A. Concept 
 
1. Description 
The Samoa Agriculture Competitiveness Enhancement Project (P115351) is currently in its last year, closing 31 
December 2018, and has achieved significant accomplishments for Samoan farmers, as well as relevant government 
departments. Based on SACEP’s successes, the government of Samoa would like to build on these achievements and 
take advantage of the opportunities presented.  
Through its objectives of increasing crops and livestock productivity and access to market increase as well as improving 
the management of targeted fisheries, this project may contribute to: (i) import substitution and increase the supply 
and consumption of domestically produced food; (ii) boost exports of some commodities, and (iii) strengthen resilience 
of farming households to climate change and climate-induced disasters (cyclones, heavy rains, prolonged dry seasons).  
 
It is proposed that SAFPROM will have four components.  
Component 1: Creating an enabling environment for increased productivity and access to markets for target farming 
and fishing households. This will include: 

a. Institutional capacity building activities in the MAF as well as current and potential cooperatives and 

associations. Activities will be based on a needs assessment and a capacity building action plan. The project 

will also support the establishment of an Agriculture Sector Coordination Division within the MAF for 

project management. This component will also help reviewing the regulatory and policy framework and 

update it if needed. A special focus will be looked at national standards that affect the capacity of Samoan 

agriculture products to reach specific high value markets. 

b. Development and improvement of infrastructure and equipment of public good nature. On the model of 

SACEP (with the Static and Mobile Slaughtering Units and the Tissue Culture Laboratory), this sub-

component will support the development of feasibility studies, work and equipment of key collective 

infrastructures that have been identified as bottlenecks for the development of the sector. For instance, in 

Savai’I island, a small veterinary laboratory and a fruits and vegetable Packhouse would help farmers to 

address their animal diseases and packaging concerns. 

 
Component 2: Support to farming and fishing households through a matching grant program (MGP). The design of 
which will be informed through a review of the MGP under SACEP. As per the GoS Concept Note, this financing 
mechanism should expand, not only to increase the number of farmers benefiting, but also to allow farmers’ groups to 
work together in post-harvest handling and agro-processing. It will help establishing alliances between the farmers, 
fishers, their groups and cooperatives and services providers or buyers. This MGP will give priority to sub-projects that 
promote innovative technologies aimed at improving productivity and quality for products for which there is a market 
demand. It will also support climate change mitigation activities through for instance intensification of livestock 
production, pasture management, improved feeding rations and practices using local products; and adaptation by 
promoting inter alia poly-tunnels to protect crops against heavy rains, water collection and small-scale irrigation to 
cope with prolonged dry seasons, etc. – therefore contributing to strengthened resilience to climate-related events. 
 
Regarding coastal fisheries, this component, through the MGP, will provide the opportunity to strengthen the 
community based fisheries management program (CBFMP) that has been implemented since 1995. This could upgrade 
the CBFMP to assess potential development support for participating communities or look at income generating 
activities for local communities. Over 100 villages have joined the program. Other coastal fisheries areas may include 

effective management regimes for the sea cucumber fishery (hatchery production, grow out and possibly processing).  
Post-harvest and value adding for low value fish are key components as community undertakings. 
 
Component 3: Aims to help GoS strengthen management of the region’s long-line tuna fisheries while identifying 
opportunities for sustainably increasing domestic revenues from this shared resource. This component will allow 
Samoa to join the PROP and is proposed to be financed through the following IDA grant resources: US$ 3 million in 
national IDA and US$ 6 million in regional IDA. 
  
Towards this objective, the component will support GoS’ regional and national activities to:  

a. Strengthen its capacity to engage effectively in the Tokelau Arrangement, the Western and Central Pacific 

Fisheries Management Commission (WCPFC) and other regional forums;  

b. Strengthen capacity and establishment of a national observer program 

c. Invest in and implement robust Monitoring, Control and Surveillance (MCS), stock monitoring and fisheries 

management mechanisms and schemes. This includes upgrading Samoa’s Fisheries Information 

Management Systems and skills on MCS, carrying out joint regional patrol operations, boarding inspections, 

data collection, analysis and application; and combating Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing 

d. Develop and implement strategies to enhance the competitiveness of the domestic longline fleet and the 

oversight and value of oceanic fishing activities within their EEZ including enhancing transshipment and 

related services.     

 
Component 4: Contingency Emergency Response Component (Total Cost: US$0): Following an eligible crisis or 
emergency, the government of Samoa may request the Bank to re-allocate project funds to support emergency 
response and reconstruction. This component would draw from the uncommitted grant resources under the project 
from other project components to cover emergency response. These activities would be carried out, as needed to 
ensure continued achievement of the project development objective. This component will only be used in the event that 
an emergency response is required. 
 
    

  SAFEGUARDS 

 
A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 

 
The project would be implemented over a period of five years on Upolu and Savaii islands. Samoa is made up of nine 

islands with four main inhabited islands (Upolu,Savaii, Manono and Apolima) and has a total land area is 2,830 km2. The 
islands are of volcanic origin dominated by olivine basaltic rocks. The area is generally mountainous. 
  
Samoa has a population of approximately 197,000 people, of which 97% are Polynesian. The majority of people live on 

Upolu and Savaii. Settlements and agricultural activity on these islands are concentrated on the coastal plains and rolling 
slopes. 
 
Approximately 60,000 ha or 21% of the total land area is under crops or grazing regimes. Forest cover is approximately 

60%. Samoa’s 12 terrestrial national parks, reserves and community conservation areas are located on Upolu and Savaii. 


The country’s reef area is approximately 10,000 km2 and its exclusive economic zone is approximately 131000 km2. The 
main fishery landing sites in Samoa include Apia (Upolu), Salelologa (Savaii) and Apolima-uta (Upolu) with local 
subsistence landings scattered in coastal villages around inhabited islands . Samoa has three (3) protected marine areas 
(inshore). 
 
As for offshore fishery, Samoa’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is the smallest in the Pacific region and tuna longline 

fishery, particularly albacore, is the main offshore fishery. While tuna used to be the country’s largest export earner, 
recent years have seen a decline in the overall tuna catches, with a more than 50 percent reduction between 2009 and 
2013.  Transshipment operations by Taiwanese longliners began in Apia, Samoa in 2010. As of April 2012, there had been 
34 such operations, with 6 occurring in 2012.  Numerous smaller domestic longliners also transship in Samoa with the 
target market being the cannery in neighboring American Samoa. In 2014 Samoa signed onto the Tokelau Arrangement, a 
joint approach to managing the South Pacific Longline Fishery. 
 
B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 

 
The current World Bank financed Samoa Agriculture Competitiveness Enhancement Project (SACEP) has addressed 

safeguards' capacity constraints within MAF through a Coordination group (PCG) which includes an environmental and 
social (E&S) officer. For SAFPROM, E&S capacity within MAF is expected to be further strengthened with the 
establishment of a dedicated Agriculture Sector Coordination Division (ASCD) including a senior E&S specialist, to 
effectively coordinate and management agriculture sector activities, including environmental and social safeguards. This 
unit will be supported by a Centralized Technical Services and Support Unit (CTSSU) within the MOF which will also 
include an E&S Advisor. Her/his role will be to build capacity of E&S specialists within the line ministries, including the 
ASCD, and advise these teams on complex issues on an ad hoc basis.

D. Policies that might apply 

 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

The project would finance a number of small-scale, 
household-based farming (i.e. livestock development 
and crop development) and community fisheries 
production/marketing subprojects through a small 
grants scheme. Negative environmental and social 
impacts associated with these activities are expected 
to be minor, localized and temporary primarily 
because of their small-scale and 
household/community focus. 
 
The project would support the development and 
improvement of collective infrastructure and/or 
equipment (i.e. small veterinary laboratory, 
renovation of a local fish market or a fruits and 
vegetable pack-house). These small to medium-scale 
investments have the potential to cause some minor 
adverse environmental and social impacts however 
these are readily managed through standard 
mitigation measures. 
 
The project would finance the development and 
implementation of strategies to enhance the 
competitiveness of the domestic longline tuna fleet 
and the value of oceanic fishing activities within the 
Samoa’s EEZ including enhancing transshipment and 
related services.  
  
An Environmental and Social Management Framework 
(ESMF) is proposed as the safeguards instrument given 
that the specific locations of the investments are not 
known and these will be determined through the grant 
process. The ESMF will incorporate the requirements 
of the World Group’s Environmental, Health and 
Safety Guidelines (EHSGs) and industry specific 
guidelines for agribusiness, food production and 
pesticides management. 
 
The project also includes a Contingency Emergency 
Response Component to support emerency activities 
that ensure continued achievement of the project 
development objective. The ESMF will outline the 
approach and principles for managing potential E&S 
impacts and risks of the CERC including ascreening 
process in accordance with the World Bank’s Rapid 
Response to Crises and Emergencies: Procedural 
Guidelines. 

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 Yes 

For agriculture and livestock, the project will not 
finance any activities that significantly convert or 
degrade any protected areas or natural habitats as the 
screening procedures in the ESMF will exclude all 
subprojects with these impacts. 
The project will support enhanced management of 
coastal and ocean fisheries/ecosystems. While 
proposed activities are expected to enhance positive 
and sustainable returns to these important habitats, 
the ESMF will contain measures to properly manage 
the risk of any unforeseen adverse environmental 
impact on natural habitats, including critical natural 
habitats, as well as measures to enhance positive 
environmental impacts. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 Yes 

For agriculture (crops and livestock), the policy will not 
finance activities that impact on the health and quality 
of forests. 
For fisheries, the project may support marine 
ecosystem conservation activities (i.e. mangroves 
conservation). 
The ESMF will contain measures to properly manage 
the risk of any unforeseen adverse environmental 
impacts of these activities, as well as measures to 
enhance positive environmental impacts. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

The client will review and update the current SACEP 
Integrated Pest Management (IPM) following the 
standards and requirements set forth in OP4.09 and 
the World Group’s Environmental, Health and Safety 
Guidelines (EHSGs) for agribusiness and food 
production. The project will include measures to 
strengthen the institutional capacity for implementing 
IPM in project areas. This will include a stronger focus 
on health and safety. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 No 

The project will not finance any activities that will have 
impacts on physical cultural resources; screening and 
chance find procedures will be included in the ESMF to 
exclude all subprojects with these impacts. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 No 
The ethnic structure in Samoa is predominantly ethnic 
Samoan (92.6%) with a minority of Europeans and 
biracial European/Polynesian. 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

At present, no involuntary land acquisition is expected 
under the project. The majority of sub-projects will be 
undertaken on customary land with the voluntary 
participation of grants scheme recipient landowners. 
The only exception will be the siting of collective 
infrastructure facilities which will be either on 
Government-owned land or land secured via voluntary 
land donation. A Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) 
will be prepared to address these potential scenarios. 
In fishery, certain activities may involve the restriction 
of access to natural resources and/or marine 
protected areas which local people may depend upon 
for their livelihood. A Process Framework will be 
developed in compliance with OP4.12 requirements to 
address these potential issues.  

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 No 
The project will not finance any dams as defined under 
OP 4.37. 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

No 
The project does not impact or relate to any known 
international waterways as defined under the policy. 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No 
The project is not located in any known disputed areas 
as defined under the policy. 

 
E. Safeguard Preparation Plan  
 
Tentative target date for preparing the Appraisal Stage PID/ISDS 
 
Aug 15, 2018 
 
Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed. The specific studies and 
their timing should be specified in the Appraisal Stage PID/ISDS 
 
As soon as the GoS will access the Project preparation Facility, the recruitment of an E&S specialist and a consultant to 

develop both the ESMF and the PMP. It is therefore expected that the safeguards documents will be ready by mid-August 
to inform the Appraisal stage ISDS.

B. Introduction and Context 

 
Country Context 

1. Despite notable progress in rebuilding the economy, strengthening institutions, and restoring 
infrastructure and basic services, Afghanistan faces tremendous challenges today. Afghanistan has relatively 
successfully managed the immediate challenges resulting from the political transition post-election of 2014.  The 
country has maintained macroeconomic stability and established the conditions for a slow recovery of the 
economy. Risks to the economy remain significant, however, and withdrawal of international security forces 
starting 2011, coupled with political uncertainties and declining aid, have resulted in deceleration of economic 
growth, while fiscal pressures increase as security threats mount. The latest numbers from the Afghanistan Living 
Conditions Survey (ALCS)1 released by the Central Statistics Organization (CSO) show that poverty in Afghanistan 
has increased from 38.3 percent in 2012-13 to 54.5 percent in 2016-17.2 With the population continuing to grow 
more than 3 percent a year, per capita GDP fell during the same period from US$ 669 to US$ 551, making it one 
of the poorest countries in the world. At the same time, private sector growth has fallen 9.4 percent in the period 
2003-2012 to only 2.1 percent between 2013 and 2016. Private sector development and diversification is 
constrained by political instability, weak institutions, inadequate infrastructure, widespread corruption, and a 
difficult business environment (Afghanistan was ranked 183rd of 190 countries in the 2017 Doing Business Survey 
and 177 out of 180 in Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index)3. With a fresh election cycle 
approaching in 2018-19, it is vital that the Government focuses on private sector led growth and revitalization of 
the economy to fill up the void emerging from the declining donor inflows over the longer-term.  
 

2. A particularly concerning challenge is the low level of economic empowerment of Afghan women. The 
current level of women’s formal economic contribution to Afghan development is low. While women constitute 
47 percent of the estimated 34.65 million population of Afghanistan in 20164 the female labour force 
participation rate stands at only 26.8 percent (down from 29 percent in 2013-14). Among the working age

rate terms.

WEE-NPP Strategy paper, December 2016. 

women, only 29 percent are economically active and most are employed in the agricultural sector (70 percent) 
while 24 percent are in manufacturing. The share of women in wage employment in non-agricultural sector is 
only 10 percent. Only 19.9 percent of the female population is literate (versus 49.4 percent for men), although 
this figure nearly doubles to 38.7 percent if only the female population under 25 is counted, a significant 
testimony to the advances that have been obtained over the past decade. Women earn significantly less than 
men. For the same type of job, women earn 30 percent less than men on average. 

 

3. Women in Afghanistan face significant legal, regulatory and cultural challenges that hinder their ability 
to run businesses and access markets5.  While the Afghan Constitution clearly states that “the citizens of 
Afghanistan – whether man or woman – have equal rights and duties before the law”6 and while most commercial 
laws have no explicit gender-legal differentiations, there are implicit cultural barriers and lack of legal incentive 
mechanisms that reduce the ability of women to participate in the economy successfully. Likewise, there are 
numerous actual gender-legal differences when it comes to non-commercial laws (like the Marriage Law, Civil 
Code, Labor Law, etc.). These include differences in the legal age of marriage, mobility of women, ownership of 
property, and duration and types of work that women can undertake7. This lack of legal incentives for women to 
participate in formal business activities, has translated into very low levels of female entrepreneurship and 
women-owned businesses, although this number has increased steadily thanks to donor and Government efforts. 

 

4. Access to finance, particularly for rural women, is especially constrained. Financial inclusion is a core 
development challenge in Afghanistan – with only 10 percent of the population (and 3.8 percent of women) 
having accounts in formal financial institutions8. Microfinance has been a widely-used strategy in Afghanistan to 
address barriers to financial inclusion, with the Microfinance Investment Support Facility for Afghanistan (MISFA) 
serving as an apex institution channeling funding and technical assistance to the whole sector. While the sector 
has grown and consolidated over the last decade, the total number of clients of micro-finance institutions (MFIs) 
only stands at 0.22 million, of which only 0.13 million are active borrowers. The outreach of MFIs is limited to 80 
districts of 14 provinces, and only 12 percent of their active clients are from rural areas. Naturally, therefore, 
demand for microfinance services continues to far outstrips supply, especially in rural areas where financial 
markets have limited presence. The outreach of the banking industry is equally limited in rural areas. Currently, 
there are 15 licensed banks in Afghanistan including three state owned banks, nine private sector banks, and 
three foreign banks. The Banking sector has gradually been offering range of financial products and services but 
their services are mostly limited to urban areas. Most commercial banks have no branches outside Kabul yet, and 
a few are providing loans to local businesses, much less small rural businesses. 
 

5. There is hence tremendous potential to increase women’s participation in national development. 
Global evidence increasingly showcases that greater gender equality can enhance productivity, improve 
development outcomes for the next generation, and make institutions more representative.9 Actions to expand 
women’s economic activity in Afghanistan are constrained by a variety of cultural, institutional, and economic 
factors. Afghan women suffer discrimination that is multi-faceted, inter-related and self-reinforcing. But the 
current international perception that Afghan women are blocked from the economy is an unhelpful over-
generalization given the variation in cultural practices across the country. Furthermore, as in other parts of the 

world, cultural practices are more dynamic than often realized. As an economy grows and more opportunities 
arise, cultural beliefs about women’s ability to contribute to household income and their participation in 
economic activities will change. Moreover, addressing gender disparities and empowering women is essential 
for consolidating peace and security in fragile and conflict-affected societies. The imperative for investing in 
women’s economic empowerment (WEE) in Afghanistan can thus not be over-emphasized. 

 
Sectoral and Institutional Context 

6. Recognizing this imperative, the Government of Afghanistan (GoIRA) launched the Women’s Economic 
Empowerment National Priority Program (WEE-NPP) on March 8th, 2017. The WEE-NPP forms the third pillar of 
the GoIRA’s Gender Strategy which is encompassed in the broader Afghanistan National Peace and Development 
Framework (ANPDF) – the country’s five-year development plan. The WEE-NPP aims to build poor women’s 
capacity to strengthen the economy of their households, communities, and the entire nation. It is structured as 
an umbrella program (rather than a stand-alone project/operation) that would operate through over a dozen 
line ministries (through ongoing or pipeline projects) and coordinated through a Program Coordination Office 
(PCO) in the Ministry of Labor, Social Affairs, Martyrs and Disabled (MOLSAMD). The latter would in turn provide 
start-up technical and financial resources to support women-owned businesses, and development of job skills, 
and financial literacy. The program would further help create an enabling environment for WEE through policy 
and planning reforms that will remove legal barriers to women’s economic participation; streamline and reduce 
regulatory barriers to women’s involvement in marketing; and improve the quality and use of gender statistics 
for planning and monitoring women's economic progress.   

 

7. The WEE-NPP builds upon and complements other initiatives of the GoIRA. The WEE-NPP builds on 
previous government-led initiatives to expand women's economic empowerment, including the gender elements 
of the Afghanistan Compact, the 2008-18 National Action Plan for the Women of Afghanistan (NAPWA), and the 
2008 Afghanistan National Development Strategy (ANDS). The GoIRA has also fully committed to gender equality 
and has backed this commitment with credible reforms to increasing the role of women in government, providing 
access to property, and implementing UN Resolution 1325. The WEE-NPP compliments these efforts and links 
closely to other NPPs – notably the Citizens’ Charter National Priority Program (CCNPP), the Agriculture NPP and 
the Human Development NPP. 
 

8. The WEE-NPP is comprised of six pillars. The WEE-NPP encompasses two domains of action. Facilitating 
activities (the first two pillars) include reforms that improve the regulatory and normative environment for 
women’s economic development, and investment activities (the last four pillars) include projects and programs 
that provide resources directly to women. In this way, the six WEE-NPP pillars focus on: (i) increasing the 
availability and analysis of gender statistics; (ii) removing legal and regulatory barriers to participation; (iii) 
training in literacy, business management, and labor skills; (iv) ensuring inclusive access to finance; (v) improving 
access to agricultural inputs, extension services, and markets; and, (vi) promoting access to creative economy 
markets. The activities under each of these pillars will be implemented by different ongoing and pipeline projects 
under various line ministries. 

 
9. The proposed women’s economic empowerment rural development project (WEE-RDP) will directly 
implement the last four pillars of WEE-NPP, while contributing to the others. It offers a national framework for 
women’s economic empowerment starting at the community level and with an explicit targeting of poor rural 
women. As acknowledged in the WEE-NPP document, past efforts at women’s economic empowerment have 
often focused on better-off, urban women. WEE-RDP reverses this approach. 

10. The project builds off the lessons from the ongoing Afghanistan Rural Enterprise Development Program 
(AREDP). The AREDP was approved by the ARTF Management Committee on April 11, 2010 with the objective of 
improving employment opportunities and income of rural men and women, and sustainability of targeted local 
enterprises. The project was successful in integrating the poorest segments of the population and empowering 
women who were the main direct beneficiary groups of all Project activities. AREDP’s operational activities have 
resulted in the strengthening of about 64,328 community members (56 percent women) including marginalized 
groups, IDPs and Returnees through a community-driven savings and enterprise model for income and 
employment generation. More than 5,193 SGs (54 percent women), 1,336 EGs (841 EGs managed by women) 
and 505 VSLAs were established and supported. Community Saving Groups have saved US$4.2 million (US$2.2 
million by women), where US$4 million of loanable savings are in circulation at any given time. Additionally, the 
program supported 657 SMEs to strengthen backward/forward linkages with the rural economy and utilized 
them as business service providers for the newly established community enterprises. A recent Bank funded 
analytical study ‘Jobs from Agriculture and Rural Development Operations in Afghanistan’ found that the 
employment effects of AREDP on female beneficiaries were significant. Participation of women in program 
activities has emerged as one of key strengths of AREDP as over 60% program beneficiaries are women. The 
impact of the project on the local economy and its catalytic effect on social inclusion facilitate its transition into 
a programmatic and women-oriented operation under the WEE-NPP.  
 

11. The project will leverage the social mobilization and outreach of the Citizens’ Charter program. Most 
successful women’s empowerment programs are built on a community platform which also provides access to 
basic services and enables trust. This is why the WEE-NPP conceived the WEE-RDP to leverage the institutional 
structure of the Citizens’ Charter National Priority Program (CCNPP). The CCNPP emerged from the foundation 
of the highly successful National Solidarity Program (NSP), which introduced a community-driven development 
(CDD) approach towards rural infrastructure and service delivery and reached approximately 35,000 
communities over the past 14 years. The Citizens’ Charter Afghanistan Project (CCAP) which implements the first 
phase of the CCNPP aims to deliver core infrastructure, emergency support, and social services to participating 
communities through strengthened Community Development Councils (CDCs). By helping to improve services, 
especially for the poor and most vulnerable through the CDCs, it also ensures social inclusion. The CCAP was 
planned to be a major contributor to building strong and accountable institutions especially by strengthening the 
capacity of CDCs to plan and monitor local service delivery and hold government and service providers 
accountable. The CCAP can thus provide an umbrella body for women’s groups and help women access critical 
social infrastructure. 

 
C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  

12. To increase social  and economic empowerment of poor rural women in selected communities. 

 

13. The project defines “social empowerment” as participation in community level women’s institutions, with 
an implicit theory of change that such participation leads to social empowerment. These institutions will be 
provided seed capital, technical assistance, and in turn be linked to formal financial institutions and markets so 
as to enable economic empowerment. “Economic empowerment” is defined in this project as having both the 
resources to advance economically and the power to make and act on economic decisions. Economic 
empowerment starts with fair and equal access to markets and institutions, but women also need agency and 
control over resources to ensure they benefit from economic activities. Economic empowerment also 


encompasses financial inclusion, which increases women’s access to products and services to exercise control 
over money.  

 
PDO Level Indicators 

14. Following the focus of the project on social, financial, and economic inclusion and empowerment, the 
proposed PDO level indicators are as follows: 

(a) Number of direct beneficiaries (of which female)  
(b) % of women self-help group (SHG) members from poor or vulnerable households  
(c) Number of beneficiaries reached with financial services (Corporate Results Indicator) 
(d) % of women EGs/PAs showing increase in volume of sales 

 
D. Project Description  

15. Based on the rural goals outlined in the WEE-NPP, the WEE-RDP has three core intervention tracks – one 
around social mobilization to develop community institutions and federating them to higher levels; the second 
dedicated to providing inclusive access to finance, and the third focusing more on enterprise development and 
value chain/market linkages. These would be supplemented with program support that would also link back to 
both the WEE-NPP and the CCNPP. This ‘institutional approach’ to empowerment of women has proven very 
successful in rural livelihoods projects in other South Asian countries, notably in India, since it harnesses the social 
capital of poor women and uses this to develop both financial and economic capital. The overall approach and 
functions are similar to what existed under the AREDP, but the fundamental shifts would be (i) specific design 
features to promote participation of poor women; (ii)a more prominent role of social mobilization (with a goal of 
‘saturating’ as many women into savings/self-help groups as possible, of which a subset would receive enterprise 
support); and (iii) a much stronger focus on building sustainable community institutions for women’s agency and 
empowerment. Keeping this core design model in mind, each of the project components is described below.  
 

COMPONENT-1: Community Mobilization and Institution Development (est. US$ 30 million) 

16. Overall focus: The first component of the WEE-RDP aims to build sustainable community institutions 
through social and economic mobilization of rural women. This is perhaps the most critical component of the 
project, since it lays the institutional foundation on top of which the rest of the activities will depend. The 
formation of sustainable institutions would build the social capital of women in the rural areas and serve as the 
first stage of their economic empowerment. The core community institutional framework envisaged under the 
project are women’s savings groups (WSG or simply SGs) which would be federated into VLSAs. From these would 
emerge community level enterprise groups (EG) which in turn would be aggregated to producer associations (PAs). 
The project will heavily draw on the mobilization efforts undertaken by CCAP and leverage the network of CCAP 
facilitating partners (FPs) working with the program.  
 

Component 2: Building Access to Finance and Linkages with Financial Institutions (est. US$ 38 million): 

17. Overall approach: The second component will facilitate empowering of both community institutions i.e. 
SGs/VSLAs and its members to develop as sustainable financial institutions at the community level and eventually 
establish direct linkages with financial service providers including MFIs and commercial banks. Evidence from past 
experiences in Afghanistan as well as other countries demonstrates that this is a long-term process that has to be 
approached in phases. The key focus of WEE-RDP would be to strengthen the ‘demand side’ by creating an 
ecosystem of women savings groups that are built on mutual trust and respect to support their livelihoods and 


federate to VSLAs for sustainability. This would prepare the women groups to link with MFIs and make them 
bankable. In this way, there would be three stages in the access to finance:  

(a) the first stage is to develop an own savings culture through SHGs and federate them into VLSAs.  
(b) In the second stage, the project will inject seed capital, which will support transforming VSLAs to 

the next level in terms of scale as well as operational and financial sustainability.  
(c) Finally, the third stage would be to link the VSLAs to MFIs and Banks. 

 

18. The component will have a strong focus on ensuring the financial and operational sustainability of VSLAs 
and will work with MFIs and commercial banks to create an enabling environment for investment in the 
livelihoods of rural women by increasing their access to sustainable financial services. 
 
19. Financial Intermediation. Given the above, the project complies in general terms with OP 10.00 para 15 
on financial intermediation. However, there is a significant reason for concern about how loan contracts can be 
enforced, and how VSLAs will be sustainable when relying on ad hoc profit sharing arrangements (under Islamic 
finance) instead of predictable interest rates. There are also major security concerns in rural areas that could 
make the financial intermediation activities difficult to implement on the ground. An additional concern is how 
risks will be covered, including force majeure risk and credit risk (on loans to SHGs by VSLAs, and on loans from 
microfinance institutions and commercial banks to VSLAs in the future).  Given that VSLAs are supervised by the 
Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development, a new arrangement for supervision will be necessary as they 
take on a financial intermediation role. Mature VSLAs managing grants and a growing loan portfolio may be 
supervised by the Central Bank, while others will require technical assistance and supervision from another 
agency.   It would also be critical to have a certification process to insure basic practices and systems are in place 
before seed capital is provided. For VSLAs that initially meet requirements and later do not, there needs to be a 
decertification or strengthening process in place – and this would have ripple effects for groups who have 
provided their savings. As for the eventual participation of MFIs, there is no law in place yet, which might limit 
their role. However, efforts are underway to pass a law to provide clear legal status and supervision 
arrangements. 
 
20. Component 3: Providing Technical Assistance and Improved access to Markets (est. US$ 18 million):  
This component aims to finance common assets of public goods nature based on business needs and assessment 
of market failures using the ‘maximizing finance for development’ (MFD) cascade principle (see figure 6 below) 
in order to provide catalytic support for the growth of viable economic activities and leveraging more private 
sector investments. These investments are expected to be catalytic, helping individual level investments reach 
economies of scale through increased coordination. This will be supplemented with technical assistance, business 
development support, as well as market exposure and linkages.  

 

21. Approach: Groups of women with homogeneous economic activities under the project will be enabled 
and incentivized to come up with business ideas that will provide the rationale for partnership and formation of 
Enterprise Groups (EGs) and Producers Associations (PAs). 10 Any support under this component will be against 

                                                           
10 Enterprise/Producers Groups (EGs or PGs) are primary economic interest groups consisting of members from same village 
working on common enterprise/production systems. This could be in the areas of farm; non-farm or off farm activities. Members 

of an EG normally ranges from 8-20 depending upon nature of economic activities. Producer’s Association (PAs) would be a higher 

order, secondary organization i.e. Federations of EGs/PAs. EGs/PGs from multiple villages engaged in common economic or 

income generating activities could be federated at a cluster level i.e. 10 to 20 villages. While, EG and PG would be an informal 

 
robust Business Plan with a ceiling of $ 2000 per EG, which may also be aggregated for the larger assets 
/infrastructure at the PA level depending upon specific business case and project requirements. The committee 
reviewing the business plan would have members of commercial banks/MFIs and representatives from industries 
and private sector, who could also choose to co-finance the proposal. The project is also considering contracting 
an independent third party to verify and validate the Business plan in terms of feasibility, fiduciary process and 
inclusion. It is expected that this build-up process will help women to increase their productivity, 
competitiveness, which would in turn improve the job opportunities for women and contribute to their economic 
empowerment. The component builds on the existing successful framework of AREDP on enterprise 
development which has proven effective in developing women enterprises and supporting them on capacity 
building, business skills and linkage to markets. EGs will be encouraged among all SHG members engaged in 
common economic activities. Thus, the component would help both individual and collective women enterprises 
to participate in organized and competitive supply chains, which would be identified through provincial 
situational analysis and other related studies. The focus will be on pro-poor, high value commodities such as 
vegetables, horticulture, milk, poultry, ship; fish; goat; carpet; honey, handicrafts etc. where women participation 
tend to be higher. Overall, only a sub-set of total households and geography having growth potential and are 
part of either economic clusters or value chains would be specifically supported under this component. This 
component will also facilitate EGs access to credit from VSLAs to support building of a healthy portfolio for the 
VSLAs and hence contributing to their sustainability. This component will also seek to draw partnerships and 
synergy with other ARTF, bilateral donor funded, and NGO run programs and projects that work on similar 
themes11. Investments made under this component would be largely/mostly of public in nature. 
 
22. COMPONENT 4: Project Management and Knowledge Management (est. US$14 million): Under this 
Component, the project will finance salaries of project staff, consultancies, training programs, office equipment, 
and incremental operational costs of set up under MRRD and provincial units. The component will also support 
project coordination, implementation, monitoring and evaluation (M&E) at the national and provincial levels, 
Management Information System (MIS), financial management (FM), procurement, human resource 
management, knowledge management and communication systems as well as environmental and social 
safeguards management, and running of the grievance redress mechanism. The project will leverage the existing 
institutional infrastructure available in the CCAP program at the MRRD level for various project management 
activities including procurement, FM and communications. A detailed M&E plan will be prepared to align project 
activities and tasks with the key results and the related PDO level results indicators and the intermediate level 
indicators at the component level. There will be systematic internal monitoring of activities and results that will 
be fed into the preparation of Implementation Status report and Annual Progress reports. An M&E/ MIS system 
will be established to collect and process appropriate information that will enable determination of the progress 
towards the achievement of the project development objective, tracking of progress at each phase of the results 
chain, and if required, adjustments will continuously be made and at Mid-Term. Baseline information will also be 
collected as part of the project preparation activities. 
 

23. Other areas of support under the component include the following: 
(a) Technical assistance to inform implementation and policy development, and capacity building of 

some of the MRRD directorate/cell/units to mainstream and ensure long term adequate staffing 

                                                           
organization, efforts would be made to convert PAs as formal community based organization registered as co-operatives or 

companies. Membership of PAs could range from 50 to 500 depending on the value chain.  

11 In this respect, the project is exploring a formal partnership with the “Women in Economy” program run by USAID. 

as part of exit strategy; 
(b) Partnership arrangements with some of the projects in India/Pakistan e.g. JEEViKA, Bihar in India 

or PPAF, Pakistan for overall technical assistance and implementation guidance; 
(c) Overall training and capacity building of staff/community professionals; identification, 

development and deployment of CRPs; organizing study tours and field learning trips; exchange 
of knowledge etc. could be also supported as part of this component. 

 
E. Implementation 

 
Institutional and Implementation Arrangements 

24. The WEE-RDP will be implemented by the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development (MRRD) 
under the overall framework of WEE-NPP. Although, MRRD is going through an structural changes, which will 
evolve during the course of 2019, as per the latest thinking, it is proposed to restructure the Ministry into three 
operational general directorates, each covering the main functional pillars of MRRD’s operations. These are – (a) 
Community Development (covering the Citizen’s Charter Afghanistan Project (CCAP) as well as supporting public 
goods/infrastructure projects such as the Afghanistan Rural Access Project (ARAP)); (b) Sustainable Economic 
Growth (covering the livelihoods/private goods related operations such as AREDP); and (c) Balanced Growth and 
Border Areas (covering specialized cross-border programs targeting these geographies as well as specific 
populations). Common functions (such as HR, procurement, finance, etc.) would be centralized at the Ministry 
level. The WEE-RDP, given its livelihoods and private sector goods focus, would be situated under the second 
pillar (Sustainable Economic Growth). However, WEE-RDP would work closely with CC General Directorate as 
well as balanced growth pillars at both the national and sub-national levels and would leverage existing 
implementation architecture set up under different programs, particularly CCAP.  
 

25. The existing WEE-NPP Steering Committee will provide overall strategic guidance and oversight. The 
High-Level Steering Committee established under the WEE-NPP will be used for the overall co-ordination, 
guidance, setting up direction for program implementation and to enable leveraging of resources and drive 
synergies among various related programs of these Ministries for the overall socio-economic empowerment of 
women in Afghanistan. The steering committee will also be an avenue to move forward with any policy reforms 
and legal provisions that may be needed to facilitate the program (e.g. registration of VSLAs, or easing the process 
of issuing national IDs to women, etc.). The WEE-RDP directorate at the national level will coordinate its activities 
with the other programs being implemented under the aegis of the WEE-NPP through other related Ministries, 
such as the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Livestock (MAIL); Ministry of Commerce and Industries (MoCI); 
MoLSAMD; and Ministry of Women Affairs (MoWA) so as to ensure synergy and coordination.  
 

26. At the national level, the existing AREDP PIU, will be re-modelled for WEE-RDP and positioned within 
the new Sustainable Economic Growth Directorate. The Directorate/PIU will be fully staffed with technically 
competent multi-disciplinary team of senior professionals, consultants and sector specialists to implement & 
manage the enterprise development, access to finance, access to market and economic empowerment elements 
of the program. WEE-RDP will utilize MRRDs common resources/systems for program support services related 
to HR; Finance Management, Procurement, and other technical units like communication; gender; Grievance 
redressal; Governance and Accountability etc. as part of the proposed Ministry restructuring. Only a lean team 
of complementary skills set with WEE-RDP will be maintained at the WEE-RDP directorate level for overall co-
ordination; policy/guidelines formulation; and for building partnerships with various public & private 
development organizations/institutions. 


27. At the sub-national level, the WEE-RDP structure will be merged with the existing institutional 
arrangements for the CCAP to avoid duplication. The WEE-RDP would therefore piggy back on the provincial 
management units (PMUs) and District Offices that have been set up under CCAP. The latter would be 
supplemented with one District Coordinator (DC) for each of the 76 districts under WEE-RDP coverage and the 
program would also establish seven regional offices for coordination across the provinces under them. 
Additionally, a team of 3 SOs (two female and one male) would be hired for every 30 CDCs covered for the first 
two years, which would then be reduced to 3 SOs per district in the remaining three years of implementation 
once the speed and scale of the program had increased sufficiently and most of the VSLAs were formed. Likewise, 
a team of 3 VFs (again two female and one male) would be deployed for every 10 CDCs for 2 years and 
subsequently for every 20 CDCs in Years 3-5. This same implementation model would be proposed for the FPs 
(who would be asked to on board VFs as well) so that at exit there is a common implementation architecture for 
the program. Selection of the sub-national positions will be done through a competitive process managed by 
MRRD at the provincial level. 

 
 
 
 .    
F. Project location and Salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 
 

Based on the AREDP experiences and lessons learnt, the proposed project, WEE-RDP is designed to be a 
more women centric program that is in better alignment with the WEE-NPP objectives. It will cover a total 
of 76 districts across all 34 provinces in the country with an average of 2 districts covered per province. 
More than two thirds of these districts overlap with the ongoing CCAP and therefore the WEE-RDP will 
benefit from the community mobilization and capacity building (including a range of participatory analysis 
and tools) that have been done as part of the former. At this stage it is envisaged that, the environmental 
and social adverse impacts will be insignificant, minor and reversible in nature. The environmental impacts 
may include issues with health, safety and labor hygiene as well as concerns on handling and disposal of 
agro-based wastes. However, given the scope and scale of planned businesses, the impact are minor and 
easily manageable. The environmental and social safeguards issues will be managed through a framework 
approach, and if required the framework will include necessary provisions to spell out with additional 
safeguards tools and plans which will be used throughout the project life.  


SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY 

 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 is triggered. 
The access to finance under compoent-2 and the 
provision of seed capital (revolving fund) for VSLAs 
under subcomponent 3 and  may cause some 
adverse environmental and social impacts including 
occupational health and safety issues. The 
environmental and health and safety concerns may 
arise from different enterprises including agro-
businesses, food processing machinery, chicken 
farms, carpets weaving and other handcraft 
industries etc.  
Similarly, the project has also triggered Pest 
Management OP/BP 4.09 to ensure address safe 
utilization of pesticide and other associated risks 
related to agri-business. A ToR for Pest Management 
Plan (PMP) has been prepared by the client . The 
project has adopted a framework approach, as the 
specific locations and details of activities will only be 
determined by the borrower during project 
implementation.  The Environmental and Social 
Management Framework (ESMF) prescribes 
directions and procedures that would avoid, 
mitigate, or minimize adverse environmental and 
social impacts and it will also spell out the policies, 
guidelines and procedures including mitigation plans 
to minimize and mitigate the likelihood of envisaged 
negative impacts. The ToR for preparation of the 
PMP is annexed in the project ESMF.   
The ESMF was prepared, consulted, cleared and 
disclosed before project appraisal and the required 
mitigation plans for sub-project and businesses 
activities under WEERDP will be identified during 
implementation.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Performance Standards for Private Sector 
Activities OP/BP 4.03 

No 

The project is owned, designed and will be 
implemented and supervised by the MRRD, which is 
a Government Agency and therefore the OP/BP 4.03 
is not triggered. 

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 No 
OP/BP 4.04 is not triggered since; the scope of the 
project will not pose any risk to the natural habitats. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No 
OP/BP 4.36 is not triggered since; the scope of the 
project will not pose any risk on Forest. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

OP 4.09 (Pest Management) is triggered, since under 
component-3 the project operations will lead the 
EGs (Enterprise Groups) to use pesticides for 
Agricultural related works and agri-business related 
activities.  
 
The Client will prepare an Pest Management Plan 
(PMP) during project implementation stage. The 
PMP will be subject to review by the Bank, consulted 
and disclosed. 
 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 No 

OP/BP 4.11 is not triggered because there are no 
activities that will impact the quality of physical 
cultural resources as defined under the policy. 
However, the ESMF will also comprise guidelines for 
Chance Find Procedures according to national laws. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 No 

This policy is not triggered as there are no 
Indigenous Peoples that meet the criteria of OP/BP 
4.10 in the country that could potentially benefit or 
be adversely affected by the Project’s activities. 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 No 

The World Bank’s operational policy on Involuntary 
Resettlement (OP 4.12) is not triggered, since the 
project will not have land acquisition and 
resettlement, in case of land requirement, the ESMF 
will provide guidelines and provisions on land 
acquisition through willing buyer-willing seller 
approach, or the Government provides government 
land to the community for sub-project 
implementation, requiring no resettlement and/or 
compensation for losses, and the land should be free 
of squatters and any dispute.  
The RSA concurs on the proposal not to trigger OP 
4.12 given that there is no physical footprint; land 
acquisition or subsequent impacts of physical or 
economic resettlement or loss of access to resources 
are not anticipated. The ESMF includes a section on 
land acquisition through willing buyer-willing seller 

=
method, if that should occur during project 
implementation. 
 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 No 
The Project does not have any activity involving 
dams. 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

No 
The Project does not involve any activity that will 
affect international waterways. 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No 
The Project does not involve any activity in any know 
disputed area. 

 
 

KEY SAFEGUARD POLICY ISSUES AND THEIR MANAGEMENT 

 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential 
large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
OP/BP 4.01 is triggered for the project hence the project is an Environmental Safeguards Category-B. The project 
under component 2 and 3 is intended to develop WSGs/VSLAs/EGs and PAs who would be provided with access to 
funds by multiple agencies. The funding would lead to village/community level businesses in various selected 
provinces. Although, the scope and nature of these businesses are not known at appraisal stage, however it is 
predicted that such businesses may have minor health and safety issues. The environmental and social safeguards risk 
rating for WEE-RDP is thus Moderate: due to insignificant negative impact on health, safety and environmental aspect 
from the project related operations.  
 
OP/BP 4.09 on Pest Management is also triggered as agricultural activities supported under Component 3 could lead 
Enterprise Groups (EGs) and Producer Associations (PAs) to use pesticides for agriculture related works and 
agribusiness related activities. The client will prepare an Pest Management Plan (PMP) during implementation to 
mitigate the risks from this. The PMP will be subject to review by the Bank, consulted, and disclosed during 
implementation. 
 
Likewise, activities under the project are not expected to have major adverse social impacts.  Systematic involvement 
of the local community throughout the planning and implementation of sub-projects will underpin the identification of 
potential negative social impacts and corresponding mitigation measures to be included in the ESMPs. Given the 
economic activities under the EGs and PAs, there is a potential risk of child labor. The project will therefore update 
and refine the ‘child labor’ strategy that had been used under AREDP. Training on labor safety will also be part of the 
training modules for EGs/PAs. Similarly, as global evidence shows, there can potentially be an enhanced risk of gender 
based violence (GBV) when working on women's economic empowerment. Although, there hasn’t been any evidence 
of increased GBV under AREDP as a result of engaging male community members, especially village elders and 
Mullah’s, this could be a potential risk to beneficiaries given that the focus now is only on women. To mitigate this 
risk, the project as part of its mobilization activities will discuss the importance women economic empowerment from 
Islamic point of view (the fact that women are given Mahr is to ensure their access to finance and making them 
empower financially) as well as highlight the good practices in Islam (wife of prophet being a merchant). Furthermore 
as part of capacity building and training activities under each component, the project will train women on soft skills 
including their wellbeing and how to manage/resolve conflict within family and community. The VSLA and SHGs will 


also serve as a safe-space to discuss/tackle potential GBV issues. 
 
As the project is owned, designed, implemented, and supervised by the MRRD (a Government Ministry), the OP/BP 
4.03 on Performance Standards for Private Sector Activities does not apply. 
 
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area: 
The project is not expected to have any harmful indirect or long-term impacts due to anticipated future activities in 
the project area. 
 
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts. 
Not applicable. 
 
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower 
capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
To manage the environmental and socials safeguards (ESS) issues during the project implementation stage, the client 
has adopted a framework approach and prepared an environmental and social management framework (ESMF), 
which is consulted with stakeholders. Clearance has been obtained from the WB and disclosed officially. The ESMF has 
necessary provisions to prepare required safeguards mitigation measures including an Environmental and Social 
Management Plan (ESMP) and checklist to affectively address risk related issues during project implementation. Based 
on the experience of similar projects, notably AREDP that was managed by the same Ministry and team, most of the 
communities in the selected villages have no capacity/awareness to tackle risks associated with the day to day 
businesses under planned SGs/VSLAs. However, MRRD as an implementing agency has years of experience with 
similar projects and is therefore expected to provide the required technical assistance and capacity building to ensure 
that the provisions in EMSF are implemented. The project will hire an ESS focal officer at HQ level, as well as appoint 
safeguards focal points at each provincial level, the terms of references (TOR) for whom will need to be approved by 
the Bank before recruitment. The ESMF will guide the preparation of any Social Impact Assessments (SIA) and ESMPs, 
if required. The ESMF has been translated and disclosed in-country at Ministry’s Website and the World Bank’s 
external website on August 25, 2018. The ESMF contains the terms of reference for the proposed pest management 
plan. The PMP will be prepared and disclosed during project implementation. 
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, 
with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
The key stakeholders are the communities and rural women who will be the beneficiaries of the project. The project 
will undertake a range of training and capacity building efforts with the target groups under each of the Components 
of the project. This will include awareness raising with regards to the ESS provisions in the ESMF. The project will also 
leverage similar efforts and capacity building done for CDCs through the Citizens Charter Afghanistan Project (CCAP). 
The ESMF has been translated and disclosed in-country at Ministry’s Website and the World Bank’s external website 
on August 25, 2018.

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 

 
1. Guinea is fortunate to possess considerable agricultural and mining resources. It possesses the world’s richest 

deposits of bauxite and iron as well as abundant agricultural land and water resources (“water tower” of West Africa). 
However, Guinea has yet to take advantage of this endowment to achieve sustainable economic growth and poverty 
reduction. Guinea remains one of Africa’s poorest countries and is classified among the Low Income and Food Deficit 
Countries by the World Bank. Per-capita income was approximately US$490 in 2016, less than one third of the regional 
average (US$1,505), and the majority of the population continues to live in extreme poverty. According to UNDP’s 
2015 Human Development Report1, Guinea ranks 182th out of 188 countries in terms of the Human Development 
Index (HDI). Guinea’s HDI of 0.411 is below the average for countries in the low human development group (0.505) 
and also for countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (0.518).  

 
2. Guinea past economic growth has been too slow and too inconsistent to reduce poverty. Since the mid-80s, 

economic growth increased due in part to the implementation of the Programme de Redressement Economique et 
Financier (Financial and Economic Redressing Program - PREF)2. Annual economic growth averaged 4.5 percent during 
the 1990-97 period, outpacing population growth (3.1 percent). Poverty declined and most social indicators 
improved3. However, these gains were short-lived. After 2000, the country experienced a series of internal political 
crises, and was negatively impacted by conflicts in neighboring countries (Liberia, Sierra Leone and Cote d’Ivoire)4. 
Economic growth slowed and poverty increased from 49 percent in 2002 to 53 percent in 2007 and more than 55 
percent in 2012. As is typical for many Sub-Saharan African countries, most of the poor are living in rural areas with a 
poverty rate of 65 percent against 32 percent in urban area (2012). Per recent detailed surveys of food security in 
Guinea5, close to a third of the country’s households (30.5 percent) are food insecure. 

 
3. Economic growth resumed after 2010 following the presidential elections that resulted in a return to constitutional 

order. Macroeconomic policies improved, structural reforms were carried out in key sectors and the country’s 
cooperation with external partners improved. Guinea reached the Highly-Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Completion 
Point in 2012 with the cancellation of two-thirds of its external debt. However, growth again faltered in 2013-2015 
with the Ebola outbreak which had a devastating impact on economic activity6. Economic growth dropped drastically 
to 2.4 percent in 2013, then 1.1 percent and 0.1 percent respectively in 2014 and 2015. GDP per capita declined 
accordingly to -0.9 percent, -2.1 and -2.2 over those years. The Ebola crisis took a heavy toll on the agriculture and the 
food sectors. Guinea like other African countries is highly vulnerable to internal and external shocks that can wipe out 
hard-earned development gains, and worsen already entrenched poverty. However, in 2016 strong growth was 
recorded (6.7 percent) driven by a strong harvest and the mining sector. 

 
4. Mining and agriculture are the dominant sectors in the country. The agriculture sector represents 20 percent of GDP. 

The mining sector currently consists of industrial-scale mining of bauxite, alumina and gold, and accounts for about

2 Supported by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, focusing on macro-economic stabilization and the liberalization 

of the economy. 
3 Between 1985 and 1997, primary school enrolment increased from 29% to 51%; access to primary health care from 10% to 40%; 

access to drinkable water from 28% to 55%.

6 The World Bank estimates Ebola economic impact to 0.7 -2.3 % of GDP during 2014-2015. 


20 percent of GDP, 80 percent of foreign currency earnings and 20 to 25 percent of government revenue. However, 
the extractive industries do not create enough direct jobs opportunities. Secondly, strong investment and policies 
from the Government are a condition to diversify the economy. Thirdly, the sector increases governance risks and the 
potential for corruption. There is a strong risk that Guinea’s economy could become subject to the “resource curse” 
resulting from an overreliance on extractive industries. Such undesirable developments can be avoided by increasing 
investment in agricultural values chains to increase productivity and competitiveness, as well as investing in transport 
and marketing infrastructure and energy to facilitate economic diversification, inclusive private sector development 
and job creation. 
 

Sectoral and Institutional Context 
 
5. The economy of Guinea is not sufficiently diversified, and structural transformation is incomplete. The agricultural 

sector is, along with the mining sector, the main engine of the economy7. Contrary to mining, which provides most of 

the country’s export revenues but creates little employment, agriculture still occupies approximately 80 percent of 

the active population. As a result, sustainable agricultural development is central to Guinea’s economic and social 

development agenda.  

6. Guinea is richly endowed with natural resources: 6.2 million ha of cultivable land, abundant rainfall and varied agro-

climatic conditions favorable to the production of a wide variety of cash and food crops. This considerable potential 

is largely underutilized. Only 25 percent of cultivable land is cultivated (including fallow land, with less than 10 percent 

cropped every year). Only 32,000 ha have been developed for irrigation out of a potential of 360,000 ha (less than 10 

percent).8 Agricultural productivity is very low, using extensive, rainfed agricultural and livestock farming systems. 

Farms are small and produce primarily for household consumption, with very little marketed surplus. The main food 

crops are cereals (rice, maize and fonio), root crops (cassava, yam, sweet potato and potato) and groundnut. Rice is 

by far the main crop representing more than two thirds of all cultivated land, and produced by 80 percent of 

agricultural households. It is also the main food import of the country. Women play particularly a key role in rice 

production, processing and marketing. The main cash crops are coffee, cotton, cashew, oil palm and rubber. Their 

importance in Agricultural GDP is negligible and exports are low despite the potential and market opportunity.  

7. Guinea's agriculture is key for poverty reduction, job creation and food security. The country has not been able to 

build on its natural advantages and on the traditional expertise of its farmers. Agriculture in Guinea is entangled in a 

vicious circle starting from lack of investment, and distorted incentives and interference in markets, leading to low 

productivity and competitiveness. Producers face high costs of factors and inputs, as well as high costs of 

transformation and commercialization. Unable to invest in quality, their products are sold at low prices, and face 

significant challenges reaching domestic and export markets.  

8. As a result, Guinean agriculture is missing the positive outcomes that would have been generated from oversea 

trade and market-oriented agribusiness, while other countries in the region have become world exporters of cash 

crops. Agriculture in Guinea represents 11% of exports and 17% of imports (PNIASA 2012). Agricultural exports are 

declining. In 2013, only five agricultural products were exported overseas: coffee, cocoa, rubber, cashew and mango. 

Cotton and banana, once Guinean major exports, have disappeared from overseas market. Guinean fruits and 

vegetables, as well as palm oil and rice are sold in neighboring countries, that are less demanding in terms of quality. 

 
7 20% for agriculture, 41% for the industrial sector (of which 15%for the mining sector) and 34%for the service sector. 
8 Of which 9 000 ha of bottom land (20% of potential), 15 000 ha of mangrove (13%), 8 000 ha of flood plains (6%). 

To break the spell, a holistic approach to agriculture is needed, focused on markets, and enhancing upstream and 

downstream linkages. 

9. Agricultural growth has been driven by the increase in cultivated land estimated at 3% per year, consistent with the 

increase in rural population. Agriculture suffers from very low productivity constrained by a combination of limited 

use of improved technologies, failures in input, output and financial markets, and land tenure issues. Subsistence 

farmers, who account for 95 percent of the cultivated area, use very few agriculture inputs (e.g. improved seeds, 

fertilizer, pesticides, irrigation, and mechanization). Improved seeds are used on less than 8 percent of cultivated land 

with only 7 kg of fertilizer used per hectare, per year (among the lowest use in Africa). Yields are very low and have 

been stagnant for many years at less than 1t/ha for rainfed rice and 5 tons/ha for cassava. Many production areas are 

cut off from markets for part or most of the year, access to financial institutions is nearly non-existent and post-harvest 

losses are high (rice: 10 percent, maize: 15-20 percent, roots and tuber: 20-45 percent, fruits and vegetables: 30-60 

percent) due to poor cultural practices and post-harvest handling, the lack of storage and deficient transport services.  

Processing is negligible and mostly small-scale. The project would be instrumental in addressing these challenges.  

10. Animal husbandry is an important activity for the rural population. Guinea has a large herd of mostly local breeds, 

hardy and trypanotolerant9. Animal husbandry accounts for approximately 20 percent of Agricultural GDP and 4 

percent of total GDP. It provides revenues to approximately 30 percent of agricultural households. It also provides 

much needed animal protein to the population, and thus contributes to food security and nutritional status. Livestock 

systems are mostly traditional, extensive and with low productivity. The country has significant advantages for 

livestock production possessing large tracts of natural pasture land, water resources and ample availability of 

agricultural sub-products. Thus, despite very low public investment (less than 5 percent of public investment is in the 

agricultural sector), Guinea has registered reasonable long-term growth (3.8 percent per year). However, competition 

for land with agriculture is increasingly causing conflict, and constraining prevailing extensive, transhumant cattle 

raising systems. National production cannot keep up with demand, and the country has experienced a significant 

increase in livestock imports, mostly poultry and milk.  

11. Over the last few decades, increasing population pressures have been responsible for an accelerating degradation 

of the natural resource base, most visible in mangrove areas along the coast and in Guinée Forestière. These anthropic 

factors have been amplified by climate change. Data since 1960 show a continuous increase in temperature and 

decline in rainfall, together with an increased variability in the start of the agricultural season and more frequent dry 

spells and floods. Although difficult to predict with any precision, it is anticipated that these trends will continue in 

the future, with important negative impacts on ecosystems and agricultural production with a decrease in crop yields 

estimated at 10 to 25 percent by 205010. To mitigate these adverse developments, Guinea has prepared its Programme 

d’Action National pour l’Adaptation aux Changements Climatiques (National Action Program for Climate Change 

Adaptation - PANA, 2007) which identifies preventive and adaptation measures such as development of irrigation, 

development and dissemination of drought-resistant varieties, protection of forests and watersheds, improved soil 

and water conservation practices, environmental education, etc.  

12. Regarding institutional context, the Government of Guinea has long recognized the critical role of agriculture for 

economic growth and poverty reduction. It has prepared and implemented a series of strategies and plans. The most 

recent are: (i) the Plan National d’Investissement Agricole et de Sécurité Alimentaire (National Agricultural and Food 

 
9 Estimated in 2012 at 5.5 million cattle, 4.0 million small ruminants, 105.000 pigs and 24 million poultry. 
10 Various models forecast a decline in rainfall of 100-to-400 mm and an increase in temperature of 1.5 to 3.0 degrees by 2050.  



Security Investment Plan - PNIASA, 2013-2017), (ii) the Programme Accéléré de Sécurité Alimentaire et Nutritionnelle 

et de Développement Agricole Durable (Accelerated Program of Food and Nutritional Security, and Sustainable 

Agricultural Development - PASANDAD, 2016-2020), and (iii) the Plan National de Développment Economique et Social 

(National Economic and Social Development Plan – PNDES, 2016-2020). PASANDAD is a strategy, an orientation 

framework and a program fully integrated in the PNDES and aiming at improving food and nutrition security, 

accelerating agricultural production (crop, animal, fish and forestry), improving commercialization, storage and 

processing, and reducing foods imports. PNDES is targeting a primary sector growth rate of 8.1 percent by 2020 

horizon by setting up agro-poles across the districts focusing on the development of values chains with high value-

added, a core component of PASANDAD. Also, PASANDAD is seeking to spur implementation of PNIASA which will be 

completed on December 31, 2017.  

13. A detailed analysis of PNIASA achievements has been initiated in the context of preparation of the successor 

program (PNIASA 2) for the 2018-22 period. This assessment is on-going and preliminary results from 2015 showed 

clearly that, although some positive results were achieved, most of PNIASA’s strategic objectives will not be met: 

▪ Actual growth in the sector has been lower than the PNIASA annual 6 percent growth target with 5.1 percent in 

2013, 2.7 in 2014 and 4.1 in 2015. Like most of Sub-Saharan African countries, Guinea did not meet the ECOWAS 

and CAADP 6 percent agricultural growth goal;  

▪ About rice production, the objectives - a 300 percent increase in production through increased use of irrigation, 

a doubling of yields (from 1.2 to 2.45 t/ha) and the elimination of rice imports - will not be achieved. Rice 

production continued to increase at about 3% per year, largely through the expansion of cultivated areas, and rice 

imports have increased;  

▪ Regarding food crop diversification, while satisfactory results have been achieved with maize and fonio 

production which has exceeded PNIASA’s objectives, the production of cassava has not; 

▪ With respect to cash crop production and exports, there has been no significant increase, as the current business 

environment related to access to markets, inputs and services is still not conducive to large private investments 

in agricultural sector;    

▪ Concerning livestock production, despite very little public support with less than 2 percent of the agricultural 

budget, the sector continued to show reasonable annual growth of about 4 percent on the strength of its 

traditional extensive systems and also of the development of peri-urban poultry production;  

▪ Regarding development of infrastructure, only 1,400 km of rural roads have been rehabilitated through 2015, 

against an objective of 3,000 km (47 percent), and only 10,000 ha brought under irrigation to date against the end 

of the Plan target of 110,000 ha. 

 

14. The disappointing results registered so far are due in part to the impact of the Ebola epidemic, as well as a large 

shortfall in the PNIASA financing plan. The financing plan suffered from two clear weaknesses: (i) an extreme 

dependency on external sources (approximately 90 percent of financing); and (ii) the low level of financial resources 

mobilized at the start (less than 25 percent). In fact, annual budget allocations for the sector averaged 5 percent, much 

lower than anticipated by PNIASA’s financing plan and the Maputo objective of 10% public spending on agriculture. 

As lessons learnt from PNIASA underperformance, it is worthy to have ambitious development objective, but 

mobilization of required resources and its efficient distribution and use across the activities driving growth are critical 

to meet it. Also, whatever the agricultural potential and opportunities offered by the country, private sector could be 

attracted if and only the business environment is favorable. 

15. Like the new PNDES approved in June 2017 by the Parliament, PNIASA 2 will be consistent with the African Union’s 

Agenda 2063 for the structural transformation of Africa, the Paris Agreement (COP 21) on climate change and the 

UN’s Universal Program for Sustainable Development.  PNIASA 2 will also be based on the main principles of the 

Malabo Declaration (2014) which reaffirms that agriculture is at the heart of Africa’s economic and social development 

while enlarging governments’ commitments to areas, such as rural infrastructure, natural resource management and 

nutrition which, are critical for agricultural growth and poverty reduction.  

16. Realigning its interventions to the PASANDAD, World bank will support the development of value chains and the 

emergence of commercial agriculture, complementing ongoing operations with (i) the proposed IDA operation 

focusing on selected staple crops for domestic and regional market, (ii) an IBRD-enclave operation focusing on 

potentially exportable crops for international market, (iii) another IDA operation on rural mobility and connectivity, 

and (iv) a Development Policy Operation (DPO) supporting structural reform in the governance of the sector and 

particularly the agricultural subsidy program for more targeting, transparency and efficiency. In addition, a review of 

the agricultural sector and the Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) are being completed. The proposed project will 

draw heavily on findings from these analytical works.  

17. Progress is being made by the Agriculture Sector Support Project (PASA-G) on strengthening institutional capacity 

and by the West Africa Agricultural Productivity Program (WAAPP) on reinforcing research, regional transfer of 

innovations and improved technologies to farmers, and rebuilding seeds production systems. Building on these 

achievements, to pave way for structural agricultural transformation for inclusive economic growth and poverty 

reduction, Guinea needs to: (i) increase agricultural productivity through a climate-smart intensification and 

sustainable mechanization of the production systems to create jobs, leveraging on WAAPP; (ii) develop and integrate 

agricultural values chains and food systems to increase value addition; (iii) improve competitiveness and develop 

agricultural markets seizing upon growing domestic, regional and international food demand; (iv) reinforce basic 

production infrastructure and logistics to enable irrigation, connection, connectivity or mobility, storage and agro-

processing for a better agri-business environment more attractive to the private sector. Also, a special attention 

should be paid to finding ways to attract youth to modern agribusiness including access to water and land-efficient 

technologies, modern labor-saving irrigation and agro-processing technologies, and advisory and financial services. 

The project will be instrumental in contributing to this development agenda. 

Relationship to CPF 
 
18. The last closing Guinea Country Partnership Strategy (CPS, 2014-2017) focused on: (i) improving governance and 

service delivery, (ii) stimulating growth and economic diversification, and (iii) strengthening human capital. A 

Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) is being completed. The SCD identified two hypotheses and the five most critical 

binding constraints and opportunities facing Guinea in achieving the World Bank Group’s twin goals of ending extreme 

poverty and boosting shared prosperity. The first hypothesis arguing that poor political and economic governance is 

at the center of Guinea’s development difficulties, leading to natural resources mismanagement, institutional 

fragmentation, and ineffective public investment. The second hypothesis is that low levels of structural transformation 

are affected by unproductive agriculture and poorly planned urbanization. Guinea’s position regarding agriculture is 

interesting since Guinea is performing significantly below its potential despite abundant rainfall and agricultural land. 

For a variety of historical reasons, agriculture was not given prominence in Guinea, and the potential for agricultural 

development remains largely underexploited. The three critical binding constraints related to agriculture are the 

following. First, although resilient, Guinea’s agriculture is underperforming, partly due to farmers’ limited access to 

quality inputs (fertilizer, seeds, and equipment). Second, Guinea’s poor infrastructure (road, ports and logistics 

services, power and telecommunications) is a major obstacle to private sector development. Finally, access to finance 

is difficult for smallholders and entrepreneurs and low levels of private investment and undercapitalization are 

manifest. Taken together, the improvement in these constraints will be able to help Guinea move forward. The project 

will be instrumental in addressing most of these constraints in the agricultural sector by improving productivity, value 

chain diversification and integration, market development and competitiveness, infrastructures and logistics to enable 

agribusiness development and create job. A multisector approach will be used bringing Agriculture, Trade and 

Competitiveness, and Transport Global Practices to team up. The project will support anticipatively the 

implementation of the upcoming CPS which will be guided by findings from the SCD. The project is also consistent 

with the Africa Regional Strategy. 

C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  
 
19. The Project development objective is to increase productivity, processing and market transactions between producers 

and other actors participating in targeted agricultural values chains in the project areas. 

Key Results (From PCN) 
 
20. The proposed PDO level performance indicators are: i) Number of Farmers reached with agricultural assets or services 

of which female (at least 40%) and youth (at least 10%); ii) Increase in productivity (ton/ha) of targeted agricultural 

commodities by direct beneficiaries; (iii) Volume of targeted agricultural commodities processed with the new 

facilities (t); and (iv) Increase in volume of market sales of targeted agricultural commodities by Project-supported 

beneficiaries (%). A detailed result monitoring framework and indicators would be developed during project 

preparation.  

21. It is expected that the project would result in increased productivity and production coupled with reduced post-

harvest losses, more integrated agricultural systems, improved product range and quality, more efficient processing 

with a better access to facilities, and improved marketing and mobility, thereby generating additional incomes for 

producers and other operators in the targeted value chains. The preliminary selected value chains are rice, maize, 

horticulture (vegetables and fruits), livestock (poultry in particular) and aquaculture (fresh, dry and smoked fish) for 

which market opportunities exist and productivity gains are achievable through better water control and adoption of 

proven technologies leveraging on WAAPP. These commodities present potentially profitable business opportunities 

that can attract youth and the private sector and contribute directly to rural poverty reduction as production is 

dominated by poor smallholders. The project will be gender-sensitive targeting both men and women as key players 

of the value chains. It is expected also that the project would develop an innovative business model for youth insertion 

in agribusiness replicable throughout the region. 

22. The project would contribute to integrated agricultural development to improve food security, income and youth 

employment. This would be achieved by improving productive infrastructure, integrating values chains, and 

developing agribusinesses and markets. An integrated approach would be used vertically along the targeted values 

chains and horizontally across the selected agricultural subsectors including crops, livestock and aquaculture.  

 

D. Concept Description 


23. The design of the proposed project would build upon the achievements and lessons learned from the 

implementation of on-going or closed projects and programs in Guinea and elsewhere in the region. Close 

coordination and synergy would be sought with ongoing or upcoming projects and programs, and approaches would 

be harmonized to leverage support in critical areas, optimize development outcomes and avoid duplication. In 

particular, partnerships would be sought with (i) the project financed by Agence Française de Développement (French 

Development Agency - AFD) and the European Union (EU) for developing rice-cum-fish production; (ii) the forthcoming 

AFD-financed rural road project; (iii) the Third Village Community Project (PACV) financed by IDA and AFD; (iv) the 

West African Agricultural Productivity Program (WAAPP) financed by IDA; (v) the Agriculture Sector Support Project 

(PASA-G); (vi) the Agricultural Services Support Project financed by USAID under its « Feed the Future » Program; (vii) 

the Growth Pole Project under preparation for funding by the Abu Dhabi Development Fund; (viii) the upcoming rural 

mobility and connectivity project financed by IDA; and (ix) the future IBRD-enclave project.  

24. The design of the project considers the growing need for Guinea to transformits agriculture sector by increasing 

substantially productivity and resilience against climate change, integrating values chains, developing markets, 

improving competitiveness, and reinforcing infrastructure to foster economic growth, improve food security and 

nutrition, and contribute to end extreme poverty. With the increasing concern for youth employment, it is more than 

ever critical to enable agriculture to offer attractive business opportunities for youth. The project will focus support 

on (i) a selected number of value chains that are both important in terms of food and nutrition security, and have 

significant development potential to respond to market opportunities; (ii) a selected geographical area to resolve the 

binding constraints on productivity, quality, value-addition and market linkages. 

25. The proposed project would consist of four interconnected components structured as follows: 

Component 1:  Supporting productive infrastructure and logistics systems 
 

26.  This component would support critical public and private infrastructure and logistics systems required to better 
valorize land and water resources to improve productivity and competitiveness of agricultural value chains. It would 
consist of three sub-components: 
 

27. Subcomponent 1.1: Water control and management. This subcomponent would consist of improving water 

management and small scale irrigation systems within existing irrigation schemes to be rehabilitated or developed. 

Land planning and water management are critical in strengthening resilience and increasing productivity and 

competitiveness. This would enable the expansion of cropped areas, the mechanization of production systems and 

production two to three times a year and consequently, yield increases. Increasing the cropping intensity is yet an 

opportunity to be exploited for Guinea agricultural development. Less than 10% of the irrigable land estimated at 

360,000 ha is developed. Also, the project would contribute to restore and develop under-used low-land (9,000 ha 

out of a potential of 180,000 ha) and flood plains (8,000 ha out of a potential of 200,000 ha). A master planning study 

on irrigation is underway and will inform the interventions areas and perimeters to be targeted. By targeting some 

works with no or limited environmental impact such as catchment weirs and drainage networks, supporting small-

scale irrigation systems and promoting the adoption of efficient water and land management technologies, the project 

would contribute significantly to developing irrigated agriculture in line with PANSANDAD priorities. It would support 

the use of improved labor-saving irrigation systems to modernize horticultural production, alleviate women’s 

irrigation burden and attract youth to this business. It would finance water user associations and develop management 

procedures and guidelines to ensure the sustainability of irrigation infrastructures. The project would aim at a 

substantial increase in yield in the irrigated perimeters, leveraging on WAAPP for producer access to improved 

certified seeds and technologies.  

28. Subcomponent 1.2: Storage, conditioning and logistics systems. This subcomponent would address the lack of 

agricultural machinery, storage, conditioning and logistics assets that prevent value chain development. It would seek 

to improve postharvest management facilities to improve quality, lower costs and enhance competitiveness, 

particularly for domestically produced rice and horticultural crops. In particular, the project would finance: (i) storage 

facilities for adequate conservation of the harvest; (ii) agro-processing equipment to reduce post-harvest losses and 

allow processing and packaging of agricultural produces for value addition; (iii) production and processing facilities for 

livestock (poultry and milk) and fish produces (smoked and dry); (iv) agricultural market infrastructure; and (v) 

processing platforms in targeted large production zones and in partnership with the upcoming IBRD-Enclave 

operation. Investment selection would be based on selection criteria including economic analyses. Investments would 

require a business plan, a mechanism for sustainable operation, and be tied to market demand.  Private sector 

involvement in those investments could be structured either through direct investment, joint ventures or PPP projects.  

29. Finally, the project would work closely with the Rural Mobility and Connectivity project under preparation to unlock 

production areas, connect farmers to markets, and attract private sector investment in agricultural values chains.  The 

required roads to be built in the targeted areas would be jointly identified. 

Component 2: Increasing agricultural productivity 
 

30. Subcomponent 2.1: Access to quality inputs and machinery. The project would leverage on WAAPP to enable the 

wide diffusion of improved technologies including certified seeds of improved varieties, fertilizers, best and 

environmentally-friendly practices for the intensification of production systems. The project’s emphasis would be on 

supporting appropriate and sustainable agricultural mechanization through the transfer of improved motorized 

machinery developed throughout the region leveraging on WAAPP, the development of machinery services and 

leasing systems. The project would provide financial and technical assistance for entrepreneurs developing 

agricultural machinery and using appropriate technology to develop prototypes and systems.  It would engage these 

entrepreneurs via business plan competitions and matchmaking with regional and international incubators for 

innovation and appropriate technology.  

31. Subcomponent 2.2: Institutional strengthening. Leveraging on WAAPP, the project would provide support to the 

national extension service, the Agence National de la Promotion Rurale et du Conseil Agricole (National Agency for 

Rural Promotion and Agricultural Council - ANPROCA), strengthening its institutional capacity through financial and 

logistic support, and capacity building. Efforts would be put on connecting and articulating agricultural extension 

services to research to enable dissemination of improved technologies and agricultural advisory services. 

Component 3: Developing and integrating agricultural values chains  
 

32. Subcomponent 3.1: Capacity building and value chain coordination. Under this sub-component, the project would 

strengthen the technical and management skills of producers’ groups including youth and women’s groups, 

cooperatives, professional associations and other stakeholders benefiting from the project. With support from agro-

processing research institutes, more sophisticated agribusiness firms, NGOs and entrepreneurship incubators, training 

would focus on improving and upgrading agro-processing technologies. Training may concern packaging and 

compliance with food safety standards for quality assurance while promoting artisanal agro-processing. Training in 


accounting, operations, using technology for business, financial management and marketing may be provided. The 

project would develop, adapt and/or deliver training on a range of business and technical subjects. Innovative personal 

initiative training that encourages entrepreneurial thinking and problem solving may also be delivered. Building on 

WAAPP experiences, innovation platforms may be created or reinforced for some value chains to develop partnerships 

among stakeholders. These efforts would build on, and may form partnerships with past and present training and 

capacity building efforts of World Bank Group partners, and other donors and organizations. IFC’s Agribusiness team 

may help replicate its Agribusiness Leadership Program which aims to professionalize producers/cooperatives by 

improving their technical and managerial capacity, and supporting them to access finance. The project may collaborate 

with IFAD’s program (Plan National d’Appui aux Acteurs des Filières Agricoles) whose objective is also to provide 

capacity building to farmer’s organization in the same value chains targeted by this project. FAO and AFD have similar 

programs in different value chains. Finally, for coordination of all initiatives on farmer’s professionalization, the project 

may work within the local Market Ecosystem Alliance (AMEA) platform, under creation by the IFC’s Agribusiness 

advisory team, which aims to standardize tools and mechanisms for farmers’ professionalization. For SMEs, more 

involved at the middle of value-chains (processing, packaging, storage, transportation), the recently-created SME 

Business center under Guinea MSME Project has the potential to become a robust platform to provide technical and 

management capacity to SME. The project would take stock of the SME Business Center’s development with an aim 

to partnering with it to deliver technical assistance and services.  

33.  Subcomponent 3.2: Access to finance for agribusiness development. This subcomponent would promote youth 

entrepreneurship and private sector investment in agribusiness through a matching grant mechanism to be defined 

in consultation with stakeholders. The project would support development of Micro, Small and Medium Agribusiness 

Enterprises (MSMAEs) to increase domestic production and processing of high-quality rice, horticultural produces 

(mango, pineapple, banana, potatoes etc.), and livestock, particularly for poultry and dairy products, and fish 

(aquaculture, dry and smoked fish etc.). The percentage of cost sharing required by beneficiaries would be determined 

during the project design phase. The matching grants may be disbursed through one or more windows each targeting 

specific types of beneficiaries, kinds of financial support or objectives. Training and capacity building activities would 

be made available to complement financing. The project would develop relationships with financial institutions to 

encourage co-financing of beneficiaries’ activities. Under this subcomponent, support would be given to the creation 

of integrated aquaculture-poultry-rice firms leveraging experience developed in Nigeria under the West and Central 

Africa Council for Agricultural Research and Development (CORAF/WECARD) Multi-Donor Trust Fund.  In addition, this 

subcomponent would support the development of agricultural machinery services led by youth groups or producers’ 

organizations.   

34. Subcomponent 3.3: Formation of productive alliances for cash crops. The productive alliance is an economic 

agreement between a group of organized producers and a buyer (intermediary, wholesaler, agro-processor or 

processor, international mining company) in which all parties assume risks, provide resources, and share the benefits, 

such that the agreement can continue over the medium and long term. The subcomponent’s main output would be 

the implementation of subprojects with clearly defined and sustainable goals, and cost sharing accompanied by 

technical assistance and business development services. It would help build productive alliances between rural 

producers and their buyers (intermediaries, wholesalers, processors or exporters) for cash crops value chains, and 

finance part of joint business plans. By formalizing relationships among value chain actors, the project would facilitate 

access to finance and expand opportunities for investment in cash crop value chains ultimately increasing the revenues 

of producers and industrial firms, improving the quality of Guinean products, and increasing exports and value added.  



35. This subcomponent would leverage past and ongoing efforts in Guinea to study and develop productive alliances. The 

World Bank and the IFC have undertaken studies to identify potential sectors and potential value chain participants 

for productive alliances. This effort would be linked to IFC’s network of more sophisticated agribusinesses that may 

be interested in buying from producers’ associations associated with the project. This subcomponent would link with 

IFC and World Bank work with financial institutions to de-risk, identify opportunities and increasingly lending to 

agribusinesses. Furthermore, the project would leverage ongoing IFC initiatives supporting the development of the 

local content in the mining sector specifically to overcome obstacles to selling food to the mines.  

36. Subcomponent 3.4: Provision of the market information system: This subcomponent would finance collaboration 

with producers’ and marketing associations to provide agribusinesses with the information they need to plan their 

operations and transact with their customers. The project would build upon pre-existing IT solutions in place where 

possible, or create new systems that are responsive to the needs of agribusinesses, their suppliers and their 

customers, and managed by market-oriented organizations. The goal would be to link producers to customers in 

markets in urban areas in Guinea and in neighboring countries, build business relationships between buyers and 

sellers, and facilitate transactions. A survey of market information systems initiatives and use, and an action plan 

would be prepared during project preparation.  

37. Subcomponent 3.5: Support to investment promotion in agricultural value chains. Through a results-based 

Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Investment Promotion Agency (APIP), this subcomponent would 

finance experts, targeted Technical Assistance (TA), consulting services, trainings, and IT development and equipment 

to facilitate private investments in agribusiness and cash crop value chains. Support for APIP under the Guinea MSME 

Development Project has increased the Agency’s capabilities, but agribusiness investing is and requires special 

attention. The new project would continue to support APIP so that it can attract and retain agribusiness investors, 

both foreign and domestic. This subcomponent would also fund efforts to improve public-private dialogue to inform 

policy decisions that take stock of the needs of agribusiness investors. The project would use the World Bank-

developed framework, “Enabling the Business of Agriculture,” to identify business environment constraints to 

investment support activities to overcome them.  

 

Component 4: Project implementation and coordination 
 

38. This component aims to ensure that the project is efficiently managed, monitored, and that performance and impacts 

are carefully tracked. It would: (i) finance the incremental expenses incurred in implementing the project through the 

project implementation unit (PIU) and the participating field implementing agencies and various service providers; (ii) 

provide technical assistance through consultancies, audits, and training to enhance implementation capacity of the 

PIU; (iii) finance communication and outreach activities; (iv) finance monitoring and evaluation of project outcomes 

and impacts; (v) support institutional strengthening to ensure sustainability of the project; and (vi) provision funds to 

address emergency demands arising from natural disasters or other shocks.  

39. Finally, the project may finance the agricultural census in partnership with others donors.  
 

  

  SAFEGUARDS 

 

A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 
 
Activities with a physical footprint includes water control and management, building or rehabilitating storage facilities 

and establishment or development of Micro, Small and Medium Agribusiness Enterprises (MSMAEs) to increase domestic 
production and processing capacities for staple crops including high-quality rice, horticultural produces (mango, 
pineapple, banana, potatoes etc.), livestock and particularly poultry and dairy produces, and fish produces (aquaculture, 
dry and smoked fish etc.). The physical locations and specific details of the proposed project interventions are not as yet 
known. 
 

 
B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 

 
This preliminary Borrower’s institutional Capacity for Safeguard policies will be completed during the project preparation 

to complete the information that are not yet available. The preliminary assessment considers:  
(i)-Policy framework:  
Article 19 (3) of the constitution states that: "the People has the right to the preservation of his heritage, culture and of 

its environment ".  Therefore, the environmental policy framework is rooted in the provisions of the Constitution. The 
Environment code was published on May 28, 1987. In November 8, 1989 the government published a Decree Regulating 
Impact Studies. 
(ii)-Operationalization of policy framework:  
The national Environmental and Social Assessment and ESIA review process is under the responsibility of the Ministry of 

the Environment through the Guinean Bureau of Studies and Environmental Assessment (BGEEE). It is part of its functions 
to monitoring and preserving the quality of the environment and advising the Government on the environmental issues. 
Since March 2013, the Government adopted a General Environmental Assessment Guide that provides project 

developers with technical support to carry out environmental and social impact studies necessary for a better analysis of 
their projects.  
(iii)-Resourcing 
In general, the ministry of environment and other state institutions in charge to handle environmental and social issues 

including BGEEE are poorly staffed.  
At the institutional level, environmental and social units are set up in the main sectors (agriculture, livestock and 

fisheries). At the decentralized level, the environmental monitoring committees (CPSE) exist.  
At the concept stage of the project, the structure that will host the PIU is not yet found.  Once defined, an in-depth 

assessment will be conducted and an action plan defined. The Unit will hire full time Environmental and Social 
Development Specialists during project preparation and implementation period.  
(iv)-Practice/outcomes/track record 
BGEEE statistics are not published yet annually  confirming that a robust archiving system will be necessary.  Despite the 

past experience with the WB safeguards policies implementation (WAAPP, PASAG, PRAO…) the borrower capacity to 
ensure the safeguards implementation in the in the satisfactory manner remains low and more capacity building will be 
needed including the logistic support to BGEEE. 
 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

The proposed project is categorized as B under this OP 
because its potential social and environmental risks 
are expected to moderate and mostly site specific, 
with no significant or long-term negative impacts. The 
potential environmental impacts are related to 
components 1, 2 and 3 activities ( Water control and 
management, building or rehabilitating storage 
facilities and establishment or development of Micro, 
Small and Medium Agribusiness Enterprises (MSMAEs) 
to increase domestic production and processing 
capacities for high-quality rice, horticultural produces 
(mango, pineapple, banana, potatoes etc.), livestock 
and particularly poultry and dairy produces, and fish 
produces (aquaculture, dry fish etc.).   An ESMF will be 
prepared and disclosed prior appraisal to guide the 
way that potential negative environmental and social 
impacts of future sub-projects (following the positive 
list) will be identified and mitigated during the project 
implementation. In the meantime, specific sites will be 
identified during the project preparation and 
ESIAs/EMPs prepared for the first year of the project 
implementation. 

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 TBD  

Forests OP/BP 4.36 TBD 

The decision to trigger or not this policy will be taken 
prior appraisal. Nevertheless, the project activities will 
avoid any negative impacts on the health and quality 
of forests. The project will avoid financing any activity 
that should have any negative impact in the natural 
forests. The ESMF will include sections relevant on 
how. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

The project activities will likely increase the use of 
chemical pesticides which could have negative 
environmental and health impacts. A pest 
management plan will be prepared to mitigate this 
risk. Moreover, the Project will support the diffusion 
of best agricultural practices environmentally-friendly 
including  integrated pest management practices 
combining chemical and biological control of pest and 
disease to support sustainable agriculture. 



Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 Yes 

The proposed operation will involve excavations and 
movement of earth for the building facilities. During 
the development of the ESMF physical cultural 
resources will be taken into consideration and 
baselines defined.  The ESMF will include clear 
procedures that will be required for identification, 
protection of cultural property from theft, and 
treatment of discovered artifacts, and will be included 
in standard bidding documents. The ESMF will also 
provide procedures for handling with “chance finds” 
during implementation project activities. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 No  

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

Involuntary Resettlement is triggered in the vent that 
sub-projects should involve involuntary resettlement 
as the Project will finance construction/rehabilitation 
of processing facilities; and infrastructures that may 
imply land acquisition in the covered areas. A RPF will 
be prepared that will guide the management of such 
situations should they arise during project 
implementation. RAPs will be prepared as and when 
necessary. 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 No The project is not anticipating financing any dam. 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

No 
The project does not anticipate any wide activity that 
could impact international waterways. only small 
irrigation scheme will be rehabilitated or developed. 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No 
The project does not anticipate any disputes in the 
targeted area.

INTRODUCTION AND CONTEXT 

 
 
 
A. Country Context 
 

The Independent State of Papua New Guinea (PNG) is one of the most culturally diverse countries in the world with over 
800 languages and 1,000 ethnic groups1. It has a total land area of approximately 460,000km2 comprised of 600 islands 
of various sizes, and hosts a remarkably varied number of species and ecosystems. The country is separated into four 
regions – Highlands, Islands, Momase and Southern – and 21 provinces. In 2017, its population was estimated at close to 
8 million2. Of this, over 80 percent live in rural areas and the rest in small urban centers with populations of under 
30,000.    
 
PNG is a relatively stable democracy and had an average GDP growth of 6.85 percent between 2005 and 2010, however 
like other resource-dependent countries, it is feeling the impacts of the fall in global commodity prices, with GDP growth 
estimated at 2.4 percent in 2016 and projected for 2.1 percent in 20173 and real GDP per capita growth in 2016 was 0.3 
percent, down from 10.1 percent in 2014. The country is dominated by two main sectors: the formal, capital-intensive 
mining and energy sector which relies heavily on the country’s rich natural resources and accounts for most of the 
export earnings, and the agriculture sector which, while largely informal, employs an estimated 80 percent of the 
population and accounts for approximately 27 percent of GDP3.  
 
Despite considerable natural wealth and reasonable economic performance over the past decade, PNG’s rural 
population continues to face significant challenges. The disparity between rural and urban living conditions is 
exacerbated by the country’s difficult terrain which increases hardship, poverty, and isolation in rural areas, and limits 
access to basic services, infrastructure and economic markets. Less than 20 percent of rural households have access to 
electricity, 60 percent lack access to safe drinking water, and an estimated 80 percent lack access to improved 
sanitation2.    
 
The 2010 Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) noted that in 2009, approximately 38 percent of the 
population lived below the extreme poverty line of US $1.90 per day, about the same proportion as in 1996.  PNG’s 
Human Development Index (HDI) ranking was 155 in 2010 and improved by one place to 154 in 2015, the second lowest 
in the Pacific2. It has the fourth highest child stunting rate in the world. An estimated 28 percent of children are 
underweight and 5-15 percent are wasted. The highlands region has the highest rates of stunting at 61.5 percent, and 

the island region has the highest wasting and underweight rates at 19 percent and 29.2 percent respectively. The 
economic cost of undernutrition is high, in 2015-2016, it was estimated to have cost the economy 2.81 percent of 
annual GDP (equivalent to US$ 508 million)4.   
 
Gender-based violence (GBV) is widespread in PNG, and the country ranks 158 out of 188 countries in the 2014 Gender 
Inequality Index3. GBV severely affects women’s ability to contribute to the economy, participate in business activities, 
and support family livelihoods. Violence and crime are high along the country’s transport corridors where much of the 
rural population are engaged in agriculture, trade, and the transportation of goods. 
 
PNG’s road network is highly fragmented and poorly maintained with only about 35 percent of national roads sealed2 
and no roads connecting most provinces and ports. PNG’s vulnerability to climate risks and hazards due to climate 
variability and complex geography further exacerbate problems with the transport network resulting in an estimated 75 
percent or more of the road network – national, provincial and district – becoming impassable at some point during the 
year2. The country is subject to both El Niño and La Niña events and both can have significant impacts such as severe 
droughts, landslides and flooding from increased rainfall5. The World Risk Report 2016 ranks PNG 10th, with a risk index 
of 16.43%, due to the country’s high exposure to natural disasters and its high social and economic vulnerability to these 
events6. The February 2018 magnitude 7.5 earthquake and aftershocks affected 544,368 people across five provinces of 
Hela, Southern, Enga, Western and Gulf provinces. In the Southern Highlands and Hela provinces alone, it is estimated to 
have killed over 100 people, displaced 18,200 and left 270,442 people in need of immediate humanitarian assistance. It 
has also left 32% of health facilities closed and, of those that are open, only a third are undamaged7. 
 
B. Sectoral and Institutional Context 
 
Sectoral context:  
PNG is characterized by its diverse agro-ecological environments (highlands, lowlands, islands), favorable climate and 
fertile soils allowing the farming of many different agricultural products, including both cultivation of cash and staple 
crops, as well as livestock production. While PNG’s export economy is presently dominated by minerals (gold and 
copper) and oil, the contribution of agricultural exports in the renewable resources sector is significant, at around 
23.1%. The main agricultural exports of the country include cocoa, coffee, copra, palm oil, rubber, and tea. The 
predominant mode of farming is in smallholder farms of less than 5 ha. Village agriculture, which supports over 80 
percent of the population, remains dominated by subsistence food production. It generates little cash income and is 
characterized by low productivity. Despite good intentions, governments, commodity boards and agencies have 
provided village farmers with little help to raise their productivity in order to improve food and nutrition security, and to 
enable them to participate more effectively in commercial activities. Translation of new knowledge to business and 
commercial opportunities has been lacking for many years. Major crops, except palm oil, have historically been 
marketed by statutory marketing boards. These arrangements as well as measures in the past such as stabilization funds 
for selected commodities (coffee, cocoa, and coconuts) have not been efficient, with over regulation of major 
commodities perhaps impeding agricultural development. In the past, labor-intensive plantation estates of some 50-150 
hectares have grown tree products for export, especially palm oil, coffee, cocoa, coconut, tea, and rubber, but except 
for palm oil, their production share is decreasing to the benefit of smallholder farmers. 
 
Coffee and cocoa are key cash crops. Papua New Guinea is considered a small coffee producer in the international 
market, but the high quality of its coffee and cocoa is recognized and sought after. Nearly 30 and 20 percent of the total 

       
     

labor force in the country is engaged in the production of coffee and cocoa, respectively. The majority of coffee is under 
the production of smallholder farmers with low productivity, and diseconomies of scale, and the main constraint is the 
limited capacity of the country to reliably meet market demand in quantity and quality. The development of coffee and 
cocoa production as an agribusiness for smallholder farmers is limited due to several constraints. These include: high 
transaction costs due to diseconomies of scale, limited market access, lack of access to information and technologies 
due to poor extensions services, poor rural infrastructure, and lack of access to rural finance. 
 
A robust internal fresh food and livestock products market exists. However, value chains are not well developed. 
Livestock production, except for pigs and poultry, remains static or on the decline since the 1970s. Meat consumption in 
PNG on the other hand, has increased steadily over the last two decades, and is predicted to increase at a conservative 
rate of 5% per annum. Increased demand for meat is met by meat imports, and is influenced by population growth rate, 
urbanization, changes in disposable income of citizens, and changes in people’s eating habits. 
 
Agriculture has under-performed. This is due primarily to low productivity, largely reflecting inadequate research and 
development, poor application of technological improvements and lack of scale economies inherent in smallholder 
farming. Other major constraints include inadequate transport and marketing infrastructure facilities, unreliable and 
expensive utilities, poor extension and veterinary services, prevalent crime and lawlessness, and insecurity of land 
ownership and tenure. However, some reasons for hope exist. For instance, the World Bank funded Productive 
Partnerships in Agriculture project (PPAP – P110959) is demonstrating in the coffee and cocoa sectors that the 
productive partnership model can help overcome some of the bottlenecks and facilitate the integration of smallholder 
farmers into effective supply/value-chains and link them to markets, which remains a priority for the Government of 
PNG (GoPNG). In the PPAP model, farmers join a partnership coordinated by a “Lead Partner (LP)” (the private sector in 
70 percent of cases, although sometimes an NGO or academic institution) through paying a small fee (contribution to 
the planned activities). The LP access a grant from the project to purchase tools and seedlings (including innovative 
cocoa clones) to be distributed to farmers, renovate processing facilities or organize training on a broad range of topics; 
technical (coffee or cocoa on-farm good practice), gender, HIV-AIDS, nutrition, etc. This increased proximity between LPs 
and the smallholder farmers has greatly contributed to: (i) increasing their on-farm productivity (over two-fold as of the 
time of writing), and (ii) link them to a potential buyer and therefore the markets.  
 
In December 2014, the World Bank completed a piece of analytical work studying the role of women in the agriculture 
sector in PNG8, notably related to coffee, cocoa and fresh produce. The main finding was that women provide 
substantial labor in both coffee and cocoa cultivation, and they dominate in the fresh produce sectors. More important 
than the amount of labor women provide, analysis of these supply chains indicated that the specific tasks women 
undertake have a direct bearing on the quality of the final product. However, different labor dynamics, gender-specific 
barriers to access key services (extension and financial) and insecurity (violence limiting women’s ability to serve in the 
field as researchers and extension agents) affect this potential outcome. In early 2018, a more specific gender time-use 
study among PPAP farmers9 highlighted that there is an imbalance between men and women’s time-use with possible 
discrimination against women which negatively impacts crop productivity and household welfare. Beside household 
awareness-raising and training on gender dynamics, reducing the domestic work burden for women before they can 
engage in more value-added agricultural activities should be a priority. 
 
Institutional context:  


The GoPNG’s Vision 2050 details the long-term development strategy for PNG.  Launched in 2009, the document sets 
out a vision for transforming the country by 2050 towards a top 50 ranking in the HDI10. It leverages seven strategic 
pillars – human development, wealth creation, environment and climate change, planning, systems and institutions, 
security and international relations, and partnerships with churches – to build this vision and realign the country’s 
economic focus away from the mining and energy sectors which currently dominate development, to new growth 
bases in agriculture, fisheries, forestry, manufacturing and eco-tourism.   
 
Vision 2050 acknowledges both the importance of subsistence agriculture to the rural economy and the cultural lives of 
many, as well as the significant challenges faced by the sector including limited markets, poor infrastructure, ineffective 
extension services, and security and safety concerns.  
 
The previous GoPNG’s National Agriculture Development Plan (NADP) 2007-2016 (currently being updated) recognized 

the importance of the agricultural sector in developing the economic potential of the country, sustaining the basic 

livelihoods of its population, increasing social wellbeing, and providing food security for all. However, its 

implementation has faced several challenges relating to the limited capacity of the Department of Agriculture and 

Livestock (DAL) to enhance implementation performance and monitor progress of outcomes in the sector. 

 
The GoPNG’s Alotau Accord II operationalizes the National Strategy for Responsible and Sustainable Development 
through the Medium-Term Development Plan (MTDP) III reflecting the principles of the PNG Vision 2050 and the PNG 
Development Strategic Plan 2010 - 2030. High on the list of priorities is the adoption of a national population policy 
aimed at accelerating economic growth by using economic stimulus packages in the non-minerals sector (agriculture, 
tourism, fisheries and forestry) to keep pace with a population currently increasing at a growth rate of about 3 percent 
annually.  
 
The government has placed greater emphasis on growing the agriculture sector by giving it greater prominence in its 
2018 budget allocation. To emphasize this commitment, the government held the first ever National Agriculture 
Summit in November 2017 to exchange experiences on successful models. The key priorities from the summit are to: (i) 
grow the economy; (ii) promote import substitution; (iii) promote more accessible and affordable credit; and (iv) place 
greater focus on institutional strengthening. 
 
C. Relationship to CPF 
 

The 2017 PNG Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) is under preparation and is scheduled for Board approval in early 
May 2018. The SCD recognizes the World Bank Group’s long-standing history of support to the agriculture sector in PNG, 
currently led by the Productive Partnerships in Agriculture Project (PPAP). Since 2011, the PPAP has been providing 
support to smallholder coffee and cocoa farmers with the aim of improving their livelihoods. Important lessons have 
emerged from the implementation of the PPAP which could assist the SCD to identify opportunities for inclusive growth 
in the agriculture sector in PNG, and support the World Bank Group’s twin goals of ending extreme poverty and boosting 
shared prosperity. The third Pillar of the draft SCD (Enabling private sector development for inclusive job creation and 
growth) recognizes the central role played by agriculture in providing opportunities for inclusive growth and bolstering 
food security. The SCD recommends an “extension of PPAP-type programs to more districts and regions and more crop-
types” – which is exactly what the PACD intends to do.

will be added in this results framework.  
 

PROJECT CONTEXT 

 
A. Concept 
 
1. Description 

 
The Productive Partnerships in Agriculture Project (PPAP P110959 + PPAP AF P146003) is scheduled to close on June 30, 
2019 and has delivered significant benefits to PNG’s cocoa and coffee sector farmers. In order to build on and 
consolidate PPAP’s achievements, the PNG Agriculture Commercialization and Diversification Project (PACD) would 
continue to support the cocoa and coffee sectors, and may also add the following commodities: small livestock, spices, 
rubber and coconuts. The additional commodities to be supported under the new project will be narrowed down to 2 
or 3 commodities based on criteria, including level of preparedness of the value-chain and possible return on 
investments11. Further stock-taking will be required during the project preparation, including, if the need is identified, 
specific value-chain analysis to help the decision-making process. DAL has already started this work which should be 
completed prior to pre-Appraisal. The FAO Investment Center will support the DAL and the WB Task Team in this stock-
taking exercise and commodity final selection. 
 
Beneficiaries: GoPNG’s emphasis is on agriculture to accelerate economic growth and generate revenues, this may 
require a targeted approach towards farmers willing to move from subsistence to semi-commercial or commercial 
farming (therefore being less inclusive than in the case of PPAP). However, the smallholder farmers remain the primary 
direct beneficiaries of the new project, together with the groups and cooperatives formed by those better-off and 
willing to address common issues collectively. While building on PPAP, considerations around the possibility of looking 
at a complementary window targeting more progressive farmers and those who are ready to take risks and form more 

                                            
11 Agreed criteria comprise: (i) competitiveness and existence of a market justifying good return on investments, (ii) availability of technical advisory and 
extension services for these specific commodities, whether of public or private origin, (iii) tradition of integrating the selected commodities in cocoa and 
coffee farming system, as a diversification strategy, (iv) importance of women participation in the specific commodities, (v) share of the value-chains’ 
income remaining with the smallholder producers, (vi) size of the population involved or benefiting from the selected commodities, and (vii) commitment 
of different level of Government (including Provincial and District) to it. 

commercial alliances under a common set of constraints and opportunities will be explored. Additional direct 
beneficiaries will be SMEs (mainly micro- and small private enterprises) involved in agri-business activities (storage, 
processing, marketing, inputs supply). DAL and Commodities Board staff will also benefit from capacity building 
interventions. 
  
Regarding the geographical scope, the MTDP identifies ten “Economic Corridors” for priority services delivery, defining 
zones for development of public transport and utilities network, social services and integration of economic plans 
including agriculture. The PACD will align its geographical scope to this GoPNG strategy and support some of these 
economic corridors, based on transparent selection criteria to be defined during preparation. 
 
The PNG Agriculture Commercialization and Diversification Project (PACD) -  interventions will be delivered through five 
components:  

 
Component 1: Institutional capacity building 
The project will address institutional capacity gaps at (i) the central level - DAL, statutory bodies in charge of 
commodities targeted under the project (Cocoa Board, Coffee Industry Corporation, Spices Industry Board, the 
Livestock Development Corporation (LDC) and the Rubber Board – list to be confirmed as per commodities selected 
under the project) and links with the private sector – and, (ii) the decentralized level – provincial and district capacity to 
deliver services: extension, advisory and veterinary services, access to inputs. Research needs may also be included and 
will depend on further discussion during preparation.  
  
This first component will also support the GoPNG in reviewing and, if required, reforming their policy and regulatory 
framework, notably on climate-smart agriculture, extension and veterinary services, quality standards and food safety. 
 
Component 2: Infrastructure networks and logistics 
The infrastructure network, including roads and storage/processing facilities, remains a major bottleneck to farmers’ 
capacity to access markets. This project should contribute to its improvement, with a focus on infrastructure that has a 
public good nature and is essential to the selected value chains. Examples of such infrastructure include feeder roads, 
municipality-managed small-scale slaughterhouses (ensuring better food safety and waste management / pollution 
reduction) or laboratories (for safety and quality tests). As per the PPAP model, feeder roads will be designed and 
constructed to be resistant to heavy rains occurring during the rainy season: they will be slightly curved, include large 
concrete gutters on the side and small log-bridges on water stream sites – therefore adapted to heavy rains which are 
increasing and longer-lasting due to climate change. 
 
Component 3: Productive Partnership-like interventions 
Integrating smallholder farmers into effective supply/value-chains and linking them to markets remains a priority for 
the GoPNG. For this, the Productive Partnerships’ model implemented under the PPAP has been successful and should 
be a strong building block to scale-up. However, additional focus should be put on approaches that promote the 
establishment and capacity building of farmers’ cooperatives that will strengthen the sustainability of the model, 
among other lessons learned.  
 
This component will promote access to services and markets by facilitating the establishment of Productive 
Partnerships, and their access to finance (Matching Grants; involvement of financial institutions) that could finance 
small collective infrastructure (e.g. small storage and processing facilities like community-managed cocoa 
fermenteries), and the introduction of innovative technologies, notably on climate smart agriculture (agro-forestry, 

water collection and micro-irrigation, drought resistance varieties, intensification of small livestock production such as 
poultry and pigs, and bio-digesters). This will be done through establishing two windows for financing:  

(i) one focusing on on-farm productivity (garden regeneration, innovative technologies, etc.) and more inclusive 

regarding smallholder farmers willing/unwilling to join partnerships – this window will expand on the PPAP 

model where a Lead Partner (often from the private sector) can aggregate smallholder farmers and channel 

support to them (advisory services, training, inputs); and  

(ii) one focusing on value-addition and marketing of products, and targeting better-off farmers willing to address a 

common issue (storage, agro-processing, marketing, access to inputs, etc.) collectively through groups and 

cooperatives who become the recipient of the funds. 

 
Component 4: Project Management and Monitoring and Evaluation:  
This activity would support all PCU activities required to manage IDA funds, procure IDA-funded goods and services, 
conduct project M&E including Iterative Beneficiary Monitoring (IBM),12 and comply with safeguard mitigation 
measures.  It would provide training and equipment to modernize DAL operations (computer hardware and software, 
office furniture, vehicles, and so on) at the central level and in the field as needed for project activities. It would also 
support the development and implementation of a communications strategy, as well as general awareness and 
sensitization campaigns about project activities. 
 
Component 5: Contingency Emergency Response Component (Total Cost: US$0):  

Following an eligible crisis or emergency, the government of PNG may request the Bank to re-allocate project funds to 
support emergency response and reconstruction. This component would draw from the uncommitted grant resources 
under the project from other project components to cover an emergency response. These activities would be carried 
out, as needed, to ensure continued achievement of the project development objective. This component will only be 
used in the event that an emergency response is required. 
 
    

  SAFEGUARDS 

 
A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 

 
Target provinces and districts are yet to be confirmed. The project is likely to support core coca production areas in the 

province of East New Britain, the autonomous Region of Bougainville (tropical island regions) and East Sepik (Momase 
Region), and coffee production areas in the provinces of Eastern Highlands, Western Highlands and Simbu (highlands 
regions). The project may expand its geographical coverage with potential support in the livestock, spices, rubber and 
coconut sectors in the same areas.  
PNG is characterized by diverse agricultural and ecological environments, tropical climate and fertile soils. Physical 

characteristics vary considerably between regions and will be described once project location and sectors are confirmed. 
 
B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 

 
The project will be implemented by the Department of Agriculture and Livestock (DAL - lead agency) through a Project 

                                            
12 This activity would monitor beneficiaries of the project starting at the beginning of the implementation with the objective to improve project 
efficiency and increase beneficiary satisfaction and beneficiary engagement. IBM collects information on project implementation, even in insecure 
settings. It is light, low-cost, and rapidly complements project supervision. The approach is problem-oriented and provides feedback to project 
teams through different iterations with the aim of catalyzing improvements in project implementation. IBM collects data directly from beneficiaries 
but keeps data collection efforts to a minimum by relying on few research questions and small samples. 



Coordination Unit (PCU), with specific Project Management Units (PMUs) established for each selected commodity. The 
Department of Works (DOW) will be designated responsibility for infrastructure networks and logistics activities related 
to rural feeder (not paved) roads. 
 
Capacity for implementing safeguard policies is currently weak in each of these agencies. The DAL lacks specific 

safeguard resources. The current World Bank financed PPAP has addressed safeguard capacity constraints within the 
cocoa and coffee PMUs however capacity remains limited and confined to these sub-sectors. DOW has an Environmental 
Management Unit (EMU) however this unit is under-resourced and relatively inexperienced. To address these constraints, 
the PACD will establish a core safeguards team consisting of senior environmental and social specialists within the PCU to 
ensure the effective implementation of safeguard policies across all project activities. The PACD will also finance 
additional environmental and social specialists within DOW to oversee safeguard requirements for project infrastructure 
network and logistic activities related to rural roads.

D. Policies that might apply 

 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

The project is proposed as Category B. The proposed 
investments are small-scale and potential adverse 
impacts can be managed. There are no potential large-
scale, significant or irreversible impacts associated 
with the project. 
 
The project will finance small collective infrastructure 
for partnerships (Component 3) including innovative 
technologies, notably on climate smart agriculture 
(agro-forestry, water collection and micro-irrigation, 
drought resistance varieties, intensification of small 
livestock production (poultry, pigs) and bio-digesters) 
that have the potential for positive impacts on the 
environment. Negative environmental and social 
impacts associated with these activities are expected 
to be minor, localized and temporary primarily 
because of their small-scale and 
household/community focus. 
 
The project will invest in infrastructure networks to 
improve access to market (Component 2). This will 
involve the rehabilitation of feeder roads and the 
development of small-scale community infrastructure

(e.g. small-scale slaughter house and laboratories). 
These small-scale investments have the potential to 
cause some minor adverse environmental and social 
impacts however these are readily managed through 
standard mitigation measures. 
 
An Environmental and Social Management Framework 
(ESMF) is proposed as the safeguards instrument given 
that the specific locations of the investments are not 
known and these will be determined through the 
partnership/grant process. The ESMF will incorporate 
the requirements of the World Group’s 
Environmental, Health and Safety Guidelines (EHSGs) 
and industry specific guidelines for agribusiness, food 
production and pesticides management. 
 
The project also includes a Contingency Emergency 
Response Component to support emergency activities 
that ensure continued achievement of the project 
development objective. The ESMF will outline the 
approach and principles for managing potential E&S 
impacts and risks of the CERC including a screening 
process in accordance with the World Bank’s Rapid 
Response to Crises and Emergencies: Procedural 
Guidelines. 

Performance Standards for Private Sector 
Activities OP/BP 4.03 

No  

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 No 

The project will not finance any activities that 
significantly convert or degrade any protected areas or 
natural habitats as the screening procedures in the 
ESMF will exclude all subprojects with these impacts. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 Yes 

Potential project target sectors including cocoa, spices 
and rubber are frequently associated with agro-
forestry in PNG, often in a positive way. No adverse 
impacts on forests are anticipated. The ESMF will 
contain measures to properly manage the risk of any 
unforeseen adverse environmental impacts of these 
activities. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

The project will support the sustainable use of 
chemical fertilizers and pesticides within an holistic 
farm management model and integrated pest 
management approach. The client will review and 
update the current PPAP Integrated Pest Management 
(IPM) following the standards and requirements set 
forth in OP4.09 and the World Group’s Environmental, 
Health and Safety Guidelines (EHSGs) for agribusiness 


and food production. The project will include 
measures to strengthen the institutional capacity for 
implementing IPM in project areas. This will include a 
stronger focus on health and safety. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 No 

The project will not finance any activities that will have 
impacts on physical cultural resources. Screening and 
chance find procedures will be included in the ESMF to 
exclude all subprojects with these impacts. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 Yes 

The project is likely to be located in areas where 
Indigenous Peoples are the sole or the overwhelming 
majority of direct project beneficiaries. Accordingly, a 
separate Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework 
(IPPF) is not proposed. Rather, in accordance with the 
provisions of OP 4.10, the elements of an IPPF is 
included in the overall project design.  
 
The ESMF will outline steps for ensuring free and prior 
informed consultation are undertaken and broad 
community support is achieved for each Partnership 
and Infrastructure activity under Components 2 and 3 
respectively. This will include a Beneficiaries 
Partnership Framework and Consultation Guidelines. 
 
A Social Assessment will be conducted across target 
sectors/provinces during project preparation to inform 
project design and will include consultations with 
farming communities, local level government 
representatives, grower associations and 
cooperatives, youth and women’s groups, extension 
workers, the private sector, and other relevant 
stakeholders. 
. 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

At present, no involuntary land acquisition is expected 
under the project. The majority of sub-projects will be 
undertaken on customary land with the voluntary 
participation of grants scheme recipient landowners. 
The only exception will be the siting of collective 
infrastructure facilities which will be either on 
Government-owned land or land secured via voluntary 
land donation. A Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) 
will be prepared to address these potential scenarios. 
The RFP will include a voluntary land donation 
protocol to ensure that this approach is properly used, 
verified and documented. 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 No 
The project will not finance any dams as defined under 
OP 4.37. 


Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

No 
The project does not impact or relate to any known 
international waterways as defined under the policy. 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No 
The project is not located in any known disputed areas 
as defined under the policy. 

 
E. Safeguard Preparation Plan  
 
Tentative target date for preparing the Appraisal Stage PID/ISDS 
 
Aug 31, 2018 
 
Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed. The specific studies and 
their timing should be specified in the Appraisal Stage PID/ISDS 
 
The PPAP PCU is in charge of coordinating the preparation of the proposed PACD. Safeguards specialists working for the 

PPAP, together with the support of external safeguards consultants, will conduct the social assessment and consultations 
across target sectors/provinces to inform project design and the preparation of ESMF and RFP. 
 
A Project preparation Advance (PPA) will be processed once the Concept Note is approved and the procurement process 

for these consultants will start after. Therefore, first drafts of these studies are not expected before end of August 2018.

Other Decision (as needed) 
 
B. Introduction and Context 

 
Country Context 

1. The Jamaican economy has historically been characterized by low growth and high public debt, but 
fiscal and structural reforms launched in 2013 are helping to reverse the trend. Real gross domestic product 
(GDP) per capita grew by only 0.5 percent on average per year between 1990 and 2016. Fiscal restraints, higher 
tax revenue, and well-timed liability management operations have reduced the debt-to-GDP ratio by around 25 
percentage points. GDP growth has seen a modest acceleration since the start of reforms, rising to 1.4 percent 
in 2016. The informal sector continues to be large in relative terms, accounting for 43% of official GDP according 
to an ILO 2014 study. The economy remains vulnerable to external shocks.  

2. Rural poverty has remained consistently higher than urban poverty, with an increasing urban-rural gap. 
The national incidence of poverty for 2015 was 21.2 percent, with an urban-rural gap of 14 percentage points 
(28.5 percent in rural areas1 compared to 14.3 percent in the Kingston Metropolitan Area). Socio-economic 
disparities for women and youth continue to contribute to the higher level of rural poverty. If Jamaica is to 
achieve “Developed World” status, as is the goal of the GOJ’s Vision 2030 plan, development of rural areas needs 
to keep pace with development in urban areas. The tourism and food/agriculture sectors hold significant 
potential for rural growth and development because of their importance to the economy overall as well as their 
potential reach into rural areas. 

3. Jamaica is highly vulnerable to climate change and faces significant environmental threats due to its 
geographical location. Between 2004 and 2008, five major storm events caused damages and losses estimated 
at US$1.2 billion. Evidence suggests that Jamaica will likely see increases in severe weather events, such as 
droughts, extreme precipitation, flooding, and increases in the intensity and frequency of hurricanes2. 
Additionally, Jamaica’s vulnerability to sea level rise is more pronounced than in other regions due to the 
potential impact of storm surges from tropical storms and hurricanes on the coast. 

            
Sectoral and Institutional Context 

Agricultural Sector 

4. The agricultural sector is an important contributor to the country’s economic development and is 
recognized as a priority in the GOJ’s mid-term plans. The agricultural sector accounts for 8.0 percent of Jamaica’s 
GDP, and employs 18.7 percent of the active population (of which 44.7 lives in rural areas). Agriculture and agro-
processing in Jamaica are characterized by a few sub-sectors with relatively tight value chains and high-quality 
standards serving export markets and the tourism industry, along with domestic production sub-sectors serving 
local parish markets and supermarkets. Traditional export crops (sugar, bananas, coffee, and citrus) are in 
decline. The “non-traditional” export sector showing strong growth and market potential includes agricultural 
products such as preserved fruits (e.g. ackee) and sauces, condiments, and mixed seasonings (e.g. jerk sauces). 
Jamaica is a net importer of livestock commodities (dairy and meat products). 

5. The small-scale agricultural and food products sector exhibits significant potential for growth, but 
significant challenges remain to be addressed.  Small-scale agriculture has ample potential for serving domestic 
markets but needs to become more competitive with respect to imports by increasing land and labor 
productivity, the quality and reliability of distribution, and climate resiliency.  Small-farmers and micro and small-
sized agri-businesses enterprises tend to be at a comparative disadvantage in accessing higher value markets due 
to lack of market information, inefficient production practice, outdated technologies, lack of value addition, 
diseconomies of scale, and high logistics costs. Limited access to financing is among the key challenges to 
agriculture competitiveness and related MSMEs. Weaknesses in the connectivity of rural areas is also limiting 
marketing opportunities and access to potentially attractive inland tourism sites.   

6. The natural environment exposes the agriculture and food sector to frequent weather shocks and high 
levels of climatic variability – further exacerbated by climate change.  Climate change has caused a trend of 
rising temperatures, worsening rainfall variability, and droughts, and here the frequency and intensity of extreme 
events is likely to rise in the future.  This will make soil and crop management more difficult, especially in coastal 
areas, which are threatened by a decline in fertility or being washed away. Crops need to be able to withstand a 
more extreme and diverse set of environmental challenges, including worsening of pests and disease occurrence. 
In the livestock sub-sector, these weather trends may put additional strains on cattle, adding to the vulnerability 
of livestock facilities.    

Tourism Sector 

7. Tourism is also a critical driver of the Jamaican economy.  The tourism sector accounted for 9.3 percent 
of the national GDP in 20163.  This sector is considered mature, with international arrivals still growing more 
rapidly than elsewhere in the region. Jamaica’s tourism strategy4 sets a target of 5 percent annual growth for the 
sector for the years 2017 to 2022, as well as 5 million visitors with US$3.5 billion in total earnings annually from 
visitor spending. The goal is also to reduce significantly the amount of leakage that results from the large amount 
of imports used in the sector. Jamaica retains about 30 percent of every dollar spent by tourists, while the target 
set by The Ministry of Tourism (MOT) is 50 percent. As such, Tourism has the potential to be strongly linked to 
agriculture and small-scale production: Sandals Resorts in Jamaica reports that 90 percent of produce purchased 
in Jamaica annually are locally produced by a network of around 180 farmers5.   

        

8. Jamaica’s tourism market has traditionally focused on the “sun, sea and sand” concept model but more 
diversification is being pursued. Attempts are being made by the GOJ and the private sector to provide a more 
diversified visitor experience through new product offerings targeted to wider groups of visitors.  The MOT 
intends to move towards a more inclusive tourism model to spread the benefits of tourism, provide more 
entrepreneurship opportunities, and deepen economic linkages in rural areas. This policy is laid out in the 
National Community Tourism Policy and Strategy, which was funded under the previous REDI project. Many 
challenges to the further development of community tourism in rural areas remains They include: (a) excessive 
licensing and standards that are too complex for small NGOs and Community Tourism Enterprises (CTEs) to 
manage; (b) low levels of available capacity and resources for expanding community tourism operations; and 
(c) poor marketing support and inadequate connections to the tourism supply chain, operators, and hotels.  

9. Climate resilience is also important for the tourism sector. More severe storms and hurricanes, rising sea 
levels, droughts, and heatwaves can degrade tourism assets such as coral reefs, shorelines, freshwater supply, 
and ecosystems, and can damage tourism infrastructure and destination communities with potentially 
significant losses to GDP and employment.  Changing weather conditions and milder winters in various parts of 
the world may also affect tourist demand, underscoring the need for sun, sea, and sand destinations to diversify 
their offerings.  

C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  
 
Development Objective(s) (From PAD)  
To enhance access to markets and to climate resilient approaches for targeted beneficiaries. 
 

Key Results 
10. The results of the proposed Project will be measured through the following set of outcome indicators: 

• Percentage of participating rural enterprises that have accessed new markets;  

• Percentage of participating rural enterprises operating on or above the projections (gross sales value) 
of their corresponding business plan; and 

• Number of targeted beneficiaries reached with climate resilient approaches supported by the project 
(of which number of rural enterprises and public institutions). 

 
D. Project Description  

 
11. Enhancement to the REDI I approaches. Building on the experience and results of REDI, the new Project 
will focus on strengthening value chains6  and tourism clusters development, placing emphasis on the linkages 
between producers/service providers and buyers, to improve economies of scale for small agricultural and 
tourism enterprises and to mainstream climate resilience.  

A. Project Components 

12. Component 1. Climate Resilient Agricultural and Community Tourism Investments Subprojects for Rural 
Enterprises (Total US$ 28.0 million, IBRD US$26.0 million).  The objective of this component is to promote the 
development of agricultural/community tourism enterprises that are better integrated in productive 

         
 liances" and operate more competitively in selected value chains, with more reliable linkages 
with buyers and markets and increased capacity to manage climate risks.  

13. This component will finance consulting and non-consulting services, good, works and operating costs 
(through matching grants) for demand-driven and competitively selected agriculture/fisheries or community 
tourism subprojects presented and implemented by participating rural enterprises to increase their production 
and to capture and/or increase their market share and level of profits.  Financed activities will support the 
promotion, identification, design, feasibility, and implementation of competitive and climate resilient 
investment subprojects for business ventures established by beneficiary enterprises (small farmer/fisher 
associations – cooperatives, friendly or benevolent societies, or any formal form of legally established 
associations – as well as, agribusinesses, community tourism operators, and related entrepreneurs such as craft 
makers).  

14. Investments proposals will be prepared in response to calls for proposal and submitted by the beneficiary 
rural enterprises. They will be appraised and competitively selected for project support and funding considering 
pre-established criteria assessing, inter-alia: market demand, product quality, technical and financial feasibility, 
environmental and social sustainability; approaches to enhance climate resiliency and the potential for local 
impact; and the level of participation by women and youth.  It is estimated that a total of 90 investment 
subprojects will be supported through this component, benefitting directly around 200 rural enterprises. As 
such, around 20,000 individual members of these rural enterprises will benefit directly from these investments 
(of which 40 percent will be females and 30 percent youth).  

15. Component 2.  Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building for Relevant Public Entities (IBRD 
US$8.0 million).  This component aims to strengthen the capacity of relevant public-sector institutions (MICAF, 
MOT, and JSIF) and associated entities (RADA, TPDCo, and others) to provide public infrastructure and quality 
services needed to promote inclusive rural development (based on the agriculture and tourism nexus) and to 
ensure the sustainability of the rural enterprises and productive partnerships supported by the project. It is 
organized in the following two subcomponents: (i) 2.1 –Public Infrastructure Investments (IBRD US$ 6,0 million) 
will finance civil works, goods, and consulting services for priority public infrastructure investments (new or 
rehabilitated) that are needed for improving the efficiency and climate resilience of targeted agri-food and 
tourism value chains; and (ii) 2.2: Technical Assistance and Capacity Building (IBRD US$2.0 million. will finance 
technical assistance (consultant and non-consultant services, goods, training, workshops, and study tours) to 
strengthen the capacity of relevant national organizations and other relevant partner entities responsible for 
assisting the agricultural and community tourism enterprises.  

16. Component 3. Project Management (IBRD US$6.0 million).  This component will finance incremental 
costs associated with the management, supervision, and monitoring and evaluation of project implementation 
by JSIF and its technical Project Management Team (PMT) for REDI II. Cost to be financed include technical 
expertise (agriculture, tourism, business development, monitoring and evaluation, etc.), staff training, annual 
audits, vehicles, office equipment, and other operating costs. This component will also ensure that effective 
safeguards, fiduciary, and M&E arrangements are in place during implementation.   

17. Component 4.  Contingent Emergency Response (US$ 0).  This component will allow for a reallocation of 
loan proceeds from other components to provide emergency recovery and reconstruction support following an 
eligible crisis or emergency at the national or sub-national level. Considering the Project design, the CERC is 
expected to be operationalized through a reallocation from component 1 to provide emergency recovery and 
reconstruction support.  To ensure that there is capacity, the Project Operations Manual includes a CERC annex 
applicable to eligible disasters, detailing fiduciary, safeguards, monitoring and reporting, and any other 

necessary implementation arrangements. 

E. Implementation 
 

Institutional and Implementation Arrangements 

18. Implementing Agency for REDI II.  Building on the REDI I experience, the Jamaica Social Investment Fund 
(JSIF) will be the lead implementing agency for REDI II and will work in close coordination and under the technical 
leadership of the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, Agriculture and Fisheries (MICAF), ,the Ministry of Tourism 
(MOT), and their respective operational agencies RADA and TPDCo. JSIF will have overall responsibility for the 
coordination and management of project implementation. JSIF will establish a Project Management Team (PMT) 
that will be responsible for overall technical implementation and will coordinate with all relevant national 
institutions on component implementation. The implementation period is expected to be six years. 

19. Project Oversight: Inter-Ministerial Project Steering Committee. This committee will be responsible for 
ensuring that the Project is in line with national development priorities.  The Committee will be chaired by the 
Planning Institute of Jamaica (PIOJ) with membership to include representatives from MICAF and MOT and other 
relevant agencies i.e. Office of the Prime Minister, Rural Agricultural Development Authority (RADA), Tourism 
Product Development Company (TPDCo), JSIF, and Ministry of Finance and Public Service (MOF&PS). 

20. Beneficiary Rural Enterprises in the agriculture and community tourism sectors will be eligible for 
subproject financing and responsible for the operating, maintenance, and sustainability of the corresponding 
investments. 

 .    
F. Project location and Salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 
 

The project will take place nationally in Jamaica and specifically in rural agricultural and tourism landscapes. 
Specific location details are unknown at this time because the sub-projects will be demand driven. 

 
 
 
 

SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY 

 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 
The project is rated as a Category B in terms of its 
risk profile.  
 



 

The World Bank  
Jamaica Rural Economic Development Initiative-Second Phase (P166279)

Component 1 will finance rural agricultural and 
tourism subprojects that support revenue 
generating activities including support to rural 
producers (inputs, equipment, seeds, water access, 
drip irrigation, greenhouses etc.) as well as support 
to tourism operators and enterprises (marketing, 
small renovations such as painting and refurbishing 
guest housing, equipment for craft making, etc.). 
Component 2 finances small scale public 
investments aimed at improving the efficiency of 
priority value chains for selected products (e.g., 
storage facilities, cold chain supply infrastructure 
equipment at the regional level as well as at 
airports/ports, fresh products grading, clearing hubs, 
agricultural research and development, 
seeds/seedling production and certification 
activities}.    Most of the impacts related to the 
implementation of Component 1 and 2 are minor, 
short-term and highly localized and thus easily 
mitigated. No cumulative impacts are expected. Any 
impacts are therefore easily mitigated through 
standard mitigation measures. .    
 
Subcomponent  2.2:  Technical Assistance and 
Capacity Building will finance TA and capacity 
building for key organizations and agencies that 
deliver support services in agriculture and rural 
tourism at the local level. While the TA activities 
themselves do not have direct adverse 
environmental or social impacts, the Bank team will 
integrate environmental and social principles and 
objectives as an integral part of the terms of 
reference and supervision of the TA.   
 
JSIF has prepared an Environmental and Social 
Management Framework (ESMF) that outlines 
potential risks and guidelines to mitigate potential 
impacts, outlines roles and responsibilities of key 
actors, provides budget and costs for mitigation and 
training (where needed) and gives guidance to 
contractors and PIU environmental specialists in 
terms of managing contracts with firms.  The ESMF 
also serves as the guiding document for any site-
specific Environmental and Social Management 
Plans (ESMPs).  This document has been reviewed 
and cleared by the bank and was recently disclosed 



to stakeholders in Jamaica and on the Bank's 
website. A separate integrated pest management 
plan was prepared and also disclosed similarly under 
the project. Institutional arrangements outlined 
within the document will guide the use of pesticides 
according to OP 4:09.  During implementation, each 
subproject will be screened to determine its risk 
profile and, accordingly, it will be determined 
whether further documents (ESMPs) will need to be 
developed to manage these risks.  Any activity that is 
rated Category A will be screened out.  
The ESMF points to additional guidance, as 
applicable, in the General EHS Guidelines and the 
Industry Sector Guidelines specifically guidelines for 
AGRIBUSINESS/FOOD PRODUCTION and FORESTRY 
http://www.ifc.org/ehsguidelines.  

Performance Standards for Private Sector 
Activities OP/BP 4.03 

No This is not a private sector activity. 

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 Yes 

Given the scale of the activities, it is unlikely that 
natural habitats will be impacted.  However, the 
locations are unknown and are in the rural areas of 
Jamaica, which has significant natural resources. For 
this reason, the OP is triggered as a precaution.  
However, every effort will be made to avoid working 
in or impacting critical natural habitats. The ESMF  
includes measures to avoid/mitigate the alteration 
of critical or sensitive areas. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 Yes 

The project activities are highly localized and are 
unlikely to impact forests but the project will 
operate in a rural landscape and therefore it is 
possible that some activities may impact tree 
clusters. For this reason, OP 4.36 is triggered as a 
precaution.  All subprojects will  be screened and 
any impacts on forests, or tree clusters, quantified.  
Alternatives will be considered as a means to avoid 
negative impacts on any forests or significant tree 
clusters. The ESMF includes specific screening tools 
to identify any potential negative impacts on forests 
or tree clusters. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

Given that support is provided to producer 
organizers, pesticides may be supported.  However, 
World Bank guidance regarding the use of pesticides 
and  IPM will be observed, and a pesticide 
management plan has been prepared. 



 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 No 

This OP is not triggered because the project will not 
operate in culturally sensitive areas.  However, 
during implementation, small rehabilitation works 
and minor mitigation works may result in the chance 
find of culturally significant objects. The ESMF 
includes procedures to address chance findings of 
archeological and cultural resources during 
construction works. 
  

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 No 
The policy is not triggered because there are no 
groups in Jamaica who meet the definition of IPs 
under OP 4.10. 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

The policy will be triggered for activities under 
Component 2. The activities under Component 1 are 
small in scale and scope and therefore unlikely to 
have long-term or cumulative impacts. The JSIF 
evaluation found no sub-project activity financed 
under the REDI I that required physical involuntary 
resettlement. The CDD-type of activities/sub-
projects proposed under Component 1 will exclude 
Involuntary Resettlement as a result of land take 
and/or the physical relocation of households as the 
costs and complexity could easily outweigh the 
benefits and costs of the sub-projects project.  
Under Component 1 a negative list will be developed 
in the ESMF including clear criteria for excluding 
Category A high-risk activities. 
 
While OP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement was not 
triggered for REDI I there may be investments under 
REDI II Component 2: Support to Critical Public 
Infrastructure that could result in involuntary 
resettlement through land acquisition. Component 2 
finances medium scale public investments aimed at 
improving the efficiency of priority value chains for 
selected products. There is scope within the project 
to also finance other public investments that are 
outside the scope of agriculture or tourism yet are 
needed to improve competitiveness and enhance 
access to markets in the two sectors.  Specific 
location details are unknown at this time and sub-
projects will be demand driven. As a result, a 
Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) has been 
prepared to guide the selection and compensation 
aspects under Component 2 which will be disclosed 




prior to appraisal. The project has also prepared 
guidelines for Voluntary Land Donation.  Upon 
identification of cases of involuntary resettlement, 
resettlement action plans (RAPs) will be prepared, 
consulted on, and disclosed in accordance with the 
policy. 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 No 

This policy will not be triggered because the project 
will not support the construction or rehabilitation of 
dams nor will it support other investments which 
rely on the services of existing dams. 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

No 
This policy will not be triggered because the project 
will not affect international waterways as defined 
under the policy. 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No 
This policy will not be triggered because the 
proposed project will not intervene in disputed areas 
as defined under the policy. 

 
 

KEY SAFEGUARD POLICY ISSUES AND THEIR MANAGEMENT 

 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential 
large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
The possible activities to be financed are small in scale and scope and therefore unlikely to have long-term or 
cumulative impacts. Any impacts would be short-term, highly localized, and therefore easily mitigated through 
standard mitigation measures.  The ESMF prepared by the Government has been reviewed by the Bank and has been 
found satisfactory.  That document outlines the procedure for minimizing risks within the project.  For Component 1 
which has many subprojects (e.g. greenhouses, water harvesting, expansion of efficient irrigation methods, integrated 
pest management, introduction of new crop varieties, development of integrated landscape models, improvement in 
stock breeding, and small group marketing infrastructure) the ESMF outlines a screening mechanism to categorize 
each subproject according to its risk profile.  ESMPs will also be developed for certain higher risk subprojects (cleared 
by the Bank and disclosed publicly) prior to implementation of the subcomponent.  For Component 2 which supports 
critical public infrastructure negative impacts will include construction related impacts such as   noise, occupational 
health and safety risks, waste management issues and so on.  In terms of safeguard however, these impacts are all 
small scale and reversible.  None of the project's activities in Component 1 are likely to result in large scale, significant 
or irreversible  impacts. 
 
There may be investments under REDI II Component 2: Support to Critical Public Infrastructure that could result in 
involuntary resettlement through land acquisition. Component 2 finances medium scale public investments aimed at 
improving the efficiency of priority value chains for selected products. These could include building storage facilities, 
processing areas, cold chain supply infrastructure equipment at the regional level as well as at airports/ports, fresh 
products grading, clearing hubs, agricultural research and development, seeds/seedling production and certification 
activities. There is scope within the project to also finance other public investments that are outside the scope of 
agriculture or tourism yet are needed to improve competitiveness and enhance access to markets in the two sectors.  


Specific location details are unknown at this time and sub-projects will be demand driven. As a result, a Resettlement 
Policy Framework (RPF) has been prepared to guide the selection and compensation aspects under Component 2 and 
has been consulted upon and disclosed. Upon identification of cases of involuntary resettlement, resettlement action 
plans (RAPs) will be prepared, consulted on, and disclosed in accordance with the policy. 
 
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area: 
Most of the impacts related to the implementation of the project are anticipated to be minor, short-term and highly 
localized and thus easily mitigated through standard mitigation measures.    
 
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts. 
The project has already been able to examine alternatives through lessons learnt from REDI which was the previous 
project that supported similar activities.  The successful aspects of the first project have become a core aspect of the 
current project. Safeguard implementation under the first project was deemed very successful due, in part, to a 
trained PIU- the same PIU that will manage this current project. 
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower 
capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
Borrower capacity is relatively high.  The JSIF will establish a Project Management Team (PMT) that will be responsible 
for overall implementation and will coordinate all the actors involved in the Project’s execution. The JSIF will be 
responsible for financial management, procurement and compliance with safeguards. The JSIF managed the recently 
closed project (Jamaica REDI (P10522)) and the ICR noted that its management of safeguards was highly satisfactory.  
In terms of social implementation, some activities may be undertaken on land that has been donated voluntarily from 
the state (through a lease and nominal peppercorn rent) or though private individual (s). Voluntary Land Donation 
(VLD) will be applied according to good global practice and in line with the World  Bank guidelines on VLD including 
that VLD applies directly to project beneficiaries and that impacts are minor.  The protocols and guidelines to be 
applied to the Voluntary Land Donation (VLD) are included in the RPF. The project has also prepared a Worker's Code 
of Conduct for all workers and contractors working on the project and a Grievance Redress Mechanism.  
 
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, 
with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
The ESMF has been completed, reviewed by the Bank and disclosed in Jamaica (November 12th, 2018) and on the 
Bank's website (November 15th, 2018).  Consultations were held with the relevant Government officials and Ministries 
and a with a subset of the project's estimated 50,000 beneficiaries.  Disclosures in Jamaica have occurred on relevant 
websites including JSIFs and further disclosures will occur through discussions during the launch meetings and follow 
up meetings with project beneficiaries. The Ministry of Tourism (MOT) and TPDCo will be a lead partner with JSIF.  
The RPF has been completed, consulted upon and disclosed in country on November 12, 2018 and on the Bank's 
website on November 20, 2018.

B. Introduction and Context 

 

Country Context 

1. Chad is a vast and landlocked country in Central Africa characterized by land degradation and 
erratic climatic conditions. It has a total land area of 1,284,000 km2 that encompasses three agro-
ecological zones: Saharan, Sahelian, and Sudanian. Out of a total population of over 14 million people, 47 
percent live below the poverty line. Chad ranked 186 out of 188 on the 2016 Human Development Index 
(HDI, 2016), making it one of the poorest and most deprived countries in the world. Chad remains largely 
rural, with over three-quarters of its population living in rural areas where they depend on subsistence 
farming for both household food and income security. The country is also beset with high unemployment, 
particularly among the youth. 

2. The economy continues to underperform, due to impacts from two main exogenous shocks: 
low oil prices and elevated regional insecurity. The oil and agricultural sectors were Chad's main growth 
drivers until the fall of the world oil price in 2014. Since then, Chad has experienced a sharp economic 
slow-down, with a fall in government revenue, resulting in a significant reduction in public expenses 
negatively impacting GDP growth (from 6.3% in 2014 to 0.2% in 2017)1,  leading the economy into deeper 
recession.  This difficult economic situation has been exacerbated by the prevailing serious threat to 
security in the region (including civil conflict and low-level insurgencies in the neighboring countries of 
Sudan, Nigeria, CAR and Libya), which has caused economic disruption in Chad and forced the Government 
to reprioritize its spending to defense, hosting of refugees and internally displaced persons. It also had an 
impact on cross-border trade, leading to the collapse of internal and external trade, especially for 
livestock, and a major disruption of the trade routes of imported products, especially in the Sahel.  

3. The short and medium-term outlooks remain challenging, with projected GDP growth for 2019 
of 3.15 percent. The situation has led the Government of Chad to prioritize diversification of the economy, 
focusing more on the non-oil sectors. The most important of these is the agricultural sector, which 
employs 80% of the Chadian workforce and accounts for 52% of GDP. It is also the second largest source 
of export income, after oil. In its 2016 – 2020 national development plan, the Government has, among 
other actions, prioritized the industrialization of agriculture, with the aim of boosting exports in order to 
diversify the economy to reduce its dependence on oil exports and increase tax revenue. 

4. The country is also experiencing rapid population growth (6.3% annually from 2010 to 20152), 
with a large youth cohort – more than 65% of the population is under the age of 25. The majority of the 
population remains rural, deriving their incomes from subsistence farming and herding activities, relying 
on traditional extensive production techniques, with limited access to markets and services (Systematic 
Country Diagnosis - SCD, 2015). Women engaged in agriculture and/or living in rural areas face 
considerable barriers: Chad ranks 140 out of 144 on the Global Gender Gap Index. Adult female literacy 
rate is 13.9% per UNESCO, about half that of men, and women are often confined to producing 

       

subsistence crops and traditional farming, with little access to advisory services and inputs (mainly 
captured by men). As a result, they are financially more vulnerable.  

5. Food insecurity is a big concern that is likely to be exacerbated by climate change. It is estimated 
that one out of 10 Chadians, or 1.4 million people, are chronically food-insecure, meaning they are unable 
to meet their basic food requirements even during “good” years of crop harvest. The situation worsens 
during “bad” years – characterized by limited availability of and constrained access to food – where 
millions more can easily and quickly fall into transitory food insecurity. Difficulties in access to food are 
partly attributed to the poor performance of the important crops and livestock sub-sectors, which are 
characterized by sluggish productivity growth due to multiple factors. Such factors include lack of and 
limited access to promising technologies, underinvestment in new technologies, as well as climate-related 
constraints. Crop and livestock production are highly dependent on rainfall, making these sub-sectors 
extremely vulnerable to climate shocks (in particular the scarcity and poor distribution of rainfall over 
time and space). This situation is aggravated by the country’s vulnerability to climatic risks, both short-
term risks associated with its inherent climatic variability and long-terms risks associated with climate 
change. The National Action Program of Adaptation (NAPA, 2010) reported that the main short-term 
climate risks are associated with droughts, floods, poor spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall, 
extreme heat, and strong winds. 

 

Sectoral and Institutional Context 

6. Chad has enormous unrealized agricultural potential. The country has a total agricultural area of 
more than 49 million hectares, of which only 6 percent is currently cultivated. Similarly, the available 
water resources remain largely untapped, with only 9 percent of this potential being used. Less than 1 
percent of the agricultural land is under irrigation in Chad. The main Agro-Ecological Zones (AEZ) in Chad, 
from North to South, are the Saharian (up to 200 mm average annual rainfall), the Sahelian (200-700 mm) 
and the Sudanian (over 750 mm) AEZ. These distinct AEZs provide a unique opportunity to diversify 
agricultural production and to develop dynamic and complementary crop and livestock value chains. 
While other projects are already targeting livestock systems in the Sahelian AEZ, the proposed project will 
focus on the higher potential Sudanian AEZ where smallholder farmers are engaged mainly in traditional 
rainfed cereal-based (sorghum, millet and berbéré and associated pulses) farming systems, but including 
also some small livestock production. This zone is also a transit zone for livestock herds as they move 
southwards from the Sahelian AEZ during the dry season, causing some farmer-livestock herder conflicts. 

7. Despite its vast potential, the agriculture sector continues to underperform. Yields of key cereals 
are far below the averages for sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), and yield gains have not kept pace with the yield 
gains achieved in other countries. For example, sorghum yields average stand between 720 and 785 
kg/ha3 respectively for Sahelian and Sudanian zones of Chad, against an average of 980 kg/ha in the 
ECOWAS4 region.  

8. Average rainfall ranges between 800 to 1250 mm in the Sudanian Agro-Ecological Zone (AEZ), but 
the distribution increases in variability, in both inter-annual quantities and geographic distribution, when 
moving from the south towards the north. The main crops are cereals (sorghum, berbéré, maize and rice), 

mostly intercropped with legumes, and roots and tubers, mainly grown for household consumption. 
Farmers also cultivate cotton for cash. Unfortunately, production of cotton is in sharp decline due to weak 
value chain organization. The Sudanian AEZ area is also classified as a cattle husbandry (and 
transhumance) area. Finally, collection of wild fruits and plants remains common, especially collection of 
shea nuts. 

9. The 2017 Agriculture Sector Review Report (ASRR) described how Chadian agriculture is going 
through a deep crisis. The sector is struggling to modernize and remains largely dependent on weather 
conditions. However, the report emphasized the potential for development of family farming in terms of 
productivity, profitability and resilience to shocks and its potential to meet the national and external food 
demand and improve the welfare of the rural populations.  

10. Several related factors explain the low productivity of Chadian agriculture: 

▪ Weak research and extension services as well as low overall institutional capacity constrain 
innovation and slow the rate of technical change. The agriculture research and development 
(AR&D) system is weak, with limited human and infrastructure resources and lack of continued 
programmatic support. In addition, the limited reach of public and private agricultural extension 
and advisory services significantly affects the dissemination and adoption of promising 
technologies.  

▪ The use of low yielding agricultural technologies and poor and unsustainable traditional 
agricultural practices are the main characteristics of Chadian subsistence farming. Farmers lack 
access to improved agricultural technologies, as well as to the know-how needed to improve 
productivity. For example, less than 5% of farmers are currently using improved seeds (Agriculture 
Sector Review, May 2017).  

▪ The growing population is increasing pressure on existing fertile production resources and hence 
rendering the practice of extensive subsistence agriculture and traditional livestock management 
systems more challenging over time. Increased competition for the shrinking natural capital often 
results in tensions between diverse user communities with at times conflicting interests. As a 
result, the increasing pressure on natural resources, particularly in marginal areas and their fragile 
eco-systems, are leading to lower soil fertility levels, soil erosion and degradation. 

▪ Climate shocks are exacting an increasing toll on Chadian agriculture. The Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) categorizes Chad as one of the countries highly vulnerable to the 
impacts of climate change. Vulnerability in Chad is characterized by increasing scarcity of available 
natural resources, fragile and substantially degraded soils, high level of food security and poverty, 
and lack of infrastructure, which hinder the capacity of local population to adapt to severe 
weather conditions. Indeed, the Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) of the 
Republic of Chad (September 2015) indicates that over the past decades, the Saharan and 
Sahelian climatic zones of Chad have progressed southwards by 150 km.  

▪ Weak or lack of policies also lead to cumbersome administrative and organizational procedures in 
Chad. The Agriculture Sector Review Report (ASRR) highlighted the persistent lack of concrete 
measures to address effectively the major factors that impact food and nutritional security. In 
practice, efforts to address those factors are very limited, and often questioned. As an illustration, 
the ASRR proposed a process for  setting up a pastoral code, which has not moved forward even 
though there has been a resurgence of conflicts related to the access and control of natural 


resources by different users. This situation of land insecurity is still limiting private investment 
and the sector’s performance. 

11. To address these constraints, the 2017 Agriculture Sector Review Report has identified improving 
productivity and strengthening resilience of family farming as effective and appropriate means of reducing 
poverty in rural areas. 

12. The Project will coordinate closely with other IDA-financed projects and projects being 
implemented by other partners to ensure effective synergies on the ground. For example, the Project will 
rely on the Chad Hydrological and Meteorological Services Modernization Project (P164256) to strengthen 
the capacity of the National Meteorology Agency (ANAM) to provide effective agro-meteorological 
services in support of the Project’s activities, including training and acquisition of digital solutions for data 
collection and analysis and weather forecasting (e.g. remote sensing application and GIS products). The 
Project will also complement interventions in pastoralism management being supported under the 
Regional Sahel Pastoralism Support Project (PRAPS – P147674). The Project will support mixed crops and 
livestock systems in agro-pastoral zones, while PRAPS will target purely pastoral zones. The Project will 
establish strategical and operational linkages with the Rural Mobility and Connectivity Project (P164747) 
which will be implemented in two out of the three targeted regions. This Project will to improve road 
access to selected agricultural production basin and markets in the Project area. Technologies to be 
introduced by the Project would also be used in the irrigation schemes developed by the Chad’s 
Component of the Sahel Irrigation Initiative Project (P154482). The is aligned with the Sahel Alliance 
Initiative which objective is to improve the support and coordination of development partners in the 
region to contribute effectively and more broadly to the stabilization and eradication of poverty, by 
developing rural areas, creating employment for youth, improving energy infrastructure and 
strengthening governance.  

 
C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  

 

13. The proposed Project Development Objective (PDO) is “to promote the adoption of improved 
technologies leading to increase productivity and enhance the climate resilience of agricultural 
production systems in the areas targeted by the Project.”  

 
Key Results 

 

14. The PDO-Level Results Indicators are:  

i. Number of direct Project beneficiaries – or farmers/producers/processors reached with 
agricultural assets or services (of which 40% female and 50% youth); 

ii. Total land area under improved technologies (in hectares) disseminated by the Project 
(including % in CSA technology - proxy for climate resilience technologies/practices); 

iii. Increase in average yields of the direct beneficiaries compared to average yields in the 
Project area (% of baselines for targeted crops in the project area); and 

iv. Share of targeted beneficiaries with rating ‘Satisfied’ or above on Project interventions 

 

D. Project Description  
 
The total project amount is the equivalent of USD 44.6 million (IDA grant of USD 41 million and beneficiaries contribution 
of USD 3.6 million) over a period of 5 years. The project consists of four components, namely: (A) Institutional support 
for sustainable agriculture development and climate resilience; (B) Supporting adoption of demand driven technologies 
and climate-smart agriculture; (C) Contingency emergency response; and (D) Coordination, knowledge management and 
monitoring, evaluation, and learning (MEL). 
 
COMPONENT A: INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT FOR SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE DEVELOPMENT AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE: 
This component is designed to strengthen institutional capacities for Agricultural Research & Development (AR&D) and 
climate change adaptation at national level. It includes the following sub-components : (A1) Strengthening the agricultural 
research and development (AR&D) system;  (A2) Strengthening of national support services for sustainable agricultural 
development and climate resilience and  (A.3) : Strengthening the framework for sectoral strategies and reforms 
preparation and monitoring    
 
COMPONENT B: SUPPORTING ADOPTION OF DEMAND DRIVEN TECHNOLOGIES AND CLIMATE-SMART AGRICULTURE: 
This component will support the adoption of high productivity potential and climate resilient technologies /practices. It 
is sub-divided into three sub-components: (B.1) Improving the effectiveness of agricultural support services in the 
targeted areas; (B.2) Accelerating adoption of improved technologies and innovations; and (B.3) Implementing climate-
smart agriculture plans.  
 
COMPONENT C: CONTINGENCY EMERGENCY RESPONSE 
This component will create a mechanism for financing emergency works in case of another disaster event by including a 
“zero-dollar” Contingency Emergency Response Component (CERC). Should this component be activated, it will allow 
rapid disbursement of funds to help reduce damage to infrastructure, ensure business continuity, and enable early 
rehabilitation. Following an adverse event that causes a major disaster, the GoC will be able to request that the Bank to 
channel resources from other components into an Immediate Response Mechanism (IRM). The IRM will enable the use 
of a portion of uncommitted funds from the overall IDA portfolio to respond to emergencies. To mobilize resources from 
the component, it will use the “Immediate Response Mechanism Operational Manual.”  

 

COMPONENT D: COORDINATION, M&E AND KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT 
This component is to support the Project on: (i) coordination and management, including human resources, financial 
management and procurement; (ii) M&E, gender impact evaluation and technical studies, (iii) knowledge management 
and communication; and (iv) safeguards and citizen engagement. The project will pilot the “Iterative Beneficiary 
monitoring” (IBM) System which is a simple low cost, high frequency feedback mechanism elaborated to inform regularly 
on what is not working during the project implementation and help to improve project results gradually and quickly 
without need of lengthy and expensive evaluations. 
 
E. Implementation 

 
Institutional and Implementation Arrangements 

15. The project will be implemented under the supervision of the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation 
and Agricultural Equipment (MAIEA).  It will be supported by a National Steering Committee for all 



 

The World Bank  
Climate Resilient Agriculture and Productivity Enhancement Project (P162956)  

 

 

  
Jan 04, 2018 Page 8 of 18  

 

projects/programmes in the Agricultural sector, chaired by the Ministry’s General Secretary, whose 
composition and mandate will be specified in a MAIEA decree5. 

16. By Ministerial Decree, dated 05 October 2017, all new projects/programmes under the MoA are 
under a unique Project Coordination Department (CCP). The CCP mandate are to ensure: (i) the alignment 
of agricultural projects/programs with national and regional policies and strategies; (ii) the development 
of synergies and collaborative frameworks between agricultural projects/programs funded  by different 
donors; (iv) monitoring the progress of projects / programs by updating the MoA’s indicators dashboard; 
(vi) knowledge management and communication on the projects and programs achievements ; (viii) the 
organization of capacity building activities and exchange between the different projects/programs; (xi) 
the recruitment of the (external) financial auditor in accordance with the provisions of the Financing 
Agreement and monitoring of the implementation of the recommendations; and (x) support for the 
release of counterpart funds for sector projects/programs.  

17. The day to day project management and coordination will be under the responsibility of a 
Technical and Fiduciary Coordination Unit (UCTF).  As agreed with MAIEA, the UCTF will be the 
implementation unit for all new World Bank funded operations in the agriculture sector. Reporting to the 
CCP, the UTCF main functions of this unit are to: (i) coordinate all projects of the agricultural portfolio of 
the Bank and their relations with the technical departments of the Ministry; (ii) the preparation and 
signing of the various memoranda of understanding, agreements and contracts linking the project (s) to 
the various partners and service providers; (iii) Financial Management (FM) and procurement activities in 
accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement between IDA and the Government and the 
procurement and FM guidelines;  (v) Terms of reference preparation, recruitment and management of 
support staff and technical units of Bank / IDA (UTPs) agricultural projects; (vi) preparation of annual work 
plans , budgets and progress reports and presentation of these documents to the PSC in relation with the 
CCP; (vii) daily liaison with all national partners, including communication on agricultural projects / 
programs funded by the World Bank; and (viii) the organization of supervision missions, mid-term and 
final evaluations of WB agricultural program projects. 

18. The UCTF will be headed by a National Programme Coordinator. It will include the following staff: 
an Internal Auditor, an Administrative and Financial Officer, an Accountant, one Procurement Officer, an 
Environmental Specialist, Gender and Social Development Specialist, a Monitoring and Evaluation and 
knowledge management Officer, and support staff. 

19. At field level, a Regional Technical Support Unit (RTSU) will be set up in Sarh for the field activities 
coordination and follow up. The TSU will be reporting to the UTCF.  The TSU will be a light structure that 
will work closely with the regional rural development delegations. The TSU mandates are to: (i) ensure 
and support the project activities implementation within its coverage area; (ii) providing technical and 
management support to project beneficiaries; and (iii) ensuring the compliance of the various subprojects 
to the operational rules and procedures. 

 
 .    
 

F. Project location and Salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 
 

The proposed Project will primarily target the Sudanian Agro-Ecological Zone of Chad, considered as high 
potential for agro-pastoral activities, but where the risk of food and nutritional security and rural poverty 
are of serious concern. The project's activities will be implemented in three (03) administrative regions, 
namely Salamat, Middle Chari and Mandoul located in the south-eastern pole of Chad. The project areas are 
home to about 1.55 million people, representing over 11% of the total population. Targeted regions are 
further characterized by high poverty rates of 70.9% in Mandoul, 61.4% in Middle Chari, and 48.4% in 
Salamat. In these communities, the average rate of fertility is estimated at about 6.5. In terms of natural and 
human resources, the targeted areas have significant agricultural potential, representing the Sudanese AEZ 
with annual average rainfall ranging between 800 to 1250 mm. However, the rainfall is highly variable in 
both inter-annual quantitates and in geographic distribution when moving from the south towards the 
north. Wooded Sudanian savanna constitutes the main vegetation in these areas, while relatively poor 
leached tropical ferruginous soils (on hills) and richer floodplains soils favorable to the culture of rice and all-
season vegetable production dominate the main soil types. 

 
SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY 

 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

The Project is classified as category B project.   
As part of the project’s aim of improving agricultural 
productivity, the project will support the use of 
improved agricultural inputs including fertilizers, 
improved seeds, irrigation agriculture and pesticides 
that will require environmental assessment to 
ensure potential adverse effects are mitigated.  The 
project is expected to be beneficial to the 
environment given the aim is to ensure the impact 
of climate change is mitigated, adaptation measures 
implemented and resilience is built in to the 
production landscape.  The project will ensure that 



 
modern efficient utilization of pesticide and fertilizer 
will be introduced and farmers trained in their 
applications that will have a positive impact on the 
environment compared to the status quo. Further, a 
strict control mechanism will be put in place to avoid 
potential adverse impacts such as pollution from 
agricultural runoffs. An Environmental and Social 
Management Framework (ESMF) will be prepared by 
the borrower given that the exact detailed footprint 
types and locations of project activities and their 
respective sites have not yet been identified. The 
ESMF will be consulted upon and publicly disclosed, 
both in-country and at the InfoShop before 
appraisal.  In addition, for subprojects that are 
expected to be identified during preparation, an 
ESIA will be prepared by appraisal.   

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 No 
The project is not expected to intervene in any 
critically natural habitats 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No The project will not support forest exploitation . 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

OP 4.09 is triggered based on project’ s activities to 
increase agricultural productivity which is expected 
to result in increased use of agrochemicals, such as 
pesticides. Any use of pesticides will be justified 
under the Integrated Pest Management (IPM) 
approach that will be promoted by the project. An 
Integrated Pest Management Plan (IPMP) will be 
developed, consulted upon by the borrower and 
publicly disclosed thereafter, both in-country and at 
the InfoShop before appraisal. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 Yes 

Due to potential impacts on Physical Cultural 
Resources associated with civil works, the ESMF will 
include provisions of “Chance Finds” approach to 
ensure that these aspects will be taken into account 
in ESIAs/EMPs to be developed under the ESMF. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 No 
There are no Indigenous Peoples People, as per the 
policy definition,  in the project area. 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

This policy is triggered because the project 
investments may support interventions that could 
entail land taking or limiting access to land and other 
resources. Since details of the subproject footprints 
are still unknown at this very juncture, an RPF will be 
developed by the borrower, consulted upon and 
publicly disclosed, both in-country and at the 
InfoShop, before appraisal. Where and when 
warranted Full Resettlement Action Plans (FRAPs) or

KEY SAFEGUARD POLICY ISSUES AND THEIR MANAGEMENT 

 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential 
large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
The environmental and social impacts and risks of the project activities are expected to be moderate to low, mostly 
site-specific and easily manageable to an acceptable level, typical of Category B projects. The potential negative 
environmental and social negative impacts and risks of the proposed project are associated with the implementation 
of Component 1 an 2, which are designed to support various activities for strengthening the agriculture research 
system and productive and resilient technology dissemination. These include: soil erosion due to agricultural 
developments; the spread of waterborne disease vectors and health risks associated with pesticide use, risks of 
increased prevalence of HIV/AIDS and other SCDs due to foreign workers on construction sites, the risk of pollution 
and environmental degradation byfertilizers and pesticides, reduced vegetation and pasture due to agricultural 
developments, etc. At the social level, though the project does not anticipate to physically display people, some of its 
proposed activities may require acquisition of land plots or restriction of access to productive natural resources, and/ 
or loss of incomes and livelihood resources without proper precautionary measures taken on time, could potentially 
lead to the involuntary resettlement of project affected persons (PAP). 
 
The proposed project triggers are OP/BP 4.01 (Environmental Assessment), OP 4.09 (Pest Management),  OP/BP 4.11 
(Physical Cultural Resources); and OP/BP 4.12 (Involuntary Resettlement). In conformity with the World Bank' 
requirements and the Government's Environmental Impact Assessment legislation, an ESMF was prepared, amply 
consulted upon, along with a RPF, and a PMP. These were approved by the Ministry of Environment through a 
national validation workshop, cleared by the Bank and publicly disclosed both in-country and at the World Bank 
website prior to appraisal. 
 
No large-scale or irreversible adverse impacts and risks haves been identified during the participatory ESMF, IPMP and 
RPF analysis conducted. 
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area: 
No adverse long term impact and risk haves been identified during the EA process. Instead, the project is expected to 
deliver significant environmental and social benefits to hundred thousands of Chadians’ beneficiaries whose main 
livelihoods depend largely on agriculture crops and value. The adoption of improved technologies, the sustainable 
management practices of land and water as part of the formulation and implementation of climate-smart agriculture 
plans are expected to increase the productive capital of the land and the net carbon stock; and to increase the 
resilience of agro-sylvo-pastoral systems to climate risks. However, project activities to increase agricultural 



productivity could potentially induce indirect, but manageable impacts associated with increased use of 
agrochemicals, such as pesticides. These issues are addressed in the Pests and Pesticides Management Plan (PMP). 
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts. 
N/A 
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower 
capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The proposed project will be implemented by an new PIU under the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Agriculture 
Equipment. The Ministry has some experience in implementing the Bank’s safeguards policies as it has implemented 
the Agriculture Support Production Project (P126576). The Government of Chad (GoC) has completed the preparation 
of an ESMF, an PMP and a RPF to address issues related to the safeguard policies triggered. 
 
The ESMF outlines an environmental and social screening process for future sub-projects to ensure that they are 
environmentally sound and socially equitable, sustainably implementable, and in line with GoC and World Bank 
operational safeguards policies and guidelines on environmental and social impacts and risks management. The 
implementation cost of the ESMF is estimated at FCFA 502 million, is proposed to be included the overall project 
budget. 
 
A Pests and Pesticide Management Plan (IPMP) has been prepared based on project activities to increase agricultural 
productivity which is expected to result in increased use of agrochemicals, such as pesticides. The PMP action plan aim 
to ensure safe pests and pesticides management. It includes: (i) promoting the use of alternative pest management 
strategies in the project areas; (ii) strengthening of controls during importation of phytosanitary products; (iii) capacity 
building of key actors on the rational use of pesticides; (iv) sensitization of producers on good pesticide management 
practices (transport, storage, applying, safety measures);  (v) environmental monitoring of the physico-chemical 
quality of water resources (groundwater and ponds); (vi) health monitoring of pesticides users and management of 
empty containers; and (v) a coherent budget of FCFA 328.5 million proposed to be included in the overall project 
budget. 
 
The RPF sets forth the basic principles and procedures to be followed once the physical footprints of project activities 
are known in details to properly mitigate any potential adverse social impacts (i.e. preparation of site specific 
resettlement action plan-RAP, etc.). The RPF includes specifics such as valuation of assets, public consultation and 
participation, institutional arrangement, capacity building, monitoring and evaluation, grievance redress mechanism, 
budget and source of financing. CFA 192.5 million are proposed to support resettlement (RAP preparation, 
sensitization and training of key stakeholders), and to be included in the overall project cost. These do not include 
compensation costs which will be borne by the Government 
 
A 2-person team of Social and Environmental Safeguards Specialists (SESS) will be established at the PIU level to 
adequately handle the implementation of social and environmental recommendations. The SESS will work in tandem 
with the WBG safeguards specialists to ensure due compliance with core safeguards policies requirements. 
 
All bidding documents for civil works will have embedded environmental and social clauses (ESC), in order to enable 
contractors to follow up on environmental and social due diligence and to mitigate the anticipated negative risks and 
impacts. Depending of the type, scope/nature and size of construction, a supervising engineer (Bureau de contrôle) 
will be hired by the project to oversee the construction works (including implementation of environmental and social 
measures by the constructor) on behalf of the PIU. For small size construction type, the PIU will rely on the 
 

deconcentrated technical services like Génie Rural, Regional Directorate for Environmental, as well as local level Socio-
environmental Specialist, etc. to ensure due diligence on safeguards as described in the ESC. Regular Environmental 
Assessment and Pollution and Nuisance Control Directorate (DEELCPN) patrols will inspect the construction sites if the 
construction activities are in compliance with the approved site specific safeguards documents.  
 
The Borrower has some experience with the World Bank Safeguards policies’ requirements through several past and 
ongoing Bank funded projects. The proposed project will build on this experience and the 3 standalone safeguards 
instruments (ESMF, IPMP & RPF) include provisions to further strengthen the capacity of the various stakeholders. 
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, 
with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
The key stakeholders identified are:  
• The Steering Committee (SC) : The Steering Committee will monitor the registry and budgeting of the 
environmental and social due diligence from the Work Plan and Annual Budget (WPAB) ; 
• The Project Management Unit (PMU):  The PMU will ensure that environmental and social aspects and issues 
are taken into account in the implementation of project activities. The PMU should benefit from capacity building in 
the implementation of the project;  
• The Environmental Assessment and Pollution and Nuisance Control Directorate (DEELCPN): it will review and 
approve the environmental classification of sub-projects and also approve  the Environmental and Social Impact 
Notices (ESIN). It will also participate in the external monitoring; 
• The research institutions will provide technical manuals of research findings and ecological monitoring of 
some activities. They will also participate in the preparation of manual of good agricultural practices. 
• The National Agency for Rural Development Support (ANADER) will be responsible for extension of good 
agricultural and environmental practices in the area; 
• The Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture Development will take care of the environmental and fish 
production monitoring; 
• Decentralized Technical Services (DTS or « STD » in French) : The STDs are composed by the Regional an 
Departmental Directorates of Ministries in charge of agriculture, of animal resources, of Health, of Environment. These 
regional and departmental directorates of the project's intervention zones will be associated to all activities 
implemented in their range and zones of action during and after the Project;  
• Municipalities :They will participate in environmental and social monitoring through their municipal technical 
services ; 
• The Regional Committees of Actions (CRA), the local Committees of Actions (CLA), the Departmental 
Committees of Actions (CDA), the National Council of Concertation of Rural Producers of Chad (CNCPRT), Asssociations 
of Farmers, Breeders and Fishermen. All these structures will also be involved in the implementation of the ESMF of 
the Project (identification of sub-projects, screening, etc.); 
• Construction companies :  They will be responsible for the implementation of the Site-ESMFs and the drafting 
of implementation reports of these ESMFs through their Environmental Expert ; 
• Owner’s Engineer : The Environmental Expert within their organization will be responsible for the day-to-day 
monitoring of the implementation of the site-ESMF and the drafting of an environmental and social monitoring report 
to submit to the Project Management Unit (PMU); 
• NGOs: In addition to social mobilization, they will participate in the sensitization of populations and the 
monitoring of the implementation of the ESMF interpellation of the principal actors of the Project. 
  
Throughout the entire process of project preparation, transparent and engaging stakeholder participation 
consultations were organized in the project intervention areas. The key concerns raised by the local stakeholders are 

 

related to land degradation issues that affect their livelihood, mainly the reduction of arable lands due to water 
erosion and silting of lowlands, lack of access to finance, and need for capacity building to improve agricultural 
practices. They have been incorporated in the project design (protection of watersheds from erosion and secure 
irrigation potential, Farmers 
Field School program, matching grant facility, etc.). Since stakeholder consultation and participation is an iterative 
process, it will be pursued and sustained throughout the project lifespan. 
As part of the ESMF, the IPMP and the RPF, in addition to the series of intensive local stakeholder meetings (open 
and/or focus groups discussions), a national stakeholders’ workshop was organized by the Client on to share the 
results of the safeguards instruments, mainstream ownership and seek inputs from the stakeholders. The 3 
standalone safeguards instruments, approved by the DEELCPN as result of this national stakeholders’ workshop, have 
been submitted to the Bank for final approval. They have been disclosed both in-country (Feb 23, 2017) and at the 
InfoShop (Feb. 22, 2018) prior to appraisal. The ESMF describes a comprehensive consultation and participation 
mechanism and disclosure during subprojects 
preparation.

B. Introduction and Context 

 
Country Context 

 
Albania has experienced rapid growth since 1990, rising into the ranks of middle-income countries in 2008. 
It emerged from the collapse of isolationist communism in the early 1990s as one of the poorest countries in 
Europe but since then has experienced a growth of nearly 6 percent per year. The rapid pace of growth helped 
the country narrow the per capita income gap with the rest of Europe from 18 percent of average European 
Union (EU) incomes in 1998 to 30 percent by 2012, and this fueled aspirations to join the EU. Growth 
successfully halved poverty from 25.2 percent in 2002 to 12.5 percent in 2008. However, the global and euro 
area crises in 2008 brought Albania's growth to a near standstill by 2012, and the country is struggling to 
recover, particularly given its historic ties to Europe’s poorer performing economies. The aftermath of the 
crisis presented an increase of the poverty rate, to around 14 percent in 2015, particularly in urban and coastal 
areas, along with rising unemployment affecting mostly youth and women. 

Recently, economic activity has picked up and the near-term economic outlook for Albania is positive. 
Economic growth is expected to accelerate to 3.8 percent in 2017 (from 3.4 percent in 2016 and 2.2 in 2015), 
supported by private investment and consumption. Investment is mostly linked to two large foreign direct 
investment-financed energy projects (the Trans Adriatic Pipeline and the Devoll hydropower plant), and 
consumption is supported by job creation and the easing of credit conditions. Net exports were helped by 
tourism and a recovering commodity market. Growth is projected to moderate to an average of 3.6 percent 
for 2018–2019 with completion of the two large energy projects and no other large projects planned.  

The Government remains committed to making deep structural reforms. Over the past years, the 
Government implemented a range of reforms, including improvements in Public Financial Management (PFM) 
(clearance of arrears, tax reforms), mitigation of fiscal risks from pensions and the energy sector, reduction of 
nonperforming loans, and improvements in doing business. Results were positive: growth picked up, the fiscal 
deficit declined, and the public debt started to fall. This provided a window of opportunity for advancing 
ongoing structural and fiscal reforms, to reduce macroeconomic risks and better support long-term growth. 

Albania applied for EU membership in 2009 and became an official candidate for accession in June 2014. 
This entails strong commitments in the transport sector, which manifest themselves in signing, with the 
European Commission, the Memorandum of Understanding for the Core Network creating the South East 
Europe Transport Observatory (SEETO)1 and in signing the Transport Community Treaty in July of this year. 
The treaty will help the Western Balkan countries align their national transport laws with those of the EU. 

 
Sectoral and Institutional Context 

 
Roads and highways are the predominant mode of land transport in Albania and provide essential 
connectivity for freight and personal mobility. Roads are one of the highest value public assets, estimated at 
about US$6 billion. The overall length of Albania’s road network is about 15,000 km; 4,000 km of national 

                                                           
1 The main aim of SEETO is “to promote cooperation on the development of the main and ancillary infrastructure on the South East 
Europe Core Regional Transport Network and to promote and enhance local capacity.” 


roads; and 11,000 km of regional, local, and urban roads.2 The Ministry of Infrastructure and Energy (MoIE), 
formerly the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure, is responsible for the policy and regulatory framework 
and technical standards. The Albania Road Authority (ARA) is responsible for managing the national road 
network and the municipalities are responsible for managing the regional and local roads. The Albania 
Development Fund (ADF) was established in 1993 with support from the World Bank, to implement regional 
and local roads projects mainly financed by international development partners.   

In 2015, Albania implemented significant administrative and territorial reforms consolidating 372 
communes and municipalities into 61 municipalities to increase the cost efficiency of local units so that they 
can provide better services. The new municipalities consolidated the responsibilities from the previous levels 
of local government—municipalities, communes, and regional councils—each of which was administering 
road networks within their jurisdiction, respectively, within city/town boundaries, within commune 
boundaries, and regional roads in regional council areas. Within the current regional and local road network, 
the function comprises (a) regional roads that connect groups of villages to the national road network or with 
main administrative centers of a municipality and (b) local roads that provide transport links between villages 
and farms. 

The infrastructure planning and prioritization process still has some way to go to provide transparent and 
economically efficient outcomes. With support from the World Bank, progress has been made by the 
Government in developing Medium-term Budget Plans (MTBPs) 2015–2017 to prioritize higher impact new 
investments. A framework that is more aligned with the budget realities is slowly emerging and more fiscal 
discipline is applied at all levels to avoid accumulation of arrears in the road sector. Under the proposed 
Regional and Local Roads Connectivity Project (RLRCP), a rigorous prioritization approach has been formulated 
for the selection of project roads which target investments that complement productive sectors of the 
economy and particularly in agriculture and tourism. This process provides an example for investment 
prioritization, transparency, and governance at a local level. 

Maintenance of the road network has been systematically underfunded, undermining the sustainability of 
the sector. The ongoing Results-based Road Maintenance and Safety Project (RRMSP) is addressing highest 
priority maintenance needs of 4,000 km of national roads while the proposed RLRCP will support the asset 
management of regional and local roads under the control of municipalities. 

The regional and local network is in bad condition overall, with more than 50 percent of network 
categorized in poor condition, 30 percent in fair condition, and less than 20 percent in good and very good 
condition. Some sections are impassable for parts of the year, thus restricting access to essential public 
services of health and education, as well as to economic centers. As of 2016, the maintenance expenditures 
for regional and local roads was allocated at approximately 300 Euro per km per year,3 which is extremely 
low and can only cover the routine maintenance, with no allowance for periodic maintenance or 
improvements. Investments and maintenance of regional and local roads are financed by local taxes 
combined with unconditional grant transfer from the central government. The poor condition of roads is a 
manifestation of the weaknesses in the municipalities planning, implementation and/or monitoring 
capacities.    

The Government of Albania (GoA) has taken large strides in improving conditions of the regional and local 
         

road network in the past decade but more work is necessary. ADF implemented a Rural Road Program, during 
the period 2008–2016, with World Bank support which crowded in US$386 million in financing from IFIs. The 
program improved1,200 km of rural roads in 12 regions and 61 municipalities which improved the mobility of 
over 2 million people. The World Bank’s engagement through the Secondary and Local Roads Project (SLRP), 
from 2008 to 2013, was evaluated as highly satisfactory which is an important milestone. The program was 
indeed highly successful, exceeding its developmental and implementation outcomes while recognizing there 
is still room to consolidate the e network improvements in a sustainable manner to enable growth in the 
agricultural and tourism sectors. 

The existing condition of regional and local road network is not able to serve the emerging tourism industry4 
and hinders the development of the agricultural sector.5 Over the past few years, the GoA has developed key 
strategic instruments including the National Territorial Development Strategy and the Coastal Management 
Strategy that provide a vision for the development of Albania over the next 15 years (2015–2030). These 
strategies highlighted a number of challenges which include improved road connectivity and the need to 
invest in municipal capacity to improve tourism destination management. The on-going Integrated Urban and 
Tourism Development Project is addressing these issues in the South of Albania while the proposed RLRCP will 
support improved access to tourism development areas in the project road areas of Albania. 

In October 2014, the GoA approved the five-year Strategy for Rural and Agriculture Development, drawing 
upon the strategic planning approach used by the EU under its Common Agriculture Policy 2014–2020. One 
of the obstacles pointed out by the strategy is lack of market access for agricultural products through an 
appropriate network of national, regional, and local roads. Considering that in Albania the agri-food industry 
is responsible (directly and indirectly) for almost half the economy-wide jobs, improving market access 
through better road connectivity is critical for the development of the country. It is also important for 
productive inclusion of women, who represent half of those employed in the sector (the highest share of 
participation of women in agriculture in the Western Balkans) and 80 percent of informal employment in the 
sector.  

Road safety remains a major social and public health issue in Albania. Although the number of accidents has 
dropped in recent years, Albania still compares unfavorably with countries in the region or EU member states, 
with the World Health Organization estimated 15.1 fatalities per 100,000 population—while it is 11.9 in 
Montenegro, 9.1 in Greece, 7.7 in Serbia, 4.3 in Germany, 5.1 in France, and 2.9 in the United Kingdom.6 In 
response, the GoA aims to reduce the number of fatalities by 50 percent in 2020, in comparison to 2009.7 The 
GoA has increased its attention to road safety reforms, including the adoption of the Road Safety Strategy and 
Action Plan in 2011 and adoption of mandatory Road Safety audit8 for all new roads. The RRMSP is 
strengthening the capacity of the Inter-Ministerial Road Safety Council, introducing road safety audit training 

                                                           
4 Tourism is a significant contributor to the Albanian economy, with 8.4 percent of total GDP in 2016, and is forecasted to rise to 10.8 
percent by 2027. Its contribution to employment is also significant, directly supporting 85,500 jobs (7.7 percent of total 
employment) in 2016, and is estimated to grow to 120,000 jobs (10.1 percent of total employment) by 2025.  
5 Agriculture is the single largest contributor to GDP in the country (22 percent in 2015) and the largest employer (41 percent in 
2015). Agricultural productivity and the competitiveness of the sector are adversely affected by the fragmented and subsistence-
oriented supply base, poor enforcement of food safety standards, infrastructure deficiencies, including poor transport networks and 
access to markets and tourism hubs, among others.

accreditation courses, supporting media campaigns, and enhancing the Accident Information System. The 
RLRCP will build on these reforms and address road safety through improvements to regional and local road 
infrastructure. 

Better links from the regional and local road network to the national road network will complement 
envisioned improvements in the country’s trade and transport facilitation competitiveness which are being 
supported under the separate proposed Regional Trade and Transport Facilitation Project. Improved feeder 
and distribution links from the regional and local road network to the national network together will reduce 
cost of trade and transport, lower the cost of importing and exporting for goods and services including 
agriculture and tourism.  These two areas will be the focus of the proposed RLRCP. 

A major emergent issue affecting sustainability of the road sector is the road network vulnerability to 
climate changes and natural disasters. Floods in recent years have increasingly affected the infrastructure 
and consequently the access of population and farmers to markets which have been substantially disrupted. 
A World Bank-executed Technical Assistance (TA) funded by the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and 
Recovery (GFDRR) is starting to address the issue of vulnerability of the road network and how to improve 
road asset management. Implementation of the TA outcome will be implemented as one of the components 
of the proposed RLRCP. 

In recent years, several IFIs have supported road sector investments and reforms in Albania. Several IFIs 
including the World Bank, European Commission, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development 
(EBRD), European Investment Bank (EIB), and Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW) are the main partners 
supporting the GoA including: (i) improvement of planning and budgeting process, (ii) introducing better 
management practices to avoid future arrears, (iii) deepening ARA reforms , and (iv) providing financing for 
priority projects. Bilateral partners including the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), Deutsche 
Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), Agence Francaise de Developpement (AFD) and the 
Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) are involved in supporting the new municipalities to 
capacity building, asset and resource management under their administration with a focus on water supply 
and sanitation, solid waste, and municipal financing. The proposed RLRCP presents an opportunity to develop 
an overall investment and policy framework for the regional and local roads sector that can be supported 
through the joint efforts of different development partners. In this context, the EBRD is currently in discussions 
with GoA to match the World Bank financing with a further US$50 million loan for a parallel operation. 

Gender gap. Gender gaps in construction and transport sectors, where less than 5 percent and 17 percent of 
all employed respectively, are women, are very substantial. Therefore, promoting women’s economic 
opportunities as part of the efforts to reverse poverty trends and boost shared prosperity are part of the 
project objectives. A separate TA funded by the State and Peace Building Fund (SPBF) administered by the 
World Bank will be looking into opportunities in this regard. The results from this TA will be implemented 
through the proposed RLRCP. 

C. Proposed Development Objective(s)

• Number of agricultural and tourism centers connected by improved project roads 
 

• Reduced travel time on project roads 
 

• Demonstrated better asset management capacity by selected municipalities through adoption of 
Municipal Transport Investment and Maintenance Plan. 

 
D. Project Description  

 
The Albania RLRCP is expected to be financed by an IBRD loan of US$50 million. The RLRCP will focus on the 
role that improved roads can play in enabling connectivity driven economic gains, particularly in the 
agricultural and tourism sectors, both key drivers of growth and employment in Albania. More specifically, 
the proposed RLRCP will support tourism development through improving road access to existing and 
potential tourism destinations and providing quality tourism-friendly amenities (for example, parking lot for 
tourist bus, viewpoints) and signage along the roads in the project areas. It will also support the integration 
of agricultural producers to agri-food value chains and market participation, particularly for women who make 
up the majority of the workforce in agriculture. 

To achieve these overarching goals and set an example for investment prioritization at the municipal level, 
a rigorous prioritization approach has been formulated in the RLRCP road selection. The selection of project 
roads was done through a two-step prioritization process including the development of a long list of 1,400 km 
candidate roads based on consultations between the ADF and 61 municipalities and a short list of 200 km 
candidate roads using multi-criteria analysis, considering tourism destinations, agriculture potential, 
beneficiary population, and economic efficiency indicators. The selection process reflects the priority from 
the municipalities as well as the GoA’s vision on rural roads investments that support tourism and agriculture. 
This approach also allows for easy scale-up to a program for the GoA, municipalities, and other developmental 
partners to implement. 

The RLRCP will include capacity building TA in support of the municipalities to improve management of road 
assets and strengthen links between roads, improved agricultural market access, and tourism development 
plans where they exist. The RLRCP is designed to address the sustainability of road maintenance at the 
municipal level which is a significant challenge following the transfer of local and regional road assets to the 
municipal level. The RLRCP is also designed to address road safety issues in regional and secondary roads in 
the selected municipalities to provide safer and sustainable infrastructure. 

In addition, the project will implement action plans on ways to promote climate resilience and women’s 
economic opportunities in regional and local roads in Albania as follows:  

• Climate Resilient Road Assets for Albania: Albania’s vulnerability to climate change and natural 
disasters, for example, flooding, landslides, and earthquakes, within the road sector, is being analyzed 
under a separate Technical Assistance and its outcome will inform the prioritization of investment to 



provide more sustainable and resilient road assets. The TA outcomes will be incorporated into the 
RLRCP designs of specific road sections.  Improved regional and local roads at time provide an 
alternative to the national road network critical links during extreme weather events. The TA will also 
include recommendations to adjust the design standards for regional and local roads and apply them 
to the project roads. 

• Promoting Woman’s Employment in Road Sector in Albania: the capacity of local stakeholders to 
reach out and increase women’s inclusion and participation in road maintenance programs is being 
analyzed under a separate TA. The outcome will consider policy options to provide support to 
contractors that explore opportunities to promote women’s employment in high skilled jobs in their 
respective workforce.  The focus will be on more and better jobs.  
 

The project will finance the following components. 

Component 1. Accessibility Improvement (Total cost US$47.03 million; IBRD US$47.03 million) 

This component will finance the rehabilitation of regional and local roads; consultancy service for designs, civil 
works supervision, and technical and road safety audits; and road safety initiatives.  

• Subcomponent 1.1. Climate resilient road rehabilitation works (Total cost US$45.83 million). This 
subcomponent will finance the rehabilitation of about 50 km of regional and local roads within 5 to 6 
municipalities. The roads will be designed according to Albanian standards with particular attention to their 
climate resilience (such as to flooding and landslides) given the vulnerability of the network. As a first-year 
program, three project roads in three municipalities, totaling 40 km, have been selected based on further 
surveys and a rigorous multi-criteria analysis on the short-listed 200 km of roads. The remaining roads will be 
identified and prioritized during implementation. Where roads serve tourism areas or pass through urban 
areas, attention will be given to footpaths, bicycle paths, safety improvements, orientation signage, and 
aesthetic considerations. In addition, new bike lanes and sidewalks will be build, to encourage the shift to 
cleaner modes of transport. This subcomponent will also finance all necessary designs, civil works supervision, 
and technical and road safety audits, although the designs of the first-year program were already financed by 
the GoA.  

• Subcomponent 1.2. Road Safety Initiatives (Total cost US$1.2 million). This subcomponent will 
consist of identification of potential road safety interventions on regional and local roads that are not included 
in Subcomponent 1.1 but within the project municipalities. Identification efforts shall include both road risk 
mapping using available crash data and a road safety inspection of sections linked to Component 1.1 roads. 
These interventions will address accident blackspots and include traffic calming measures, footpaths, crash 
barriers and junction design. 

Component 2. Capacity Building for Municipalities (Total cost US$0.85 million; IBRD: US$0.85 million) 

This component will build capacity in the project municipalities’ to manage their transport system and road 
assets in a sustainable way and to maximize the impacts of improved accessibility on agricultural production 
and tourism potential. It will develop standard approaches that will be implemented in a few municipalities 
in this project but can subsequently be rolled out more widely. The following activities are envisaged: 

• Subcomponent 2.1. Municipal Transport Capacity Development for all Participating Municipalities 
(Total cost US$0.45 million). This subcomponent will focus on developing municipal systems for road 
maintenance and road planning following the recent transfer of road assets to the municipal level. It will: (i) 
assess municipalities capacity, local planning instruments and processes for road planning and maintenance 
and public transport planning, (ii) develop recommendations for addressing weaknesses, and (iii) provide 
training based on the recommendations. The focus will be on road maintenance and will include support on 
programming, budgeting, sustainable financing for road rehabilitation and maintenance priorities, asset 
management and maintenance execution. Public transport planning will extend to public parking and bus 
terminals, and safety measures. The subcomponent will also finance the preparation of a standard service 
level agreement contract for maintenance between the municipalities and the service provider and will 
provide training to the municipalities on its use.  

• Subcomponent 2.2. Linking Farmers to Markets (Total cost US$0.20 million). This subcomponent will 
support implementation of the recently approved 100 villages program. It will provide technical support for 
linking agricultural producers to local demand, including through local markets and tourism centers. The focus 
will be on production areas adjacent to the road infrastructure supported by the project. The subcomponent 
will provide an assessment of potential activities that could be financed through the grants available under 
the 100 villages program or other development partner programs. Potential activities include  supply chain 
activities for key agricultural products; recommendations for alleviating impediments in connecting roads, 
warehouses, harvesting facilities, regulations; developing collection zones; and promoting “Eat Albania” 
restaurants. This subcomponent will also increase the World Bank’s evidence base for supporting women 
smallholder farmers and women-led agriculture small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to start and/or enhance 
their participation in agri-food value chains in Albania; analyze the barriers that women face in accessing 
markets, in general, but particularly in light of the new business opportunities that the project is hoped to 
deliver; and recommend the ways to address them.9 

• Subcomponent 2.3. Managing for Tourism Growth (Total cost US$0.20 million). As above this 
subcomponent will support implementation of the recently approved 100 villages program. It will provide 
technical support to promote agro-tourism in the project municipalities. The subcomponent will provide an 
assessment of potential activities that could be financed through the grants available under the 100 villages 
program or other development partner programs. The subcomponent will also provide technical support to 
concerned municipalities to plan for this growth and mitigate any possible environmental and social impacts. 
Where appropriate support may also be given to steer public and private investments in tourism related 
infrastructure and services.        

Component 3. Implementation Management Support (Total cost US$2.0 million; IBRD: US$2.0 million) 

This component includes incremental operational cost of the ADF, development and maintenance of 
Geographic Information System (GIS) and prioritization database for regional and local roads, midterm 
evaluation, and capacity-building initiatives for the ADF. It will also include the implementation of a Project 
Impact Assessment to assess the project’s impacts on key social, transport, agriculture, and tourism indicators. 
This is similar to the approach used by ADF in the previous Rural Road Program using financing from the 
development partners and outsourced expertise.    

                                                           
9 The project scope and available budget will likely not allow for addressing most of the recommendations resulting from the gender 
analysis of this subcomponent. Still, in light of the large gender gaps in agriculture and the focus that the CPF rightly puts on them, 
the team considered it important to integrate gender analysis as part of the envisaged study. The recommendations will be provided 
to the client and will also be used to inform the World Bank’s future activities.  

E. Implementation 
 

Institutional and Implementation Arrangements 

The project will be implemented over four years and seven months by the ADF, which has strong experience 
and track record as an implementing agency of road projects financed by the World Bank and other 
development partners since its inception in 1993. A Project Management Team (PMT) will be established 
within the ADF, staffed by its own personnel, which will also coordinate with representatives of the respective 
municipalities. The PMT will manage project activities, such as procurement, social impact assessments, 
safeguard functions, monitoring and evaluation, and so on. When necessary, the project management 
function will be supported by consultants. A budget for such operating costs has been allocated in Component 
3. 

It is recognized that the participation of municipalities is critical during both project preparation and 
implementation. During the project preparation, the ADF has worked very closely with municipalities in the 
prioritization exercise, and several consultations with municipalities and local communities have taken place 
during the preliminary designs of the project roads. Before starting the civil works, an Investment Agreement 
and a Function and Maintenance Agreement will be signed by the municipalities, defining duties that 
municipalities must carry, e.g. maintenance requirement, after the project roads are handed over. The ADF 
will monitor the compliance of these agreements. When procuring and implementing capacity building 
activities, municipalities will provide ADF with inputs to TOR and sign off outputs.  

1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential 
large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
The project has been classified as Category B.  Under Component 1, the project will finance the rehabilitation and/or 
reconstruction within the right-of-way of regional and local roads in selected municipalities. This Component will also 
finance and implement safety works on improving signage, pedestrian crossings, line-marking, etc. of regional and 
local road network.  
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area: 
Additional impacts might be expected due to increased traffic on rehabilitated roads, however the project will under 
Component 1 finance and implement safety works on improving signage, pedestrian crossings, line-marking, etc. of 
regional and local road network. In addition, the rehabilitation works itself financed under the same component will 
also support improving the road safety aspects in project roads, and as such are expected to have long-term positive 
social impacts. 
 
 
 
 
 .    
F. Project location and Salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 
 

The project will finance rehabilitation of priority regional roads across the municipalities. Construction will 
mainly occur within the existing right-of-way, and the estimated cumulative length of project road segments 


is 50 km. Three project roads were selected for implementation in the first year, and are located in Shkoder, 
Pogradec and Fier municipalities. There is no geographical focus for the remaining roads to be financed.

SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY 

 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

The project is categorized as category B and not 
expected to have significant or irreversible 
environmental impacts given the rehabilitative 
nature of works to be financed.  Anticipated civil 
works will primarily entail rehabilitation and 
reconstruction of rural roads.  Potential negative 
environmental impacts may include, but not limited 
to: (i) temporary construction -related effects on 
noise, dust, and air quality; (ii) temporary localized 
water quality impacts resulting from possible 
drainage and sewage pollution; and (iii) temporary 
changes in access to, and the use of, public spaces 
during construction. The exact project locations are 
still not known as the prioritization of rural roads is 
still ongoing. For that reason, preparation of 
Environmental and Social Framework (ESMF) is 
proposed prior to appraisal. ESMF is prepared to 
facilitate screening, assessment, and management of 
environmental and social issues for activities to be 
taken up by the project in subsequent years. The 
ESMF ensures preparation of appropriate and World 
Bank safeguard policy-compliant safeguard 
instruments during project implementation. 

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 Yes 

Some of the rehabilitation works are envisaged in 
nature protected areas and natural habitats. For that 
reason, the ESMF defines procedures for identifying 
and managing subprojects affecting natural habitats. 
No new construction will be allowed in nature 


protected sites, or significant natural habitats, but 
only rehabilitation of the existing roads. In addition, 
no activities will be allowed in or in proximity of 
critical habitats. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No The project will not have any impacts on forests 

Pest Management OP 4.09 No 

The project is not expected to trigger pest 
management policy. The investments will not 
promote or increase the use of the pesticide. 
Although the project will finance solely roads 
rehabilitation, the ESMF provides guidance for use of 
herbicides for roads maintenance. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 No 

The project is not expected to trigger OP 4.11. The 
investments will be focused on rehabilitation of 
existing roads. Nevertheless, due to the countries 
cultural richness, during the earthworks chance finds 
might be possible. For that reason, ESMF includes 
provisions on chance finds and required 
practices.For each such subproject, the ESIA and 
ESMP will be prepared, prior reviewed by the World 
Bank environmental specialist, and 
cleared/consulted with the Albanian Agency for 
Protected areas (or relevant environmental 
authorities). 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 No Not relevant 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

The project will finance rehabilitation and 
reconstruction of rural roads. Roads connecting 
villages with the regional centers, touristic/cultural 
sites and agricultural fields. Given the linear nature 
of the works the land-take impacts will be minor and 
linear, adjacent to the existing road. Thus there will 
be small land taken. Displacement of households or 
businesses is not expected either, nor any impact on 
livelihoods. Given that the project is a rehabilitation 
of existing roads, there will be no need for access 
roads, thus it is not expected to address associated 
land-take cases. To address the social safeguards 
instrument, the borrower will prepare Resettlement 
Policy Framework (RPF) that will guide the land take 
activities during the whole cycle of the project 
implementation. If for any sub-project it is expected 
that the footprint will be known during the 
preparation phase of the project then the borrower 
will prepare site specific abbreviated or full fledge 
(depending of the impact) Resettlement Action Plan. 

 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 No Not relevant 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

No 
The project activities will not have impact on 
international waterways 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No Not relevant 

 
 

KEY SAFEGUARD POLICY ISSUES AND THEIR MANAGEMENT 

 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential 
large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
The project has been classified as Category B.  Under Component 1, the project will finance the rehabilitation and/or 
reconstruction within the right-of-way of regional and local roads in selected municipalities and short new segments 
only where they present natural continuation / connection. Under the same component, the project will also finance 
and implement safety works on improving signage, pedestrian crossings, line-marking, etc. of regional and local road 
network. This implies that the project will possibly have some adverse environmental impacts; however, these would 
be site specific and would not be significant nor long-term. For the project to remain category B, ESMF defines 
following environmental criteria for eligible subprojects: a) category A sub projects will not be financed; b) for sub 
projects in nature protected sites, or significant natural habitats, only rehabilitation of the roads would be allowed and 
no new construction. No activities would be allowed in or in proximity of critical habitats; c) New construction should 
be limited and allowed only in some specific cases for example where segments are missing or alignment of a section 
that is currently particularly difficult of dangerous; d) The construction, reconstruction or rehabilitation of roads on 
existing right of way would be allowed only in form of one or two lane roads. 
Some of the rehabilitation works are envisaged in the nature protected areas and natural habitats. For that reason, 
the ESMF defines procedures for identification and managing subprojects affecting natural habitats. No new 
construction would be allowed in nature protected sites, or significant natural habitats, but only rehabilitation of the 
existing roads. In addition, no activities would be allowed in or in proximity of critical habitats. For each of such sub 
projects ESIA and ESMP would be prepared, priory reviewed by WB environmental specialist and cleared / consulted 
with the Albanian Agency for Protected areas (or relevant Environmental Authorities). For all supported TA activities, 
the TORs for these activities should include environmental and social considerations in line with the triggered 
safeguards operational policies. 
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area: 
Additional impacts might be expected due to increased traffic on rehabilitated roads, however the project will under 
Component 1 finance and implement safety works on improving signage, pedestrian crossings, line-marking, etc. of 
regional and local road network. In addition, the rehabilitation works itself will also support improving the road safety 
aspects in project roads, and as such are expected to have long-term positive social impacts. 
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts. 
As the project will finance mainly rehabilitation of existing roads, no major alternatives were, nor will be considered. 
Some alternatives will be taken in consideration during design when considering roads width and possible new 
connections. All those alternatives will be examined in site specific environmental due diligence documents prepared 
during project implementation. The ESMF screening procedure will help guide the Client in ensuring that the site-

specific impacts are mitigated, that no additional safeguards policies are triggered and that no category-A works are 
financed 
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower 
capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The Albanian Development Fund (ADF) will be implementing the project. ADF has experience in managing 
environmental and social impacts of World Bank-financed infrastructure investments and other infrastructure projects 
financed by international finance institutions. The ADF project team includes experienced environmental and social 
specialists.  
To comply, the ADF prepared an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) as well as Resettlement 
Policy Framework, satisfactory to the Bank, to guide the overall project as the exact subproject locations are still not 
known or are currently being assessed. The purpose of this ESMF is to guide the Environmental and Social Assessment 
process, i.e. to facilitate screening, assessment, and management of environmental and social issues for activities to 
be taken up by the project in subsequent years. Environmental due diligence documents envisaged by ESMF include: 
ESIA, ESMPs and ESMP checklists. In addition to ESMF, the Borrower prepared a sample Environmental and Social 
Impact Assessment (ESIA) for Fier-Seman road rehabilitation. 
The Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) was prepared parallel with the Environmental and Social Framework 
(ESMF)/ The documents were disclosed on the December 22th and the consultation held on January 4th . 
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, 
with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
Major stakeholders are ADF and municipalities in which the projects will be implemented. ESMF documents was 
disclosed and publicly consulted prior to appraisal. ESMF with the call for public consultation was disclosed on the ADF 
website on December 22, 2017 and major municipalities participating in a project (paper or electronic) for two weeks. 
The ESIA for Fier-Seman road was disclosed on ADF website and in Fier municipality on January 5, 2018. In addition to 
the public call, the government and relevant non-governmental organizations were invited through official invitations 
sent out by the ADF. Public consultation meetings were held in Tirana (January 4, 2018r) and Fier (January 15, 2018). 
The Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) was disclosed and consulted parallel with the Environmental and Social 
Framework (ESMF) 
The similar procedure will be followed for site specific ESMPs during project implementation as defined by the ESMF. 
All due diligence documents will be disclosed on the ADF websites respectively, and hardcopy will be available at their 
premises as well in participating municipalities for at least two weeks following public consultation as per ESMF.

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 

 
Southern Africa’s increasingly integrated regional market presents opportunities for greater economic growth and 
poverty reduction. Southern Africa is a diverse region of both low income and middle-income countries and is home to 
over 330 million people connected through an increasingly dynamic regional market. The region hosts two well-
established pan-African institutions covering agriculture and commerce—the Southern African Development Community 
(SADC) and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), which are actively pursuing a regional 
integration agenda. 
 
Agriculture varies in importance from country to country within the region but is the primary source of subsistence, 
employment, and income for most of the population. Particularly in the lower income countries, agriculture is the 
largest contributor to GDP, and the performance of the agricultural sector has a strong influence on growth, 
employment, food security, and poverty. In Angola, while the agriculture sector contributes only on average 5.5 percent 
to GDP, 44 percent of the employed population works in the sector. More than half of Angola’s poor are in rural areas 
and depend almost exclusively on agriculture for their livelihood.  Within Lesotho, agriculture contributes around 6 per 
cent to the GDP, employs almost 60 per cent of the labor force (on subsistence farms) and provides livelihood 
sustenance for 90 per cent of the rural population.  In Lesotho, more than half the population – 57 percent – live below 
the poverty line, many of whom reliant on agricultural activities. 
 
Both Angola and Lesotho have experienced development challenges common to the Southern Africa region: economies 
heavily reliant on natural resource exports with high levels unemployment and food and nutrition insecurity in rural 
areas. For many countries in Southern Africa over-reliance on oil and mineral resource driven growth has led to 
increased focus on economic diversification and more inclusive growth.  
 
Within Angola the 2015/2016 oil price shock highlighted the need to more forcefully address vulnerabilities and 
dependence on oil, and diversify the economy and better manage oil revenue volatility. The shock prompted the 
Government of Angola to accelerate efforts to diversify the economy and reduce dependence on food imports. The 
Government’s strategy in the face of the crisis placed a strong emphasis on agriculture as an immediate way to increase 
domestic production and reduce imports. Increased agricultural production (particularly cereals and vegetables) and 
productivity have the potential to ease the current account pressures and the foreign exchange scarcity. 
 
Lesotho’s economic growth has been driven by natural resource based exports – water and diamonds –  and is strongly 



linked to trade with South Africa, where Lesotho also struggles to compete with South Africa’s more efficient firms or 
farms. Lesotho’s National Strategic Development Plan prioritized development of several sectors – agriculture and rural 
economy, manufacturing, tourism and mining. Measures to develop processing and manufacturing capacity – including 
agro-based – are important to diversification efforts and address rural unemployment.  
 
The region’s rich land and water resources have potential but the agriculture sector has not yet been fully developed to 
contribute to economic transformation. Southern Africa region falls within the so-called Guinea Savannah zone, which 
has significant potential for highly productive commercial agriculture as with similar agro-ecologies in other parts of the 
world such as Brazil and Thailand. Angola is the third largest country in sub–Saharan Africa in terms of geographic size 
and much of its agricultural land is within the underexploited Guinea Savanah zone. A major agricultural producer before 
the civil war, Angola’s agricultural performance remains a fraction of its potential.   
 
In the past 50 years, Lesotho has gone from a position of virtual self-sufficiency in grain production to being highly 
dependent on imports of grain.  A mountainous country with limited amounts of arable land, Lesotho nonetheless has 
areas of high agricultural potential and the possibility to exploit its extensive water resources and unique highland 
growing environment – particularly for higher value crops.  
 
 

Sectoral and Institutional Context 
 
Raising agricultural productivity is necessary if agriculture is to contribute to growth and poverty reduction. Agricultural 
productivity has increased in southern Africa, but remains well below potential. This remains the case in Angola and 
Lesotho where even average yields are below southern Africa regional averages. Most of the growth in productivity in 
Africa has come from bringing previously uncultivated land into production, rather than from intensification made 
possible by technical change. Comparisons of total factor productivity growth have shown technical change accounted 
for a large share of agricultural productivity growth in Asia and Latin America, but a very small share of agricultural 
productivity growth in Africa in recent decades. Southern Africa has experienced more technology-driven productivity 
growth than other regions in Africa, but the gains have occurred mainly in middle income countries. Analysis has 
identified several yield gaps (the difference between actual and potential yields) that could be narrowed with additional 
investments in technology adaptation and dissemination. 
 
Regional approaches to technology generation and dissemination are a more effective and strategic than national 
efforts alone. Regional integration has proven to be an effective strategy that can allow groups of countries facing 
common research challenges to increase the efficiency of their investments in agricultural R&D. Adoption of a regional 
approach to research based on the concentration of resources within a reduced number of large, specialized research 
institutes serving an expansive shared technology space can deliver many benefits. First, it can reduce duplication by 
allowing a single regional research institute to undertake work that otherwise would be done in parallel within multiple 
national research institutes. Second, it can help capture economies of scale by concentrating resources within a single 
institute, where they can achieve a critical mass. Third, it can increase the payoffs to research by facilitating 
dissemination of improved technologies across national borders, thereby vastly increasing the number of beneficiaries. 
Fourth, it can mitigate the isolation that frequently occurs in small, fragmented research institutes by creating effective 
mechanisms for facilitating knowledge exchange and technology transfer. 
 
Southern Africa continues to offer attractive opportunities for regional research. Groups of countries within southern 
Africa share similar agro-ecological zones and farming systems, suggesting that there is potential for finding shared 
solutions to common problems. Technology spillover is already occurring within the sub-region, and several high-


yielding crop varieties and improved crop and livestock management practices have been successfully disseminated 
across borders. Significant unrealized potential remains, however, for expanding spillovers.  Southern Africa is aso 
vulnerable to climate shocks and many countries are likely to face greater variability and more pronounced extremes of 
temperature and rainfall. Adaptation measures—particularly the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices—will 
be needed to maintain productivity and ensure resilience in the face of more frequent and more severe shocks. 
 
National systems for generating and disseminating agricultural technology are operating well below their potential, 
constrained by inadequate facilities, shortages of qualified staff, and low levels of overall investment and budget 
support. These factors, in turn, are linked to the high degree of fragmentation in the deployment of resources within the 
sector, as limited financing is spread over a range of priorities. Given the small size of many countries and economies in 
the sub-region, few can afford fully elaborated technology development systems capable of addressing all of the crops 
and livestock breeds in their highly diversified production systems. This particularly true in the case of Angola and 
Lesotho, which have small number of PhD scientists (particularly for Lesotho) and infrastructure that has largely been 
devastated by the civil war.   
 
The regional productivity program model has demonstrated satisfactory outcomes.  The Agricultural Productivity 
Program for Southern Africa (APPSA) was approved in March 2013 with IDA financing to Malawi, Mozambique and 
Zambia. APPSA is part of the Bank’s larger portfolio of regional agricultural productivity programs and was third regional 
operation in a series that followed the successful implementation of the West Africa Agricultural Productivity Program 
(WAAPP) and the East Africa Agricultural Productivity Program (EAAPP).  Like the first two programs, it was expected 
that APPSA would expand to include additional countries as they expressed interest and if financing was available.  
 
In terms of results, to date APPSA has launched 74 R&D sub-projects which are currently making 156 technologies 
available to farmers (new and “on the shelf” technologies). This includes 47 technologies in Malawi (37 seed varieties; 10 
agronomic practices); 63 technologies in Mozambique (11 seed varieties; 28 agronomic practices, 16 pest and diseases 
management practices, 3 water management practices, and 5 post-harvest technologies); and 46 technologies in Zambia 
(31 seed varieties; 15 agronomic practices). Additional results include improving cross border movement of technology 
through the introduction of new plant material and varieties; scaling up extension and dissemination of improved 
technologies to reach more farmers; improved seed production; building a larger pipeline of qualified agricultural 
scientists – particularly women scientists; and upgrading of laboratory and fields to modern standards. 
 

Relationship to CPF 
 
APPSA is consistent with the emerging priorities of the new Regional Integration Strategy and the Africa Region 
priorities. Africa Region has prioritized IBRD and IDA funding around macroeconomic stability, improving 
competitiveness and economic diversification, improving human capital and access to basic services; and resilience to 
shocks. APPSA touches closely on the latter three areas with a focus on increasing.   
 
The Angola CPF is currently under review, but agriculture remains a high priority and APPSA aligns to Pillar I of the 
outgoing CPF, which is focused on supporting integrated national economic diversification and regionally balanced 
development. Productivity is central with a focus on increasing yields and developing post-harvest processing 
technologies.  APPSA is also consistent with Lesotho’s FY16 – 20 CPF Focus Area II: Promoting Private Sector Jobs 
Creation, which will direct support towards improving smallholder and MSME agriculture productivity. The CPF 
specifically prioritizes raising productivity, strengthening farmers’ capacity, fostering stronger marketing linkage, 
substituting imports from South Africa, create job opportunities, and promote women’s status in rural communities. 
 
     

C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  
 

 
To increase the availability of improved agricultural technologies in participating countries in the Southern Africa 
Development Community (SADC) region. 

 
Key Results (From PCN) 

 
Results would be measured using the APPSA results – which include the following PDO indicators: 
 

• Number of technologies that are being made available to farmers and other end users   
• Percentage of Lead Farmers in targeted areas who are aware of an improved technology promoted by the 

Project  
• Number of technologies generated or promoted by the Project in one participating country that are released 

in another participating country 
• Direct Project beneficiaries (number) 
• of which female (percentage) 

 
D. Concept Description 

 
APPSA’s regional design. APPSA is currently supporting agricultural research, technology dissemination, and capacity 
building activities associated within a regional collaborative framework around priority farming systems/commodities 
value chains.  These have been identified on the basis of a regional priority-setting study that identified leading R&D 
priorities for the SADC region, as well as the priorities indicated by each country. To date APPSA is actively supporting 
research and dissemination activities around maize, sorghum, legumes (beans, soybean, cowpea, pigeon pea), rice, 
cassava, and cross cutting climate smart agriculture practices. Regional Centers of Leadership have been established in 
in legumes (Zambia), maize based farming systems (Malawi) and rice based farming systems (Mozambique).  
 
The proposed expansion would allow the addition of horticulture and roots and tubers (cassava and potato) to APPSA 
activities with Angola taking a lead on cassava and Lesotho taking a lead on horticulture. This adds a valuable dimension 
to APPSA with a stronger focus on higher value production (fruits, vegetables, potatoes) and processing.     
 
Component 1: Technology Generation and Dissemination. The first component will finance technology generation and 
dissemination activities associated with the commodity or commodity groups being targeted by APPSA. Regional R&D 
activities for the initial targeted commodities have been developed in the initial set of APPSA participating countries and 
additional activities proposed by Angola and Lesotho as part of as part of the preparation of each country’s RCoL 
proposal. R&D activities include technology generation (research), but also technology dissemination activities 
(extension, strengthening of innovation systems).  
 
All activities financed under Component 1 are undertaken through collaborative R&D projects involving the participation 
of at least two countries. To date 74 R&D projects have been developed  through the following process: (i) for each 
commodity being targeted by APPSA, priorities are identified and endorsed at national level; (ii) draft concept notes are 
developed through communication with other regional partners; (iii) for each commodity being targeted by APPSA, 
regional planning meetings will be convened by CCARDESA to facilitate the finalization of regional research and 
dissemination priorities and associated R&D project proposals; (iv) a peer review process facilitated by CCARDESA 
provides feedback on the relevance and quality of R&D project proposals; and (v) R&D project proposals will be 

confirmed and agreed at national level.  
 
Participating countries will participate in R&D projects relating to the commodity farming system being targeted by the 
RCoL that they are hosting, as well as in R&D projects relating to the commodity farming systems being targeted by 
RCoLs in other countries; or additional R&D priorities that are agreed collectively by all participating countries. 
Therefore, each country is expected to devote a share of its Component 1 funding to R&D projects related to the 
commodity farming system being targeted by the RCoL that it is hosting, but a portion of its Component 1 funds will also 
go to support R&D projects related to the commodity farming systems being targeted by RCoLs hosted by other 
countries or any other regional priorities.  
 
Technology dissemination priorities: APPSA will support the dissemination of improved technologies by providing 
resources for RCoLs to engage with a range of partners in scaling up the use of promising innovations of relevance to the 
targeted commodities. APPSA will help to strengthen the links between researchers, extension agents, input 
distributors, and farmers and other end users, but lead responsibility for technology dissemination will remain with the 
national extension system.  
 
Component 2: Strengthening the Institutional and Enabling Environment for Technology Adoption. Component 2 will 
support activities to strengthen institutional capacity of RCoLs and to facilitate the movement of improved technology. 
The choice of activities to be financed will be driven primarily by the specific needs of each country, as identified at 
national level. In general APPSA will support: (i) upgrading of research infrastructure including rehabilitation and 
construction of physical infrastructure; farm, laboratory, and office equipment; and information technology and 
knowledge management systems; (ii) upgrading of infrastructure for sanitary and phytoanitary (SPS) management; (iii) 
improving institutional administration and performance management systems within RCoLs or SPS systems; (iv) 
developing human capital including by providing scientific or technical training at the post graduate level; by upgrading 
skills through short courses or targeted training, and scientific exchanges; and (iv) strengthening seed production 
capacity, seed regulatory functions, and related services.   
 
Component 3: Coordination and Facilitation. Component 3 will finance three main categories of activities:  
 
National level research coordination and management: At national level, APPSA will finance project coordination 
activities, including planning and budgeting, management and administration, monitoring and evaluation, safeguards 
compliance, and regional engagement. If necessary, APPSA could finance consultants to ensure that all essential project 
coordination activities are carried out effectively. Government counterpart resources will be used to pay staff-related 
costs not eligible for IDA or IBRD funding.  
 
Regional facilitation by CCARDESA: At the regional level, APPSA will finance regional facilitation activities including: (i) 
planning, monitoring and evaluation activities related to regional collaboration; (ii) regional exchange of information, 
knowledge and technologies; and (iii) technical assistance and capacity building. Many of these activities will be carried 
out by CCARDESA, which will play an important role in facilitating the development of R&D projects, including organizing 
the peer review process and providing quality control. The regional facilitation activities to be performed by CCARDESA 
will be supported using funds from a subsidiary agreement between the APPSA participating countries.  
 
R&D policy analysis and dialogue: APPSA financing will support analytical work, needs assessments, and policy dialogue 
or policy harmonization activities in key areas that affect R&D at national and regional level. Work will focus on analysis 
of relevant policies and legislation for intellectual property rights, operationalization of the SADC harmonized seed 
regulatory system, implementation of biosafety regulations, and similar topics. Discussions will take place during 



implementation to determine whether Project resources could be used productively to advance the regional seed 
agenda. If the participating countries agree that APPSA could play a useful role by supporting key players other than the 
RCoLs, support for these key players could be channeled through CCARDESA. 
 
 
    

  SAFEGUARDS 

 
A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 

 
Project activities will take place on research stations and farmer fields (on farm trials and demonstrations). The activities 

will all take place on land that is already part of existing agricultural research stations in the respective countries. 
However, as not all land is currently in active use by the client and the exact location of all project activities are not 
known, OP4.12 has been triggered as a precautionary measure.  
 
Indigenous Peoples (IPs) in Angola are dispersed through small communities in southern Angola border regions and their 

exact location is difficult to identify. Therefore, once potential project locations are confirmed, OP4.10 may be triggered 
to provide clear guidance if IP groups are encountered during the course of implementation. 
 

 
B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 

 
Both Angola and Lesotho have some experience in implementing Bank safeguards requirements through other projects 

but capacities remain limited in the specific implementing agencies. In Angola the implementing agency is the Ministry of 
Agriculture through its Institute of Agriculture (Institute de Investigacão Agricola (IIA)). In Lesotho the implementing 
agency is the Ministry of Agriculture through its Department for Agricultural Research (DAR). In each agency, incremental 
staff and consultants will be recruited to ensure implementation of safeguards instruments and monitoring compliance of 
all components. In addition, the World Bank will provide guidance and training to ensure that the client will have the 
adequate capacity to implement, monitor and report on environmental and social issues. Both Angola and Lesotho, have 
established project implementation units for other World Bank agriculture projects that will be utilized for shared 
services, and fiduciary and safeguards issues. 
 
 
D. Policies that might apply 

 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 



Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

The policy is triggered as a result of: (i) proposed 
research activities under component 1 which could 
include breeding, germplasm, and on farm technology 
testing that can involve the application of agro-
chemicals including chemical pesticides; and (ii) 
capacity building for Regional Centers of Leadership 
under component 2, which would include financing for 
civil works investment in field rehabilitation, office and 
lab infrastructure and irrigation related upgrading or 
construction. Angola and Lesotho will prepare an 
Environment and Social Management Framework 
(ESMF) as the safeguard instruments which will 
provide mitigation measures and a uniform approach 
for addressing identified potential negative 
environmental impacts as well as screening 
procedures and monitoring plans for compliance 
management.  
 
The project is proposed to be classified as an EA 
category B. 

Performance Standards for Private Sector 
Activities OP/BP 4.03 

No  

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 No 

The policy is not triggered as the program would not 
involve significant conversion of natural habitats 
through its direct or indirect activities. APPSA support 
under component 1 activities are intended to improve 
the productivity of agriculture through the adoption of 
improved technologies (intensification) rather than 
expansion of agricultural production (extensification). 
Technologies developed, tested and released under 
the project would not specifically target natural 
habitats but would aim to improve the productivity of 
existing agricultural practices. Under Component 2 the 
project is expected to finance infrastructure upgrading 
on already existing agricultural research stations and 
fields. No new land would be acquired and natural 
habitats are not known to be inside or adjacent to 
research stations. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No 

The policy is not triggered as program activities do not 
have any direct impacts on the health and quality of 
forests, people who depend on forests, nor is there an 
aim to change the management, protection, or 
utilization of forests.  

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 
The program may purchase pesticides or 
agrochemicals at very low volumes as part of project 
supported research activities. No pesticides or 

     

agrochemicals will be purchased and supplied to 
farmers outside of their participation in research trials 
or demonstrations activities.  Adoption of improved 
agricultural technology generated by APPSA could 
indirectly result in increased use of pesticides and 
agrochemicals by farmers, but the scale of this indirect 
impact is not known. For this reason, each 
participating country will prepare a Pest Management 
Plan (PMP) which incorporates Integrated Pest 
Management (IPM) procedures. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 Yes 

The policy is not triggered as implementation is not 
expected to involve any known physical cultural 
resources and will take place on land already actively 
in use for agricultural purposes either within 
agricultural research stations or farmer fields. 
Nonetheless, lessons learned from other projects in 
Lesotho have shown that in some of the districts 
where the project will be implemented, such as Leribe 
and Butha Buthe, artefacts from historical cultural 
resources have been found at some places. Therefore, 
the Chance Find Procedures will be included in the 
ESMF in case of chance finds during implementation 
project. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 TBD 

This Policy may be triggered for Angola, given the 
possibility of IP communities being present in the 
project areas. Based on the review of potential project 
locations, an IPPF will be prepared in order determine 
and provide measures to avoid and mitigate potential 
negative impacts. The framework will be specific for 
each group identified and will as well be focused on 
providing positive benefit for this vulnerable 
population. 
OP4.10 is not triggered in Lesotho as there are no 
indigenous people within the project area of influence. 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

The policy is triggered in Angola and to be determined 
in Lesotho. Although no land acquisition is expected 
under the project and activities will take place on land 
already under the management of agricultural 
research stations or farmers, in some cases land is 
currently fallow or not actively used and local 
communities may have encroached into fields for their 
own farming. While all land which is required for 
project activities belongs to the respective clients, 
there is a risk that informal occupation or use may 
occur during project implementation. OP4.12 is 
therefore triggered as a precautionary measure to 



guide implementation and mitigation measures to 
avoid resettlement impact. An RPF will be prepared in 
Angola and a determination made whether it is 
required for Lesotho during the course of preparation. 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 Yes 

The policy is triggered. Although the project would not 
invest in large scale dam construction the project 
would invest in small productive rural infrastructure, 
such as the establishment or rehabilitation and 
improvement of small-scale irrigation and drainage 
works for research stations under the RCoLs, and 
possibly include small-scale earth dams to harvest and 
store water. These structures, however these would 
generally be far less than 10 m in height. The FAO 
manual on small dams will guide implementation and 
be incorporated into the relevant safeguards 
instruments. The small dams would be designed and 
the construction supervised by a qualified engineer. 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

No 

The policy is not triggered as the project would not 
invest in any large scale irrigation works that would 
adversely affect the quality or quantity of water flow 
within shared waterways. Small scale irrigation within 
the context of technology demonstration or research 
could be financed by the program but would be within 
the context of research facilities and would not exceed 
more than 50  hectares per station/center.  

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No 
The policy is not triggered as the area where the 
program will be implemented is not known to include 
any disputed areas  

 
E. Safeguard Preparation Plan  
 
Tentative target date for preparing the Appraisal Stage PID/ISDS 
 
Feb 28, 2018 
 
Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed. The specific studies and 
their timing should be specified in the Appraisal Stage PID/ISDS 
 
An ESMF with PMP will be prepared for each country. An additional RPF will be prepared in Angola and if required in 

Lesotho. If OP 4.10 is triggered an IPPF will be prepared for Angola. Both Angola and Lesotho ESMFs will also have a 
screening process for sub-projects under component 1.

B. Introduction and Context 

 
Country Context  
1. Mozambique is a southeast African country, with a population of about 29 million people1, of which about 70 
percent reside in the rural areas.  It is estimated that about 90 percent of the rural population depend on agriculture 
as the main source of their livelihood.  With the current population growth rate of 2.7%, Mozambique’s population is 
expected to reach 46 million by 2040. The country is endowed with potentially large arable land, water, energy, gas 
and mineral resources; and is also strategically located to support economic development in the region.  

2. Poverty levels remain high and economic growth has been highly inequitable. Despite significant economic 
growth and macroeconomic stability over the last two decades between 1995 and 2015, rapid economic growth rates 
have not translated into poverty reduction. The country ranks 180 out of a total of 187 countries in the 2015 Human 
Development Index as reported by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and more than half of its 
population live in poverty2. Approximately, half (43 percent)2 of the children under age of five in Mozambique are 
stunted due to long-term effects of malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies. Economic growth has been driven 
primarily by few large-scale capital investment projects, with very limited benefits to the poor living in the rural areas. 
Poverty is particularly persistent in the country’s two most populous provinces, Nampula and Zambezia, where poverty 
rates have increased, while the rest of the country has experienced reduction in the poverty rates by over 10% between 
2003 and 2015.  

3. The country’s near-term economic prospects have been recently worsened by political and economic 
instability. Against the backdrop of the longer-term challenge of stimulating more inclusive growth, political and

economic developments in 2016 led to a rapid and dramatic deterioration in Mozambique’s macroeconomic 
framework. With large unreported debts and increased violence, the fast growth economy pre- 2016 slowed down 
significantly marked by high inflation and depreciation of local currency, coupled with falling commodity prices and 
exports. The country also suffered from the El Ninõ effects that led to extremely low rainfalls and a prolonged drought 
(2014 to 2018) which resulted in limited water supply and low agricultural productivity. This led to a humanitarian crisis 
in some of the most critical regions of the country. 

4. However, medium-term economic prospects appear positive as the country recovers from the recent 
economic crisis. Real GDP growth fell below four percent in 2016, but is expected to pick up in the range of five to six 
percent in 2018. Inflation has stabilized at around 18%, following some tight monetary policy reforms to curb currency 
depreciation and fiscal deterioration. Amidst a medium growth rate forecast, the country still faces a number of 
development constraints, including high-dependence on rain-fed agriculture; limited access to basic services such as 
water supply and electricity; and lack of resilience to climatic events due to limited infrastructure and institutional 
capacity, among others.  

5. Mozambique is among the most affected countries by climate change in Sub-Saharan Africa. Globally, 
Mozambique ranks 36th in terms of vulnerability and 144th in terms of readiness3, indicating significant risk to national 
social and economic development. The country has also been experiencing high rainfall variability, with more frequent 
droughts and floods. Highly variable rainfall, combined with limited water storage and flood control infrastructure, are 
among the main factors contributing to crop losses.  The pattern, frequency and severity of floods and droughts are 
also changing over time with significant adverse implications for agriculture productivity and production. 

 
Sectoral and Institutional Context 

 

6. Agriculture is the largest economic sector in Mozambique. The agriculture sector accounts for 26 percent of 
GDP and employs 78 percent of the labor force. However, most of the population is engaged in smallholder, rain-fed 
subsistence agriculture which frequently suffers from climate-induced shocks with significant negative impacts for 
overall economic growth and poverty reduction. Only about 10 percent of its 36 million ha of arable land is currently 
under cultivation. In 2012, there were about 3.9 million farms in Mozambique, of which 99 percent were smallholders, 
and only about 1 percent were medium and large scale commercially-oriented farms involved in competitive value 
chains, primarily for cash crops. More recently, however, there is an emerging trend and potential for the involvement 
of commercially-oriented smallholders in the value chains of horticulture and other crops as the case the out-growers’ 
systems develop under the implementation of the Sustainable Irrigation Development Project (PROIRRI). 

7. Low agricultural productivity is a binding constraint to Mozambique’s economic growth and poverty 
reduction. The country’s agriculture productivity levels are lower than the average of the low-income countries in 
southern Africa, particularly for maize and rice, two important crops for food security and trade in the region. According 
to FAO statistics 2016, the average yield of maize in Mozambique is 35 percent lower compared to Malawi and 76 
percent lower compared to Zambia. Average rice yields are similarly lower in Mozambique and are estimated at 60 
percent lower compared to Malawi and 50 percent lower compared to Zambia.  Key constraints include limited use of 
improved crop varieties (less than 3 percent of farmers); limited use of fertilizers (less than 5 percent of the farmers); 
inadequate agricultural support services, including extension (there are only 1,200 agricultural extension officers 
employed by the public sector in the country); very small area under irrigation (2.5 percent of the cultivated area); 
limited access to agricultural credit; limited access to mechanization and animal traction services (less than 9.5 percent

vulnerability to climate change and other global challenges in combination with its readiness to improve resilience. 


of farmers used animal traction in 2014); and low connectivity and limited access to markets for inputs and outputs 
(road networks provide access to only about 33 percent of the rural population). Moreover, climate-related events and 
an inadequate land rights system present a substantial risk to agriculture productivity and sustainability and reduce 
the efficiency of land use. 

8. A gender gap persists in agricultural productivity in Mozambique. Female headed households tend to be 
poorer, and lack access to productive assets and labor. In addition, they are less likely to adopt improved technologies. 
As a result, they tend to be less productive than male headed households. In 2014, the average maize yield among 
female headed households was 50 kg less than average among male headed households, which represents an 8 percent 
yield gap. This result is consistent with the findings of the literature on agricultural productivity in sub-Saharan Africa.  

9. The provinces of Manica, Nampula, Sofala and Zambézia have the highest agriculture potential, covering some 
of the most fertile soils in the country, along the Zambezi river basin, which accounts for about 17% of the irrigable 
land and 47% of the country’s water resources.4 Also, these four provinces are home to about 1.85 million smallholder 
farmers or 47% of all the country’s smallholder farmers. Nampula and Zambézia provinces face specific challenges: it 
is estimated that 11.21 million people or about 40 percent of the population in Mozambique live in these two provinces, 
but due to limited accessibility, rural households are more isolated and income from farm activities is three times lower 
as compared with the rest of country. In addition, there are generally low levels of irrigation coverage, and current 
investment patterns are not consistent with the highest-potential agriculture areas. 

10. Irrigation has the potential to significantly enhance smallholder agriculture productivity. Mozambique has a 
potential to irrigate 3 million ha. However, only about 180,000 ha are equipped with irrigation infrastructure, and only 
about half of this is currently fully operational. Thus, only about 3 percent of the country’s irrigation potential is 
currently being exploited. Under the World Bank financed PROIRRI – Sustainable Irrigation Development Project 
(P107598, closing in December 2018), smallholder farmers have doubled their productivity in vegetable crops and 
increased cropping intensity to three harvests per year from investments in improved irrigation infrastructure and 
services. PROIRRI developed a total of 3,000 ha under irrigation; out of which 1,700 ha for rice, 800 ha for horticulture 
and 500 ha for out-grower crops.  

11. The Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security (MASA) is the lead institution for agriculture development. 
MASA is responsible for formulating and implementing agricultural policies at the national level, including agrarian 
services, crop development, livestock, irrigation, forestry and food security. Irrigation development is the responsibility 
of the National Irrigation Institute (INIR) under MASA. INIR works in close collaboration with the other MASA 
departments responsible for agriculture and extension services, such as the National Directorate of Agriculture and 
Silviculture, the National Directorate of Agriculture Extension; and the Agriculture Development Fund which finances 
agriculture projects. Other relevant institutions for irrigation development include the National Directorate of Water 
Resources Management from the Ministry of Public Works, Housing and Water Resources (MOPHRH), which is 
responsible for water resources planning and allocation, as well as the development and operation of major hydraulic 
works through the Regional Water Administrations; and the National Directorate of Land and Forestry in the Ministry 
of Land, Environment and Rural Development (MITADER), which is responsible for land allocation and titling. 

12. INIR was created by the Council of Ministers Decree 9/2012 of May 11th, with legal, technical and 
administrative autonomy to promote the development of an efficient and sustainable irrigation sector in the 
country. Currently INIR focuses on technical assistance to small irrigation schemes, including the oversight of design 
and construction supervision of irrigation rehabilitation, as it lacks the technical capacity to do the design and 
construction supervision of these rehabilitation investments in new irrigated areas. INIR is also responsible for 


oversight of two large state-owned irrigation enterprises operating a total of 41,000 ha of irrigated land along the 
Limpopo river basin (23,000 ha in Chokwe and 18,000ha in Xai-Xai). Other large irrigation schemes are owned and fully 
managed by private agribusiness enterprises engaged in sugar cane production along the major river basins. 

13. In 2016, the National Irrigation Program (PNI) which was approved by the Government. The National Irrigation 
Program consists of a series of reforms and investments to address critical irrigation development needs and medium-
term food security targets for the country. MASA developed three scenarios to implement the PNI, moderate, medium 
and high. In the moderate scenario, about U$ 1 billion is needed to develop a minimum of 122,500 ha (32,000 ha public 
and 90,500 ha private) of irrigated land by 2042. The initial phase of the program is focused on strengthening MASA’s 
institutional capacity to plan irrigation infrastructure and related services and to establish and provide training to Water 
User Groups and Water Users Associations (WUGs and WUAs) to improve on-farm water management, and operations 
and maintenance (O&M) of the irrigation schemes. Moreover, MASA intends to coordinate with relevant sector 
institutions to promote agriculture intensification and market linkages for smallholder farmers.  

14. To support the PNI, the Government of Mozambique has requested the World Bank to support INIR’s capacity 
building program and finance priority irrigation infrastructure investments along the Central-Northern region. Under 
the PROIRRI, the World Bank supported key sector reforms, including the development of the PNI, the Water User 
Associations Decree Law5, and the draft regulations for private sector engagement on irrigation development. PROIRRI 
also financed the construction of 3,000 ha priority smallholder irrigation schemes in Manica, Sofala and Zambézia 
provinces, including the establishment and training of Water User Associations (WUAs) and Water User Groups 
(WUGs), and facilitated market linkages through existing agribusinesses. Through the Agriculture and Natural 
Resources Landscape Management (SUSTENTA) Project (P149620, approved by the Board on June 30, 2016) the Bank 
is supporting small emerging commercial farmers (SECF) and strengthening market linkages in a landscape approach 
in ten districts of Nampula and Zambézia. IRRIGA will build capacity for planning, design, construction and operation 
of irrigation infrastructure as proposed under the PNI, and further develop services required to enhance agriculture 
productivity in the northern-central region of the country. The IRRIGA project therefore builds on PROIRRI 
achievements and partners with SUSTENTA to maximize value chain development.  

15. The Government has also requested project support for the establishment at the central level agriculture 
investment management unit (AIMU) that will be responsible to coordinate all donor support to the sector. 
Participation of the World Bank is therefore key to contribute to the implementation of the PNI, and is expected to 
help catalyze additional financial contributions from the other development partners and the private sector. The World 
Bank has been a long-standing and valued partner in the agriculture sector in Mozambique, supporting the 
development of institutional reforms, as well as infrastructure investments. The proposed investment operation will 
build upon and leverage the World Bank’s deep involvement in the agriculture sector over time. 

16. The Bank support will be through a Series of Projects (SOP) to support MASA in the implementation of the 
National Agriculture Sector Investment Plan (PNISA).  The SOP will support a Program aimed to increase farmers’ 
productivity and improve rural livelihoods through increased access to irrigation and markets. The program will also 
fund the rehabilitation of a combined amount of 8,000 hectares of irrigated land, benefiting 12,000 smallholder 
farmers. The project description below and appraisal details refer to the first Project (SOP1).
 

C. Higher Level Objectives to which the Project Contributes 

17. The project is aligned with the Country Partnership Framework (CPF, FY17-21)6 which acknowledges low 
agriculture productivity as a major constraint to economic growth and poverty reduction. Specifically, the project 
contributes to the Focus Area 1 of the CPF on Promoting Diversified Growth and Enhanced Productivity and the Focus 
Area 2 of the CPF on Investing in Human Capital.  

18. The project addresses the Government of Mozambique’s priorities. Irrigation development is a strategic 
objective under Priority III (promote jobs, productivity and competitiveness) and priority IV (develop social and 
economic infrastructure) of the Government’s 5-year Plan 2015-2019. The project also supports the Strategic Plan for 
the Development of Agriculture Sector, 2010-2019 (PEDSA) and the National Agriculture Sector Investment Plan 
(PNISA), 2014-2019, which aim at increasing food security and income of agricultural producers in a competitive and 
sustainable manner, while guaranteeing social and gender equity.  

19. The project also contributes to the World Bank Group’s (WBG’s) twin goals of ending extreme poverty and 
promoting shared prosperity. Improved agriculture and irrigation practices will contribute to increase agriculture 
productivity and income generation for the rural communities in Mozambique. It will also contribute to improvements 
in human nutrition by improving the quality and quantity of food and reducing food insecurity. Moreover, the project 
will contribute to women empowerment by improving access to water and enable multi-seasonal production, as well 
as establishing participatory governing bodies for water management. In addition, the project will promote private 
sector participation mainly through the market linkages and where possible, through public-private partnerships to 
invest and operate small irrigation schemes. 

 
C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  

 
The proposed Project Development Objective (PDO) is to improve smallholder agriculture productivity and market 
access in the project areas developed with irrigation and provide immediate and effective response to an eligible crisis 
or emergency. The Program objective of the Series of Projects is the same as the PDO of this Project. 
 
20. The key PDO-level results indicators for the proposed project are: 

• Average crop yield of selected commodities in irrigated production systems; 

• Proportion of the production marketed for selected commodities;  

• Farmers reached with agricultural assets or services (desegregated by gender); and 

• Number of beneficiaries (desegregated by gender) 

 
D. Project Description  
21. The first phase of the project (SOP1) is expected to improve agriculture productivity and market access to 
smallholder on 3,000 hectares of irrigated land rehabilitated under PROIRRI and on additional 3,000 hectares of 
irrigated land to be rehabilitated under the project for a total of 6,000 hectares. While investments in agricultural 
intensification and market access will be primarily in these 6,000 hectares, they will be also extended to areas beyond 
those rehabilitated irrigation areas (in coordination with and involvement of the private agribusiness sector) as the 


opportunity arise. The IRRIGA project will establish and strengthen WUGs and WUAs, improve water service delivery 
and on-farm water management, expedite the introduction and transfer of improved agriculture technology, and 
improve the input and output market linkages to irrigated and non-irrigated areas.  

22. The project will be implemented in four selected provinces - Manica, Nampula, Sofala and Zambezia. The main 
criteria for the selection of these four provinces were: (a) significant agricultural potential; (b) availability of water for 
irrigation in areas currently or formerly irrigated; (c) potential for complementarity with other Bank- funded agriculture 
operations and other partners; (d) large share of population being rural and involved in agriculture for their livelihood; 
(e) high level of poverty; (f) potential for linkages with the private agribusiness sector and other development projects; 
and (f) availability of recently rehabilitated irrigation schemes under PROIRRI. 

23. The project will finance the following five components: (i) institutional capacity building; (ii) smallholder 
irrigation development and management; (iii) agriculture intensification and market linkages; (iv) project management, 
monitoring and evaluation; and (v) contingency and emergency response. Below is the summary description for each 
component. Detailed project description is presented in Annex 1. 

24. Component 1 - Institutional Capacity Building (US$8 million of IDA Grant). The objectives of this component 
are to strengthen the institutional capacity and to improve the enabling policy environment, and support the regulatory 
framework of the institutions involved in the development of irrigated agriculture, and to enhance beneficiaries’ 
capacity for sustainable development and management of irrigated agriculture. In response to a request from the 
Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security, the project will strengthen MASA’s capacity for investment planning, 
implementation, coordination and management of all donor funding for the agriculture sector development in the 
country. This component will finance three main activities: (i)strengthening irrigation institutional capacity; (ii) 
strengthening agriculture institutional capacity and market linkages; and (iii) the establishment the Agriculture 
Investment Management Unit (AIMU). 

25. Sub-component 1.1. Strengthening Irrigation Institutional Capacity. This sub-component will finance technical 
assistance to support INIR to improve the enabling environment in the irrigation sub-sector and develop regulatory 
tools and a professional code of conduct to improve irrigation services delivery. Specifically, this sub-component will 
finance studies, training and equipment to: (i) improve the institutional and regulatory framework for the irrigation 
sector to improve irrigation service delivery; and (ii) establish a national irrigation water monitoring system that will 
collect data at watershed and irrigation perimeter level. These regulatory tools and processes are broadly identified in 
the PNI and include: preparation of the public private partnership (PPP) regulations; develop regulations and contract 
models for partnerships in irrigation, and guidelines for licensing irrigation development in the country; and 
partnerships with formal education systems in the country (e.g. University Eduardo Mondlane, Instituto Superior 
Politecnico de Manica, among others), including provision of internships for irrigation engineering and irrigation 
economics graduates for practical field work up to 12 months of field work.  

26. Sub-component 1.2. Strengthening Agriculture Institutional Capacity and Market Linkages. This sub-
component will finance capacity building of institutions involved in the development of irrigated agriculture, 
specifically: (i) The National Directorate of Planning and International Cooperation (DPCI) at MASA to strength the 
statistic services, agriculture market information systems to collect, process and disseminate market and price 
information (through digital mobile devices) in the country, and provision of training to staff; (ii) the National 
Directorate of Agricultural Extension Services (DNEA) and the Agricultural Research Institute (IIAM) to increase their 
capacity for the dissemination of improved agriculture technologies and practices in the project areas developed with 
irrigation; (iii) the National Directorate of Agriculture and Silviculture (DINAS) to establish a satellite monitoring system 
to monitor the use of all areas developed with irrigation in the country. This subcomponent will also establish an 
“agricultural observatory” to generate reports for decision making for relevant institutions involved in the agriculture 


development. These reports will support relevant departments at MASA, including IIAM, DNEA, DNAS, MITADER, 
Ministry of Public Works, Housing and Water resources (MOPHRH), and the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MIC), 
including input suppliers, traders and private agribusiness operators to improve their planning to support the 
development of the agriculture sector. 

27. Sub-component 1.3 Agriculture Investment Management Unit. This sub-component will finance technical 
assistance and incremental operating costs for the establishment of AIMU to lead agriculture sector investment 
planning and implementation at MASA. AIMU will report to the Technical Committee, composed by the National and 
General Directors of MASA, and headed by the Permanent Secretary. AIMU will initially manage and implement IRRIGA 
under the strategic guidance and supervision of INIR and then gradually evolve into the MASA operational unit for 
agriculture programs implementation, thus hosting all the MASA’s investment operations with donor funding in close 
coordination with the Policy Unit of MASA, in charge of the PEDSA and PNISA. The goal is to create a strong, long-term 
operational capacity within MASA and achieve economies of scale while reducing the burden on other functional areas 
tasked with regulatory and policy functions. 

28. The AIMU will consist of five teams, including financial management, procurement, safeguards management, 
monitoring and evaluation and technical design and supervision team (TDST). Under the IRRIGA Project, the unit will 
be responsible for the design of irrigation schemes and assurance of technical quality in all phases of the development 
of the irrigation schemes.  

29. Component 2: Smallholder Irrigation Development and Management (US$28 million of IDA Grant). This 
component will finance engineering design of 5,000 ha for irrigation development; and construction supervision, 
equipment and civil and hydraulic works for 3,000 ha of irrigated land in the project areas to improve water availability 
and resilience of irrigation services.  Forty potential districts have been identified in the four beneficiary provinces 
based on Government strategies for agriculture development, market needs and existing agro-climatic conditions, land 
and water availability, and existing markets. The location of the potential districts is presented in MAP 1. Out of the 
3000 ha, 500 ha have already been assessed (feasibility) under PROIRRI and 2,500 ha additional schemes which will be 
further assessed in the first eight months of project implementation to determine the exact scope of irrigation works 
to be financed by the project. The timeline for project implementation is presented in Annex 1. 

30. Sub-component 2.1: Irrigation Infrastructure Investment: This sub-component will finance technical assistance 
for detailed engineering design for 5,000 ha irrigated land, of which 3,000 ha will be rehabilitated and modernized 
under SOP1 and 2,000 in SOP2. The rehabilitation and modernization will consist of: (i) upgrading the water intake and 
transmission main; (ii) rehabilitation and expansion of water collection and storage structures; (iii) upgrading the 
distribution system; (iv)installation of water distribution and control structures; and (v) rehabilitation and protection 
of the catchment area and embankments for conservation and erosion control. The AIMU will be responsible for the 
technical oversight and quality control of the irrigation infrastructures to be constructed under this component. Priority 
will be given to gravity-fed open canal irrigation systems, as they are relatively simple to operate and maintain, and 
are less costly compared to pumped systems. Pumping will be considered, if at all, only for high value crops and under 
exceptional cases. The construction of the irrigation infrastructure will take into consideration environmental and 
social risks and will utilize the relevant safeguards instruments to implement appropriate mitigation measures. 

31. Sub-component 2.2: Irrigation Infrastructure Management: This subcomponent is designed to support the 
establishment and capacity strengthening for the Water User Groups (WUGs) and Associations (WUAs) in all irrigation 
schemes in the project areas to manage, operate, and maintain the irrigation and drainage systems operational. 
Specifically, the project will finance technical and logistical support to establish WUGs and WUAs; develop manuals 
and associated learning materials and media products, and deliver trainings on operation and maintenance of the 
schemes. The project will also finance incremental operating costs for transitional O&M and investment costs for WUAs 




operational offices and equipment. 

32. The expected outputs from this subcomponent would be: (i) the establishment of WUGs and WUAs in all areas 
developed with irrigation infrastructure to manage, operate, and maintain the irrigation and drainage systems at 
turnout and tertiary levels, and (ii) improvement of the level of bulk water service delivered to the WUAs. Expected 
benefits include: (a) improved maintenance of irrigation systems; (b) improved water distribution; (c) increased level 
of water fee collection; and (d) enhanced transparency and accountability. 

33. Component 3: Agriculture Intensification and Market Linkages (US$13 million of IDA grant). This component 
will improve productivity, production, cropping intensity, competitiveness and market access for 9,000 smallholder 
farmers cultivating roughly 6,000 ha of land in the project area. This component builds on successful interventions 
models in the country and the region. It will finance training, technical assistance, equipment and matching grants. 
This component will finance three main activities and specific eligibility criteria will be further developed in the PIM to 
ensure equity and avoid double dipping with beneficiaries already receiving assistance under PROIRRI. 

34. Sub-component 3.1. Capacity Building for Smallholder Farmers – Under this sub-component, the project will 
support organization of farmers into producer groups and provide training through Farmers’ Field Schools (FFSs), and 
through the Integrated Program for the Transfer of Agricultural Technologies (PITTA-Programa Integrado de 
Transferência de Tecnologias Agrárias), using methodologies currently under use by MASA.  Training to farmers will 
include: (a) supporting the establishment of smallholder farmers’ organizations and producers’ groups; (b) 
strengthening the knowledge of farmers on improved agricultural practices, technology, inputs and marketing; (c) 
strengthening the functional literacy and numeracy of farmers; (d) improving household nutrition; (e) improving soil 
fertility and integrated nutrient management; (f) promoting climate smart and conservation agriculture and other 
climate smart agriculture technologies and practices; and (g) conducting demonstration trials at the farm level (FFS). 
The project will also support training to staff from the local government institutions and service providers, including 
local NGOs, to provide technical assistance to the project’s smallholder farmer beneficiaries to prepare business plans. 
It is expected that up to a total of 9,000 farmers and 200 Government staff and more than 100 local service providers 
will benefit from the project support. 

35. Sub-component 3.2 Investment Support to Enhance Smallholder Agricultural Production. This subcomponent 
will finance vouchers for eligible farmers to allow access to improved farm technologies.  These would include but not 
be limited to: seeds, inputs, mechanization services such as those using draft animals, power tillers, tractors, etc. for 
individual farmers. The mechanism will enable market access to agricultural inputs and services and improve the 
capacity of suppliers to plan and delivery quality inputs and services based on voucher system. The voucher serve as a 
financial credit for the purchase of inputs and services and will be co-financed by the beneficiary. This approach will 
build on and expands a model promoted in country and in other neighboring countries such as Zambia with FAO 
support, which proved successful in equipping farmers and promoting local input providers.  It is expected that this 
sub-component will assist up to 9,000 farmers, of which half are expected to be women. The Project Implementation 
Manual will specify a sliding scale for financial support, with an increasing co-financing percentage paid by the 
beneficiary as the value of support provided by the project to the farmer increases.  

36. Sub-component 3.3 Matching Grants for Market-led Production and Value Chain Development – This 
subcomponent will finance matching grants to support business proposals to improve production, post-harvest, value 
addition, equipment, storages and marketing facilities. Matching grants will either finance business plans for groups of 
producers (window 1, including equipment, storage facilities, and technical assistance), or for Small and Medium 
Enterprises (window 2, for processing and value addition to improve existing businesses that benefit producers in the 
project area by purchasing production, grading, packaging etc.). Typical investments would include technical assistance 
and equipment to clean, sort, grade, wash, weigh, package, store or any other activity that add value.  


37. The matching grant structure will be similar to that implemented under the World Bank financed SUSTENTA 
Project. Window 1 will typically be up to US$100,000 of which 50 percent will be grant, 40 percent credit from a 
commercial bank to be repaid by the beneficiaries and 10 percent beneficiaries own contribution. Window 2 projects 
would be above US$100,000 and up to US$1 million. Specific details of the matching grants schemes will be further 
detailed in the PIM and matching grants manual (MGM).  

38. The eligibility criteria for the grants (see Annex Table A1.3) will take into consideration the capacity level of 
the farmer’s organization, including the availability of a business/investment plan, agronomic skills and experience, 
and alignment with project supported value-chains. The implementation arrangements and grant delivery structure 
will be reflected in the PIM and harmonized with similar programs under implementation by the Government of 
Mozambique.  

39. Component 4: Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation (US$6 million of IDA grant). The objective of 
this component is to ensure project management efficiency and efficacy, by ensuring the use of resources in 
accordance with the project’s objectives, procedures, and fiduciary guidelines; and finance monitoring and evaluation 
(M&E) activities during the project implementation and report regularly on implementation status and performance, 
and the achievement of project indicators and development objective. Specifically, the project will finance (i) 
incremental operating costs for project implementation at the national level led by AIMU and at the provincial level 
led by Provincial Implementation Units (PPIUs); and (ii) the establishment of a Management Information System (MIS) 
for irrigated agriculture, and the project monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system. 

40. Component 5: Contingency and Emergency Response (US$0). This component will provide immediate response 
in the event of an eligible crisis or emergency. This is a “zero-dollar” Contingency and Emergency Response Component. 
In the case of an adverse event that causes a major disaster, the Government of Mozambique may request the World 
Bank to channel some financial resources from this component to address the emergency. If agreed by the World Bank, 
part of the project resources will be re-allocated to this component to finance any critical emergency activities under 
this component. This component will facilitate access to rapid financing by allowing reallocation of uncommitted 
project funds in the event of a natural disaster, either by a formal declaration of a national or regional state of 
emergency or upon a formal request from the Government of Mozambique. Component 5 will use IDA Immediate 

Response Mechanism. 

 
E. Implementation 

 
Institutional and Implementation Arrangements 

 

41. The project will be implemented by MASA at three levels of implementation: the national, provincial and district 
levels (Figure 1). Detailed implementation arrangements are provided in Annex 2 and will be further detailed in the 
PIM.  

42. At the National Level. MASA will be responsible for the overall implementation of the project, in consultation 
with the other relevant Ministries to ensure that the project activities are consistent with the national policies and 
programs. A Project Coordination Committee (PCC), chaired by the Minister (or - by delegation – by the Vice Minister), 
with participation of MOPH, MITADER, and Ministry of Industry and Trade (MIC), will have the overall decision-making 
responsibility regarding the management of the project, review decisions made by AIMU, issue directives to guide 
project interventions, methods and criteria. The PCC will be responsible for the approval of work plans and budgets, 
and oversight on compliance with World Bank fiduciary requirements. The Permanent Secretary of MASA will be the 
executive level head responsible for strategic direction of the project with support from the Technical Committee of 
 

the National Directors. AIMU will be responsible for day-to-day management of the project and will be composed by a 
Program Coordinator (PC), a communication specialist, an environmental safeguards specialist, a social safeguards 
specialist, an M&E specialist, a procurement specialist, a financial management specialist and the lead specialists for 
TDST. The detailed composition of the TDST is presented in Annex 2.  

43. AIMU. MASA will establish AIMU at the national level that will be (i) responsible for the project coordination and 
management of fiduciary issues in conformity with the standards and requirements agreed with the World Bank; and 
(ii) manage the project in accordance with the Financing Agreement and other project documents such as Project 
Appraisal document and the PIM.  

 

Figure 1. IRRIGA implementation Arrangements 

 



44. At the provincial level.  Each beneficiary province will have a Provincial Project Implementation Unit (PPIU) with 
a minimum of five staff including provincial coordinator, irrigation engineers, safeguard team and will collaborate with 
beneficiary districts to facilitate the project implementation.   

45. The Provincial Directorate of Agriculture will be responsible for implementation of the project in coordination 
with the provincial government directorates and district governments. A Provincial Project Coordination Committee 
(PPCC), chaired by the Provincial Governor, will oversee project implementation, including monitoring project progress 
at the provincial level and making decisions in line with the objectives and institutional arrangements that are 
consistent with the project document and legal agreements. The PPCC will approve and monitor the implementation 
of activities at provincial level. The Provincial Director of Agriculture (within the provincial government) will be 
responsible for strategic direction of the project at the Provincial level with support from the Provincial Project 
Implementation Unit, (PPIU) headed by a Provincial Project Coordinator (PPC) that will be responsible for day-to-day 
management of the project at the provincial level.  

46. Activity implementation on the ground will primarily be handled by service providers with involvement of local 
technical staff at Provincial Directorate of Agriculture. Component 2 will hire qualified engineering firms to undertake 
the design of the schemes and supervise the construction based on TORs agreed with the World Bank; Component 3 
will be implemented by services providers hired on competitive basis, based on TORs also agreed with the World Bank. 
Component 3 will provide training and demand based support in the e-vouchers for eligible farmers, and farmer groups 
for production, processing and marketing sub-projects. A specific Cost sharing grant will be prepared by the Project to 
guide the implementation of the grants in accordance with World Bank and Government of Mozambique Policies. The 
AIMU, PPIU will be responsible for overall coordination of implementation of the approved projects.   

47. At the District Level. Agricultural activities and marketing take place at district level. Given that the capacity is 
in most cases weak, the project will provide capacity building and targeted technical assistance. The District Office of 
Economic Activities (SDAE) will be responsible for project implementation at the district level, in coordination with 
District Services for Planning and Infrastructures and consultation with the District Administration. The SDAE will be 
actively involved in site identification and general oversight of the irrigation infrastructure development at the district 
level, identification and selection of sub-project proposals for matching grants with the Administrator’s guidance. The 
preparation and implementation of sub-projects for matching grants is at the level of irrigation scheme and smallholder 
farmer groups and associations.  To effectively participate in the implementation of the project, local SDAEs will have 
to carry out their work in accordance with their usual functions (training, extension, technical advice, among others), 
but they will require capacity building. To facilitate this process, the project will assist in: (I) capacity building; (ii) 
provide technical assistance; and (iii)engage service providers to assist local SDAEs. The farmers will also be involved 
in the design and construction works for the irrigation schemes and will be fully responsible for O&M of the schemes. 

 

B. Results Framework and Monitoring and Evaluation 

48. The Project will establish a Progress and Results Information Monitoring System (PRIMS) at MASA to monitor 
the implementation progress and the project outcomes. The system will be programmed as a web-based data 
reporting and management tool that will help: (i) to collect, document, analyze and generate reports on project 
progress and results indicators; (ii) to cross reference annual work plan and budget (AWP&B) tables with progress and 
results information; (iii) to integrate progress and results data of all sub-projects (i.e., monitoring of business plan 
implementation); (iv) to store and document geo-referenced data on seasonal water flow and use, agricultural 
production at plot level, and input/output markets; and (vi) to serve as a project related grievances monitoring 
database. The PRIMS will be procured in the first year of implementation.  


49. The Results Framework (RF) and the arrangements for monitoring results are reported in Section VII. The RF 
will be used to periodically track progress in achieving the project’s objectives. Also, the critical processes to achieve 
the project’s objectives, such as procurement, safeguards, technical assistance and institutional development 
activities, will be closely monitored. The project will rely on existing data sources at MASA and other Government 
agencies including the National Institute of Statistics, supplemented by regular data collection, and special surveys and 
assessment updates will be carried out by contracted specialists. Both quantitative and participatory M&E methods 
will be used to assess the social and gender inclusion of project participants. All teams involved in the implementation 
of the project will participate in the process of data collection, compilation, analysis, and use. The project will finance 
MIS costs under component 4. 

50. MASA will recruit an M&E specialist using project funds to be responsible for tracking progress on project 
results indicators. The M&E specialist, reporting to the AIMU, will be responsible for managing the PRIMS. The PRIMS 
will include an activity-specific database aligned with the annual activity plans and the M&E Plan for all outcome and 
intermediate performance indicators. The M&E specialist will be responsible for regular updating the PRIMS and 
producing quarterly progress reports. Two evaluations of project outputs and outcome will be commissioned, first at 
midterm and the second at completion. An M&E unit will be established within AIMU and the MIS and procedures for 
data collection and reporting will be prepared to the World Bank’s satisfaction. The project will finance M&E costs, 
including the impact evaluations (midterm and completion) as well as the implementation completion report, ICR.  

 
 .    
F. Project location and Salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 
 

The project will support the rehabilitation of irrigation schemes in 3,000 hectares in four provinces of 
central and northern Mozambique: Manica, Sofala, Nampula and Zambézia. The exact locations for the 
interventions have not yet been selected, though they are expected to fall within the above-listed provinces. 
The irrigation schemes will be assessed before investment is considered to ensure, economic, financial, 
social and environmental feasibility. In addition, no infrastructure investment will be made before critical 
issues such as land and water user rights have been fully secured. The project will not support construction 
of large scale irrigation structures to minimize the extent of environmental and social impacts. Priority will 
be given to gravity-fed open irrigation systems, as they are relatively simple to operate and maintain, and 
are less costly compared to the piped systems, and will consist of: diversion weir from the river, main canal 
from the weir to the irrigated area, distribution network canals, drainage network, internal road, protection 
dykes (for flooding risk), and land levelling. Dams are not required because the irrigation schemes will target 
permanent streams/rivers with enough water for irrigation and downstream use. The design and 
construction of the infrastructures will take into consideration the need to avoid and minimize 
environmental and social risks. Under the ongoing PROIRRI project it can be concluded that associated 
negative environmental and social impacts include water abstraction on downstream users, loss of wetland 
habitat because of the irrigation infrastructure needed, point and non-point pollution of water sources, soil 
erosion and siltation, acquisition of land for development of irrigation infrastructure, water and land-use 
related conflicts. However, some other potential impacts may have moderate intensity and significance, as 
well as being non site-specific, such as reduction of downstream water flow and eventual social conflicts 
among downstream water users. IRRIGA is rated as a Category B project, since most of these impacts are

minor or of low-intensity, site-specific, thus relatively straight forward to manage with adequate 
participation of the Local Government entities.

SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY 

 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

Proposed project investments under Components 2 
and Component 3 involve irrigation and 
infrastructure activities (irrigation related 
infrastructure, grain storage and processing 
facilities). Such investments have a potential of 
causing environmental impacts that require due 
safeguards consideration. Some of the associated 
negative environmental and social impacts include 
water abstraction on downstream users, loss of 
wetland habitat as a result of the irrigation 
infrastructure needed, point and non-point pollution 
of water sources from use of pesticides, fertilizers 
and other agrochemicals, soil erosion and siltation, 
water and land-use related conflicts. The specific 
location/site and scope of all project components 
are not yet known. Therefore, an Environmental and 
Social Management Framework (ESMF) has been 
prepared, consulted upon, and publicly disclosed 
prior to appraisal. Once there is information specific 
to individual sub-projects, site/project specific 
Environmental and Social Management Plans 
(ESMPs) will be prepared during implementation. 
The ESMF includes a set of Environmental and Social 
Clauses (ESC) for project implementers, provisions 
for stakeholder engagement as well as a grievance 
redress mechanisms. 

Performance Standards for Private Sector 
Activities OP/BP 4.03 

No 
The project does not expect to involve or invest in 
Private Sector activities as defined under this policy 



 

The World Bank  
Smallholder Irrigated Agriculture and Market Access Project (P164431) 

 

 

  
Apr 25, 2018 Page 16 of 24  

 

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 Yes 

Overall, promotion of irrigation and agriculture 
intensification could lead to some negative impacts 
on natural habitats. Such impacts may include 
natural habitats degradation due to an increased 
land use pressure, water bodies and soil 
contamination from use of pesticides, fertilizers and 
other agrochemicals including reduced quantity and 
quality of water upon which natural habitats 
depend. Hence, OP 4.04 was triggered and the 
borrower prepared an ESMF which includes 
appropriate measures to address any potential 
impacts on natural habitats. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No 

The OP/BP4.36 is not triggered. IRRIGA will not have 
any direct or indirect impacts on health and quality 
of forests per this policy definition, or on people 
who depend on forests, as activities will mainly 
involve rehabilitation of existing irrigation schemes. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

Promoting intensification through improved inputs 
under Component 3 may lead to an increased use of 
pesticides (though at a low scale to boost agriculture 
productivity) which  could affect the quality and 
quantity of water or lead to soil contamination and 
degradation including risks to the health and safety 
of the farmers from the use pesticides or 
agrochemicals. To address such impacts the 
borrower has prepared and implemented under 
PROIRRI a Pest Management Plan (PMP) which 
includes guidelines and procedures that are essential 
in disseminating sustainable agricultural practices by 
promoting ecological and biological control of pest 
management. The PMP also contains specific 
measures to address health and safety risks to 
community and farmers due to mishandling of 
pesticides or disposal and storage of empty 
containers. The PMP was duly updated, under 
IRRIGA, tconsulted upon and publicly disclosed prior 
to appraisal. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 Yes 

The proposed project will involve civil works and 
could potentially involve chance finds of PCR during 
construction. The ESMF include Chance Find 
Procedures. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 No 

The policy does not apply to Mozambique, as there 
are no populations/communities that meet the 
definition of Indigenous Peoples as described in the 
policy.

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

The exact nature and specific location of the project 
interventions (in Manica, Nampula, Sofala and 
Zambezia provinces) will be determined during 
implementation, and because the project will 
finance activities such as civil works for irrigation 
schemes that may disrupt farmers activities  
restricting their access to water and potentially 
resulting in the loss of crops, OP 4.12 has been 
triggered. Land acquisition is expected to be low in 
magnitude and it is unlikely that the rehabilitation 
and expansion of agricultural areas would potentially 
result in physical displacement. Consequently, MASA 
has updated the Resettlement Policy Framework 
(RPF) of the PROIRRI to adequately address issues of 
land acquisition resulting in physical impacts on 
people and/or loss of assets, means of livelihoods or 
resources. 
The RPF sets forth the principles and procedures for 
managing issues of land acquisition requiring 
compensation and/or the physical displacement of 
persons/households. The RPF has been consulted 
and was sill be disclosed both in-country on 15 May 
2018 and by the World Bank on 17 May 2018 prior 
to Appraisal. The RFP includes specific guidance for 
screening subprojects for resettlement and 
livelihood impacts, and for the preparation (prior to 
subproject approval) and subsequent 
implementation of site-specific Resettlement Action 
Plans (RAPs) and/or Abbreviated Resettlement Plans 
(ARAPs). 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 Yes 

This policy is triggered since IRRIGA will support 
activities that will involve rehabilitation of water 
storage or water control structures, canals and 
rehabilitation of small dams/water diversion weirs. 
The project will not finance any large dams as 
defined under this policy. Nonetheless, the borrower 
prepared an ESMF that includes basic guidelines and 
measures to address potential environmental 
impacts from rehabilitation of small dams. Such 
measures will be included in the project design and 
will be reviewed by qualified engineers prior to 
commencement of the works. 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

Yes 
IRRIGA will support construction and rehabilitation 
of irrigation schemes along Buzi and Zambezi River 
basins. However, the activities supported by the 



 

The World Bank  
Smallholder Irrigated Agriculture and Market Access Project (P164431) 

 

 

  
Apr 25, 2018 Page 18 of 24  

 

project will have a low likelihood of interference in 
intentional watershed, given the downstream 
location of the areas of the project intervention 
relative to riparian countries (Mozambique is the 
lowest riparian country of these rivers).  LEGEN has 
determined that the project qualifies for an 
exception to the notification requirement in OP 7.50.  
A memo for exception to notification prepared 
which was duly cleared by the AFRVP. 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No 
This policy is not triggered. The area in which the 
project will be implemented is not known to include 
any disputed areas. 

 
 

KEY SAFEGUARD POLICY ISSUES AND THEIR MANAGEMENT 

 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential 
large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
The project may have some unintended negative environmental and social impacts such as soil erosion, siltation, 
salinization, water pollution with fertilizers and pesticides, health risks for farmers due to agrochemicals usage, limited 
water availability for downstream users and biodiversity loss in mountain water springs, and loss of wetland habitat as 
a result of the irrigation infrastructures needed. Additionally, expansion of irrigation areas may also result in land 
acquisition and limited water availability for downstream which could then lead to loss of crops and livelihoods with 
potential to generate water and land-use related conflicts. Most of these impacts are minor or of low-intensity, site-
specific and thus relatively straight forward to manage, with involvement of the Local Governments entities and 
WUAs. Nonetheless, some other potential impacts may have moderate intensity and significance, as well as being non 
site-specific, such as reduction of downstream water flow, eventual social conflicts among downstream water users, 
drawing from PROIRRI's identified environmental and social impacts, or maybe labor influx issues with local 
communities. Overall, no potential large scale, significant or irreversible impacts are expected under IRRIGA. 
 
Other impacts associated with the civil works include health and safety of the workers and communities, dust 
pollution, and construction waste/debris. Some of the schemes rehabilitation/expansion works and equipment 
installation will be along the cultivated fields. Although the works will primarily occur along the edges of the fields, 
some works may disrupt farmers activities restricting their access to water and potentially resulting in the loss of 
crops. It is not anticipated that the project will lead to significant land acquisition or significant restrictions on access 
to sources of livelihood. Moreover, some of the construction works may require the hiring of external work force, thus 
leading to the risks of labor influx in rural areas. Such risks should be manageable and will be adequately addressed 
through application of standard Bank safeguard instruments (ESMF, RPF, ESIA/ESMP and RAP).  
 
The predecessor project, PROIRRI continues to face compliance issues. The ESMPs for the subprojects (32 irrigation 
schemes) were recently approved. The PIU has submitted a remediation plan which needs to be consolidated and 
implemented, to which end time and resources will have to be allocated.

Borrower capacity to implement sound safeguard management procedures is low, but improving, therefore although 
global environmental and social impacts from IRRIGA are considered to be moderate, the environmental and social 
risk assessment of the overall project, including the PIU  (AIMU - Agriculture Investment Management Unit) capacity 
to perform adequate project safeguard management and procedures, is considered to be substantial. 
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area: 
As examples of potential indirect and/or long term impacts of IRRIGA, downstream water contamination from on-farm 
agro-chemicals application, reduction of downstream water flow and eventual social conflicts among downstream 
water users can be put forward. However, water availability studies were undertaken through other WB financed 
projects in the same target area, such as SUSTENTA and involving National and Regional Water authorities. These 
studies demonstrate that river flows are high and current uses are very low, hence easily accommodate the extra 
water need for IRRIGA and for other future water uses. Recent figures related to water availability, made at river basin 
level (for Lúrio, Meluli, Licungo, Zambezi, Pungoe and Buzi) clearly show that future cumulative water demand with 
IRRIGA ranges from 0.16% to 4.6% of these river's mean annual runoff. The ESMF includes an examination of potential 
cumulative and induced impacts to followed upon during implementation. 
 
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts. 
The project will not support construction of large scale irrigation structures in order to minimize likely environmental 
and social impacts. Priority will be given to gravity-fed canal irrigation systems. The feasibility studies, the design, the 
safeguards instruments and construction of the irrigation infrastructures will take into consideration the need to avoid 
and minimize to the extent possible, environmental and social risks. 
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower 
capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The project implementation arrangements related to the environmental and social safeguard requirements, national 
legislation and Bank policies, will be under responsibility of the Agriculture Investment Management Unit (AIMU) at 
MASA. 
 
The capacity of MASA to implement safeguard policies is still inadequate, but improving. MASA through AIMU 
(Agriculture Investment Management Unit) is currently implementing other WB funded projects and its overall 
capacity has been gradually strengthened at central ad local levels to address the increasing safeguards risks in this 
sector. AIMU comprises among others, a Project Coordinator and two dedicated safeguards specialists (environmental 
& social) who will ensure management of project’s safeguards requirements. IRRIGA safeguards capacity will build on 
experiences learnt from PROIRRI implementation while also establishing strategic synergies with other WB projects 
coordinated by FNDS (MOZBIO, SUSTENTA) with overlapping geographical area to ensure harmonization of procedures 
and protocols among projects and institutions. In addition, measures are being taken to ensure that the remedial 
measures still pending implementation under the ongoing PROIRRI project are satisfactorily addressed so to serve as 
he basis for IRRIGA safeguards management.  
 
The existing safeguards specialists at central level, will be further assisted at the provincial level by a team of social 
and environmental technicians who will closely oversee implementation and ensure compliance with safeguards 
policies in each of the targeted provinces. In addition, detailed team roles, responsibilities, as well as capacity building 
(training) requirements and procedures for sound management of environmental and social impacts were adequately 
included and budgeted for in the ESMF. A series of regional training seminars/workshops will be organized for all 
actors involved in the implementation of social and environmental safeguards policies, upon project effectiveness.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, 
with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
During preparation of the ESMF, RPF and PMP a Public Consultation Process was undertaken in all provinces targeted 
by the IRRIGA, plus Maputo province, aiming to inform, hear and gather recommendations from different potentially 
affected and interested groups on project design, environmental and social impacts and risks related with the project 
activities. 
After project approval a Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP) will be prepared to identify key stakeholders that are 
affected, and/or able to influence project design and its activities while also identifying effective methods and 
structures through which to disseminate project information and to ensure regular, accessible and transparent 
consultation; guide AIMU to build mutually respectful, beneficial and lasting relationships with stakeholders; Establish 
a Grievance Redress Mechanisms; and define roles and responsibilities for the implementation of the SEP. 
The main stakeholders to engage in this project are Farmers, Associations of Farmer, women associations, vulnerable 
groups (youth, elderly, disabled), Ministry of Land, Environment and Rural Development  (MITADER), DPTADER,  
Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security, Provincial Directorate of Agriculture and Food Security, District Services of 
Economical Activities (SDAE), District Services of Planning and Infrastructure (SDPI), National Directorate of Water 
Resource Management (DNGRH), Regional Administrations of Water (ARAs), Ministry of Industry and Commerce, 
NGOs, Academia and other ongoing projects such as SUSTENTA, MozFIP, MOZBIO, among others. 
At IRRIGA subproject level, during the prefeasibility phase and through the implementation of the E&S Screening Form 
(ESSF), stakeholders will be consulted in the identification and assessment of the social and environmental risks of a 
proposed project so that project design alternatives can be identified prior to proceeding to project feasibility.

Corporate Review Decision  

 

I. Country and Sector Background  
 
1. The collapse of global oil prices, a persistently unstable regional security situation, and the high 
fiscal cost of ongoing humanitarian efforts, have strained Chad’s public finances. The Government has 
responded with a proactive but severe fiscal adjustment and the economy has experienced a deep and 
extended recession with high social costs. The crisis has also weighed heavily on the country’s ability to 
implement much needed structural reforms for non-oil sector recovery and social inclusion.  

2. Following a global oil price drop, Chad’s economy contracted 6.3 percent in 2016 and 3 percent 
in 2017. Chad’s oil sector has not only driven growth during boom years, but also translated falling oil 
prices into a sharp recession since 2016. The export price for Chadian crude oil fell from an average of 
US$100 per barrel in 2013-14 to US$34 in 2016, putting an abrupt end to growth rates around 6.3 percent 
per year in 2013-14. Oil-related fiscal revenues dropped from 11.7 percent of non-oil GDP in 2014 to just 
3.5 percent in 2016. Chad’s crisis has been aggravated by limited economic diversification and widespread 
poverty. In 2017, the economy struggled to recover and remained in recession, to a large extent due to 
an unexpected oil production shortfall.  

3. The new context of lower oil revenue, together with the challenging security and humanitarian 
situation, has greatly intensified economic, fiscal and social pressures. In the absence of adequate macro 
policy buffers and in the presence of immediate financing needs, the government had no room to 
undertake counter-cyclical fiscal policy to support economic recovery and protect social spending 
effectively. Monetary policy options have also been limited as the regional central bank is trying to 
manage the fallout from the oil price shock across Central African Economic and Monetary Union (CEMAC) 
members (including Chad). Regional security threats have negatively impacted growth by reducing cross-
border trade and kept foreign direct investment away. Significant security expenditures are linked to 
Chad’s continued efforts combating transnational terrorist groups (such as Boko Haram), supporting 
regional stabilization (peace-building) initiatives (2.8 percent of GDP in 2016), as well as providing for a 

vast number of refugees and displaced persons (around 2.8 percent of 2016 GDP per year).1 Domestically, 
the government keeps diffusing tensions between agricultural communities and pastoralists. 

4. The government has demonstrated its determination to responsibly manage what has turned 
out to be a much deeper and longer fiscal crisis than expected. Continued efforts to restructure external 
commercial debt came to fruition in February 2018, when an agreement in principle was reached. This 
agreement will allow Chad’s public debt to return to sustainability and moderate risk of debt distress (as 
per the March 2018 Bank-Fund Debt Sustainability Analysis). The substantial oil-collateralized loan with 
an international commodity firm – Glencore – had heavily reduced fiscal revenues and rendered debt 
unsustainable (see Box 1 for details). As a result, between 2014 and 2016, public spending was cut by 10.8 
percent of non-oil GDP, and since 2016 an emergency fiscal consolidation action plan has been adopted 
and extended in the 2017 Finance Law. Despite such sharp adjustment, Chad’s fiscal situation remained 
challenging during 2017, with a financing gap that required domestic arrears accumulation.  

5. Poverty reduction gains achieved over the past decade have been threatened by the current 
economic crisis.2  In the absence of a well-targeted and effective social safety net, the poor and vulnerable 
have likely been deeply affected by the crisis. During the oil boom, poverty rates declined (from 55 percent 
in 2003 to 47 percent in 2011), however, the absolute number of poor increased from 4.9 million to 5.6 
million due to population growth. Progress on non-monetary poverty also presents a mixed picture. Since 
the beginning of the crisis, dwindling fiscal resources have disrupted vital public services despite the 
government’s efforts to protect priority social spending. Payments to community-based teachers and 
health workers, funding for student scholarships, social-program benefits, and the provision of 
agricultural inputs have either been delayed or halted altogether at various occasions, and all public 
investment projects have been suspended.  

II. Proposed Objective(s) 
 
6. The primary objectives of the series are to enhance fiscal and oil sector risk management and 
transparency, promote economic diversification, and improve social protection for the poor and 
vulnerable. To achieve these objectives, the programmatic series is organized around four intertwined 
pillars: First, it aims at enhancing fiscal risk management through (a) improved debt management, (b) 
rationalization of tax expenditures, (c) streamlining the payroll for enhanced fiscal space, and (d) improved 
oversight and transparency in the management of SOEs. Second, to improve the contribution of the oil 
sector to fiscal sustainability and economic resilience it promotes (i) a functional oil revenue management 
mechanism; (ii) transparency in the sector; and (iii) improved control over oil production costs. Third, to 
increase diversification and resilience of Chad’s population in face of economic and climatic shocks, the 
operation (a) contributes to greater agricultural productivity for more sustainable and inclusive growth; 
and (b) strengthens the contribution of the ICT sector to inclusive growth through enhanced affordability 
and coverage of services, as well as improved transparency for public and private service delivery. Fourth, 
it increases social protection for the poor and most vulnerable groups including refugees, by developing 
an effective and well-targeted social safety net system, and implementing cash transfers.  

 

                                                 
1 Of the more than 750,000 displaced people currently living in Chad, 403,780 are refugees. The number of refugees is equivalent 
to over 3 percent of the population, the fifth-highest level in the world. See: UNHCR and World Bank IDA18 refugee Sub-Window 
Board Consultation Paper (September 19, 2017). 
2 The latest poverty data are available as of 2011 only. 



III. Rationale for Bank Involvement 
 

7. Building on the 2017 Emergency Fiscal Stabilization Operation (EFSO), this series shifts Bank 
support towards a structural resilience and growth agenda. The authorities aim at sustaining growth 
recovery, fostering economic diversification in the medium term, and developing coping mechanisms for 
the poor and vulnerable. Four intertwined pillars combine structural measures to enhance fiscal risk 
management with boosting economic diversification and social resilience. Improved debt management, 
SOE oversight and oil revenue management are complemented by increased productivity in agriculture 
and competitive, open access information and communication technologies (ICT). Finally, putting in place 
a well-targeted and fully operational social protection system for the poor and vulnerable adds an explicit 
micro layer of resilience.  

8. The program supported by the proposed series is closely aligned with the three pillars of the 
Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for FY16-20. The CPF was discussed at the Board on December 10, 
2015. The CPF, which succeeded the interim strategy note for FY10-12, is based on three engagement 
themes: (i) strengthening fiscal management; (ii) improving the returns to agriculture and developing 
agricultural value chains; and (iii) building the stock of human capital and reducing socioeconomic 
vulnerability.  

9. The proposed series follows a sequence of efforts by the World Bank to help the Chadian 
government cope with the impact of multiple exogenous shocks and lay the groundwork for sustained 
growth recovery and social inclusion. In December 2015, the Board approved the Fiscal Consolidation 
Program Support Grant (FCPSG), Chad’s first development policy operation in a decade. The FCPSG aimed 
to reinforce macroeconomic stability, protect critical expenditures, and initiate a medium-term structural 
reform agenda. It supported measures to broaden the tax base, rationalize public spending, enhance PFM 
transparency, and streamline business-registration procedures. In December 2016, as a protracted slump 
in global oil prices coupled with persistently high security and humanitarian costs further strained Chad’s 
fiscal resources, the Board approved US$80 million in additional financing for the FCPSG through Crisis 
Response Window allocation. The FCPSG’s implementation has been broadly on track, with a substantial 
in of the number of taxpaying firms and newly registered businesses observed despite the difficult 
economic climate. While less progress has been achieved in enhancing public procurement and limiting 
recourse to extraordinary spending procedures, the government is now preparing to implement a new 
procurement code, while the fiscal consolidation and the recent shift to cash-based budgeting are 
expected to curb the use of extraordinary spending procedures. Considering the country’s dire macro-
fiscal situation, the World Bank also approved a US$65 million emergency development policy financing 
operation - the EFSO – in June 2017, which builds on the FCPSG and has helped the government meet 
urgent financing needs while laying the groundwork for more substantive reforms. 

IV. Institutional and Implementation Arrangements 
 

10. The government’s Negotiation Committee will oversee the implementation of the reform 
program supported by the proposed operation. The Negotiation Committee, which is chaired by the 
Ministry of Economy and Development Planning, is an inter-ministerial committee charged with 
coordinating the preparation of the proposed operation and monitoring the reform program. The 
participating ministries, departments, and agencies will provide information on the status of their 
respective programs, and the committee will monitor their progress against program objectives. The 
committee previously collaborated with both the IMF and the World Bank during the successful HIPC 
completion process and the implementation of the FCPSG. A results framework will define concrete 



indicators and empirical benchmarks to monitor progress and facilitate ex post evaluation following the 
end of the program. 

V. Risk and Risk Mitigation 
 

11. The overall risk rating for the proposed operation is high. Political and governance risks, 
macroeconomic risks, and risks related to institutional capacity for implementation and sustainability are 
especially serious.   

12. Following the agreement in principle to restructure the debt to Glencore, debt vulnerabilities 
declined significantly. Public debt remains in distress for the time being. Once the final agreement is 
reached and progress is made on clearing the outstanding external arrears, other things equal, the risk 
rating would be expected to be upgraded to moderate under the current LIC DSF methodology. 

13. Risks of delayed structural reforms in sensitive areas because of political resistance cannot be fully 
mitigated and remain high.  Against the backdrop of continued exposure to oil price and production 
shocks, the government has demonstrated a strong commitment to fiscal discipline and an ability to 
maintain a sound fiscal stance in a challenging economic context. While CEMAC membership has 
bolstered macroeconomic stability in recent years, CEMAC’s low foreign-exchange reserves and the 
constrained fiscal space of its members pose additional downside risks.  Risks related to institutional 
capacity for implementation and sustainability will be mitigated by leveraging ongoing and planned World 
Bank projects in the policy areas supported by the proposed series, as well as technical assistance from 
Chad’s development partners, including France, the AfDB, EU, IMF and CEMAC. 

 

VI. Poverty and Social Impacts and Environment Aspects 
 
Poverty and Social Impacts 
 
14. The proposed series is expected to have a significant positive impact on poverty reduction in 
the medium and longer term. The proposed operation is expected to help decrease poverty in the 
medium and long term through the promotion of inclusive growth in agriculture, and the development of 
more affordable ICT services and broader coverage in underserved areas. In addition, a properly targeted 
expansion of the social safety net system has the potential to have a significant impact on allowing 
households to move out of poverty and strengthen household resilience to shocks. The overall impact on 
poverty therefore is expected to be positive in the medium and longer term.  

15. Medium term efficiency gains in fiscal and debt management and better overall risk 
management are expected to improve fiscal space for social protection and other public services as well 
as pro-growth investment. While fiscal rationing and stabilization policies of the Government may have 
a negative short-term impact on poverty through public sector job losses or decreases in public services, 
however, medium term efficiency gains in fiscal and debt management and better overall risk 
management should clearly improve fiscal space for social protection and other public services as well as 
pro-growth investment. Improved control of fiscal risks should also contribute to macroeconomic stability, 
which is beneficial to growth and poverty reduction. The social costs associated to the elimination of 
irregularities in the payroll is likely to have only negligible social costs. However, the payroll audit may set 
the stage for deeper reforms of the civil service (beyond the scope of this operation), which would likely 
involve significant social costs and would require careful evaluation and adequate mitigation.  



 
16.   The proposed reforms in agriculture and ICT may lead to a more diversified economy and 
improved public services. As around 80 percent of Chad’s labor force is active in agriculture, productivity 
gains stemming from enhanced dissemination and adoption of agricultural technology and more effective 
input supply chains is bound to result in broad positive effects for vulnerable and poor households. The 
development of more affordable ICT technologies is also expected to contribute directly, over the medium 
term, to the provision of better public services. This would benefit the poor who tend to rely 
disproportionately on public services. Cheaper, more effective ICT services in Chad, may also contribute 
directly to inclusive growth in agriculture by facilitating extension services, but also have cross cutting 
positive spillover effects for most sectors using ICT as an input. Ultimately, effective ICT is also expected 
to support faster and more efficient implementation of social safety nets and related transfer and social 

protection systems nationwide. 

 
17. The expected medium-term impact of the reforms included in this operation on gender equity 
is positive.  In the medium to longer term, increased fiscal space for health, education, and social safety 
nets would have positive impacts on services benefitting women. Increased spending for health may 
contribute to decrease very high maternal mortality rates. At 856 deaths per 100,000 women, Chad ranks 
only above CAR and Sierra Leone in international comparisons.3  In addition, increased funding for 
education and social safety nets may support improved school attendance for girls. Families with limited 
resources often prioritize the education of sons, and, despite recent improvements, the 2014/15 
Demographic and Health Survey shows that 44 percent of girls aged 15 to 19 have never attended school, 
compared to 30 percent of boys in the same age group.  To help address this, the implementation of the 
NSPS clearly identifies women as the most vulnerable population, and targets them specifically as the 
primary recipients of cash transfers and cash for works programs. 
 
Environment Aspects  
 
18. The reforms and policy actions supported by the proposed operation are not likely to have 
significant negative effects on the country’s environment, forests and other natural resources. 
Environmental Assessment (EA) is a legal requirement in Chad and is widely applied to all developmental 
projects. The EA process is based on Presidential Decree No. 630/PR/PM/MEERH/2010 on EA regulations 
and the ministerial decision No. 039/PR/PM/MERH/SG/DGE/DEELCPN/2012 with respect to the general 
guidelines and procedures for environmental assessment. The department of environmental assessment 
and pollution control in the Ministry of Environment and Fisheries is institutionally saddled with reviewing 
and clearing environmental impact assessment (EIA) documents. 
 
19. As per the Policy on Development Policy Financing, the World Bank assessed whether specific 
country policies supported by the DPF series are likely to cause significant effects on the country’s 
environment, forests, and other natural resources. The assessment concluded that the policies 
supported by the proposed DPF are not likely to have negative impacts on the country ‘s natural assets. 
All the actions supported throughout the operation are policy-oriented; they do not support direct 
investment in environmentally impactful investments or involve policy actions with significant 
environmental consequences. The assessment of potential impacts related to actions supported by the 
DPF will rely on the existing national legal and regulatory framework, and will be monitored and addressed 
through the national procedures in place in Chad. 
 

                                                 
3 World Health Statistics 2016, World Health Organization. 



20. Prior actions and triggers designed for increasing social protection for the poor, vulnerable and 
refugees are also largely environmental neutral. Although some cash for work under the social 
protection programs could be expected to have some small physical footprint, the Government will 
finance significant capacity-building activities including environmental and social safeguards through the 
Cellule Filet Social (CFS) established on March 10, 2016. In conjunction with department of environmental 
assessment and pollution control, the CFS will play a key role in minimizing any environmental and social 
adverse impacts and enhancing the positive ones derived from social protection programs. Further, the 
operation’s focus on ensuring adequate fiscal space to preserve pro-poor spending and maintain the 
government’s capacity for effective social protection policy could indirectly support environmental 
objectives by mitigating the need for rural households to resort to environmentally unsustainable 
practices in the event of a natural disaster or a shock to agricultural production. 
 
21. Prior actions with respect to reforms in the agriculture and ICT sectors may have positive or 
little impact on the environment. Improved seeds will increase productivity at the intensive margin, 
thereby reducing the need to increase cultivated land size and grow at the external margin. Although this 
operation focuses uniquely on open access to Chad’s fiber backbone, potential extension of geographic 
coverage of mobile networks at a later stage could involve the destruction of some flora and fauna. 
However, any potential environmental impact could be minimized by avoiding areas were the impact will 
be substantial. Also, the licensed operators would be encouraged to begin revegetation of excavated sites 
immediately the sites have been backfilled. 
 
22. The Government’s reform agenda encompasses a robust institutional framework for 
environmental protection. The NDP includes a pillar dedicated to environmental protection and 
adaptation to climate change built on four key elements: (i) the protection of Lake Chad and other critical 
ecosystems; (ii) improved land management in rural and urban areas; (iii) the mitigation of risks related 
to natural disasters; and (iv) the fight against desertification and the conservation of biodiversity. The 
1998 Environmental Code was augmented in 2009 by a decree on pollution and environmental damage. 
The use of charcoal is officially forbidden in Ndjamena to minimize indoor air pollution, and the country 
is promoting the use of improved cooking stoves. Nevertheless, indoor air pollution remains a major 
health risk, and access to clean fuels is limited. The Environmental Code also defines principles for solid 
and hazardous waste management, though these are poorly enforced. The GoC promulgated a Forestry 
Law in 2008 that clearly distinguishes between conservation and production activities.

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 

 

Niger is one of the world’s poorest and least developed countries in the world, with a per capita income of 
US$390 in 2015 and almost half of Nigeriens living beneath the poverty line (45.7 percent in 2014). In 2015, 
Niger ranked last of 188 countries on the United Nations Human Development Index. The Nigerien economy is 
highly dependent on its agricultural sector and a few commodities (uranium, oil and gold), making it vulnerable 
to climate and price shocks. With a variable and changing climate, the country suffers from recurrent drought 
and food crises. Niger has one of the fastest population growth rates in the world (4 percent in 2015) and the 
youngest population in the world, with a dependency ratio of 113 in 2015. Niger has significant institutional 
deficits, ranking 99 of 168 countries in the 2015 Corruption Perceptions Index. 

 

Niger meets the very definition of a country at risk of fragility, conflict of violence. The country—which held 
presidential and general elections in March 2016—has managed to remain stable in a difficult regional 
environment. Some of the factors that account for this achievement include: (i) a relatively strong social 
cohesion and (ii) a political settlement in which the elites manage to solve their disputes in a regulated manner. 
However, several factors contribute to the country’s fragility. These include demographic trends combined 
with notable climate change–related events and the deterioration of natural resources in the most populated 
areas; the contestation of the political elite and state institutions; external stresses; and a lack of economic 
opportunities. Because several risk factors — such as climate-related events or the tightening of the elite 
coalition — could trigger instability and violence, Niger remains a country at risk. 

 

Niger is hosting over 280,000 people displaced by conflict: approximately 158,000 refugees, 109,000 Internally 
Displaced People (IDPs) and 16,000 Nigerien nationals who returned from Nigeria as a consequence of the 
conflict. This displacement has been caused by two regional conflicts: the crisis in Mali (accounting for 22 
percent of the total displaced) and the Boko Haram regional crisis (78 percent).  



 

Since 2011, there has been an increasing number of attacks on Niger’s territory. The country, which held 
presidential and general elections in March 2016, has managed to remain an “island of stability”, but the 
relatively strong social cohesion is fragile. Niger is part of internationally-supported military efforts against 
Boko Haram (through the Joint Multi National Force) and in Mali, but increased military spending is putting a 
severe strain on public finances. The Risk and Resilience Assessment (RRA) highlights the security and economic 
impacts of regional conflicts and forced displacement on Niger, including the crises in Libya, Mali and Nigeria 
and notes that the expansion of Boko Haram into Niger has had an adverse impact on economic activities in 
the Diffa region and also raises concerns about the weakness of the Nigerien Army (e.g. following the attack in 
Bosso, Niger had to call on Chad for military assistance). The RRA argues that each military defeat raises the 
risk of a military coup in Niger. 

 

Overall, the situation remains in flux. Despite a recent slowdown, further flows of population may be caused 
by Boko Haram until the region is fully stabilized. The authorities are eager to demonstrate the normalization 
of the situation both in the Diffa region and along the Mali-Niger border, but insecurity remains very high. On 
the one hand, there may be pressures to eventually encourage the return of forcibly displaced people in the 
Diffa area, on the other hand there seems to be a degree of acceptance that the situation along the Mali-Niger 
border may last.  

Across all forced displacement situations, the conditions for women and girls are very specific. Gender-based 
violence and survival sex are relatively prevalent. Early marriages are often the norm, including within host 
communities and economic opportunities and access to education are very limited for women and girls. Unless 
the gender dimension of the situation is effectively dealt with, progress is likely to remain elusive. 

 
Sectoral and Institutional Context 

 

Niger has adopted a relatively progressive approach to managing refugee situations. This is also reflected in 
the solidarity demonstrated by host communities in particular in the Diffa Region. The overall legal and 
protection environment in Niger is conducive to an effective socio-economic response to the forced 
displacement crisis. Niger is a party to applicable international conventions on refugees, IDPs, and stateless 
persons, and it has domesticated some of these instruments. In particular, refugees are to be treated equally 
under the law with respect to key socio-economic rights: property ownership, security, access to the courts, 
access to basic services, and freedom of expression and movement. Efforts are underway to strengthen the 
legal framework applicable to IDPs in light of the situation in the Diffa Region. 

 

Niger is party to the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (1951 Convention), 
1967 United Nations Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees (1967 Protocol) and 1969 Organization of 
African Unity Convention Governing Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa (OAU Convention), without 
any reservations. Niger has also domesticated these instruments: the government has affirmed both in national 
legislation and at representations to the CERD that refugees are to be treated equally under the law with 
respect to all rights: property ownership, security, access to the courts, access to basic services, and freedom 
of expression and movement (CERD 2013). Article 10 of the 1997 law ensures the equal treatment of refugees 
in the protection of property; freedom of movement; and access to health, education, and housing. Elsewhere, 


the Labor Code prohibits discrimination on the basis of nationality in hiring, and Décret n° 87-
076/PCMS/MI/MAE/C of June 18, 1987, permits foreigners to be contracted for employment provided that the 
contract is approved by the Ministry of Labor. 

 

Niger is also party to the African Union Convention for the Protection and Assistance of Internally Displaced 
Persons in Africa (Kampala Convention), but has yet to domesticate it. Preliminary discussions are underway 
for the domestication of the convention and authorities have indicated willingness to improve the legal 
framework on IDPs, especially in light of the situation in the Diffa Region. Finally, Niger is signatory of both 
1954 Convention on the Status of Stateless Persons (Convention on Statelessness) and 1961 Convention on the 
Reduction of Statelessness. Efforts to align domestic legislation with the provisions of both conventions are 
underway, with an ongoing review of the domestic legislation on nationality and civil status registration. 

 

Malian refugees are recognized on a prima facie basis and enjoy a favorable protection environment with 
the right to settle where they wish and to access basic social services and the formal and informal job market. 
A tripartite agreement between UNHCR and the Governments of Niger and Mali, signed in 2014 provides a 
legal framework for voluntary returns in respect of the related international standards. The parties consider 
that the conditions in parts of northern Mali are not yet conducive to returns in safety and dignity. As a result, 
voluntary repatriation is currently not promoted. Persons that wish nevertheless to return to Mali are 
counseled on the prevailing situation and sign a Voluntary Repatriation Form. They receive one-time cash 
assistance to pay for their transport (UNHCR 2016). Out-of-camp policy applied in Malian refugee-hosted areas 
with success, leading to the creation of so-called Zones d’Accueil des Réfugiés. Several institutions work closely 
with UNHCR to process status determinations for refugees, including the Comité National d’Eligibilité (CNE), 
the Comité d’Appel, the secretariat within the Direction Générale de l'État Civil et des Réfugiés, and the Comité 
de Recours Gracieux (CRG).  Regional administrations such as those in Diffa are also key partners to the national 
government and international NGOs.  The Direction Générale de l'État Civil et des Réfugiés is in charge of 
ensuring administrative protection to refugees and asylum seekers. 

 
Relationship to CPF 

 

The CPF recognizes the need to mitigating the three negative consequences of forced displacement in Niger: 
(1) the effect on the economy of increased insecurity and the subsequent outlays on security and humanitarian 
assistance; (2) increased food insecurity (exacerbating the effects of drought, environmental degradation, high 
grain prices and poor food access); and (3) increased poverty due to the loss of productive assets (land, 
agricultural tools and inputs, seeds, animals, etc) caused by forced displacement. Specifically, within the 
objective 5 of the CPF namely “Improved Social Protection System and Ability to Manage Forced Displacement” 
the CPF includes two expected outcomes to which this operation directly contributes: 5.3 Refugees who benefit 
from a vulnerability-based assistance system and 5.4. Refugees who benefit from country systems in the health 
sector The CPF also tracks the “percentage of refugees who benefit from a vulnerability-based assistance 
system” in its Result Matrix.  

 

The successful support to displaced and host population would require synergies among the proposed project 
together with (i) the Disaster Risk Management and Urban Development project, (ii) the Safety Net Project, (iii) 


the Skills Development for Growth project and (iv) the Community Action Project – Phase 3. Each of these four 
projects target chronically poor or vulnerable households living in disadvantaged and marginal areas which 
may also overlap with areas hosting refugees. 

 
C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  
 
The project development objective is to improve access to basic social services and economic opportunities for forcibly 
displaced and host communities in select areas.

the government in leading and coordinating the overall program, inclusive of all different partner activities, in the targeted 
regions. The identification of the specific type of activities in the targeted regions will be based on a rapid Markets and 
Needs Assessment. 

 

Components 

Activities identified under the government strategy are grouped below into three main project components along the 
three resilience levels targeted for improvement: 1) community, 2) individual, and 3) local authorities.  

 

COMPONENT 1 - Community level resilience: Access to basic social services and local capacity building 

This component will aim to build resilience on the community level through investment in community infrastructure and 
services; capacity building to government authorities; and social cohesion measures.  Investments will be identified in 
consultation with communities by updating and/or preparing the Local Development Plans. Communes/communities will 
be responsible for the identification and preparation of the subproject proposals as well as the supervision of their 
implementation and operation and maintenance. Final subprojects selection and contracting will be done by the 
respective line agencies in accordance to the national planning process. 

 

This component will focus on two main types of activities: 

A. Investment in community infrastructure and services: 
1. Municipal services: Reconstructing and repairing small water supply facilities, latrines and other sanitation 

infrastructure, as well as solid waste management infrastructure and service delivery. 
2. Education: Reconstructing and repairing damaged school infrastructure such as classrooms, offices, fences, 

playground, latrines, labs, and other associated service delivery interventions. 
3. Health: Reconstructing or rehabilitating health center buildings, and other associated service delivery 

interventions in respect of staff, furniture and supplies. 
4. Economic infrastructure: Constructing or rehabilitating of rural markets, community storage facilities, rural 

roads, small bridges, culverts, and small irrigation schemes.   
5. Natural Resources: Restoring and protecting natural resources and supporting environmental management 

measures to decrease environmental impacts of protracted refugee presence. 

 

B. Community Resilience and Social Cohesion Measures: 
1. Community associations: Setting up and strengthening community associations that bring together local 

authorities (government, traditional and religious) and representatives of all different segments of the 
population in order to build and reinforce social cohesion.  

2. Small social cohesion grants: Supporting initiatives that address key drivers of the conflict and needs 
emerging in the post-conflict period such as out-of-school children and youth literacy, sports for peace 
activities, community radio programing, cultural activities that promote common identities, sexual and 
gender based violence prevention campaigns and de-stigmatization campaigns. 

3. Community-based psychosocial support: Providing targeted support to communities to address potential 
mental health risks resulting from the forced displacement experience.   

 

COMPONENT 2 - Individual level resilience: Strengthening economic opportunities and professional training 

This component will focus on two main types of activities: 

A. Transitional Support towards Stabilization and Self-Reliance by (a) increasing and improving the access to basic 
necessity kits; (b) restoring immediate access to productive assets by providing agricultural inputs and livestock 
for farming families and trading commodities for non-farmers; and (c) setting-up Cash for Work programs to 


support community assets recovery and reconstruction. The cash-for-work component activities will be closely 
linked to the priority infrastructure investments in component 1. 

B. Support to Business Development and Individual Skill Building: provision of professional education, on-the-job 
training,  “portable skills” and support of small business development opportunities for youth/women. provide a 
package of interventions that combines short-term trainings (including basic financial literacy) and accompanying 
mentoring/technical assistance, access to small matching grant, and citizen engagement mechanisms. The focus 
of skills trainings might differ between locations based on an assessment of the market and needs in the region.  

 

COMPONENT 3 - Capacity building of local authorities 

This component will focus on two main types of activities: 

A. Local planning and decentralized service delivery: Providing capacity building interventions for communes and 
local implementing institutions to ensure adequate capacities in the areas of community‐driven planning process, 
local development management, service delivery capacities enhancement, mainstreaming of project 
interventions with the government’s development planning and budgeting process, as well as coordination of all 
development stakeholders on the local level and community level. 

B. Preparedness of Government institutions to manage displacements:  Strengthening government actors to be 
more prepared for potential future displacements by supporting their administrative management capacity (i.e. 
supporting and coordinating biometric registration of population) as well as humanitarian management capacity 
(i.e. contingency planning for displacements). 

 

COMPONENT 4 - Contingency Emergency Response Component 

This contingent emergency response component is included under the project in accordance with OP/BP 10.00, 
paragraphs 12 and 13, for situations of urgent need of assistance. This will allow for rapid reallocation of project funds in 
the event natural or manmade crisis in the future, during the implementation of the project. This component will have 
no funding allocation initially, but will be used to draw resources from the unallocated expenditure category and/or allow 
the government to request the WB to reallocate financing from other project components to cover emergency response 
and recovery costs, if approved by the WB. 

 

COMPONENT 5 - Project Management 

This sub-component will cover: (a) strengthening the capacity of the Project Steering Committee for overall Project 
coordination; and (b) strengthening the capacity of the Project Implementation Unit for project management, 
coordination, monitoring and evaluation, including: (i) fiduciary (i.e. financial and procurement management); (ii) 
environmental and social assessments; (iii) preparation of project reports; and (iv) monitoring and evaluation. 

 
 
    

  SAFEGUARDS 

 
A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 

 
The specific sites for infrastructure investments and their scope will be determined during project preparation based on 

the government’s detailed assessments of priority needs within the target regions in consultation with local population 
and authorities and detailed technical studies to be undertaken. The general areas include sites hosting refugees in Diffa 
region and along the Malian border in Tillaberi, Tahoua and Agadez regions. 
 


B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 
 
The Government of Niger has previously successfully implemented Bank-financed projects for which Environmental and 

Social Impact Assessments (ESIAs), Environmental and Social Management Frameworks (ESMF), Resettlement Policy 
Frameworks (RPFs), Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) and Pest Management Plans (PMPs) were approved by the Bank.  
The Bureau des Evaluations Environnementales et des Études d’Impacts (BEEEI), the National Environmental Agency 

(NEA), and its decentralized structures, have the capacity to assure the external monitoring of the implementation of the 
of the ESMF, RPF and PMP under the project, including ensuring and validating that the provisions of the ESMF and RPF, 
leading to further sub-projects environmental and social assessments, are followed (i.e., sub-projects categorization, 
review, clearance and monitoring of the sub-project-specific EIAs/EMPs and RAPs), on behalf of the Government.  
Overall project environmental and social safeguards compliance, with national laws and regulations and applicable World 

Bank operational policies and procedures, will be devolved to BEEEI.

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

The project will rehabilitate and upgrade 
infrastructures in several locations. As the sites and 
works are not yet finalized, an Environmental and 
Social Management Framework (ESMF) will be 
prepared, consulted upon, and disclosed both in-
country and at the World Bank Website before 
appraisal. The ESMF will formulate standard methods 
and procedures, along with clear institutional 
arrangements for screening, review, approval, 
implementation and monitoring of sub-project-specific 
safeguards instruments (Environmental and Social 
Management Plans ESMPs, Environmental and Social 
Impact Assessments ESIAs) as necessary. These 
instruments will also be consulted upon and disclosed 
in-country and at World Bank Website. A Social 
Assessment will be conducted in parallel to 
complement the safeguards documents. 

Performance Standards for Private Sector 
Activities OP/BP 4.03 

No  

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 No 

Due to the location of interventions in areas were 
infrastructure and/or productive activities were 
already in place, no negative impacts to critical or 
sensitive natural habitats are expected. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No 
No interventions are financed in forest areas, nor do 
they involve forests. 




Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

Although procurement of pesticides is not envisaged 
under the project, it is expected that intensification of 
agricultural production and productivity will likely lead 
to an increased use of pesticides. 
The Government will update its existing Pest 
Management Plan and submit it to the Bank for 
clearance and then disclosure in-country and at World 
Bank website, prior to appraisal. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 Yes 

The Physical Cultural Resources Policy (OP 4.11) is 
triggered because Niger is viewed as a rich cultural 
heritage area. Though it is unknown at this time which 
sites may contain such resources, due to the lack of 
specifics on the locations, size, scale of planned 
investments under the project. Chance Find 
Procedures will be applied as indicated in the ESMF. 
The ESMF will address potential impacts and includes 
suggested mitigation measures. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 No There are no Indigenous Peoples in the project area. 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

OP 4.12 is triggered due to the potential impacts 
related to civil works, which may lead to minor land 
acquisition, loss of assets and/or access to resources. 
A Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) will be 
prepared, consulted upon, approved and disclosed in-
country and at the World Bank website prior to 
appraisal. The RPF will formulate standard methods 
and procedures, along with clear institutional 
arrangements for screening, review, approval, 
implementation and monitoring of sub-project-specific 
safeguards instruments such as Resettlements Action 
Plans (RAPs) if necesary. 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 No 

The project will not finance the building of dams and is 
not supporting dam infrastructure. Subject to 
technical studies the project may finance local flood 
prevention structures that may temporarily retain 
excess water during peak volume events, but which do 
not pose dam safety issues. 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

No 

OP 7.50 is not triggered as there are no infrastructure 
investments likely to affect water flow of Niger or 
Komadougou international waterways under the 
project. 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No 
OP 7.60 is not triggered as there are no known 
disputes over project areas.

B. Introduction and Context 

 
Country Context 

 

1. Rwanda is increasingly recognized as a global exemplar in the pursuit of the Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDG) and in meeting the global challenges of climate change. Rwanda’s economy has 
been amongst the fastest growing among the sub-Saharan African (SSA) region. Despite remaining one of 
the poorest on the continent with per capita incomes of US$1,720 (2015, in purchasing power parity 
terms) the economy is nevertheless undergoing rapid structural transformation. Overall Gross Domestic 
Product (GDP) growth has averaged 7.6 percent per annum (p.a.) over 2000 – 15, with urbanization rates 
of 7 percent p.a. over the same period. 
 

2. After slowing to 5.1 percent in 2017, real GDP growth is expected to pick up in 2018-19, 
averaging 5.9 percent, and inflation has increased above the National Bank of Rwanda’s (BNR) target 
ceiling of 5 percent.1 BNR has raised interest rates to prevent capital outflow and this will likely force a 
tightening of monetary policy in 2017 – 18. BNR has reduced the repo rate by 50 basis points to 5.5 percent 
to encourage commercial banks to lower lending rates to drive growth in private-sector credit and 
stimulate economic growth.2 Rwanda’s large current account deficit (16 percent of GDP in 2016) has been 
exerting downward pressure on the Rwandan franc (FRw). Higher oil and commodity prices (as well as 
large purchases including new planes for the national carrier) have seen the import bill increase although 
this is expected to be mitigated by recovering commodity prices in tea, coffee and minerals – Rwanda’s 
three main exports. On the fiscal side, the fiscal deficit is expected to narrow from an estimated 4.7 
percent of GDP in 2016/17 to 4.4 percent of GDP in 2018/19, financed by external project-based debt and 
some budgetary loans from development partners and multilateral institutions.3 Notwithstanding these 
emerging domestic and international trends, the overall policy stance of the Government of Rwanda (GoR) 
is likely to remain in line with the existing Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS) 
(approved in 2013) and its successor to be finalized and approved in 2018. 

 

3. Rwanda’s Vision 2050 sets an ambitious agenda for further improvements in the standard of 
living, targeting middle-income country (MIC) status by 2020. Parallel targets to reduce food insecurity 
and malnutrition and to further reduce poverty from 45 percent today (according to the national poverty 
line; the headcount rate is 63 percent according to the US$1.25 per day measure) are evidence of a deep 
political commitment to the twin goals of poverty reduction and shared prosperity. Except for a period 
between 2000/01 and 2005/06 when the Gini coefficient rose slightly, rapid growth has not been 
associated with an increase in equality. At the same time, the country has embarked on several flagship 
projects to promote a highly skilled service economy, notably around conferences and hospitality and 
information and communication technology (ICT). 

 

4. However, Government spending programs are currently under pressure. The increase in total 
public spending in 2013-2015 has been exclusively for capital expenditures and net lending as recurrent 
expenditures have held steady. The adjustment program of recent years to address growing external 
imbalances restrained the overall fiscal envelope. Health expenditures, for example, have declined both 

 
1 EUI Country Report, January 2018. 
2 ibid 
3 EUI Country Report, November 2017 



as a percent of GDP and in terms of their share in the budget in recent years. Going forward, resource 
availability will be further constrained because of a continuing decline in external grant financing. 
Although the headline fiscal deficit will be more expansionary in FY18/19, the decline in grant financing 
will continue to depress the overall fiscal envelope. Going forward, Rwanda’s fiscal spending will remain 
constrained due to the elevated debt and subdued tax revenues.  

 

5. The Government is also concerned by the emerging demographic trends and the rapidly 
expanding ambitions and expectations of new entrants to the labor market. Demographic projections 
suggest that by 2032 rural areas will be home to an additional 2.5 – 3.5 million Rwandans; land is already 
so scarce (50 percent of rural farm households farm less than 0.35ha) that few can be meaningfully 
accommodated in farming. With a working age population projected to increase from 5.2 million (in 2014) 
to 6.6 million – of which 4 million will be youth (14 – 35 years old), realizing labor productivity potential 
and meeting individual aspirations will require off-farm employment opportunities. This need not imply 
urban-based employment. Agriculture and the food system broadly (i.e. non-agriculture sector jobs 
nevertheless part of the food system such as retail, agro-processing, food logistics etc.) can provide 
substantial rural-based non-farm employment (RNFE). Current economic modeling indicates around two-
fifths of the 200,000 new labor market entrants annually could be gainfully employed in this sector.  
 

6. Continued urbanization will present many challenges as well as opportunities including for the 
agricultural sector. By 2050 Rwanda’s population is projected to reach 22 million of which 70 percent 
would reside in urban areas. Assuming similar patterns are observed elsewhere in the region, food 
preferences will change with increasing incomes, with increasing demand for more standardized and 
packaged or processed food and food safety will become increasingly important. This will threaten existing 
supply chains from domestic producers, with likely upward pressure on the food import bill and foreign 
currency reserves. At the same time, tapping into this emerging market can be an important opportunity 
for expanding domestic value chains, diversifying out of food staples and further value addition across the 
agriculture and food system. Meeting these challenges for the domestic market can also serve as a 
launching pad for successfully penetrating regional and international markets. 

 
Sectoral and Institutional Context 

7. Notwithstanding, Rwanda’s impressive progress and likely future growth, the country remains 
largely agrarian with agriculture the mainstay of jobs, income and livelihoods for much of the 
population. The sector continues to account for around one-third of GDP. Because of its forward and 
backward linkages, it remains a key driver of overall economic performance and poverty reduction 
(accounting directly for over one-third of the overall reduction in poverty from 59 percent in 2001 to 45 
percent in 2011). 
 

8. Historically, aggregate agricultural performance has been driven by productivity improvements 
and land expansion. Aggregate production of key food staples such as maize, beans, Irish potato, sweet 
potato etc. has increased steadily since the end of the Genocide. According to recent analysis by the 
International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), agriculture’s aggregate growth rate of 5 percent p.a. 
in recent years has been made up of land expansion (2 percentage points) and productivity growth (1.7 
percentage points) with the remainder from increased labor productivity. Rwanda is already among the 
most densely populated countries in SSA and land expansion has been achieved through developing inland 
swamps and valleys with rapidly declining potential for further gains.  



 

The World Bank  
Transformation of Agriculture Sector Program 4 PforR (P161876) 

 

9. Despite productivity gains, yields remain below their potential. Crop yields have greatly 
increased since 2000 but yield growth started to plateau as of 2011. (For instance, cereal and cassava 
yields have trebled, sweet potato yields have doubled yet they have made marginal progress in the last 
five years and remain at around 40 – 50 percent of their potential.) Similarly, livestock productivity has 
remained consistently low over time due to lack of good quality animal feed and poor husbandry 
management practices. Diversification into higher value crops has been limited to date, partly because of 
limited farmer knowledge and traditional risk aversion, and also because the public-sector support 
services has been excessively focused on a narrow range of food staples under the Government’s flagship 
Crop Intensification Program (CIP).  

 

10. Farm size is a major challenge.  The average is only 0.6 ha, with perhaps 0.12 ha per worker.  
Production on numerous small plots of land can impose technical inefficiencies related to water control 
and distribution, crop choice and interactions, and planting materials used, while limiting the potential 
for mechanized plowing. The government has made significant progress on land consolidation.  Land 
under consolidated use rose from 28,788 ha in 2007 to 502,916 ha in 2012, primarily through 
consolidation of production rather than of ownership (World Bank, 2014).  The consolidation process has 
not involved mandatory consolidation of ownership, and planting, cultivation and harvesting are still 
carried out by the individual land owners, albeit on a communal schedule (Pritchard, 2013).  

 

11. The agriculture value chains face key constraints at every stage. Research and extension is 
dominated by public institutions which are understaffed. There are insufficient extension services to 
support both quantity and quality, and there are weak linkages between research and extension. Input 
supply systems are driven by the public sector, there is low awareness of the advantages of quality inputs, 
domestic seed production is low and there is limited access to finance. Production potential is restricted 
by land size, subsistence and rain-fed farming, mono-cropping, limited access to irrigation and 
mechanization. Post production is impacted by poor storage techniques and insufficient storage and 
drying infrastructure and safety and quality of produce affected by poor storage and drying. Processing is 
characterized by low capacity utilization. - Less than 10 percent of total production is processed. The 
supply of raw material is irregular and limited. The agricultural workforce has a low level of technical skills. 
Finally, markets are informal and unorganized, Rwanda country branding is weak, and the price-sensitive 
domestic market poses a challenge for start ups to enter the market. 
 

12. The government has focused on extending the rural roads network with a main objective of 
connecting to regional markets and opportunities exists for scaling up regional connectivity. A 
significant proportion of Rwanda’s rural population, whose livelihoods depend on agriculture, lacks access 
to rural transport facilities, including feeder roads. In 2015, only 13,350 km of roads were in good or 
passable condition, but Rwanda targets to have 30,000 km of passable roads by 2028. Poor connectivity 
hampers agricultural development and prevents farmers from increasing access to markets, enhancing 
their competitiveness and improving their incomes and livelihoods. A national feeder roads strategy has 
been developed which establishes the Feeder Roads implementation framework with clear-cutting 
institutional responsibilities for different stakeholders in the Feeder roads sub-sector, promoting labour-
based technology in feeder roads development and outlining mechanisms for funding feeder roads 
development and maintenance. 

 

 

13.  Rwanda’s proximity to many of the continent’s key food markets and increased global/regional 
consumption for key export crops including bio-fortified staples, presents significant opportunities 
(especially through EAC and COMESA) for enlarged export markets, transport corridors and cross-border 
trade cooperation. Global and regional markets for higher-value agricultural items are also becoming 
more demanding in terms of quality, food safety, and branding, but also more remunerative. Rwanda is 
well-placed to benefit from expanding regional food markets, providing the facilitating investments in 
infrastructure and institutions are in place and the private sector responds. 

 

14. Moreover, existing farming practices are ill-suited to the challenges of climate change, with the 
agriculture sector accounting for 45.6 percent of national greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and poorly 
equipped to adapt to changing weather patterns. Climate change projections are highly uncertain, and 
so precise changes to agro-climatic conditions in what is an agro-ecologically diverse country are hard to 
predict. What is certain, however, is that the system is not yet equipped to model, forecast and adapt as 
changes occur and greater evidence becomes available to hone down climate change forecasts. According 
to a recent assessment by the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT), few climate smart 
agricultural practices are currently deployed. Current on-farm practices are leading to rapid declines in 
soil fertility and land degradation. 
 

15. In addition, Rwanda remains challenged by malnutrition especially among rural households 
with extremely small land holdings, and pervasive food insecurity. The national rate of stunting remains 
high at 38 percent while the latest Comprehensive Food Security and Nutrition Survey (2016) reports that 
around one-fifth of households remain food insecure. The pattern of stunting and food insecurity is 
complex and not only related to food availability – food insecurity is greatest in the western and northern 
areas and stunting is observed even in relatively non-poor areas due to inadequate child care and poor 
sanitation practices, in particular. A narrow focus on a few traditional food staples under the CIP resulted 
in limited dietary diversity, yet there are emerging opportunities with bio-fortification. The Government’s 
existing kitchen garden program is reportedly contributing to broader nutritional intake, although further 
improvements are required. 

 

16. In Rwanda the labor force is growing at a rapid pace annually with census projections showing 
that the working-age population will grow by about 240,000 per year between 2016 and 2025. This 
growth is substantially larger than the increase in jobs during the last 15 years. Acknowledging the 
demographic trends, the ongoing Second Five-Year Economic Development and Poverty Reduction 
Strategy (EDPRS-2) of the Government of Rwanda (GoR) has an ambitious target of creating 200,000 off-
farm jobs annually. For off-farm jobs, both the formal and informal sector will be important. The 
informal non-farm sector absorbed 70 percent of the new workers between 2006 and 2011 and will 
continue to absorb workers who seek a better living outside agriculture. Employment in the formal 
sector, while growing quickly, will remain low for the foreseeable future given it is starting from a low 
base. Even so, the sector remains important since most of the perceived ‘good’ jobs are created by the 
formal private sector. Increases in agriculture productivity and job creation in industries related to 
agriculture (agro-processing, agribusiness) will also support employment outcomes for the most 
vulnerable, unskilled workers. 

 

17. Women perform the bulk of the labor in the agriculture sector, putting in approximately 51 hours 
per week on farm and domestic duties compared to men who work 40 hours. Most women farmers lack 


the means to purchase high-quality seeds and proper storage facilities to protect their crops. Many also 
never received education on effective farming methods to increase yields and to ensure that the soil on 
their land remains healthy. This creates a cycle of subsistence farming leaving very little or no profit from 
outputs for farmers to use as a source of income or capital.  

 

18. Despite the observed growth, the non-farm enterprise sector maintains a limited presence. 
Rwanda’s non-farm enterprise sector has been growing from a small base. The number of business 
establishments has increased to 149,404 in 2014 – an increase of 18 percent since 2011 – providing 
employment to 361,901 workers in 2014. However, employment in business establishments represents 
only a small portion of overall employment in Rwanda, with agriculture still being the dominant activity. 
The enterprise sector provided employment to 6.2 percent of working-age Rwandans in 2014 (361,901 
jobs of a labor force of 5,785,000). In addition, there is a limited presence of medium- and large-sized 
private firms and vibrancy in the sector has yet to fully emerge.   

 

19. Considering these trends and projections, Rwanda is committed to identifying and addressing 
the policies, regulations, and investment areas that will stimulate inclusive productivity growth for 
broadening nutritious food production and increasing private sector investment. Furthermore, there is 
commitment across the GoR to pursue new opportunities for farm income diversification to secure further 
reductions in rural poverty, strengthen resilience against the impacts of climate change and to transform 
the dominant subsistence farming sector into a competitive and market-led agriculture sector. Their 
objectives for the food and agriculture system mirror the scale of their broader national goals in terms of 
ambition and conviction to achieve them. 

 

20. To codify these ambitions and articulate a road map to achieve them, the Ministry of Agriculture 
and Animal Resources (MINAGRI) revised and updated their National Agricultural Policy (NAP) in 2017. 
The National Agricultural Policy 2017-2030 responds to the changes facing agriculture and the food system 
nationally, regionally and globally. Under this policy, the role of government in agriculture is envisaged to 
fundamentally shift from making direct interventions in the sector – especially with a focus on production 
only – to a market enabler, thereby promoting enhanced farmer cooperation and private-sector-led 
development of the agri-food economy. The policy seeks to build upon Rwanda’s growing reputation as 
supplier of high-quality, sustainably produced agri-food products, especially for the increasingly 
demanding consumers in Africa’s growing urban centers. It places added emphasis on principles of 
resilience to changes in climate and markets and seeks to seize opportunities offered by advances in 
digitalization and information and communication technology (ICT), and to leverage these also for 
vocational-skill development and for more effective sector administration. The policy also aims to 
promote inclusion through mainstreaming preferential treatment for better participation of women and 
youth in agriculture programs and development. 
 

21. MINAGRI has prepared its fourth Strategic Plan for Agriculture Transformation (PSTA 4) which 
is an articulation of how the Government proposes to implement the updated NAP. PSTA 4 is 
structured around four Priority Areas which are well aligned to the NAP. Priority Area 1: Innovation and 
Extension focuses on improving agronomic knowledge and technology in terms of basic research and 
innovation, development of efficient proximity extension services, as well as promoting knowledge and 
skills of value chain actors; Priority Area 2: Productivity and Resilience focuses on promoting sustainable 
and resilient production systems for crops and animal resources; Priority Area 3: Inclusive markets and 



value addition seeks to improve markets and linkages between production and processing; and Priority 
Area 4: Enabling Environment and Responsive Institutions that provides the regulatory framework and 
defines and coordinates public sector involvement. In addition, although women and youth are 
mainstreamed across all priority areas, Priority Area 4 features specific measures and incentives to 
increase gender equity and to introduce skilled youth to commercial farming and jobs along the 
agricultural value chains. PSTA 4 builds on the experience of implementing the previous strategic plan 
(PSTA 3) and provides a basis for ‘future-proofing agriculture to prepare for risks such as those inherent 
in climate change, considering the constraints and opportunities of Rwanda’s demographic, 
geographical and strategic conditions. 
 

22. In addition to MINAGRI, key actors in the sector include the National Agricultural Export 
Development Board (NAEB) and the Rwanda Agriculture Board (RAB). NAEB is responsible for the 
implementation of policies and strategies for promoting and developing agricultural and livestock 
products for export. RAB is an autonomous body largely responsible for research and extension, 
strengthening the linkage with policy, and establish efficiency in service delivery through institutional 
integration in the agricultural sector.  

 

23. PSTA 4 will also be aligned to National Policies and Strategies including Vision 2050, the Third 
Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS III), and relevant sub-sector strategies. 
The EDPRS III was designed to address the Rwanda’s commitment to the SDGs, Intended Nationally 
Determined Contributions (INDC’s) on agriculture, and the Paris Climate Agreement.  The African Union 
has confirmed that PSTA 4 is aligned with goals of Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development 
Program (CAADP) and key regional programs. 

 

24. The proposed Program for Results (PforR) operation will be nested within PSTA 4. PSTA 4 is in 
the final stages of approval – led by a core team within MINAGRI and benefiting from a broad group of 
development partners, including the World Bank and CAADP institutions. PSTA 4 has been endorsed by 
the GoR and will be formally approved at the CAADP Business Meeting on May 15, 2018. Reflecting 
emerging best-practice with PforR operations, the specifics of the PforR Program are drawn from the 
broader PSTA 4 and nested within the Government’s strategy. 

 
PforR Program Scope 

 

25. The responsibility of agriculture public sector institutions, and of MINAGRI in particular, to lead 
the national transformation process outlined in PSTA 4 is clear. The achievement of this transformative 
agenda will require intense policy work with a particular focus on how to promote and support 
agribusiness at all stages of key value chains while balancing commercialization with the consideration of 
poverty reduction and environmental sustainability in a complex, dynamic and risk prone national and 
regional context. The nature of this leadership will be less through the direct delivery of service but will 
be through “thought leadership”, problem solving, policy definition, capacity building, joint enterprise or 
strategic partnership, resource mobilization, regulation, coordination, information management and 
communication. 

 

26. There have been several organizational reviews of agriculture sector institutions as well as review 
and reform exercises intended to inform the transformation of the public sector as a whole.  In addition, 
 

various reports and evaluations, including the 2016 Agriculture Public Expenditure Review and the 2017 
Mid Term Review of the PSTA 3 Strategy have raised significant issues of an institutional nature.  
Furthermore, recent sub sectoral reports or strategies including the Agriculture Finance Diagnostic and 
the National Agribusiness Investment Promotion Strategy (NAIPS) make clear the need for institutional 
reform.  

 

27. The PforR Program has incorporated the recommendations from these reviews and studies into 
its design.  In addition, the design draws on the lessons learned from previous attempts to build capacity 
within MINAGRI, including the first PforR Program. Specifically, the attempts to undertake reforms 
without significant attention to a well design reform process, sustainably addressing Human Resource 
constraints, ensuring communication/coordination are prioritized and ensuring new ways of working are 
well designed and appropriately incentivized.  As a result, the PforR Program makes a sequenced, focused 
and results based approach to the institutional change process central to its design.  

 

28. The scale and complexity of PSTA 4’s institutional reform agenda is significant. However, it will 
take time for MINAGRI to fully establish and strategically apply its “thought leadership” capacity.  Many 
of the expected outcomes will only be fully delivered, at the required scale, during the latter years of PSTA 
4 implementation. In that context, the PforR Program, which supports the first three years of PSTA 4, is 
focused on a series of mutually reinforcing interventions -  some of which are activities, that will deliver 
intermediate outcomes but, more importantly, incentivize organizational reform, create new policy 
instruments, build increased capacity, and establish new systems that will build a sound institutional 
platform to enable MINAGRI to deliver PSTA 4. 
 

29. The proposed PforR operation will support the first three years (2018 – 2021) of the six-year 
strategy of the PSTA 4 (2018-2024). This period of PSTA 4 is focused on establishing a platform for change 
and new ways of working, including the way MINAGRI is structured and reflecting the way it is more 
private sector facing.  

 

30. There is a possibility of supporting the final three years through additional financing, subject and 
without prejudice to normal Bank approval procedures. The activities to be supported under the PforR 
Program correspond to the MINAGRI PSTA 4 agenda. In this context, the focus of the proposed PforR 
operation will be on strengthening the capacity of MINAGRI to increase private sector investment and to 
enable the commercialization of key agriculture value chains in Rwanda’s agriculture sector. Based on 
value chain diagnostics (further elaborated in the technical assessment ANNEX 4) and taking into 
consideration the Bank’s comparative advantage regarding the PSTA 4 Priority areas, the PforR Program 
is constructed around an organizing framework of the following four results areas: 
 

31. Results Area 1: Policy and Organizational Reform – aligned with PSTA 4 Priority Area 4: The PforR 
Program will seek to improve the structure and capability of MINAGRI in order to strengthen sector 
analysis, associated policy reforms and design/introduce relevant financing mechanisms/business models 
for attracting private sector investment. MINAGRI will demonstrate this new capacity by producing a 
Private Sector Leveraging Strategy to guide processes that will leverage private sector financing, while 
ensuring environmental and social standards are maintained. In addition, the foundations for digital data 
systems will be launched to improve management information and enable greater innovation. 
Furthermore, a new mechanism will be established to enable greater interagency coordination (including 

 

key stakeholders such as Ministry of Trade, Financial sector actors, etc.) and communication.   
 

32. Results Area 2: Enabling Agric Commercialization - aligned with PSTA 4 Priority Area 4:  The 
second PforR Results Area focuses on specific interventions to improve the quality of public investments 
in essential value chain services to leverage commercial agriculture. This includes key areas such as 
infrastructure and research, by introducing new business models that will link public investments to 
commercial markets and leverage increased levels private sector investments. PSTA 4 advocates for 
maximizing the effectiveness and efficiency of public investment by leveraging increased private sector 
investment in service provision and delivery/management of agricultural infrastructure. 
 

33. Results Area 3: Delivery of Improved Agric Value Chain Services - aligned with PSTA 4 Priority 
Areas 3 & 4.  The PforR Program will support fostering competitive agricultural value chains, which 
requires the public sector to provide critical services to support production, processing, logistics, 
marketing and the like. This approach is consistent with MFD principles.  The public function supported 
by the PforR Program is to introduce and accelerate the expansion of services that de-risk agricultural 
investments by improving dialogue between private and public actions, increasing the use of private 
sector service delivery (e.g. out-grower schemes and productive partnerships), and expanding access to 
information and financial services. These measures will help achieve a key anticipated outcome from PSTA 
4 and will improve productivity and inclusiveness of agricultural market systems and increase value 
addition and competitiveness of diversified agricultural commodities, for domestic, regional, and 
international markets. 

 

34. Results Area 4: Efficiency in Public Expenditures - aligned with PSTA 4 Priority Area 4. The PforR 
Program seeks to incentivize the dual approach of supporting: (i) a very specific action that demonstrates 
improved efficiency in public expenditure of the core delivery agency RAB; and (ii) a more general effort 
to improve the overall expenditure among the three main agencies that account for the largest share of 
sector expenditure. Since RAB is the agency responsible for key services, improvements in the budget 
execution system will be undertaken with the goal of improving their delivery function. Standards for 
budget execution help to maximize the impact of government spending and the ability to meet such 
standards signals weaknesses that undermines value for money. It also undermines the argument for 
additional public resources since there are associated concerns over malfeasance in execution that render 
MINECOFIN reluctant to allocate additional resources. Previous audits of RAB have not been approved 
because of non-compliance in several important areas. Prior qualified audits have highlighted in detail 
where weaknesses lie and both agencies are aware of where improvements are needed. 

 

35. The implementation of the program will be sequenced.  Specifically, under Result Area 1 MINAGRI 
will develop and seek approval for a Private Sector Leveraging Strategy (with sections on selection criteria 
for private investments, contract governance, and environmental/social management).   Approval of the 
Private Sector Leveraging Strategy will enable MINAGRI to focus on the delivery of Result Areas 2 and 3.  
 

36. The Boundaries of the PforR Program are summarized below in Table 2

37. The Program boundary for PforR financing provides a clear strategic focus to the PforR Program.  
There are areas of PSTA 4 that will not be covered by the PforR Program.  These areas include the 
following: 
 

a. improved soil health and fertility  
b. conservation of biodiversity  
c. skills development 
d. animal resources and production systems  
e. nutrition sensitive agriculture 
f. mechanisms for resilience 
g. quality assurance  
h. knowledge management 

 

38. The rationale for not incorporating these areas in the PforR Program includes the following:  a) 
MINAGRI is in the process of securing both public and external resources for these areas (including 
regional IPF and GASFP), b) these areas are unlikely to provide an equivalent transformation impact and 
c) a number of these areas (e.g. mechanisms for resilience and quality assurance) could not be effectively 
supported by a PforR Program.  

 

39. The PforR Program and its sub-components aim to tackle identified climate risks and 
vulnerabilities as follows: 

• Policy and Organizational Reform. Currently MINAGRI has limited capacity to fulfil its mandate 
in policy development, inter-sector and intra- sector coordination, resource mobilization and 
M&E. The PforR Program will support improving the capability of MINAGRI to properly 
address policy challenges and direct public investments across all GoR. This new capacity will 
result in strengthen regulatory institutions and policies (including rules and regulations) which 
reduce the emissions of GHGs in the agriculture, fishing, livestock, and/or forestry sectors (a 
PAP action), improvements in data management of weather monitoring systems. 

 

• Improved coordination with relevant agencies and actors. The primary focus for the PforR 
Program is to support MINAGRI in becoming a stronger market enabler.  Improving 
interagency working and coordination is a requirement in this process. This improved capacity 
for sectoral collaboration will also be applied toward tackling climate risks and vulnerabilities. 

• Commercialization of the delivery of key public goods and services. Most agriculture in 
Rwanda is practiced on steep slopes prone to erosion during the rainy season. While 
considerable progress has been made in constructing robust “bench” (wide) terraces, much 
more needs to be done to secure the land asset.  The PforR Program will support, via the 
efficient use of public funds and leveraged private investments, the restoration and 
conservation of productive landscapes.

DLI 4: Mechanism 

to strengthen 

public private

Commodity value chain platforms (year 1) 

• Two national PPDs held and at least 3 VC 
platforms established with operating plans 
(year 2) 

• Additional 2 PPDs held (year 3) 

• VC platforms are fully functional and yielded 
evidence of satisfactory results (as per M&E of 
operating plan) (year 3) 
 

A stronger dialogue between the 

Public and Private Sector 

(including farmer associations 

and other stakeholders) will 

allow for knowledge exchange 

and greater awareness of climate 

risks, and will encourage greater 

consensus and innovation on 

how (exposure to) risks and

The DLI will help to promote new financing 

mechanisms.  Only investments fully committed 

are included in the measure. 

• 4,000,0000 US$ or more (year 2) 

• 7,150,000 US$ or more (year 3) 

Investments will be targeted 

towards infrastructure (e.g. 

greenhouses, drying areas, etc.) 

that is designed to reduced the 

vulnerability of crop storage 

facilities to climate change and 

climate variability. 

 

This investment will also support 

the creation of infrastructure 

that will support improved 

business continuity during and 

after extreme weather events. 

DLI 7: Private 

sector service 

models designed, 

launched and 

achieving positive 

response    

• 6,000 farm households reached by private 
advisory services (non-outgrower scheme) 
(year 2) 

• 8,0000 additional farm households reached by 
private advisory services (non-outgrower-
schemes (year 3) 

• 10,0000 new farm household participating in 
outgrower schemes (Year 3)  

Reduction in the reliance on 

public sector as the key service 

provide will enable MINAGRI to 

refocus resources towards 

supporting farmers who have 

fewer resources to manage 

climate-related risks

40. Role of the Development Partners.  MINECOFIN and MINAGRI will be mobilizing resources to 
finance PSTA 4.  There are indications that DFID, EU, IFAD, and USAID will be providing finance via project 
based financing or programmatic financing. 
 
41. DFID is considering providing support for the PforR Program. Once this is confirmed, the most 
appropriate mechanism for their co-financing will be established (i.e., parallel financing, co-financing, 
establishment of a multi-donor trust fund, etc.). To the extent that other development partners (DPs) 
participate in co-financing the PforR Program, it is understood that their funding would need to fit in the 
overall program envelope under PforR financing and would be allocated to the same DLIs, according to a 
similar pattern of distribution (in agreement with the Common Framework of Engagement (CFE)) of the 


MDTF, following all existing procedures of the PforR instrument (i.e., DLIs, verification protocols, PAP, 
Program Implementation). 
 
42. DFID, EU, IFAD, USAID, FAO and the Netherlands will continue to provide Technical Assistance 
(TA) to address the recognized capacity gaps within MINAGRI. These DPs are planning to continue TA 
support over the implementation of PSTA 4.  These same DPs are also part of the Agriculture Sector 
Working Group (ASWG), which provides an important forum to coordinate the complementarity of TA 
interventions, also as part of the annual planning and budgetary processes. Discussions are underway to 
explore the most appropriate modalities to be followed by these DPs, including co-financing the PforR 
operation. Having multiple DPs finance the PforR operation would streamline and reduce transaction 
costs for the Ministry by having one mechanism with agreed upon results and a common set of DLIs. It 
would also simplify the financing to support strategic results, whether policies, impacts, outcomes, and/or 
outputs. DPs who wish to provide co-financing under the proposed PforR operation will follow the same 
procedures as the PforR Program. 

 

C. Proposed Program Development Objective(s)  
 

Program Development Objective(s) 
  
To improve the capacity of selected public agricultural institutions and to enable an increase in commercialization of 
agriculture value chains in Rwanda  
 
 
D. Environmental and Social Effects 

 
43. The physical activities planned under this PforR Program follow the scope and nature of 
activities implemented under the previous PforR operation, and moderate adverse environmental and 
social impacts are anticipated to be site-specific and reversible. Identified impacts can be effectively 
mitigated, based on existing environmental and social systems and the solid recent track record of the 
implementing agencies compliance with both national legislation and World Bank safeguards. No 
anticipated Program activities are judged likely to have significant adverse impacts on the environment 
and/ or affected people that are sensitive, diverse, or unprecedented. However, it is recognized that the 
key sector intuitions, such as, MINAGRI and RAB will require significant capacity building to enhance E&S 
systems and staffing to ensure effective implementation and monitoring of not only public sector, but 
also PPP initiatives.  The capacity enhancement efforts for MINAGRI are included in the PforR operation, 
supported by other Donors. Based on the introduction of the new instruments and new types of 
collaboration with the private sector, the overall environmental and social risks of the PforR Program are 
proposed to be rated as Substantial. 
 

44. The previous PforR operation had several notable achievements, such as the development of a 
consolidated Environmental and Social Implementation Manual based on existing government 
guidelines; and national and district level capacity building on the application of the Manual and the 
establishment of a grievance redress call center. 
 

45. The update of the ESSA is still ongoing to incorporate a sample of the private sector entities and 



assess the environmental and social systems as they are applied for potential PPP projects, especially 
focusing on Results Area 2: Enabling Agricultural Commercialization and Results Area 3: Delivery of 
Improved Agric Value Chain Services. 
 

46. Environmental Effects. The PforR Program may include small scale irrigation schemes, similar in 
scale to sub-projects under the IDA-financed Rural Sector Support Project (RSSP; phases 1 – 3), located 
in existing sites of agricultural land use, do not involve large-scale resettlement, and consist of land 
husbandry works (e.g., terracing); drainage canals and/ or dams that are not higher than 10m; post-
harvest infrastructure, markets, and community storage facilities. Based on the experience with 
implementation of support to PSTA III, the potential environmental impacts of Program activities are 
generally well known and understood by implementing authorities at the national and local levels. 
Under the previous PforR operation, MINAGRI has adopted an Environmental and Social Management 
System based on the internationally accepted best practices and more specifically, based on 
implementation of other donor-funded projects, including Bank-financed RSSP and the Land Husbandry, 
Water Harvesting and Hillside Irrigation (LWH) project. This system includes national small dam safety 
guidelines, integrated pest management plans, environmental assessments and grievance redress 
mechanisms database. It is expected that the identified environmental impacts can be: (i) avoided 
through a careful site selection process, which entails conducting feasibility studies, an environmental 
impact assessment (EIA), and social screening; and (ii) reduced with diligent monitoring of 
implementation of known and demonstrated mitigation measures. At the same time, the Program will 
have a number of environmental benefits, including (i) a soil conservation and land husbandry program 
that will contribute to more sustainable land and water management and decreased erosion; and (ii) soil 
fertility management, and advance research and seed production, which will improve agricultural 
practices and increase food security in the country. 
 

47. Social Effects. No significant changes in land use or large-scale land acquisition are expected 
from the proposed PforR. The Program continues to pay specific attention to its potential social impacts, 
based on the practices established under previous PforR operation. These include: a chance of moderate 
physical resettlement and/ or land acquisition related to Program interventions and temporary 
displacement due to land husbandry works; challenges of identifying relocation sites due to the limited 
land availability; loss of income from land due to demarcation of buffer zones; potential for limitations 
on access to natural resource use in or around protected areas; consolidation of land use; acquisition of 
land for agro-processing and off-farm activities; benefit sharing of commercial farming if land is rented; 
male capture of community institutions; obstacles for women and youth participation; difficulty of 
purchasing agriculture inputs for the very poor due to their limited access to micro finance; conflict over 
land ownership and use; and weak participatory decision making and lack of transparency. The Program 
is also expected to have significant social benefits for the rural communities in the target areas, such as 
increased productivity and commercialization of agriculture and improved quality and accessibility of 
agricultural services, thus improving citizens’ incomes and overall welfare and quality of life, especially 
for the rural poor and vulnerable. Based on the approach established during implementation of other 
Bank-supported operations, the Program targets farmer groups with specific attention to gender issues, 
including in group and cooperative leadership, inclusion of vulnerable groups, and training in conflict 
resolution and family welfare.  
 

48. Sustainability. Ensuring environmental and social sustainability of Program investments requires 




mainstreaming sustainability planning at all levels of the government, including the continuous 
participation of target communities. Currently, the challenge for the sector institutions under the 
Program is to ensure that decentralized decision making, transparency, and accountability are 
institutionalized to enhance sustainability of investments. This need has been recognized by MINAGRI, 
RAB and participating private sector entities and will receive support from the DPs.  
 

49. Capacity. Institutional arrangements for environmental management, including ESIAs, are 
mandated and established at all levels of government. The legal/regulatory procedures and policies for 
expropriation of land in the country adequately respond to the relocation and compensation for loss of 
assets, services, homes, and land. However, a common challenge is the ineffective implementation of 
these requirements and responsibilities due to lack of institutional capacity and financial resources at 
the local level. The assessment of specific capacity of the private sector is ongoing, however, more 
coordination efforts will need to be made by MINAGRI to ensure effective compliance monitoring of the 
PPP interventions. The capacity-building program will continue from the previous phase and focus on 
improving the environmental and social management practices among the government agencies and 
private sector organizations, including in the areas of: (i) implementation and oversight of the 
environmental and social assessment system within the Program; (ii) sustainability aspects of site 
selection and technical designs of the land husbandry and irrigation activities; (iii) documentation of 
involuntary resettlement and project-affected people and vulnerability assessments, including, where 
necessary, preparation of resettlement action plans (RAPs); (iv) screening of potential environmental 
and social impacts and public consultation; (v) enhancing gender-sensitive capacity building of local and 
national staff and service providers and gender responsiveness in agricultural service delivery; and (vi) 
good monitoring practices, including proactive use of grievance redress mechanisms; sampling of soil 
and water quality, and others.  
 

50. OP 7.50 on International Waterways is triggered as the Program activities will involve water 
extraction for irrigation activities from the streams flowing into international basins of the Nile and Lake 
Tanganyika. Following the practice of the RSSP (phases 1-3), the Bank has notified riparian states as part 
of Program preparation. The Bank has assessed, however, that the proposed activities under the 
Program will not result in any adverse impacts to the riparian countries. Irrigation development and land 
husbandry are not expected to have adverse impacts on water quality levels. Even though agricultural 
intensification and increased use of agricultural inputs are objectives of the Program, pre-Program input 
use levels are very low, and modest increases and sustainability measures built into the Program design 
are not expected to have an adverse impact on water quality. In addition, environmental and pest 
management plans are routinely implemented in the Program to mitigate such impacts to minimal 
levels. The PforR Program will not have any adverse effects on the quantity or quality of water flows to 
any other riparian states. 
 

51. Communities and individuals who believe that they are adversely affected as a result of a Bank 
supported PforR operation, as defined by the applicable policy and procedures, may submit complaints 
to the existing program grievance redress mechanism or the WB’s Grievance Redress Service (GRS). The 
GRS ensures that complaints received are promptly reviewed in order to address pertinent concerns. 
Affected communities and individuals may submit their complaint to the WB’s independent Inspection 
Panel which determines whether harm occurred, or could occur, as a result of WB non-compliance with 
its policies and procedures. Complaints may be submitted at any time after concerns have been brought 




directly to the World Bank's attention, and Bank Management has been given an opportunity to 
respond.  For information on how to submit complaints to the World Bank’s corporate Grievance 
Redress Service (GRS), please visit http://www.worldbank.org/GRS. For information on how to submit 
complaints to the World Bank Inspection Panel, please visit www.inspectionpanel.org

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 

 

The intersection of land management, rights, and use forms the key development issue for millions of rural 

Ethiopians facing water insecurity, food insecurity, land tenure insecurity, and livelihood insecurity – all 

amplified by climate variability and change. Climate impacts in Ethiopia are felt primarily through water stress, 

which is affected by land use and degradation that undermines watershed function. In Ethiopia, the estimated 

cost of land degradation is 2-3% of GDP, before accounting for downstream affects, such as increased flood risk.  

The proven remedy centers on delivering a combination of better natural resource management and resource 

rights, jobs and livelihood enhancements, and gender outreach throughout targeted major watersheds. 

Restoration effects include a range of resilience-related results, including increased soil moisture and soil fertility 

important for higher and less variable crop yields, improved water availability, and increased carbon 

sequestration – all of which are high priorities for the government.   

 

Much progress has been made by the government and thousands of local communities to address these challenges 

through proven investment packages financed by the World Bank. However, this work requires more innovation, 

more financing, more coordination, and much greater scale if the country is to meet its resilience and low carbon 

objectives while achieving middle income status in less than 10 years as planned. 
 

 
 

Sectoral and Institutional Context 
 

The World Bank has been financing Ethiopia’s Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources (MOANR) 

in six regional states to transform the way landscapes are managed by convening sectors, resources and partners 

(IDA, Norway, Canada, Germany, GEF, LDCF) to invest in a holistic and coordinated fashion. With financing 

from IDA through the Second Sustainable Land Management Project (SLMP-2), natural and economic wealth is 

being built on over 1.3 million hectares of degraded communal and smallholder lands through an integrated 

package of activities throughout targeted watersheds that include (i) management of natural resources (soil and 

water conservation structures, agroforestry, participatory forest management, enclosures to reduce free grazing 

and allow assisted natural regeneration, small irrigation, water point development, climate-smart technologies on 

household farmland, and land use planning approaches), (ii) improved land rights through issuance of legal 

landholding certificates to one million people, including landless youth, and (iii) livelihoods support including 

for improved cookstove adoption that reduces women’s labor,  respiratory illnesses, and fuelwood demand.  

 

Results from SLMP-2 financing are well documented in 135 major watersheds in 135 woredas (districts) in the 

six highland regional states during a major drought. Water and food security are boosted. Approximately 9 million 

tons of additional CO2e will have been accumulated in restored productive lands – a proxy for system function 

as well as a contribution to climate change mitigation over 4-5 years. Degraded lands are brought back into 

production for local farmers. Dry season base flow of streams and depth to water table are improving. And, 

protective vegetation cover was either maintained or expanded, as verified by remote sensing. A short video of 

the SLMP-2 approach and achievements is available here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nak-

UUZnvPI&t=1s.  Smallholder farmers regularly express how their identity and sense of place has also been 

restored through landscape restoration and improved legal resource rights. Many community members who were 



ready to migrate remained in their birthplace. Afterwards, they could send their children to school. They could 

increase nutrition by combining forage and livestock management, produce vegetables and fruits using small-

scale irrigation, and diversify with poultry, apiculture, and woodlot production. Moreover, local people 

established community watershed teams to discuss natural resource problems and opportunities, plan and 

implement interventions on the ground in an empowered, participatory manner.  

 

This transformative approach contributes to key national strategies, including the Growth and Transformation 

Plan-2 (GTP-2), the Climate Resilient Green Economy (CRGE) Strategy, and accompanying 2015 Climate 

Resilience Strategy for Agriculture and Forest, Ethiopia’s Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC), 

the Ethiopia SLM Investment Framework, the emerging National Forest Sector Strategy and National REDD+ 

Strategy, as well as sector strategies for energy, water, and agriculture.  

 

With support from the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience and the BioCarbon Fund, the Bank is further 

supporting the government’s CRGE Facility and four line ministries led by the finance ministry to develop a 

Multi-Sector Investment Plan (MSIP) for climate resilient production landscapes, while taking into account 

relevant activities on water resources, irrigation, and energy. 
 

 
 

Relationship to CPF 
 

The operation features in the Bank’s CPF for FY 17-21 as a government flagship addressing the CPF’s 

resilience pillar, with a funding commitment from IDA-18 for US$100 million. It would leverage and scale up 

support to the MOANR’s proven Sustainable Land Management Program while also contributing to the climate, 

forest, water, energy, and land tenure targets in the client’s GTP-2 and CRGE Strategy as well as the 

forthcoming GTP-3.   
 
 
C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  

 

 
 

To improve livelihoods, climate resilience, carbon storage, and land productivity in vulnerable rural major 

watersheds. 

 

Key Results (From PCN) 
 
10 million hectares restored, supporting at least 20 million people facing increasing food, land tenure and water 

insecurity, and accumulating at least 20 million tons of CO2e per year after restoration.  

 

PDO level indicators: 

 
     

1. Land area with sustainable landscape management practices (Ha)  

1a. Communal land area treated for degradation (degraded hillsides, gullies, PFM, pastures) (ha)  

1b. Individual farmland area treated for productivity improvements (Ha)  

2. Total land area restored or reforested/afforested on both individual and communal land (Ha)  

3. Incremental carbon dioxide equivalent accumulated in the project area (metric tons)  

3a. Biomass in the intervention areas (Tons/Ha)  

4. Land area of the targeted micro watersheds with vegetation increase of at least 4% compared to baseline (Ha) 

 

Bottom 40: Ethiopia’s poorest citizens will benefit from the operation since they are the ones who are dependent on land 

resources for their livelihoods, and are highly vulnerable to climate shocks that good natural resource management and 

improved tenure security can mitigate – as proven in SLMP-2 interventions. 

 

A note on scale: These results imply that 300-1000 major watersheds are targeted, expanding from the current 135 major 

watersheds targeted in the Bank-financed SLMP-2 and just over 100 major watersheds targeted by parallel external 

financing. Interventions in 1000 major watersheds in turn implies an expansion of financing from the current 

approximately $250m for the current SLM Program (Bank and parallel financing together) to approximately $883m in 

total financing, or approximately $800,000 per major watershed depending on the package of interventions selected and 

the amount of blended and parallel financial and technical support provided by partner projects. Bilateral and multi-

lateral co-financiers are interested in significantly leveraging IDA. 

 
 
D. Concept Description 

 
A critical mass of watershed restoration is within reach, but more must be done. MOFEC and MOANR aim to scale up and 

enhance the success of its proven flagship, the Sustainable Land Management Program, for which the Bank has been the 

largest and leading financier. The government has also requested the World Bank to be a GCF delivery partner for large-

scale impact, building on our mutual track record of delivery on the ground, and to convene financing from a variety of 

sources to be truly transformative at very large scale.  

 

The $100m of IDA would be blended with bilateral financing, Green Climate Fund (GCF), Global Environment Facility 

(GEF), plus additional sources of financing currently under discussion, would provide a large and strategic financing 

package to support Ethiopia, through its existing proven Sustainable Land Management Program (SLMP), to reach a 

critical mass of 10 million restored hectares of climate-vulnerable degraded watersheds upon which an estimated 20 

million people directly depend, and which could store an estimated 20 million tons of CO2e per year after restoration.  

An indirect spill over effect of replication would also occur in neighbouring watersheds, as is happening already. Reaching 

this critical mass would be a true transformative achievement, one that has started and built momentum over the years 

but requires institutions, investments, and financing models with a track record of getting to scale -- and with the right 

combination of integrated, well-monitored interventions.  

 

But it is not only about scale. Specific enhancements to the package of interventions are needed to reduce climate risks 

and sustain impact. For example:  



 

• Improved technologies are critical to reduce variability of crop productivity in the face of more extreme and 

frequent droughts, floods, and storms. As part of SLMP’s innovative landscape approach to achieve climate 

resilient productivity, a proven technique in the field ready for scaling is based on use of seeds from Ethiopian 

indigenous land races instead of imported improved varieties. Ethiopian wheat and barley varieties have seen 

approximately 60% yield improvements in the face of drought in actual farmers’ fields. This proven approach of 

deploying Ethiopia’s own genetic crop diversity for drought risk management needs to be brought to more farmers 

in the context of successful models of watershed re-vegetation and restoration and the government’s seed and 

extension system. 

• Information modernization and dissemination: improved meteorological, hydrological, and early warning systems 

are being developed, but the “last mile” of connecting improved weather information with farmers via the 

extension system and mobile phones needs to be strengthened for more timely planning and planting. 

• Small scale irrigation infrastructure is being put in place in restored watersheds and can be enhanced with PV and 

wind water pumps that displace diesel options. Resilient rural roads that also serve as water harvesting structures 

can expand from small pilots to national reach. 

• Innovative measures that integrate land management with land rights can reduce climate risks especially water 

stress. The Bank has financed a proven scheme to provide landholding certificates, inputs, and extension to 

landless youth in exchange for restoring degraded communal land, such as through terracing plus fruit tree or 

plantation outgrower schemes. 15,000 youths have been reached and this could grow to 100,000 in a new 

operation – alleviating urban migration driven partially by risks from land degradation and climate variability. 

• Innovative financing models such as the Bank’s “Performance for Results (P4R)” are proven in Ethiopia’s urban 

space and the selective use of Disbursement Linked Indicators (DLIs) in this IPF could, for example, help incentivize 

rapid, transformative expansion of the issuance of landholding certificates that are important for farmer 

reinvestment in land resource and adaptation. 

• Smart targeting of watershed restoration can expand the lifetime and resilience of key infrastructure including 

reservoirs for hydropower and irrigation. 

• Focusing on generating income streams from value and supply chain development from restored watersheds. An 

example is a large-scale commercial brewery made economically viable because a major restored watershed now 

provides cleaner and more consistently available water in a semi-arid highland setting. Another example is 

cookstoves, which according to a rigorous impact evaluation by the World Bank’s DEC and the Ethiopia 

Development Research Institute, significantly reduces fuelwood demand and deforestation. It also was shown by 

the SLMP-2 community reinvestment clubs to reduce women’s and girls’ fuelwood collection time from 3.5 hours 

to half an hour per day while reducing indoor air pollution, and saving up to 3h of cooking time per session and 

decreased fuel collection time by 1/3. Women also started to produce injera (bread) and sell it to the community. 

• More than 33,000 fuel saving stoves has been distributed or sold to households.  This figure could reach into the 

hundreds of thousands -- and solar lighting could also be included which has very high demand -- if a focused 


effort were made to bridge the last mile of distribution via women-managed local enterprise development. A shift 

to ethanol stoves could be prioritized. 

 

In line with the above and underpinned by extensive World Bank analytical work and investment experience on forest, 

climate-smart agriculture, household energy, land tenure, watershed management and landscape restoration, the new 

Resilient Landscapes project financed by IDA, GCF and others would provide large-scale coordinated financial support to 

the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources (MoANR) and its acclaimed Sustainable Land Management Program to 

make a lasting impact at very large scale.  

 

The Project would be implemented by the government based on sound, proven principles centred on: 

 

• Crowding in activities spatially to comprehensively investment in each targeted major watershed 

• Knowledge disseminated across communities by leveraging a large-scale program, 

• Improving agro-ecological, hydrological and climate information services and extension, 

• Empowered participatory approaches to community watershed management and livelihoods activities,  

• Better land use planning and policy combining bottom-up and top-down approaches informed by a stronger 

evidence base,  

• Mechanisms for deciding on more optimal trade-offs of sector objectives in the landscape,  

• Household energy solutions that impact land use, climate, jobs, women, health and education, 

• Legal land tenure security, and  

• Strengthened government and community institutions to coordinate and deploy investment, information, 

incentives, and income-generating opportunities. 

 

Strategic options for scaling up:  

 

1. Continue toward “full treatment” of existing 135 major watersheds in SLMP-2 and 18 major watersheds 

supported by Canada; 

2. Expand treatments to neighboring major watersheds in existing SLMP woredas, based on degradation/climate 

hotspots; 

3. Expand to neighboring major watersheds in new neighboring woredas, based on degradation/climate hotspots; 

4. Expand to Afar and Somali regional states -- perhaps a handful of western border woredas to pilot, if the 

additional GCF resources or other significant financial resources materialize;  

5. Combination of the above. 

 

Project Components 

 
Component 1. Investment in Green Infrastructure for Resilient Watersheds ($70 million IDA, others TBD).  

This component would scale-up proven sustainable land and water management practices by rural smallholders and 

communities in large watersheds (average 10,000 ha each) vulnerable to climate variability and change, recurrent drought 

and floods, and land degradation. Investment would support communal and individual lands as well as supporting 

infrastructure such as rural roads and small bridges.  Proven climate-smart practices include: soil and water conservation 

infrastructure such as terraces, small irrigation, and water harvesting trenches, check dams, small reservoirs, and other 

civil works; soil fertility and moisture management; assisted natural regeneration, enclosures plus livestock land use 

rationalization, intercropping, low tillage, gully reclamation, establishing grazing corridors, watering points and wells, 

sylvo-pastoral strategies, etc. Government Development Agents in the Bureaus of Agriculture would mobilize and support 

communities and receive continuous training to ensure quality extension. It is also important to enhance the 

interconnectivity of natural resources, which would be supported through land use planning in targeted watersheds where 

green corridors would be established to link fragmented forests, water bodies, key habitats, and rehabilitated micro 

watersheds (km). 

There would be three sub-components: 

Sub-component 1.1. Land restoration and watershed management ($40 million IDA, others TBD).  Described above. 

Sub-component 1.2. Climate-smart agriculture ($20 million IDA, others TBD). Described above. 

Sub-component 1.3. Income Opportunities and Resilient Livelihoods ($10 million IDA, others TBD). This sub-

component would finance advisory services and investment to improve access to and implementation of income 

generating activities.  These activities will help address the issue of landless/jobless youth/women and the 

resulting increased stress on the natural resource base and its potential to reduce climate risks.  Interventions 

could potentially include: 

• Ethanol and improved cookstove and solar home lighting promotion via women-managed local enterprise 

development, to close the last mile in distributing low carbon household technologies that also reduce 

land and water degradation; 

• Support to self-help groups, cooperatives and community unions such as vocational training for jobs, 

identification of business opportunities and preparation of related business plans for natural resource 

based community enterprises or others; 

• Organization of related consultation workshops, private sector forums, exhibitions/fairs;  

• Preparation of marketing strategies and sales promotions, manuals/guidelines;  

• Facilitation of access for technology, market information, credit, standard certification services; 

• Facilitate access to markets and fair trade opportunities; 

• Facilitate opportunities for international foundations and private sector engagement; and 

• Construction of warehouses, stores, product processing and workshops.   

Component 2. Strengthening Institutions and Information: and information modernization (US$ 10 million IDA, others 

TBD). This component would enhance production and management of -- and access to -- relevant environmental, climate, 

hydrological, crop, livestock, forest, geospatial, and weather information for land use decision making and disaster risk 

reduction at the levels of major watersheds, community watersheds, and farms. Land use planning (supported under 

Component 3) would be informed by vulnerability mapping and climate profiling, which would in turn be used to develop 

or update watershed plans and farm planning (under Component 1) by incorporating climate smart agricultural techniques 

financed under Component 1.  Component 2 would also support rigorous independent impact evaluations through a 

partnership arrangement between the MOANR, the Ethiopia Development Research Institute’s Environment and Climate 

Research Center, the World Bank’s Development Research Group, and the Africa Gender Lab for Impact Evaluation. 

Component 3. Land administration and use (US$ 10 million IDA, others TBD). In the same targeted watersheds in 

component 1, this component would (i) improve the legal land tenure security of rural households and groups through 

land certification and administration, and (ii) expand and enhance local level land use planning and innovations in 

landscape certification models. For the former, approximately 100,000 landless youth would receive legal communal land 

certificates, inputs, and extension in exchange for land restoration. And 2,000,000 households would receive legal 

individual landholding certificates. Half of the communal and individual/HH certificates would include a woman.  For the 

latter, the component would introduce the certification of locally managed forest plantations or natural forest, so that 

forest maturity is reached. This approach to forest management provides job opportunities for establishment and 

management including harvesting, processing and transport of forest products while helping green the supply chain for 

wood products. 

Component 4. Project Management and Monitoring ($10 million IDA, others TBD). The component would finance the 

operational costs of Project Implementation Units (PIUs) in MoANR and Regional State Bureaus of Agriculture. These PIUs 

will carry out all fiduciary aspects of project implementation including financial management, procurement, 

environmental and social safeguards, M&E, sector coordination of investment targeting and policy harmonization, and 

donor coordination structures. 

 
 

 
 
    

  SAFEGUARDS 

 
A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 

 
The operation would be implemented in existing 135 major watersheds in the Sustainable Land Management Project II 

(SLMP-2, P133133) and possibly in 18 partially treated major watersheds recently supported by Canada whose funding 
has been exhausted. Additional major watersheds to be targeted will be determined during preparation, and based on 
the scale of financing made available beyond the $100m IDA. Potential new major watersheds could be selected by the 
government based on the following options: (ii) expand treatments to neighbouring major watersheds in existing SLMP 
woredas, based on degradation/climate hotspots; (iii) expand to neighbouring major watersheds in new neighbouring 
woredas, based on degradation/climate hotspots; (iv) expand to Afar and Somali regional states, perhaps a handful of 
western border Woredas to pilot, if significant financial resources materialize beyond ID financing.  
 
SLMP-2 safeguard instruments will be updated taking the above considerations into account as the project concept 

becomes more concrete during preparation, and pending formal site selection by the government and subsequent 
mapping of the specific project intervention area with provision of shape files for each major watershed and community 
watershed targeted for project intervention.  

B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 

 
SLMP-2 safeguards implementation was consistently rated moderately satisfactory and to date has not encountered any 

serious problems. RLLP would build upon this implementation structure and the built capacity. RLLP implementation 
would be centered in the MOANR who would be responsible for project implementation down though all levels of the 
government’s existing implementation structure for its Sustainable Land Management Program: Federal, Regional State, 
Zone, Woreda (District), and Kebele (Sub-district). These entities and their staff are generally capacitated and ready to 
implement in the existing 135 SLMP-2 woredas in Oromia, Amhara, SNNP, Tigray, Benishangul Gumuz and Gambella 
regional states. If the proposed new regional states of Afar and Somali and any Woredas additional to SLMP-2 materialize, 
these will require a start-up period of capacity building and mobilization of communities in institutional capacity to 
implement safeguards.  
For RLLP, MoANR will need to update the SLMP-2 Social Assessment through enhanced consultation in existing and 

proposed new areas to integrate the experiences from SLMP-2 implementation and address any new challenges 
identified. This work would then be used to integrate the views, concerns and recommendations into the design of RLLP 
components. If the proposed inclusion of the 18 major watersheds supported earlier by Canada occurs, the MoANR will 
need to conduct Environmental and Social due diligence to identify any gaps and integrate actions in the RLLP design for 
implementation.

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

Generally, the RLLP is proposed as a Category B 
project, and would provide positive environmental 
and social benefits by scaling up proven sustainable 
land and water management practices on communal 
and individual lands, coupled with land holding and 
use rights. The EA policy is triggered, given that the 
project would finance supporting infrastructure such 
as rural roads and small bridges, soil and water 
conservation structures such as terraces, small 
irrigation, and water harvesting trenches, check dams, 
small reservoirs, and other civil works; soil fertility and 
moisture management; assisted natural regeneration, 
enclosures plus backyard livestock land use 
rationalization, intercropping, low tillage, gully 
reclamation, watering points ,wells, and also land use 
planning , reforestation and afforestation, etc. The 



RLLP project may have range of activities such as 
construction of small scale irrigation schemes, 
community access road construction, water harvesting 
structures, small or micro-dams, degraded forest 
rehabilitation and reforestation, gully rehabilitation, 
land administration, certification and local land use 
planning. These activities may cause some unforeseen 
environmental and social impacts. These impacts may 
include biodiversity loss, natural habitat and cultural 
resources destruction, soil erosion and sedimentation, 
restriction of access to resources, flooding, involuntary 
loss of land and displacement of people, pollution and 
diseases 
Since the location, scope and nature of the major 
watersheds, micro watersheds, and specific activities 
within these sites are not known at the time of 
preparation, the instrument proposed for analyzing 
potential environmental and social risks is an ESMF. 
Thus, the SLMP-2 ESMF will be updated to capture the 
essence of implementation challenges, concerns and 
views regarding environmental and social risk 
management in the proposed RLLP. Regarding the 
possible inclusion of the 18 major watersheds 
supported earlier by Canada (not involving the Bank), 
an Environmental and Social due diligence will be 
conducted to document environmental and social 
compliance issues and identify recommended actions 
to be integrated in the RLLP design.   

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 Yes 

Project intervention areas are likely to encompass 
some natural habitats which are protected by law. 
Hence, it is necessary to reflect this OP/BP in the ESMF 
and to ensure that sub-projects are screened against 
this OP/BP and that appropriate preventive or 
mitigation measures are formulated and executed. 
The policy will be triggered because activities in the 
Project may have some impacts on wetlands, 
protected areas, conservation sites, and critical 
ecosystems. Activities involving significant conversion 
of natural habitats or if an environmental assessment 
indicates that a proposed activity would significantly 
convert or degrade natural habitats, the proposed 
activity will not be eligible for financing under RLLP. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 Yes 

This policy is triggered as the Project areas are likely to 
encompass some forests which may be for production 
or protection. Under RLLP, the forest related activities 
will have positive impacts because of reforestation, 



rehabilitation of degraded forests land and communal 
lands. Community infrastructure such as access roads 
and irrigation schemes may pose some negative 
impacts if forests are found in those sites. 
Management plans with mitigation measures will be 
prepared to avoid or reduce such impacts. If there are 
projects likely to cause significant conversions of 
forests, they will not be financed under RLLP. The 
project ESMF will ensure that subprojects are 
screened against this OP/BP and that appropriate 
preventive or mitigation measures are formulated and 
executed. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

The triggering of this OP is predicated on the 
assumption that the Project intends to support the 
introduction of high value crops, new and high yielding 
crop varieties and animal breeds which may lead to 
increased application of agrochemicals (insecticides, 
herbicides, fertilizers, etc.). The ESMF includes a 
description of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) 
approaches that would elaborate on what actions 
need to be undertaken to minimize environmental, 
health and safety impacts. Experience from SLMP-2 
implementation indicates that activities, particularly 
those in agriculture and irrigation (introduction of high 
value crops and use of pesticides, introduction of new 
varieties of crops, new fruit tree species and varieties, 
high yielding varieties) may increase the use of 
agrochemicals (insecticides, herbicides, fertilizers, 
etc...). 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 Yes 

This policy is triggered given the possibility that there 
may be cultural assets and/or sites in the project area 
and on the assumption that there could be “chance 
finds.”  
The policy is triggered by the Project because the small 
scale infrastructure activities involve access road 
construction, small scale dam construction, and other 
similar infrastructure, which may potentially affect 
physical and cultural resources. The necessary steps of 
public consultations, engagement of cultural or 
religious leaders, local authorities need to be 
conducted before decision on project is made.  

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 Yes 

As a follow-on operation to SLMP-2, the RLLP is not 
expected to introduce new social risks related with the 
underserved and historically disadvantaged peoples. 
SLMP-2 had conducted an enhanced consultation 
process with project beneficiaries and project affected 



peoples and prepared a Social Assessment in regions 
having the characteristics associated with the 
populations defined under OP4.10 criteria, to seek 
broad support for the project from these groups. The 
findings of the Social Assessment (the identified social 
risks and risk mitigation measures), as well as the 
process used to foster free, prior, and informed 
consultations and achieve broad community support 
have been documented and publicly disclosed.  
The RLLP, as a follow-on operation to SLMP-2, will 
update the Social Assessment and Social Development 
Plan to document experiences and mitigate the 
challenges identified in SLMP-2 implementation and 
ensure the views, concerns and recommendations of 
people in Afar and Somali regional states, if included. 
Regarding the possible inclusion of the 18 major 
watersheds supported earlier by Canada, an 
Environmental and Social due diligence will be 
conducted to document any environmental and social 
compliance issues and identify recommended actions 
to be integrated in to the RLLP design against SLMP-2 
safeguard instruments. The Social Assessment and 
Social Development Plan update will also screen the 
presence of underserved and historically 
disadvantaged peoples in 18 major watersheds 
previously supported by Canada and new areas to be 
covered by RLLP but not previously covered by SLMP 
II.  
The gender and youth dimensions of the SLMP-2 
implementation will be captured in the updated Social 
Assessment and the SDP with a dedicated section to 
ensure provision of adequate implementation and 
monitoring support while addressing the practical and 
strategic needs of the youth and gender aspects of the 
RLLP design.   

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

This OP/BP is triggered based on the assumption that 
the implementation of RLLP interventions may 
potentially involve acquisition of land and/or 
restriction of access to communal natural resources. 
The ESMF, Social Assessment, and the Resettlement 
Policy Framework (RPF) prepared for SLMP-2 will be 
updated based on an enhanced community 
consultation to capture views, concerns and 
recommendations based on experience in 
implementation of the SLMP-2 RPF. Experience from 
SLMP-2 implementation indicates that the scope of 


land take has been small and the nature of land take is 
voluntary. The restriction of access to degraded lands 
follow a due process using the participatory watershed 
management guideline. However, to ensure adequate 
assessment satisfactory to the Bank, the RPF update 
will include a participatory process, steps on 
community decision making process including 
identification of appropriate measures to mitigate any 
adverse impacts, if any, on the vulnerable members of 
the community. 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 Yes 

The project triggered OP 4.37 (safety of dams). No 
new construction and/or rehabilitation of large dams 
is anticipated to be financed under the proposed RLLP 
but there will possibly be construction of small dams 
particularly for irrigation of small-farm holdings, these 
may not be large (more than 4.5 meters high) and may 
not require special procedures to follow. In cases of 
small dam construction (less than 4.5 meters), 
implementers can use the FAO ‘Manual on Small Earth 
Dams, a guide to siting, design and construction’. In 
addition, the guideline for small dam construction 
prepared by the MOANR will be used to ensure safety 
of small dams. 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

Yes 

RLLP woredas are located in international water basins 
such as Abay, Tekeze, Baro or their tributaries. Most of 
the project activities are aimed at better watershed 
and pasture land management, afforestation and 
reforestation, biodiversity conservation as well as 
climate smart agriculture. These activities will 
contribute to reducing soil erosion and rejuvenate 
degraded landscapes hence lesser siltation of rivers 
and streams in the targeted watersheds. None of the 
project activities will therefore adversely change the 
quality or quantity of water flows to the other riparian 
countries. The physical interventions the RLLP project 
is expected to undertake include shallow groundwater 
recharge and micro-scale community-level irrigation. 
While the impact of individual sub-projects would be 
negligible and the cumulative abstractions minor, 
riparian countries will be notified in accordance with 
the policy. 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 
 

1. Kenya’s economic growth has been robust over the past years. For the third consecutive year, economic activity has 
increased, reaching an estimated 5-year high of 5.9 percent in 2016, and once again placing Kenya among the fastest 
growing economies in Sub-Saharan Africa.

1
 Projections indicate continued growth with a rate of around 6 percent in 

2018 and 2019. Kenya’s population is estimated to grow equally fast, with an annual increase of 1 million.
2
 In 2015, the 

country’s population stood at around 46 million.
3
 Natural resources are the basis for livelihood and economic 

development. Agriculture, including forestry and fishery,
4
 represents a major economic driver and a dominant source of 

employment, having accounted for more than 30 percent of GDP in 2015.
5
  

2. The effects of sustained macroeconomic growth are translating into improved quality of life and poverty reduction, 
but inequality remains high. Between 2006 and 2016, poverty measured against the official national poverty line is 
projected to have dropped from 46 percent to 36 percent.

6
 Inequality, however, remains high. Kenya’s Gini coefficient 

stood at 48.5 in 2005.
7 

In remote and sparsely populated areas such as the north-eastern parts or the coastal areas, 
poverty rates can be as high as 80 and 60 percent, respectively. There is a growing rural-urban split, and the richest 10 
percent of the population receive 40 percent of the nation’s income.

 
 

3. In 2008, the Government prepared a long-term development strategy, Vision 2030, which aims to transform Kenya 
into a globally competitive middle-income country by 2030.

8
 The strategy has three pillars: an economic pillar that 

aims to achieve GDP growth of 10 percent per annum; a social and environmental pillar that aims to build a just society 
enjoying equitable social development in a clean and secure environment; and a political pillar that aims to build a 
people-centered, results-oriented, accountable democratic political system. Promoting equal opportunities across the 
entire Kenyan territory is key to realizing this vision.  

4. In an effort to narrow long-term, deeply entrenched regional disparities and to increase the responsiveness of the 
government, Kenya adopted a new Constitution in 2010. County governments now play the primary on-the-ground 
role in delivering services (in the agriculture, water, environment, urban, and health sectors), while the national 
government retains a policy-making, regulatory, and research role.  

 
Sectoral and Institutional Context 
 

5. While the fisheries sector contributes less than one percent to GDP, it plays a significant role in employment 
generation, food security, and rural development. Fish production from inland fisheries, marine artisanal fisheries, and 
aquaculture, increased from 150,000 metric tons in 2010, to about 190,000 in 2014, with a market value of more than

 An updated national poverty line and measures will be published in 2017 based on the second Kenya Integrated Household Budget Survey 

completed in September 2016. Poverty incidence measured using the international extreme poverty line of US$1.90 per day (2011 PPP terms) was 
33 percent in 2006 and is projected to have dropped to 24 percent in 2016.

 Fish production from marine resources only, amounts to around 9,000 metric tons of catch annually.

10 

Imports and exports of fish products have also been increasing. Fish products were being imported and exported in the 
amount of US$15.5 million and US$39 respectively in 2013, compared to US$4.6 million and US$38.9 million, 
respectively, in 2010.

11
 The sector employs more than 2 million people directly and indirectly, working as fishers, 

traders, processors, suppliers, and merchants of fishing accessories, and thus serves the development and stabilization 
of Kenya’s rural communities, both coastal and riparian.

12
  

6. The artisanal marine fishery is recognized as one of the most important contributors to the food security of coastal 
villages, however, weak governance, particularly an unregulated fishing regime, has led to overexploitation and 
degradation. Fishing effort in Kenya’s marine waters is primarily directed inside territorial waters (i.e., 12 nautical 
miles), is largely artisanal and characterized by small crafts propelled by wind and paddles, and thus almost entirely 
restricted to the fringing reef and near-shore areas. The coastal region is among the least developed in the country, 
with more than 60 percent of the population living below the poverty line, and most relying on coastal and marine 
ecosystems for employment, livelihood and nutrition. On the other hand, Kenya’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), which 
broadly extends 200 nautical miles from the coastline and covers a total area of 142,400 km

2
, is exploited mostly by 

distant-water fishing fleets, comprised mainly of purse-seiners and long-liners.
13 

Unrestricted access to fisheries in near-
shore waters, increased fishing effort driven by a growing population, and destructive fishing gear are destroying 
critical marine habitats and seriously affecting the state of fish stocks. Most nearshore fish stocks are considered fully 
exploited, and in many instances at levels that exceed Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY), thereby contributing to 
economic overfishing. The World Bank and the Global Environment Facility (GEF)-financed Kenya Coastal Development 
Project (KCDP) has been supporting the development of Fishery Management Plans (FMPs) as well as stock 
assessments to improve the management of these inshore fisheries. However, the management plans are yet to be 
implemented and used by decision makers and other key stakeholders.  

7. Poor market access and lack of basic infrastructure are causing post-harvest losses, thereby reducing economic 
returns. Lack of appropriate post-harvest fish handling and preservation facilities increase transport time and thus the 
risk of spoilage, ultimately leading to low fish prices or wastage. In 2014, post-harvest losses were estimated at 2,700 
metric tons, representing about 30 percent of total landings for marine fisheries.  

8. The impacts of climate change further compound the challenges coastal communities are facing not only due to 
shoreline erosion, floods, and extreme weather events, but also because of their limited ability to adapt as a result of 
insufficient income and lack of basic infrastructure. In Kenya, 2.8 million people are estimated to live within 25 km of 
the coast, and this number is expected to increase to nearly 4 million by 2030. While the impacts of climate change on 
Kenya’s coast are not yet fully measured, or analyzed, marine and coastal ecosystems are expected to be affected as a 
result of rising ocean temperature, irregular rainfall, sea level rise, ocean acidification, changes in ocean current 
patterns, and more frequent and severe extreme weather events. 

9. With improved management and control, Kenya aims to increase the contribution from offshore fisheries to its 
economic development. Kenya is increasingly engaged in regional initiatives aimed at controlling Illegal, Unreported, 
and Unregulated (IUU) fishing, and in managing regional fishing efforts through its involvement in the IOTC, the 
Southwest Indian Ocean Fisheries Commission (SWIOFC), the African Union-Interafrican Bureau for Animal Resources

 With support from the KCDP, Kenya has recently established an advanced Vessel 
Monitoring System (VMS) in Mombasa, which will become fully operational once licensed vessels deploy the required 
on-board beacons to link with the base station at the State Department of Fisheries and Blue Economy (SDF-BE).  

10. More broadly, and driven by a growing population and the need for sustainable growth in ocean-related economic 
activities, the Government of Kenya (GoK) has made a strong commitment towards improving the management of its 
marine fisheries by embarking on a new approach – the Blue Economy. The blue economy approach aims to increase 
the number of livelihoods and level of income linked to the oceans, while concurrently conserving its resources and 
ecological integrity to ensure sustainability of the coastal/marine fisheries sub-sector.

15
 Sustainable management of 

fisheries stock, enhancing economic returns including through development of local semi-industrial fisheries, and 
improving coastal livelihoods are key focus areas of the GoK. Several State Departments were established through 
Executive Order No.1/2016, with the SDF-BE being tasked with coordinating economic ocean activity, which includes a 
comprehensive mandate to protect marine ecosystems. In addition, a new Fisheries Management and Development 
Act is currently under implementation, and a new national fisheries agency to bolster management of the fisheries 
sector, the Kenya Fisheries Service (KeFS), was established in September 2016. KeFS is in the early stages of becoming 
operational.  

11. The proposed project would support the GoK in implementing its blue economy agenda. MAFIDEV would scale up 
some of the successes of the KCDP. Furthermore, MAFIDEV would support the GoK in the operationalizing the KeFS, 
and help strengthening the marine fisheries and aquaculture-based livelihoods in coastal communities, by building on 
the benefits derived from the Hazina Ya  Maendeleo ya  Pwani (HMP), a coastal development fund providing grant 
support to demand driven community sub-projects which was established under KCDP. 

 
Relationship to CPF 
 

12. The proposed project is aligned with the Kenya Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) FY2014-2018
16

 as updated during 
the Performance and Learning Review in 2017, whose overarching goal is sustainable reduction in poverty and 
increased shared prosperity. Aligned both with Kenya’s Vision 2030 and its Medium-Term Plan, the CPS highlights three 
priority areas of engagement: (i) competitiveness and sustainability – growth to eradicate poverty; (ii) protection and 
potential – human resource development for shared prosperity; and (iii) building consistency and equity – delivering a 
devolution dividend. The project would directly contribute to the competitiveness and sustainability pillar of the CPS 
through development of a robust marine and coastal fishery economy, thereby addressing the government’s growth 
and poverty reduction strategies. By focusing on the coastal region, the project is expected to contribute to economic 
prosperity, employment, and livelihood of the coastal communities, where deep-rooted poverty and inequality are still 
a major concern for the government.

C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  
 

 
 
The Project Development Objective is to improve management and increase value-addition of priority fisheries and 
aquaculture, and to strengthen access to livelihoods for coastal communities in Kenya. 

 
Key Results (From PCN) 

 
13. The key project outcomes are: 

 Index of captured indicator species (size, volume and fishing effort) (tbd) 

 Number of fishing vessels in Exclusive Economic Zone with valid licenses (#)  

 Total production of aquaculture in coastal areas (disaggregated by type of aquaculture) (metric tons) 

 Coastal communities with access to livelihood activities (number) 

 Increase value addition of catch of indicator species (tbd)  

 Share of targeted beneficiaries with rating ‘Satisfied’ or above on project interventions (disaggregated by 
gender)  

 
 
D. Concept Description 

 
14. The project objective will be achieved through targeted interventions grouped under the following proposed 

components. 

1) Component 1 – Governance and Management of Marine Fisheries and Aquatic Resources: Strengthening of 

marine fisheries and aquaculture governance is a critical element to increasing economic benefits from marine 

fisheries. This includes regulating fishing effort to enhance stock productivity and ensuring availability of reliable 

fisheries information for management decision-making. The proposed component would: (i) strengthen marine 

fisheries and coastal aquaculture governance; and (ii) minimize overfishing and destructive fishing practices, 

maintain or improve stock productivity, and enhance the integrity of associated ecosystems. The expected 
outcomes are: (i) improved institutional capacity of KeFS; (ii) improved FIS that supports management decision-

making; (iii) fisheries management measures implemented for four priority nearshore fisheries; (iv) functional (at 

least seven) joint Co-Management Areas (CMAs); (v) effective surveillance of Kenya’s EEZ; (vi) improved 

understanding of the status of stocks and fishing effort in priority fisheries; and (vii) regulatory framework for 

coastal aquaculture in place.  

2) Component 2 – Promote Investment in Marine Fisheries and Coastal Aquaculture: Most of Kenya's marine 

fisheries resources are close to, and in some cases beyond, maximum sustainable harvesting levels. Thus, in the 

context of enhancing overall economic benefits, there are limited options to increasing production sustainably. 

However, there is a greater scope to improve value addition of existing production, in particular through 

improved post-harvest handling, product development and better access to markets, as well as through 

aquaculture development. This potentially creates a space for private sector investment, which in turn will 

generate opportunities for community-level income generation. The objective of this proposed component is to 

Note to Task Teams: The PDO has been pre-populated from the datasheet for the first time for your convenience. 
Please keep it up to date whenever it is changed in the datasheet. 

 


promote efficient utilization and value-addition of the resources by increasing investment in the marine fisheries 

and aquaculture sector. The component objective will be achieved through facilitating sectoral value chain 

analysis and identifying opportunities for investment in upgrading and/or new processing facilities and marketing 

initiatives, targeting the full range of nearshore resources, industrial offshore tuna fisheries and aquaculture. Such 

facilitation of private sector investment may include enhancing the business-operating environment, potentially 

including relevant infrastructure improvements. The expected outcomes are: (i) improved fisheries-related 

infrastructure; (ii) stable growth in the total economic value generated by sustainable use of the fishery and 

aquaculture resources; and (iii) improved business environment for investments in the fishery and aquaculture 

sector.  

3) Component 3 – Strengthening Marine Fisheries and Aquaculture-based Livelihoods in Coastal Communities: 

Outside Mombasa and tourism centers such as Malindi-Watamu, Diani and Lamu Island, rural coastal 

communities in Kenya remain relatively poor, and would thus be a main target beneficiary group under the 

proposed project. Even the coastal tourism economy is highly vulnerable to fluctuating global economics and 

security challenges in East Africa; therefore, fisheries resources remain the critical livelihood resource for rural 

coastal households in Kenya. Since nearshore capture fisheries resources are already at, or in some cases beyond, 

maximum sustainable harvesting levels, as with private sector development under Component 2, opportunities to 

strengthen coastal households lie more in fisheries value addition, aquaculture production and other enterprise 

development, than in increasing effort on capture fisheries. Accessing these opportunities requires information 

and knowledge sharing, skills development and better access to credit. Strengthening coastal livelihoods is an end 

in itself. However, it also supports a positive feedback loop in terms of strengthening nearshore fisheries 

management. Fishers with more secure livelihoods are better able to engage in fisheries co-management 

initiatives, which, although in the short-term might involve reducing fishing effort and catches, in the medium to 

longer-term allow stock recovery, improved fisheries productivity and further improvements to coastal 

livelihoods. This proposed component would enhance the social and economic benefits that coastal communities 

derive from sustainable use of living marine resources. Expected outcomes are: (i) increased income of coastal 

households from project-supported enterprise development and value-addition initiatives; (ii) increased access to 

and repayment of credit among coastal communities; and (iii) project beneficiaries are distributed by gender and 

age in accordance with stated targets.  

4) Component 4 – Project Management: This proposed component would ensure efficient and effective 

implementation of project activities and fiduciary management. Project management including monitoring and 

evaluation, and safeguards management activities are supported under this component.  

 
 

 
 
    

  SAFEGUARDS 

 
A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 

 
The Project investments will be located in the coastal counties of Kenya, including Mombasa, Kwale, Kilifi, Taita Taveta, 

Lamu and Tana River. While the exact location of project interventions is not known at this stage, it is known that Kwale, 

Note to Task Teams: The following sections are system generated and can only be edited online in the Portal. 
 

     

Kilifi, Taita Taveta, Lamu and Tana River counties are home to Vulnerable and Marginalized Groups (VMGs) who meet the 
OP 4.10 criteria in terms of their language, culture, attachment to given lands and being subordinate to the more 
dominant communities among whom they live. The livelihood strategies of the VMGs within these counties range from 
nearshore fishing – the closer a community is located to the sea – to subsistence farming, livestock keeping and small 
scale businesses, the farther a community is from the sea. 
 
B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 

 
The overall project implementation would be carried out by a Project Coordination Unit (PCU) in the State Department of 

Fisheries and Blue Economy (SDF-BE), Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, and Fisheries. The SDF-BE has been newly 
established, however, previously it existed as State Department of Fisheries and represented one of the implementing 
agencies of the KCDP. The PCU would hire environmental and social safeguards staff to be responsible for overseeing the 
implementation of safeguards instruments. The initial assessment finds the safeguards capacity of the future PCU to be 
rather limited, therefore a technical assistance, capacity building and monitoring environmental and social risks and their 
mitigation will be included as part of Component 4 design.

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

The initial screening revealed that the project is likely 
to have negative environmental and social impacts, 
taking into account that the project activities include 
small and rehabilitation of large infrastructure, such as 
reconstruction of fishing port facilities in Mombasa, 
improvement of landing sites infrastructure, upgrading 
fish markets, small scale fish-handling and processing; 
and product development and packaging facilities. It is 
proposed that the project is assigned EA Category B. 
Given that the nature of the proposed project 
activities, including their design and location are not 
known at this point in time, the project would follow a 
framework approach to managing safeguards. An 
Environmental and Social Management Framework 
would be prepared and publicly disclosed before 
project appraisal. During project preparation, the 
team will identify initial investments ready for 
financing, for which subproject specific ESIAs (and if 
necessary RAPs) will be developed and also disclosed 
prior to project appraisal. Throughout the project 
implementation, each subproject will be screened for 




environmental risk and ESIA/ESMP will be prepared by 
the PCU. The preparation of the ESMF and ESIAs will 
be accompanied by a set of public consultations with 
the project stakeholders, which will be documented in 
the assessments. 

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 Yes 

Most of the marine coastal area is classified with some 
form of protection, including several national parks. 
Some of the marine protected areas are under 
effective management as they were supported under 
Kenya Coastal Development Project (KCDP).  However, 
others are at various stage of degradation and in need 
for targeted activities to enhance management 
effectiveness including an active monitoring system. 
The project will design its investments to avoid 
negative impacts on environmentally sensitive areas 
and will work with relevant stakeholders, such as 
Kenya Wildlife Service, to enhance the management 
effectiveness of protected areas including the 
establishment of buffer zones and providing capacity 
building to the communities. The ESMF will include 
identification of risks and description of mitigation 
measures specific to avoidance and minimization of 
impacts on natural habitats. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 Yes 

The Project may include some investments in some 
areas with potential negative impacts on mangroves 
while in other areas may benefits from restoration of 
mangroves. The ESMF will include specific provisions, 
including a TOR for a mangroves management plan, 
for cases where such impact is unavoidable. Project 
preparation will determine the potential impacts on 
mangroves, however the large scale impact is not 
anticipated. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 TBD 
 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 TBD 

It is unlikely that cultural resources will be impacted, 
however, the presence of objects of cultural heritage 
will be identified during screening as part of project 
preparation. The ESMF will include a sample chance 
find procedure to be adopted by the contractors. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 Yes 

Five of the six coastal counties targeted under the 
proposed MAFIDEV (i.e., Tana River, Lamu, Kilifi, Kwale 
and Taita Taveta) are home to Vulnerable and 
Marginalized Groups (VMGs) who meet the OP 4.10 
criteria in terms of language, culture, attachment to 
given lands and being subordinate to the more 
dominant communities among whom they live, as well 
as other Vulnerable Groups. Under the Kenya Coastal

Development Project (KCDP), a VMG Framework was 
prepared followed by a comprehensive Social 
Assessment (SA), which found that the livelihood 
strategies of the VMGs within these counties ranged 
from nearshore fishing, the closer a community is to 
the sea – to subsistence farming, livestock keeping and 
small scale trades, the farther a community is from the 
sea. The findings of the SA resulted in the 
development of a VMG Plan (VMGP) to mitigate risks, 
which was disclosed in December 2015.  
Activities under Component 1 of the proposed 
MAFIDEV will include regulating fishing effort to 
enhance stock productivity and ensure availability of 
reliable fisheries information for management 
decision-making. While this may result in medium- to 
long-term benefits, in the short term, it might 
negatively affect the livelihood strategies of the fishing 
VMG communities. Since the exact location of project 
interventions is unknown at this point in time and in 
order to continue addressing the livelihood needs, 
strategies and aspirations of the VMGs, the project will 
prepare a VMG Framework. The VMG Framework will 
build on the VMG Framework and SA developed under 
KCDP, accommodate lessons learnt, and be publicly 
disclosed in Kenya and in the World Bank Info Shop. 
Furthermore, the proposed MAFIDEV will build on the 
KCDP best practices and engage the VMGs at all stages 
of the project including at the project design stage.    
 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

Large scale involuntary resettlement and land 
acquisition are not expected to be required for the 
proposed types of investments, as the project expects 
to include rehabilitation of existing infrastructure or 
expansion of existing facilities. While resettlement of 
households can be avoided, in most cases, some 
economic displacement and restriction of access to 
resources is expected to be an impact for the project. 
Since the exact locations of project interventions are 
unknown at this stage, a framework approach would 
be adopted through which the project will develop a 
Resettlement Policy Framework to outline the types of 
compensation required for the project activities and 
guide preparation of the Resettlement Action Plans 
during project implementation. The project will also 
develop a Process Framework (PF) to establish the 
mechanism for compensation, participation, and 



implementation of improved management of 
nearshore and offshore fisheries. During project 
preparation, the PCU will identify initial investments 
ready for financing, for which subproject specific RAPs 
will be developed (if necessary) and disclosed prior to 
project appraisal. Throughout the project 
implementation, each subproject will be screened for 
resettlement risks and a RAP prepared by the PCU as 
necessary. The preparation of the RPF, PF and RAPs 
will be accompanied by a set of public consultations 
with the project stakeholders, which will be 
documented in these documents. Particular attention 
will be paid to the identification of vulnerable groups 
among the Project Affected Persons (PAPs), who may 
require special resettlement assistance during project 
implementation. Such PAPs and the nature of their 
vulnerabilities as well as the necessary support to 
them will be clearly documented in the RAP. 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 No 
 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

TBD 
The policy may need to be triggered, which will be 
determined during project preparation. 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 TBD 
The policy may need to be triggered due to Kenya’s 
maritime dispute with Somalia.

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 
 

1. Niger is a large, landlocked country in the arid and semi-arid Sahel region. The country’s 
population is estimated at over 22 million, half of it less than 15 years old and growing rapidly at about 
3.9 percent per year.. Two-thirds of the country is inhospitable desert, and more than 84 percent of the 
population is concentrated in the areas along the Niger River in the southwestern part of the country 
and along its long southern border with Nigeria. The climate is mostly arid; annual rainfall in 85 percent 
of the country’s area is less than 350 mm.  However, some areas in the south and along the Niger river 
get some 600 mm of rain, making rainfed agriculture with dryland crops possible. 
  
2. Niger’s political institutions have been strengthened since the restoration of constitutional 
order in 2011. The Government of Niger (GoN) is pursuing important measures to combat organized 
crime and terrorism and to promote the safety and property rights of its citizens. Military and law 
enforcement agencies have created new crisis response units, and border security has been 
strengthened in close collaboration with regional and international partners. As a result, both unrest in 
various zones of Niger and insecurity in the border zone with Mali have diminished. Nevertheless, the 
country continues to face significant risks related to domestic and regional instability, as well as 
organized crime and transnational terrorism. The rise of Boko Haram in Nigeria and the recent expansion 
of its operations to neighboring countries, including Niger, is cause for concern.  Further, there are now 
over 100,000 refugees from Nigeria in the Diffa region.   

 
3. Niger is a founding member of the Sahel Alliance, an organization that committed its members 
and development partners to combine their efforts and better coordinate their actions to create the 
conditions for sustainable growth and lasting peace.  It aims to achieve more effective aid coordination 
and enhance the support from development partners to the region, in order to more generally 
contribute to stabilizing the security situation and eradicating poverty, by developing solutions for rural 
areas, creating employment for young people, improving energy infrastructure and the fight against 
climate change, and strengthening governance. 

 
4. Since 2000 Niger has had a good track record for macroeconomic stability. It has embarked with 
some success on reforms to foster private sector-led economic growth, reduce its debt, and improve 
social indicators. Niger has significant mineral wealth, including uranium and gold, and has started 
exporting refined oil products. These three commodities account for approximately 70 percent of the 


country’s exports. However, despite improvements, Niger continues to face persistent, long-term 
development challenges linked to its large geographical size, home to a largely rural population often 
beyond the reaches of public services, where the bulk of the poor reside. 

 
5. Although poverty incidence is declining, Niger remains among the poorest countries in Africa, 
with an estimated average per capita gross domestic product (GDP) in current prices of US$420 in 2014, 
well below the average GDP of US$1,600 for Sub-Saharan Africa (IMF, 2017).  In the 2016 Human 
Development Index, Niger was ranked second to last out of 188 countries.  Despite a decline in overall 
poverty incidence, the rural poor became poorer relative to their urban counterparts during the 2005-
14 period. Their per capita consumption relative to that of the urban poor declined from 60 percent to 
43 percent. Lack of economic diversification, volatile agricultural growth, low access to physical and 
institutional infrastructure, and weak human capital base limits economic opportunities, especially in 
rural area. 

 
6. Food insecurity and malnutrition remain a challenge. Overall, growth of major food production 
was slightly less than the population growth over the period 1980-2011, with the increase in the food 
deficit being filled by imports. Malnutrition is a big challenge with. An estimated 2.5 million people in 
Niger are chronically food-insecure and unable to meet their basic food requirements even during years 
of average agricultural production. During periods of constrained access to food, millions more can 
quickly fall into acute transitory food insecurity. Over the past years, Niger made some progress on 
nutrition indicators, but the country still lags substantially behind other low-income countries and Sub-
Saharan African counterparts. Malnutrition accounts for more than one-third of child mortality in the 
country and 43 percent of children under five years old suffers from stunting and wasting. Malnutrition 
remains high due to a host of health, sanitation, and behavioral factors, worsened by recurrent food 
shortages.    

 
7. Niger is vulnerable to climate shocks, with drought being the most important risk in terms of 
frequency and impacts. A strong correlation exists between changes in gross domestic product (GDP) 
and the meteorological conditions, demonstrating the fragility of the economy to weather-related 
events, particularly in the agriculture sector.1 The food crisis resulting from the 2011 drought affected 
almost half of the country’s population. While uncertainty remains regarding longer-term climate change 
projections (2050-2100), short- and medium-term rainfall deficits will most likely continue to plague 
Niger’s agriculture sector, and the frequency and severity of droughts may remain the same or increase. 
The agriculture, forestry, and other land uses (AFOLU) sector accounts for 89 percent of total greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions, while the energy sector accounts for 9 percent. The national priority for the AFOLU 
sector in Niger’s Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) relates to improving the resilience 
of the agriculture, animal husbandry, and forestry subsectors. For Niger, the adaptation options 
considered as top priority are those that will permit higher co-benefits with respect to climate change 
mitigation, particularly those good adaptation practices and techniques that will permit carbon 
sequestration and reduction of GHG emissions while improving productivity. Niger’s climate change 
strategy is based on the vision of climate-smart agriculture (CSA) and access to modern energy services 
for everyone in 2030.    

 

                                            
1 The 2013 World Bank agriculture sector risk assessment report indicated that Niger’s GDP growth rate dipped into 
negative territory eight times between 1984 and 2010, and drought was largely responsible. 


8. Women and young people are marginalized. The main factors that significantly impede the 
economic empowerment of rural women in the agricultural sector include: difficulties in accessing 
natural and productive resources, the overwork of rural women as they are in charge of both productive 
and reproductive/ household tasks, lack of women's leadership and decision-making, and limited access 
to information and education/ training.  Similarly, rural youth are mostly un-educated and lack 
professional qualifications. Their low social status and the difficulties they encounter to access economic 
opportunities limit their participation in decision-making at community and family level. 

 
Sectoral and Institutional Context 
 

9. Agriculture (crops, livestock, and fisheries) is very important for the economy and employment. 
It represents more than 40 percent of the national GDP and occupies nearly 90 percent of the active 
population. The performance of the sector is unstable from one year to another because of its high 
exposure to agronomic, climatic, health, and more recently security risks.  The shocks that follow 
agricultural and livestock crises have a strong impact on household incomes,  the general budget  of the 
State and the growth rate at the overall Nigerien economy.  
 

10. Crop subsector.  Crop production is only possible in the relatively humid areas in the south-west 
of the country (an area of some 12 million hectares; about 10 percent of the national territory). 
Additionally, there are some 19 million hectares mainly pasture lands. Most crops are produced under 
rainfed conditions with low yields, including millet, sorghum, and other cereals (including coarse/feed 
grains), as well as legumes (cowpeas, groundnuts) in more modest amounts. The remainder of crop 
production grown by irrigated conditions, including rice and vegetables.  The yields of irrigated crops, 
however, are still below potential. The average size of a family farm unit is about 5 hectares, producing 
mostly for household consumption and little marketable surplus.  The production of food/feed grains, of 
which by-products are used for animal feeding (e.g. shredded millet/corn stalks) as extensive livestock 
production, is common to each farm and remains the customary production model. Agricultural 
productivity remains low largely because of a highly variable agro-climate from year to year with a 
constrained access to inputs such as certified seeds and fertilizers.  More entrepreneurial farmers are 
facing a weak financial market, limiting access to credit, and suffering from poor access to quality 
phytosanitary products, limited familiarity with modern production practices, and the difficulty of 
accessing urban markets due to lack of aggregation, and a lack of adequate transport infrastructure and 
transport means.  
 

11. Livestock subsector. It is a key sector of the Nigerien economy that contributes 13 percent to the 
national GDP and provides 7 percent of the country's export earnings. The national herd is estimated at 
more than 10 million cattle, 24 million small ruminants, and a little over a million and a half camels.2 
Three main types of livestock farming co-exist in Niger: (i) the "pastoral systems" characterized by animal 
mobility (extensive breeding systems for camels, small ruminants, and cattle), (ii) the traditional livestock 
farming systems practiced by villagers throughout the country, for ruminants and poultry, and (iii) 

                                            
2 Despite the mortality associated with successive pastoral crises, livestock numbers have been steadily increasing 
over the past ten years, rising from 11.5 TLUs in 2005 to 14.5 TLUs in 2012. [Tropical Livestock Units/Unités de bétail 
tropical (TLUs/UBT); a TLU implies a live weight of 250 kg]. The most significant increase involved cattle (+ 38 
percent) and goats (+ 22 percent). Equines and camels had the lowest rates of increase (4 and 7 percent, 
respectively). While the increase represents a larger potential food reserve, these animals also need to be fed in 
what is often a fodder-constrained environment. 



"improved livestock systems" (mainly semi-intensive and intensive peri-urban poultry and ruminant 
fattening). Other types of farming (quite marginal, but diversified) include beekeeping, rabbit breeding, 
etc. 
 

12. Fisheries subsector. National consumption of fish is only in the order of about 2 kg per inhabitant 
per year, implying a total demand of about 44,000 tons per year.  Production between 2012 and 2017 
fluctuated within a range of 27,000 to 47,000 tons.  Most of the catches from Lake Chad are exported to 
Nigeria (in smoked form).  Some fish are imported fresh or frozen from Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Benin, and 
Côte d'Ivoire.  Potential for import substitution exists. There are currently about 70,000 people employed 
in this subsector, involving fishermen, processors, and traders, and the estimated contribution to GDP is 
about 0.7 percent. Previous projects financed by other donors have demonstrated that there can be 
relatively high fish productivity in ponds (more than 200 kg/ha/year in many ponds particularly for 
catfish, Carp, and Lake Chad perch).  Also, there exist some successful local initiatives for community 
management of fisheries. Fish output could be increased, including particularly with an expansion of 
aquaculture, while conserving fishery resources and the natural resources on which these are based.  Key 
actions would include investments in water management, particularly of excess water during the rainy 
season (continuing investments or similar to some of those under PRODEX) along with improved 
extension and transfer of technology.  
 
13. Extension and advisory services, support to processing and marketing, and availability of 
financing are weak. These constrain agriculture development.  Some of the factors explaining the weak 
status of extension are: weak human resources, limited research along with limited research and 
extension linkages, unclear extension messages, limited specialized services to support crop quality, 
animal health, and food safety; limited transport resources and operational budgets to visit farmers and 
their fields/livestock, and low use of information and communication technology (ICT). The above factors 
combine to limit effective coverage of crop and livestock extension to support production.  Similarly, 
bottlenecks in the various value chains limit support to value addition on production, such as with 
processing or packaging units of products of animal and vegetable origin, and the weakness of the inter-
professions.  However, opportunities exist as proven by private or professional initiatives regarding milk, 
dried meat, hides and skins, cowpeas, onions, sesame, nut-grass, etc. Finally, financing for the sector is 
lacking. Banks are reluctant to take risks to finance the agriculture and livestock operations, and micro-
finance institutions are weak. 
 

14. Significant water resources exist but are insufficiently used. The limited use of water is a major 
constraint for crop production.  It is estimated that only 1 percent of surface runoff and 15 percent of 
renewable groundwater are currently used, and that less than 30 percent of potentially irrigable land is 
currently irrigated.  Water resources consist of large surface water networks as well as large renewable 
groundwater reserves of around 2.5 billion m3, and 2,000 billion m3 of non-renewable water reserves. 
This water potential is underutilized. Only the Niger River flows permanently throughout the year, while 
five other large rivers feeding the Niger river flow only part of the year. There are also about a thousand 
ponds, including 175 permanent ones that are mostly used by livestock herders for watering their cattle.  

 
15. Other constraints for agriculture development include: (i) institutional, legislative and regulatory 
deficiencies (means and capacity of intervention of the State services, including some of its laboratories 
for analysis and diagnosis, unsuitable texts and/or not-applied data and unused monitoring/evaluation 
systems); (ii) low level of organization of sector actors (POs, unstructured IPs and other cooperatives 

without economic organization capacity); (iii) lack of technical and economic benchmarks on the 
intensification of farming and livestock systems; (iv) difficult access to advisory support (low coverage 
and weak messages of the extension network and local veterinary services) and quality production inputs 
(low access to improved seeds, livestock/poultry feed capacity limited and uncontrolled); (v) low genetic 
potential of the most common plant varieties and animal breeds or under-valued potential; (vi) 
inadequate investment and support for the sector (lack of industrial-scale infrastructure and outdated 
equipment for production, processing, storage, transport and marketing, low value of by-products); (vii) 
overexploitation and non-sustainable use of land resources; (viii) limited decentralization and land 
insecurity; and (ix) national system for preventing and managing crises (of climatic, sanitary, and 
commercial origin) that is not well adapted or developed.  

 
16. Main assets of the agriculture sector. These include: (i) a substantial potential for irrigated 
farming, (ii) the presence of a numerically large and diversified herd with untapped potential for 
increased productivity through animal health, feed, genetic improvements, and better husbandry 
practices; (iii) the presence of plant varieties and animal breeds recognized for their adaptive and 
productive potential in their agro-climatic environment; (iv) traditional know-how and good experience 
of producers in certain areas (flood recession cultivation, livestock fattening, artisanal milk production, 
poultry); (v) competitiveness of certain export sectors (onions, cattle/meat); and (vi) important sectoral 
contribution to the fight against poverty (the main source of household income), and to food and 
nutrition security. 

 
 

Relationship to CPF 
 

17. The proposed project is fully aligned with the Niger Country Partnership Framework (CPF) and 
the Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD). The proposed project is aligned with the CPF and SCD as it 
would contribute to poverty alleviation and improved food security through increased farm productivity 
and value addition in selected agricultural value chains, thus improving rural livelihoods. It would 
generate employment in general and in particular for women and young people in the targeted areas. 
The SCD underlines that “improving the productivity in agriculture remains a first priority for poverty 
reduction.”  The CPF has an overarching goal of empowering women, while engaging with men as allies, 
to bring down the unsustainable population growth rate in Niger and to enable development policies to 
succeed. In the medium term, reduced demographic pressures are expected to free up scarce public 
resources to fund services, such as health and education and enable further empowerment of women 
and girls in a self-sustaining virtuous circle. Within this overarching logic, the FY18-21 CPF, approved by 
the Board on April 10th, 2018, focuses on the importance of boosting agricultural productivity, 
diversifying exports, and raising incomes in the rural sector where 80 percent of the population live. 
Investments in the agricultural sector, including livestock and fisheries, are therefore essential, such as 
through the proposed project. Specifically, yields can and should be increased, including, for example, 
via use of more productive varieties, small-scale irrigation, agroforestry and intercropping, which the 
project would emphasize, while increasing the involvement of youth and women.  
 
18. The proposed project is also aligned with the Government’s sector strategy in support of 
agriculture and livestock.  The strategy is described in the Plan for Economic and Social Development II 
(PDES II), focused on "food security and sustainable agricultural development," implemented in 
particular through the 3N (“Nigeriens feed Nigeriens") Initiative. The Initiative aims to contribute to the 

overall overarching goal of eradicating hunger, while helping to improve the productivity and income of 
farming households, especially the most vulnerable. The approach is also intended to operationalize the 
Rural Transformation Program of the Sustainable Development and Inclusive Growth Strategy (SDDIC). 
It contributes to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted in 2015 by the 
United Nations World Assembly, including SDGs 2 and 1. The general orientation of the proposed project 
is also in line with the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Plan (CAADP), the ECOWAS 
Common Agricultural Policy (ECOWAP), and the Agricultural Policy of Africa (PAU; UEMOA). 

 
C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  
 

19. The Development Objective (PDO) is “to increase productivity and commercialization for selected 
agriculture and livestock value chains and strengthen the country’s capacity to respond to eligible crisis 
or emergency”. This objective is fully aligned with the Government's vision for agricultural and livestock 
development. 

 
Key Results (From PCN) 

 
20. Key performance indicators include: (i) increased productivity of project-targeted agriculture and 
livestock systems: this would be measured based on area irrigated and increased yields (kg per hectare 
or per head), including the reduction of losses due to the most prevalent animal diseases; (ii) incremental 
sales in targeted value chains, including for dairy/milk, cattle/meat, fish, poultry, onions, and niébé 
(aggregated over all the targeted value chains); and (iii) reduction in the Government’s response time to 
agriculture and livestock sector-related emergencies including sanitary crises. In addition, the following 
two core indicators regarding direct beneficiaries would be measured: (i) number of small-scale 
agriculture producers and sedentary livestock rearing and fish farming households benefiting from 
project interventions in the project-targeted production basins, particularly the vulnerable groups (e.g., 
women and youths); and (ii) beneficiary satisfaction rate with the quality of project-supported services, 
as a partial measure of citizens’ engagement in the Project. The detailed results framework would be 
developed during the course of preparation. Adequate provision would be made in terms of human and 
financial resources for the design of thorough M&E activities as part of project preparation. A baseline 
survey would be conducted to inform indicators regarding the reference situation at project inception. 
 

D. Concept Description 
 

21. The World Bank's Agriculture and Livestock Portfolio in Niger currently includes the following 
projects: (i) Export Promotion Project (PRODEX) which ended in October 2017 and for which an 
Implementation Completion Report is currently being  prepared; (ii) Additional Financing for the West 
Africa Agricultural Productivity Project, approved in 2017; (iii) Regional Support Project to the Sahel 
Irrigation Initiative/Project d’Appui Regional à l’Initiative pour l’irrigation au Sahel (SIIP/PARIIS) approved 
in December 2017; (iv) Climate-Smart Agriculture Project/Projet d’Appui à l’Agriculture Sensible aux 
risques Climatiques (CSA/PASEC) approved in 2016; (v) Sahel Regional Pastoral Support Project (PRAPS-
Niger) in operation since fiscal year 2016 to support pastoral livestock production; (vi) Phase 3 of the 
Community Action Program/Programme d’Actions Communautaires (CAP3/PAC3), with its recently 
approved additional funding in 2017 and scheduled to close  in December 2019; (vii) the Regional Disease 
Surveillance Systems Enhancement Project (REDISSE) is strengthening the national cross-sectoral 
capacity for disease surveillance and epidemic preparedness,;  (viii) a rural development policy operation 

being disbursed over 2017-2018 under IDA 18. This project will provide financial support for the 
implementation of the PDES II whose  objectives include “increasing rural productivity growth” and 
“supporting growth enabling sectors.” It has numerous actions planned, including in energy, mineral 
exploitation, financial sector, etc.; it also seeks to provide input subsidies and improve agricultural 
extension in pilot communes; and (ix) The Competitive and Growth Support Project, which is closing on 
March 31, 2019 and  includes the rehabilitation and upgrading of slaughterhouses and their respective 
environments for developing meat production. In spite of the above projects/investments, there still 
remains a significant gap in terms of the overall performance of the agriculture and livestock sectors.  
 
22. Scope of intervention and complementarity with other projects. The PIMELAN would capitalize 
on the lessons learnt and best practices by past and on-going Bank projects. The targeted production 
systems and activities would be complementary to those supported by other Bank-financed projects. On 
the crop production side, the project would focus on increasing irrigated production with a focus on 
onions, and horticulture production (tomatoes in particular); it would also focus on fodder production as 
a link to the livestock production. It would capitalize on the results of the Small Irrigation Project (SMP; 
closed in FY 2009) and PRODEX (closed in October 2017, which already built on SMP) as well as PASEC 
that focuses on climate-smart agriculture (CSA) and PARIIS that focuses on irrigation. Regarding livestock, 
the project would focus on sedentary livestock systems to enhance cattle and small ruminant production 
and meat processing, the milk and poultry value chains (meat and eggs), and fish farming and processing; 
it would complement PRAPS-Niger which focuses on pastoral systems. The PIMELAN would deal with 
value chains in an integrated manner; it would focus on processing and marketing activities downstream 
of production. It would also address as a major thrust the financing constraints of the sector through TA 
support to partner financial institutions (PFIs) and funding for matching grants to producers and other 
V/C participants, following mechanisms already used by other projects. It would also coordinate with IFC 
and complement on-going or planned IFC work on agri-business development. 

 
23. The proposed Project would be structured as an Investment Project Financing (IPF), funded by 
an IDA credit in the amount of US$100 million over a six-year period. The Project would have three 
interrelated components: (i) improving the quality of public and private services in support of agriculture 
and livestock; (ii) support to public and private investments for improved production, processing, and 
market access for selected agriculture and livestock value chains; and (iii) crisis prevention & 
management, and project coordination. The project would be complementary to the ongoing agriculture 
and livestock projects. 
 

24. Integrated value chain approach. The rationale for the proposed project is to boost productivity 
in the selected agriculture and livestock value chains (V/Cs). The selected V/Cs would be: (i) Crop 
production: irrigated onions and vegetables; and (ii) Animal production: cattle and small ruminant meat, 
cows, poultry, goat and camel milk, hides and skins, as well as fish farming. This project would adopt an 
integrated value chain approach for the selected V/Cs from production to marketing on the domestic 
and regional markets or export to international markets. It would support financing through small credits 
or grants for services and activities of entrepreneurs who are ready to engage in intensification of their 
production, development of value-added activities to primary production through diversification of 
processing activities, and the logistics between agricultural production and the market (including 
processing, storage, and transport). This would require the close involvement of Partner financial 
institutions. 

25. The project would address cross-cutting priorities.  The main cross-cutting priorities proposed to 
be addressed under the project are: (i) capacity-building of extension and advisory support for crop and 
animal production; of input supply services (including seeds, feed supplements, and genetics); and of 
veterinary services; (ii) land restoration and sustainable land management; (iii) empowerment of women 
and youth; (iv) climate change mitigation and adaptation; (v) public health and nutrition; and (vi) 
environmental and social safeguards. 
 
26. Preparatory activities. Before making a final choice of actions to be selected, preparation work 
would identify the difficulties and constraints to be considered to guarantee the success of the project 
through a detailed mapping of the sectors and locations already covered by other IDA projects and those 
of other partners. The authorities would determine whether the priority actions should relate to sectors 
and/or locations not supported so far, or the promotion and scaling up of sectors already supported and 
promising in terms of supply of the domestic and export market. Due to the diversity of beneficiaries, 
and therefore the needs that would ultimately be identified (in terms of production sectors but also of 
typology of actors), a selective approach would be preferred, with a preferential focus on women and 
young people (see below). 

 
27. There have been recent developments in the Agriculture Sector in Niger, such as the reform of 
agriculture extension services and facilitation of the policy environment for investing in the sector.  On 
August 2, 2017, three important decrees were issued. These created: (a) the National System of 
Agricultural Extension/Système National de Conseil Agricole (NSAE/SNCA); (b) the Promotion Agency for 
Agricultural Extension/l’Agence de Promotion du Conseil Agricole (PAAC/APCA); and (c) the Investment 
Fund for Food Security and Nutrition/Fonds d’Investissement pour la Sécurité Alimentaire et 
Nutritionnelle (IFFSN/FISAN). A Committee has been set up to help with the operationalization of these 
bodies and to develop a roadmap, including the preparation of procedural manuals, the recruitment of 
the DGs and the technical directorates, etc.  PIMELAN would provide support to make them fully 
operational and effective. 

 
28. The preliminary project description is presented below.  
 

Component 1: Improving the quality of services in support of agriculture and livestock--US$ 25 million  
 

29. The objective of this Component would be to increase the productivity of agriculture and 
sedentary livestock farming systems for selected crops and non-pastoral value chains (milk, meat, fish, 
poultry, onions, and niébé) through the strengthening of the capacity and efficiency of services which 
would provide more and effective support and advice to producers. In doing so, it would build sustainable 
human, institutional, and policy capacity for key public and private actors in the agriculture and livestock 
(including aquaculture) sectors, in order to improve crop and animal husbandry practices (and therefore 
output), including climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices, as well as improved access and delivery of 
quality extension services (crop production, animal health, feed, and breeding), which would also help 
farmers to strengthen their resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards.  Activities would 
include:  
 

(a) Support to crop and livestock extension and advisory services in order to increase 
producers' knowledge and capacities to facilitate increased productivity. Knowledge 
developed under the West Africa Agricultural Productivity Programme (WAAP) would 


be disseminated to help reduce crop and livestock losses and contribute to improved 
public health; and involvement of extension services would help in finding synergies 
and complementarities with PRAPS-Niger, PASEC, and the SIIP. Support would include 
knowledge development for the selected crop and livestock value chains through 
increased transfer of Good Agriculture Practices (GAPs) by rolling out innovative 
extension models, such as livestock Farmer Field Schools (FFSs) and e-extension, 
diffusion of innovative technologies (including CSA, such as climate-resilient feed 
production and mitigation options), developing technical references, and providing the 
related training; provision of improved access to quality agricultural and zootechnical 
inputs (fertilizers, seeds, phytosanitary and sanitary products, food, genetics). 
Improved extension services are expected to increase producers’ awareness about 
climate change and improve their capacity to mainstream climate action; 

 
(b) Productivity and food safety enhancement via provision of specialized services to 

support crop quality, animal health, and food safety. The aim would be to increase the 
availability of and access to high-quality services and inputs for crop and livestock 
producers (including aquaculture). It would include crop and animal disease 
surveillance in order to improve the quality and hygiene of food of plant and animal 
origins, strengthening programs of animal prophylaxis (animal health/vaccinations) 
and fight against major pests and diseases, including prevention and management, 
weather monitoring, veterinary services enhancements and vaccination campaigns, 
quality control of crop and animal products, and seed and input certification.3 It would 
seek synergies and complementarities with PRAPS and REDISSE. Pest and animal 
health surveillance, together with weather monitoring, is expected to improve herd 
and crop resilience to climate-induced risks; and 

 
(c) Strengthening the policy planning and regulatory framework. This activity would aim 

at strengthening MoA&L’s efficiency and effectiveness by supporting policy 
formulation and developing the attendant legislation/regulations for improving the 
agriculture, livestock, and fisheries regulatory environment, and reducing distortions.  
This would include supporting the preparation of sector master plans, public 
investment plans, public expenditure reviews, support the establishment of 
agricultural and livestock infrastructures (establishment of service platforms at the 
level of the eight regions, according to approaches adapted to the target sectors, 
which would also include CSA options), and definition of food standards (quality and 
safety).  In order to support women’s empowerment and enhance agricultural 
productivity, the project would support policy development to expand women’s land 
rights and formally document their land claims to improve land access and tenure 
security for women.4 

                                            
3 This could involve the development of registers for plant and livestock varieties to help standardize food 
production and processing methods.  A livestock identification and registration system would help with disease 
mitigation and management from getting a handle on animal movements within the country.  It might be useful also 
to develop a phyto register to catalogue locally-developed seeds but also help with controls of invasive species (bugs 
and weeds). 
4  These proposed actions are fully in line with World Bank Policy Research Working Paper No.7199 by Prospere 
Backiny-Yetna and Kevin McGee, entitled: “Gender Differentials and Agricultural Productivity in Niger.” The paper
     

 
Component 2: Support to public and private investments for improved production, processing, and 
market access for selected agriculture and livestock value chains—US$ 60 million  

 
30. The Component would promote public and private investment at all levels of the selected value 
chains of milk, red meat, fish, poultry, onions, and niébé (production, processing, storage, transport, and 
marketing) for the development of production, market access, and competitiveness. The objective would 
be to increase productivity (while adapting to climate change and allowing for reduction in GHG 
emissions) and to strengthen the competitiveness of the targeted sectors (including through processed 
product diversification) and facilitate market access for producers and breeders, and agro-industry. 
These activities would be aimed at supporting the intensification and modernization of cropping and 
sedentary livestock systems, as well as processing units in the selected value chains, with a view to 
reaching operators' critical sizes to increase profitability and generate jobs.  

31. The intervention principles would be the following: (i) supporting the enhancement of capacities 
of farmer, cooperative, and inter-professional organizations in the targeted sectors in order to allow the 
emergence of an improved, more competitive economic fabric; (ii) identifying pre-investment activities 
(commercial viability studies, capacity building of service providers) to prepare viable business plans for 
economic operators and improve access for project promoters to financing by partner financial 
institutions (PFI); (iii) improving market access by removing distortions and supporting aggregation and 
packaging/processing points for agricultural and livestock products; and (iv) financing public and private 
investments in all segments of the sectors targeted by the project (production, processing, upstream, 
and downstream) within the framework of Productive Partnerships, i.e. economic partnerships between 
producers and other operators of the value chains. 

 
32. Activities envisaged to strengthen value chains (VCs) could be as follows: strengthen the 
economic organization of operators (support for professional structures); facilitate the linking of supply 
and demand (structuring of supply, identification of markets, linking, and contracting prospects); conduct 
pre-investment and training activities for economic operators and private service providers, in order to 
identify viable business plans, and improve operators' access to PFI financing (development of financial 
products for livestock farming, training of PFIs in the agriculture and livestock sector, negotiation of 
agreements with PFIs to partially finance project promoters); and finance investment subprojects within 
the framework of Productive Partnerships in all segments of the targeted sectors (upstream, production, 
downstream) in the form of cost-shared grants that could finance inputs, services, training, equipment, 
and infrastructure. 

 
33. Possible windows for investment funding. Funding and co-financing of investments in the 
targeted VCs would likely be conducted through separate windows, such as: (i) Productive Partnership 
(PP) window: for larger investment sub-projects, requiring individual contributions in cash and PFI 
funding; these sub-projects could involve, inter alia, scaling up of small-scale irrigation with the use of 
solar energy instead of diesel pumps; (ii) medium-scale microproject (MP) window: for medium 
investments with combination of cash, PFI funding, and in-kind contributions; and (iii) small-scale 
microproject (MP) window: for small investments with in-kind contributions and no external funding 

                                            
explicitly recommended enhancing women’s tenure rights in order to improve agricultural productivity. It further 
recommended facilitating women’s access to and use of hired farm labor and facilitating its supervision, incl. by 
facilitating community-based child care. 

requirements. Under these three windows, women and youth would receive preferential treatment.  The 
most appropriate financing modalities, including lower and upper thresholds for different windows, 
would be determined during project preparation. 

 
34. Women and Youth. Possible types of investments, favoring women and youth where feasible, 
may include: (i) promotion of small-scale irrigation facilities and equipment in order to properly manage 
water for agriculture purposes. This would be done according to the National Small-Scale Irrigation 
Strategy developed (SPIN) in Niger. The activities to be carried may also include structures to 
manage/store excess water during rainy season; (ii) land tenure rights recognition/documentation in 
order to preserve existing assets and use rights and to avoid conflicts; (iii) land reclamation, upgrading of 
soil fertility and improving existing carbon pools (such as through rangeland management, agro-forestry, 
reduced tillage techniques, etc.); (iv) development of storage facilities (including cold chain and adapted 
to climate risks); and (v) marketing structures. 

 
Component 3: Crisis prevention & management, and project coordination--US$ 15 million  

 
35. The objective of this component is to develop mechanisms for preventing and responding to 
severe crises and emergencies in the agriculture and livestock sectors, including future extreme weather 
events and other climate risks, as well as to strengthen project coordination capacities within MoA&L. 
Accordingly, its proposed activities relate to: (i) crisis prevention and management, and (ii) institutional 
support and project management: 

(a) Crisis prevention and management: (i) support MoA&L’s capacity to deal with crises by 
providing equipment (computer hardware and software, office furniture, vehicles, etc.), 
training and resources for specialized studies and communication campaigns, and vaccines; 
(ii) develop and operationalize crisis prevention and management tools, including the 
organization of forums for crisis management at local and national levels (as well as 
participation in international crisis management forums in West Africa and the Sahel); and 
(iii) funding of an Contingency Emergency Response Component (CERC). In doing so, the 
project would help establish a Crisis Management Unit at MoA&L with the capacity to 
intervene quickly when needed through the provision of emergency funds for severe crises 
and institutional support.  
 

(b) Project coordination. This activity would support all PCU activities required to manage IDA 
funds, procure IDA-funded goods and services, conduct project M&E including Iterative 
Beneficiary Monitoring (IBM),5 and comply with safeguard mitigation measures.  It would 
provide training and equipment to modernize MoA&L operations (computer hardware and 
software, office furniture, vehicles, and so on) at the central level and in the field as needed 
for project activities. It would also support general awareness and sensitization campaigns 
about project activities.  

    

                                            
5 This activity would monitor beneficiaries of the project starting at the beginning of the implementation with the 
objective to improve project efficiency and increase beneficiary satisfaction and beneficiary engagement. IBM collects 
information on project implementation, even in insecure settings. It is light, low-cost, and rapidly complements 
project supervision. The approach is problem-oriented and provides feedback to project teams through different 
iterations with the aim of catalyzing improvements in project implementation. IBM collects data directly from 
beneficiaries but keeps data collection efforts to a minimum by relying on few research questions and small samples. 


  SAFEGUARDS 

 
A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 

 
The Project will be nationwide. However, during preparation it will be determined whether the focus will be on selected 

Communes in the eight regions, depending on the selection of value chains and the complementarity with other ongoing 
projects. 
 
B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 

 
The Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (Recipient) has considerable experience in implementing IDA-funded 

Agricultural sector development projects. This collaboration with the Bank has obviously provided the Ministry with some 
technical capacity with regards to the application of World Bank environmental and social safeguards policies; the 
development of appropriate safeguards mitigation instruments and their implementation and monitoring.  Staff of the 
Ministry have shown a great deal of understanding and implementing social and environmental safeguards measures on 
the ground. More recently, the Recipient successfully carried out the CAP3 microprojects in accordance with the WB 
environmental and social safeguard policies and the national environmental and social compliance requirements. This 
good standing trend will be continued and further mainstreamed as the Recipient will continue to receive guidance from 
the Bank’s Environmental and Social Safeguards Specialists in the project team through supervision missions and virtual 
support to the Social and Environmental Focal Point.

D. Policies that might apply 

 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

The proposed project is categorized as B under this OP 
policy because its potential social and environmental 
risks are expected to be moderate and mostly site-
specific, with no significant or long-term negative risks 
and impacts. The potential environmental and social 
risks and impacts are mostly related to the use of 
fertilizers, pesticides and the increased GHG emissions 
due to the land-use change during agriculture cycles.   
Since the project physical footprint is presently 
unknown prior to appraisal, and in compliance with 
OP/BP 4.01 core requirements, the Borrower will 
prepare an Environmental and Social Management 
Framework (ESMF), consult upon and disclose it prior 
to appraisal.  The ESMF will be mostly building upon 
the existing PAC3 ESMF to guide the way that 
potential negative environmental and social risks and 



impacts of future sub-projects (following the positive 
list) will be identified and mitigated during project 
implementation. The ESMF will include social and 
environmental clauses to be observed by the farmers 
and herders, especially during project implementation, 
by which time most project activities footprints will be 
known.  If, during project preparation, any specific site 
is known before appraisal, Environmental and Social 
Impact Assessments (ESIA)/Environmental and Social 
Management Plans (ESMP) will be also be prepared 
and publicly disclosed, both in-country and at the WB 
prior to appraisal. 

Performance Standards for Private Sector 
Activities OP/BP 4.03 

No  

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 No 
The policy is not triggered as the project will not 
support activities in areas where critical habitats may 
be threatened. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No 

The policy is not triggered because the project will not 
support activities related to forest exploitation or 
management or that might have potential adverse 
impacts on forested areas. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

The project is not expected to finance acquisition, 
transport, distribution, disposal, storage or use of 
pesticides or similar chemicals that could threaten 
environmental and human health.  Nevertheless, OP 
4.09 is triggered because of the following related to 
the project: (i) livestock productivity enhancement via 
animal health, animal disease surveillance, animal 
health/vaccinations, and fight against pests, 
prevention and management; and (ii) farmers, for the 
agricultural productivity purpose, may use fertilizers 
and pesticides.  An Integrated Pest Management Plan 
(IPMP) will be prepared, consulted upon and publicly 
disclosed prior to appraisal. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 Yes 

This policy is triggered because of the nature of 
possible civil works to be financed under component B 
which might lead to the unearthing of such PCR.  
Nevertheless, it is highly unlikely that any physical 
cultural resources will be impacted; nonetheless, the 
existing “Chance finds procedures” will be embedded 
in the ESMF to ensure that these aspects will be taken 
into account during project preparation and 
implementation. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 No 
The policy is not triggered as there are no Indigenous 
Peoples in the project areas. 


Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

The Policy is triggered as the proposed project 
activities will require acquisition of land that could 
lead to some losses of assets, losses or restriction of 
access to some sources of livelihoods, resulting in 
either a temporary or permanent involuntary 
resettlement of project affected persons (PAP). 
However, since the physical footprint of project 
activities areas are mostly unknown at this juncture 
and will very likely be unknown prior to appraisal, the 
Borrower will prepare, consult upon, and publicly 
disclose prior to appraisal a Resettlement Policy 
Framework (RPF). During project implementation, the 
screening process will further determine whether land 
will be acquired and whether a subproject-specific 
Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) will be required. If so, 
such a RAP would be duly consulted upon and publicly 
disclosed both in-country and on the World Bank 
website at the InfoShop prior to the physical start of 
project civil works. 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 TBD 

The project may finance some water retention 
structures for excess water during the rainy season. 
This matter will be reviewed during the project 
preparation stage and pre-appraisal to assess whether 
or not OP/BP 4.37 should be triggered. The Policy of 
for now is to TBD until then. 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

No 
The project will not finance activities that will interfere 
with international watercourses; either in terms of 
water withdrawal or discharge of pollutants. 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No The project intervention areas are not under dispute. 

 
E. Safeguard Preparation Plan  
 
Tentative target date for preparing the Appraisal Stage PID/ISDS 
 
May 31, 2018 
 
Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed. The specific studies and 
their timing should be specified in the Appraisal Stage PID/ISDS 
 
The safeguard-related studies will be launched in early March 2018 and will be completed by May 14, 2018.

I. Key development issues and rationale for Bank involvement  
 

Niger is predominantly a rural economy. The majority of the population and the poor earn their 

living from agriculture which is the main contributor to GDP. A key objective of the Government 

of Niger is to focus on supporting rural growth with agriculture being the leading sector of the 

rural growth strategy. The government’s priority is to increase agricultural productivity. The sector 

is handicapped by inadequate extension services,1 limited use of equipment and modern inputs, 

limited control of water, a weak organization of producers, and declines in soil fertility. Extremely 

low access to rural finance is identified as one of the key impediments to modern inputs, marketing 

channels and logistics—including inadequate storage facilities and ability to process agricultural 

products which also account for low productivity in agriculture. Strengthening of the links between 

the extractive industry and the local economy is also considered a key factor to rural growth. The 

greatest potential for the extractive industry social and economic contribution is in job creation 

either through local subcontracting and/or through the development of the informal mining sector, 

such as gold panning and small-scale mining. A framework needs to be established to formalize 

the local content in the sector and the artisanal mining sector needs to be formalized and better 

organized. Community development aimed at providing social infrastructure (roads, schools, 

hospitals, and mining cities) also enhances the benefits for the rural population. They provide an 

alternative to rural employment.

d’appui conseil. Mise en place d’un dispositif intégré d’appui conseil pour le développement rural au Niger. 

Counterfactual analyses show that significant gains could be made if inefficiencies in 

infrastructure were fixed. Niger could grow by as much as 4.5 percentage points per capita if it 

expands and improves its infrastructure. Power would contribute around 1.51 percentage points to 

per capita growth if generation capacity and national access rates—which as of today are among 

the lowest in the region—were increased. ICT would also make an important contribution to 

economic prospects (1.31 percentage points), provided the mobile phone and Internet markets 

continue expanding.2 Creating a favorable environment for the private sector to invest in these 

sectors, improving access of the rural population to electricity and mobile/internet, and making 

sure that the NIGELEC, the state-owned company in electricity, remains financially viable are the 

main objectives of the Government.    

 

One of the key challenges facing Niger is to increase tax revenue. First, it will help continue 

financing Niger’s development challenges and avoid painful fiscal consolidation through cuts in 

expenditures as has been the case in the past years. Second, the current vicious circle of increasing 

public debt and interest payments represents a risk that would only be mitigated in the medium 

term under the assumption of a tightening fiscal stance. Tax policy to broaden the base, the 

rationalization of tax exemptions and the strengthening of tax and customs administration are 

among the key features of the government’s strategy. Government data show that tax expenditures 

and exemptions from the investment code -only - increased from 0.5 percent to 0.9 percent of GDP 

between 2014 and 2015. A World Bank study showed that for customs revenues only, over the 

five years from 2011 to 2016, exemptions represented 47 percent of customs revenue, on average, 

peaking at 54 percent in 2015.3  

 

Niger’s macroeconomic framework remains adequate for the proposed operation. Niger’s 

macroeconomic framework remains adequate for the proposed operation. Growth is on an upward 

trend and expected to average 5.8 percent during 2018-21. Niger has sustained its fiscal 

consolidation policy since 2016, combining enhanced revenue policy and expenditure control 

which aims to bring Niger in line with the West African Economic and Monetary Union 

(WAEMU) fiscal target by 2021. The risk of debt distress is moderate. The macro policy 

framework is underpinned by the continued implementation of the International Monetary Fund 

(IMF) Extended Credit Facility (ECF) program and the macroeconomic anchor offered by Niger’s 

membership in the WAEMU. Downside risks predominate and are mainly related to the 

vulnerability and exposure of the economy to weather, security and commodity prices. 

 

II. Proposed Objective(s) 
 

The proposed operation is the second of a series of two development policy operations to be 

disbursed over 2017-2018 under IDA 18. The operation will provide financial support to Niger as 

the authorities implement the PDES II.   

 

The proposed series is fully aligned with the government’s development strategy and priorities as 

articulated in the PDES II.  It is designed to advance a number of key PDES II objectives. Pillar 1 

supports the PDES II ’s objective of “  by 

focusing on agricultural productivity

The focus on the extractive industry in Pillar 1 supports the PDES II’s objective of “

rural economy. 

the PDES II’s objective of “ . Pillar 3, supports the PDES 

II’s objective of “Governance, Peace and Security”.    

 

 

III. Preliminary Description 
 

The program development objective (PDO) is to foster rural growth. This will be achieved 

through a series of cross-cutting reform measures grouped in two pillars. The first pillar is 

“Increasing rural productivity growth”. It aims to (i) 

strengthen the linkages between the extractive industries 

and the local economy “Supporting 

growth-enabling sectors”. It aims to (i) develop a framework favorable to ICT investment, mainly 

in rural areas; (ii) improve the financial and the technical performance of NIGELEC4; (iii) broaden 

the tax base by rationalizing tax expenditure and exemption regimes, and (iv) create the conditions 

for sustainable rural road maintenance financing framework.  

 

IV. Poverty and Social Impacts and Environment Aspects 
 

Many of the actions supported by the proposed operation are expected to have positive poverty 

reduction and welfare enhancement impacts. Improvements in the agricultural input supply chain 

(seeds and fertilizers) and on the extension service delivery will contribute to higher agricultural 

yields and therefore to improved food security while reducing economic vulnerability of rural 

households. Artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) is an important source for jobs for the rural 

population, and a way for many to complement agricultural incomes. In particular, the 

development of community projects financed by the extractive industry will impact positively the 

rural population. In addition, enforcement of existing regulation in the extractive industry will 

allow the development of a strategy to address the social, health and safety issues that are currently 

encountered in the artisanal mining areas: the child labor, the dangerous and unhealthy working 

conditions resulting in frequent accidents (collapsing tunnels and pits), the absence of adequate 

personal protective equipment. Greater access to rural finance will help producers access more 

economic opportunities.  

 

The development of the electricity and ICT sectors will create small business opportunities while 

complementing other initiatives to improve rural welfare. Potential negative impact on the poor of 

the tariff adjustment is mitigated. The majority of the poor does not have access and use electricity. 

In addition, there is already a tariff system that protects to the poor. Nonetheless, a PSIA will be 

conducted during calendar year 2018 by the NECALEP to assess the impact of the electricity 

measures and inform the government policy in the sector. Access to internet and mobile through 

the USF will allow for the expansion of e-voucher supporting social protection and subsidy 

programs targeting the poor.    

 

Some actions supported by the proposed series are expected to have a positive impact on gender

equality. The development of an action plan to better integrate Extractive Industries into the 

national economy envisages among other objectives the advancement of women in the sector. The 

formalization of the ASM will protect women and children for whom harsh working and living 

conditions are the norm The impact on gender of the prior actions on agriculture, rural finance, 

electricity and ICT will not be directly linked to the prior actions. However, their impact could 

benefit female-headed more proportionately given their more pronounced vulnerability if directed 

to hem. Increased access to electricity and broadband network is expected to benefit female-headed 

households who are more in need of new economic opportunities more proportionately. Similarly, 

the education and health reforms will allow the Government and public agencies to expand social 

services, which are critically important to women and female-headed households.  

 

Environment Aspects  

 

The proposed operation is likely to have positive effect on the Niger’s environment, forests, or 

other natural resources. Unregulated or poorly regulated artisanal mining activities in the extractive 

industries have resulted in significant environmental destruction. Such adverse impacts have been 

considered by the Government which has prepared a Strategic Environmental and Social 

Assessment (SESA) to identify and address negative (enhance positive) environmental and social 

impacts along the entire mining value chain. The SESA provides strategic guidance for enhancing 

environmental sustainability and social equity of the sector as a whole and specific 

recommendations to be incorporated into national policies and programs. The formalization of 

artisanal mining is likely to reduce such adverse impacts on the environment. Similarly, a stronger 

regulation and control of the quality of agricultural inputs will reduce potential environmental risks 

borne by unregulated seeds or fertilizers. The prior actions supporting the development of ICT, 

rural finance and the social sectors are not likely to have significant impacts on environment and 

forests

 Country and Sector Background 
 

1. Niger’s economy is undiversified, heavily relying on agriculture and the extractive 
industries. Agriculture is main driver of growth and accounts for 40 percent of GDP. The vast 

majority of Niger’s population and the poor live in rural areas and earn their living from 

agriculture. However, agricultural productivity is low due to very low uptake of modern inputs 

and poor extension services.  Niger has significant mineral wealth, including uranium and gold, 

and has started exporting refined oil products. These three products account for approximately 70 

percent of total export values. The extractive industry accounts for 10-15 percent of government 

revenue.  

2. Growth is volatile owing to frequent external shocks of different nature. Shocks 
impacting on the economy include security challenges, the Nigerian crisis, unfavorable weather 

conditions and commodity prices. Security challenges disrupted economic activities with 

growing social and humanitarian pressures linked to the flow of hundreds of thousand refugees 

and internally-displaced people. The economic downturn in Nigeria impacted export 

performance. Unfavorable weather conditions impacted agriculture, and depressed commodity 

prices adversely affected growth and revenue in the extractive industries.       

3. Although declining, poverty remains high, and is more pronounced in rural areas. Poverty 
incidence declined from 53.7 percent in 2005 to 44.5 percent in 2014. Despite the decline in 

overall poverty incidence, the rural poor became poorer relative to their urban counterparts 

during the same period. Their per capita consumption relative to that of the urban poor declined 

from 60 percent to 43 percent. Lack of economic diversification, volatile agricultural growth, 

low access to physical and institutional infrastructure, and a weak human capital base limit 

economic opportunities, especially in rural area. 

 

 Key development issues and rationale for Bank involvement  
 

4. A key objective of the Government of Niger is to focus on supporting rural growth, given 
the concentration of the poor in rural areas. Agriculture would be the leading sector supported by 

the government’s 3N initiative with a special focus on agro-industry, public investment in 

infrastructure and the social sectors. Niger is predominantly a rural economy and the majority of 

the population earn their living from agriculture. Agriculture is the main contributor to GDP but 

agricultural productivity is low compared to the secondary and tertiary sectors, to other countries 

in the region.1 The sector is handicapped by inadequate extension services,2 limited use of 

equipment and modern inputs, limited control of water, a weak organization of producers, and 

declines in soil fertility. Extremely low access to rural finance is identified as one of the key 

impediments to modern inputs, marketing channels and logistics—including inadequate storage 

facilities and ability to process agricultural products which also account for low productivity in 

agriculture. Strengthening of the links between the extractive industry and the local economy is 

also considered a key factor to rural growth. The greatest potential for the extractive industry 

social and economic contribution is in job creation either through local subcontracting and/or 

through the development of the informal mining sector, such as gold panning and small-scale 

mining. A framework needs to be established to formalize the local content in the sector and the 

artisanal mining sector needs to be formalized and better organized. Community development 

aimed at providing social infrastructure (roads, schools, hospitals, and mining cities) also 

enhances the benefits for the rural population. They provide an alternative to rural employment.  

5. Counterfactual analyses show that significant gains could be made if inefficiencies in 
infrastructure were fixed. Niger could grow by as much as 4.5 percentage points per capita if it 

expands and improves its infrastructure. Power would contribute around 1.51 percentage points 

to per capita growth if generation capacity and national access rates—which as of today are 

among the lowest in the region—were increased. ICT would also make an important contribution 

to economic prospects (1.31 percentage points), provided the mobile phone and Internet markets 

continue expanding.3 Creating a favorable environment for the private sector to invest in these 

sectors, improving access of the rural population to electricity and mobile/internet, and making 

sure that the NIGELEC, the state-owned company in electricity, remains financially viable are 

the main objectives of the Government.    

6. Niger’s domestic revenue is low, and is among the lowest in the WAEMU. One of the 
key challenges facing Niger is the need for increasing its tax revenue. First it will help continue 

financing Niger’s development challenges and avoid painful fiscal consolidation through cuts in 

expenditures as has been the case in the past years. Second, the current vicious circle of 

increasing public debt and interest payments represents a risk that would only be mitigated in the 

medium term under the assumption of a tightening fiscal stance. Government data show that tax 

         

expenditures and exemptions from the investment code -only - increased from 0.5 percent to 0.9 

percent of GDP between 2014 and 2015. A World Bank study showed that for customs revenues 

only, over the five years from 2011 to 2016, exemptions represented 47 percent of customs 

revenue, on average, peaking at 54 percent in 2015.4  

7. Niger’s macroeconomic framework remains adequate for the proposed operation. Growth 
is expected to be moderate averaging 4.5-5 percent in 2017-19 driven by agriculture and mining. 

To contain the substantial fiscal deficit of 7.5 percent in 2017, explained partly by security-

related spending, the government has initiated a process of fiscal consolidation which aims to 

bring Niger in line with the WAEMU fiscal target by 2020. The tax revenue measures included 

in this programmatic series support this consolidation effort.  This risk of debt distress is 

moderate. The macro policy framework is underpinned by the continued implementation of the 

International Monetary Fund (IMF) Extended Credit Facility (ECF) program and the 

macroeconomic anchor offered by Niger’s membership in the West African Economic and 

Monetary Union (WAEMU). Downside risks predominate and are mainly related to the 

vulnerability and exposure of the economy to weather, security, Nigeria’s economy and 

commodity prices. 

 

 Proposed Objective 
 

8. The proposed operation is the first of a series of two development policy operations to be 
disbursed over 2017-2018 under IDA 18. The operation will provide financial support to Niger 

as the authorities implement the (Plan de Développement Economique et Social) PDES II .   

9. The proposed series is fully aligned with the government’s development strategy and 
priorities as articulated in the PDES II.  It is designed to advance a number of key PDES II 

objectives. Pillar 1 supports the PDES II ’s objective of “Food security and sustainable 

agricultural development” by focusing on agricultural productivity and the dissemination of 

context-relevant farming practices. The focus on the extractive industry in Pillar 1 supports the 

PDES II’s objective of “A competitive and diversified economy” by strengthening the linkages 

between the extractive industries with the rural economy. The focus on rural finance under Pillar 

1 and infrastructure under Pillar 2 supports the PDES II’s objective of “A competitive and 

diversified economy”. Pillar 3, supports the PDES II’s objective of “Governance, Peace and 

Security”.    

 

 Preliminary Description 
 

10. The program development objective (PDO) is to foster rural growth. This will be 
achieved through a series of cross-cutting reform measures grouped in two pillars. The first pillar 

is “Increasing rural productivity growth”. It aims to (i) enhance the use of modern inputs and 

improve access to extension services systems; (ii) strengthen the linkages between the extractive 

industries and the local economy, and; (iii) deepen rural finance penetration. The second pillar is 

“Supporting growth-enabling sectors”. It aims to (i) develop a framework favorable to ICT

investment, mainly in rural areas; (ii) improve the financial and the technical performance of 

NIGELEC5, and; (iii) broaden the tax base by rationalizing tax expenditure and exemption 

regimes  

 

 Poverty and Social Impacts and Environment Aspects 
 

11. Many of the actions supported by the proposed operation are expected to have positive 
poverty reduction and welfare enhancement impacts. Improvements in the agricultural input 

supply chain (seeds and fertilizers) and on the extension service delivery will contribute to higher 

agricultural yields and therefore to improved food security while reducing economic 

vulnerability of rural households. Artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) is an important source 

for jobs for the rural population, and a way for many to complement agricultural incomes. In 

particular, the development of community projects financed by the extractive industry will 

impact positively the rural population. In addition, enforcement of existing regulation in the 

extractive industry will allow the development of a strategy to address the social, health and 

safety issues that are currently encountered in the artisanal mining areas: the child labor, the 

dangerous and unhealthy working conditions resulting in frequent accidents (collapsing tunnels 

and pits), the absence of adequate personal protective equipment. Greater access to rural finance 

will help producers access more economic opportunities.  

12. The development of the electricity and ICT sectors will create small business 
opportunities while complementing other initiatives to improve rural welfare. Potential negative 

impact on the poor of the tariff adjustment is mitigated. The majority of the poor does not have 

access and use electricity. In addition, there is already a tariff system that protects to the poor. 

Nonetheless, a PSIA will be conducted during calendar year 2018 by the NECALEP to assess the 

impact of the electricity measures and inform the government policy in the sector. Access to 

internet and mobile through the USF will allow for the expansion of e-voucher supporting social 

protection and subsidy programs targeting the poor.    

13. Some actions supported by the proposed series are expected to have a positive impact on 
gender equality. The development of an action plan to better integrate Extractive Industries into 

the national economy envisages among other objectives the advancement of women in the sector. 

The formalization of the ASM will protect women and children for whom harsh working and 

living conditions are the norm The impact on gender of the prior actions on agriculture, rural 

finance, electricity and ICT will not be directly linked to the prior actions. However, their impact 

could benefit female-headed more proportionately given their more pronounced vulnerability if 

directed to hem. Increased access to electricity and broadband network is expected to benefit 

female-headed households who are more in need of new economic opportunities more 

proportionately. Similarly, the education and health reforms will allow the Government and 

public agencies to expand social services, which are critically important to women and female-

headed households.  

 
Environment Aspects  

 

14. The proposed operation is likely to have positive effect on the Niger’s environment, 
forests, or other natural resources. Unregulated or poorly regulated artisanal mining activities in 

the extractive industries have resulted in significant environmental destruction. Such adverse 

impacts have been considered by the Government which has prepared a Strategic Environmental 

and Social Assessment (SESA) to identify and address negative (enhance positive) 

environmental and social impacts along the entire mining value chain. The SESA provides 

strategic guidance for enhancing environmental sustainability and social equity of the sector as a 

whole and specific recommendations to be incorporated into national policies and programs. The 

formalization of artisanal mining is likely to reduce such adverse impacts on the environment. 

Similarly, a stronger regulation and control of the quality of agricultural inputs will reduce 

potential environmental risks borne by unregulated seeds or fertilizers. The prior actions 

supporting the development of ICT, rural finance and the social sectors are not likely to have 

significant impacts on environment and forests

A. Introduction and Context 
 
1. Sri Lanka is a Lower Middle-Income country with a GDP per capita of USD 4,073 (2017) and a total population 
of 21.4 million people. Following 30 years of civil war that ended in 2009, Sri Lanka’s economy grew at an average 5.8 
percent during the period of 2010-2017, reflecting a peace dividend and a determined policy thrust towards 
reconstruction and growth; although there were some signs of a slowdown in the last few years. The economy is 
transitioning from a predominantly rural-based economy towards a more urbanized economy oriented around 
manufacturing and services.  Economic growth has contributed to the decline in the national poverty headcount ratio 
from 15.3 percent in 2006/07 to 4.1 percent in 2016. Extreme poverty is rare and concentrated in some geographical 
pockets. 
 
2. The Government that came to power in 2015 envisions promoting a globally competitive, export-led 
economy with an emphasis on inclusion. It has indicated keenness to undertake reforms in the areas of public finance, 
competitiveness, governance, and education sectors. In 2017, the Government presented Vision 2025, a policy 
document that both identified economic limitations due to the constrained fiscal space and presented structural 
reforms (including the promotion of private sector participation) to address key economic challenges and strengthen 
economic growth. Despite Sri Lanka’s remarkable economic achievements, many people continue to be at risk of falling 
back into poverty. 
 
3. Sri Lanka is vulnerable to climate-related natural disasters that have major economic impacts. Long-term, 
annual losses for housing, infrastructure, agriculture, and relief from natural disasters are estimated at LKR 50 billion 
(USD 327 million), with the highest annual expected losses from floods, cyclones or high winds, droughts and landslides. 
This is equivalent to 0.4 percent of GDP or 2.1 percent of GoSL expenditures. Due to the increased sophistication of the 
economy the damage caused by the 2016 and 2017 floods and landslides was more than twice as high in US$ terms 
than the worst flood disasters between 1992 and 2011. 
 

B. Sectoral and Institutional Context 
 

4. The agriculture sector remains the backbone of Sri Lanka’s culture and economy.  The agriculture sector 
contributes 7.7 percent to GDP and still employs approximately 27 percent of the population.  Of the country’s 
approximately 2.3 million hectares of agricultural land, around 80 percent is under smallholder production, with 
around 1.65 million smallholder farmers operating on average less than 2 hectares.  Sri Lanka has successfully attained 


self-sufficiency in rice through policy interventions including fertilizer subsidies. However, expenditures on vital public 
services, such as Research and Development (R&D) and extension services account for only three percent of total 
agriculture expenditure and much of this limited budget is spent on rice research. The focus on self-sufficiency in rice 
has limited farmer’s opportunities to diversify into higher value products and kept the sector concentrated in the low 
value food crops.  As a result, agriculture productivity, as measured by Total Factor Productivity (TFP), has only grown 
by an average of 0.6 percent per year since 1980 and Sri Lanka lags significantly behind other South and East Asian 
countries. Women contribute to over 38 percent of the farming operations in Sri Lanka. However, the unemployment 
rates of women are more than double that of men at all age levels, with more than 60 percent of women engaged in 
agriculture working as unpaid family labor. Furthermore, only 10 percent of female farmers receive extension services 
in comparison to 90 percent of male farmers.  
 
5. Irrigation is a key feature of the smallholder agriculture sector.  Sri Lanka has a long history of water 
management for agriculture production.  The expansion of crop cultivation into the dry zones of the north, east and 
south-east of the country was enabled through the construction of elaborate water management systems, dating back 
to the period between 500 BC and 300 AD. The systems are based on water capture in small reservoirs commonly 
known as “tanks” connected via canals into “cascades” which enabled crop cultivation throughout the country 
including those areas with long and variable dry seasons. Tank cascades remain the primary source of water for dry 
season cultivation of approximately 74,150 hectares, supporting the livelihoods of approximately 154,744 farmers.  
Recently, water scarcity has increased because of high inter-annual and inter-seasonal variability in rainfall, catchment 
area land-use changes which have reduced the proportion of rainfall available for capture in downstream tanks, and 
the growing demand for water to meet the needs of a growing population.  For example, drought in 2016 and 2017 
affected 1,927,069 people across 17 districts, according to the Disaster Management Centre. During the Maha season 
in 2016, 612,224 hectares of paddy were cultivated of which 50,615 hectares were damaged due to the drought, with 
total production of MT 2.383 million, 30 percent of the average in last ten years. 
 
6. Hotspot areas are the most vulnerable to climatic events .  Although much of the country has been subject 
to the increased frequency and severity of climate e vents, some areas have emerged as being particularly 
susceptible to either flood or drought events, or both.  These are areas which are predominantly agriculture based 
and therefore the livelihoods of smallholder farmers are at risk.  Hotspots have been identified through a rigorous, 
analysis of empirical evidence by the Department of Agrarian Development (DAD) of the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA), 
the World Food Program (WFP) and the International Water Management Institute (IWMI). 
 
7. The management of irrigation water suffers from institutional fragmentation and lack of local accountability. 
The management of irrigation tanks has undergone a transformation in the post-independence period. Community 
institutions which originally managed these tanks were initially replaced with a new GoSL-led institutional system that 
ultimately became ineffective. To overcome the top-down management of tank systems, since 1978 there have been 
experiments in Participatory Irrigation Management (PIM), involving local communities in the management of irrigation 
schemes. PIM was approved as official policy in 1992 and Farmer Organizations (FOs) were created by the Agrarian 
Services Act of 1991 to manage minor tanks. Despite this policy direction, less capacity of FOs to manage limited 
remaining water and lack of strong oversight from GoSL have compounded the situation. Within GoSL, the responsibility 
for the management of these tanks currently lies with three different institutions: Ministry of Irrigation, Water Resource 
and Disaster Management (MIWRDM); Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) and, Provincial Councils (PCs). The responsibility 
for system maintenance budgeting and implementation is shared across these institutions and FOs often with unclear 
mandates. Water user fees were removed after the independence, and GoSL started to allocate maintenance budgets 
which are insufficient to meet maintenance needs. But, FOs collect contribution from farmers and they are 
maintaining their own Operation and Maintenance (O&M) funds. 




 
8. While many of these tanks are still functioning, some are in a completely dilapidated condition and the 
overall performance is low.  Past tank rehabilitation efforts have largely failed to produce the desired results for many 
reasons. Firstly, insufficient attention has been paid to water and land use management in the upstream catchment 
areas. The supply of water from upstream catchment areas is in most cases decreasing because of land use changes, 
including deforestation and infrastructure development, which has also increased the flow of silt into the supply canals 
and tanks resulting in declined water inflows into the tanks and reduced water storage capacity in the tanks. Secondly, 
previous rehabilitation efforts have not adequately accounted for the hydraulic inter-connectedness of tanks within 
cascades resulting in sub-optimal development of water resources and negative downstream impacts. Finally, past 
rehabilitation efforts have not sufficiently factored in either growing water demand in the tank command areas or the 
likely future impacts of climate change, such that rehabilitated tanks have failed to provide enough water supply to 
meet even current demand. 
 

9. Improved access to irrigation and better water management needs to be addressed in conjunction with 
improving productivity in the sector.  Agriculture productivity is low due to an inhibiting policy framework, weak public 
services and low levels of private investment.  With rice self-sufficiency secured, a consensus has recently emerged 
within the GoSL that the country should take a more strategic approach to addressing low productivity by (i) 
modernizing water resource infrastructure, minimizing flood damages and managing water allocation more efficiently 
and (ii) diversifying the agricultural sector away from relatively low value food crops towards high value and export-
oriented commodities. In the water sector, an integrated basin approach to water investment and management needs 
to be built on integrated basin plans developed through effective stakeholder participation. As a middle-income country 
in an economically strong region, farmers can capitalize on growing domestic consumer demand for diversified, 
nutritious, and higher-valued foods and take advantage of the country’s proximity to fast growing neighboring markets. 
The GoSL has recently implemented measures to improve the competitiveness of the agriculture sector, such as 
promoting commercial and export-oriented agriculture through attracting and leveraging investments from farmer 
producer organizations and agribusinesses for high value agriculture production and value addition under the Bank-
supported Agriculture Sector Modernization Project.  
 
C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  

 
Development Objective(s) (From PAD) 
  
10. The Project Development Objective is to improve the productivity and climate resilience of smallholder 
agriculture in selected hotspot areas. 

 
Key Results 

11. The key results indicators to assess project outcomes are: 

• KPI 1: Increase in water productivity at farm level (Custom); 

• KPI 2: Increase in agriculture productivity of crops (Custom); 

• KPI 3: Crop diversification index (Custom); and 

• KPI 4: Direct project beneficiaries, segregated by gender (CRI). 
 

D. Project Description 
  
12. Theory of Change: The project will address the key problem of the vulnerability of agriculture systems in 



climatic hotspot areas of the country.  The drivers of this vulnerability are (i) lack of farmer access to reliable 
sources of irrigation water, (ii) insufficient protection of agriculture land from floods; (iii) low levels of 
diversification in agriculture production; and (iv) limited adoption of climate-smart technologies. Addressing 
these issues will involve an approach that (i) addresses expected long-term trends in climate change including 
the frequency and severity of climatic events (flood and drought); (ii) adopts a catchment scale approach to water 
management; and (iii) integrates agriculture and water by working with farmers and Farmer Organizations (FOs) 
to improve the sustainable management of water and soil resources, and promote the adoption of suitable on-
farm water management and crop production technologies. 
 
13. The proposed project interventions will introduce catchment level hydrological assessments that 
incorporate future climate change projections to assess water availability and identify appropriate investments 
for upper catchment area treatments, water harvesting, rehabilitation of irrigation systems and reduced flood 
damage. Once water availability is assessed in a river basin, watersheds, sub-watersheds, cascades and individual 
tanks, then technical designs will be carried out for the tank irrigation systems, which consist of watershed 
catchment area, tank headworks, canal system and agriculture production area. The water stored in rehabilitated 
tanks will be used to commence CSA activities. Management of irrigation schemes will be enhanced through 
improved capacity of FOs. The project would support the identification, demonstration and adoption of 
technologies to both improve water use efficiency and enable farmers to diversify their production and move 
into higher value crops. Finally, support would be provided to enable farmers to have improved market access. 
Through these interventions, as stated below, the core project objectives of improving climate resilience and 
increased productivity would be achieved. 
 

 
 
 
14. Project Beneficiaries: The primary project beneficiaries will be over 470,000 smallholder farmers in 
hotspot areas (375,000 ha) in eleven administrative districts (Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu, Anuradhapura, 
Polonnaruwa, Puttalam, Kurunegala, Trincomalee, Batticaloa, Ampara, Hambantota and Moneragala) spread 
across six provinces (Northern, North Central, North Western, Eastern, Southern and Uva) in the dry zone of Sri 


Lanka (see Project Area in Annex 9). Smallholder farmers consist of small farmers (1.0 to 2.0 ha of farm land) and 
marginal farmers (less than 1.0 ha).  They will gain knowledge and technology transfer and access to 
infrastructure assets to enhance climate resilience in farming resulting in increased revenue from crop 
diversification and participation in emerging value chains.  Many technical and managerial staff of the 
participating agencies will benefit through training and capacity building activities. The project will also promote 
participation of youth and women in all key project interventions to ensure that they would benefit from the 
project activities. 

 
15. Hot-Spot Area Development Model: Given the centrality of tanks in the agrarian livelihoods of the dry 
zone of Sri Lanka, their current levels of neglect and the increasing vulnerability of these areas to both droughts 
and floods in quick succession with consequent impacts on agricultural production and incomes, the 
rehabilitation of tank-based irrigated agricultural systems is key to improving the resilience of these areas and 
the agrarian communities that depend on them. Resilience being ‘the ability of a system to bounce back or return 
to normal functioning after adversity’,1 the Hot-Spot Area Development model aims to enhance the resilience of 
these areas and those who depend on them for their livelihoods. Climate shocks add to relatively low paddy 
productivity. Resilience will be built through stable and rising incomes of agrarian families living in these hotspot 
areas despite increasing climatic variability. The expected results of this novel model will be achieved by (1) 
flexible and adaptive management of existing and improved irrigation water storage and delivery structures to 
make irrigation more reliable in the face of rising climatic variability (including more frequent episodes of high 
intensity rainfall and flooding and/or drought); (2) better agricultural inputs, techniques and practices that will 
help farmers maximize water use efficiency given rising climatic variability – and reduce crop harvest losses; and 
(3) better access to new markets and higher prices, through marketing higher up the value chain, more 
competitive agri-enterprises and upgraded infrastructure for agricultural trade to stabilize and increase incomes 
from agricultural livelihoods. The project will prioritize nutrient-rich foods to improve year-round nutrition. 
 

16. Phasing: In view of the complexity and innovativeness of the project and to learn lessons, the project will 
be implemented in three overlapping stages. The first stage (2018–2021) will cover three Hot-Spot Areas 
(Anuradhapura, Kurunegala and Kilinochchi districts), whereas the second (2020–2023) and third (2021–2024) 
stages will cover the balance eight districts. Progress will be reviewed annually and prior to completion of every 
stage, to sanction the next stage of implementation. All project financed activities in a stage will be completed in 
3 years but the O&M activities will continue till end of the project.  

 

Project Components 

 
17. Component 1: Agriculture Production and Marketing (US$ 42 million). The objective of this component 
is to improve agriculture productivity and diversification through the adoption of CSA practices and improved 
on-farm water management. 
 
18. Component 2: Water for Agriculture (US$ 92 million). The objective of this component is to facilitate (a) 
planning for water and other infrastructure necessary to support climate-resilient irrigated agriculture, (b) 

 
construction of the planned infrastructure; and (c) co-management of this infrastructure by central/provincial 
governments and the local community. 
 
19. Component 3: Project Management (US$ 6 million). The objective of this component is to ensure the 
quality of overall project management, while ensuring smooth coordination of activity implementation by various 
agencies and strategic partners at national and subnational levels. This component will finance (i) the consultancy 
and operating costs of the PMU and DPD Offices and of different project executing agencies, including for 
fiduciary and safeguard aspects; (ii) the monitoring and evaluation of project activities at baseline, midterm and 
end of project, including geotagging of the assets created; and (iii) information, education and communication 
campaigns to make all stakeholders aware of the project. 

 
20. Component 4: Contingent Emergency Response (US$ 0.0 million). This emergency response component 
will allow for rapid reallocation of project proceeds in the event of a natural or man-made disaster or crisis that 
has caused or is likely to imminently cause a major adverse economic and/or social impact. 

 

21. Climate Co-Benefits: The project seeks to derive Climate Co-Benefits (about 95 percent) through: (i) 
enhanced water security at farm level through the rehabilitation and modernization of irrigation systems and 
improvement in water efficiency; (ii) improved soil health through the adoption of good agricultural practices to 
improve soil fertility, soil nutrient management, and promote soil carbon sequestration; and (iii) improved 
adaptation to climate risks through increased farm productivity and crop diversification. 

 

22. Project Cost and Financing: The project will be financed through a six-year Investment Project 
Financing (IPF) loan. The total project cost is US$140 million and will be funded by an IBRD loan of US$125 million, 
with the GoSL contribution of US$ 10 million to cover salary costs on parallel basis and the Beneficiaries 
contributing US$ 5 million in kind.  Retroactive financing up to an aggregate amount of US$ 5 million will be 
available for eligible expenditures incurred under all project components and all categories prior to the date of 
signed Loan Agreement, but on or after July 01, 2018. 
 
E. Implementation 
 
23. The key design features incorporated in the institutional and implementation model include: multi-
stakeholder approach - different stakeholders involved in the field of climate resilient irrigation and agriculture 
are expected to contribute to project implementation from national to sub-national levels; coordinated 
approach - stakeholders are expected to share knowledge and resources in a collaborative manner at each level; 
citizen engagement - local smallholder farmers, medium sized agribusiness owners, common interest groups, 
producer organizations, individual entrepreneurs and their customers will be involved in the planning & 
implementation of project activities, along with government counterparts, NGOs, academia and the private 
sector; consistency with the National Poverty Alleviation Programme – since the project will also work with the 
People’s Company of the Grama Shakthi Programme implemented at Grama Niladhari Division (GND) level; Use 
of existing government staff – except a few of the full-time key professionals to be recruited from the open 
market, the rest of the staff will be from existing government cadres and work on a part-time basis at both 
national and provincial levels; and gender equality - the project design and approach will take into account the 
gender dimension and ensure that the project provides equal opportunities for women to participate in the 
project cycle. 

 

24. Institutional arrangements:  The project is fully integrated in the GOSL administration, and the 
implementation is designed to capitalize on existing government agencies at national, provincial, district, 
divisional, and   Grama Niladhari Division levels. A Project Management Unit (PMU) will be established under 
the Ministry of Agriculture, whereas Deputy Project Director’s Offices (DPD Offices) will be established under 
the Ministries of Irrigation & Water Resources Management and of Provincial Councils and Local Government. 
At provincial level, there will be Provincial DPD Offices set up in each of the participating Provinces to implement 
the project. The Provincial DPD Offices will be set up under the Chief Secretaries in Kilinochchi, Kurunegala, 
Anuradhapura, Trincomalee, Hambantota and Moneragala Districts, and they will cover the district level 
activities of the respective districts. In addition, a District Unit of the DPD Office will be established under the 
District Secretary at the Office of the Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Development in Puttalam, Batticaloa, 
Mullaitivu, Polonnaruwa and Ampara Districts to coordinate all agencies operating at district level.  
 

25. There will be a Project Appraisal Team (PAT) set up at district level, and it will be coordinated by the 
District Planning Director. The PAT is an independent body and will report to the DPD. In addition, at the district 
level, there will be an advisory committee headed by the District Secretary. The Divisional secretaries of the 
participating divisions and district and divisional level heads of the government agencies, representatives of 
chamber of commerce, Associations of Farmer/Producer Organizations and NGOs will participate in the Advisory 
Committee. The Advisory Committee will guide the project implementers at the district level to implement CSIAP 
effectively. 

 
26. At Divisional level, there will be a Divisional Unit of the Provincial DPD Office set up at the Agrarian 
Service Center (ASC), and it will be headed by the Divisional Officer of the ASC. The Divisional Unit will function 
as a supporting unit to the Provincial DPD office and work closely with the District Unit to implement the Project 
effectively. The community based organizations, such as Farmer Organizations (FOs), Producer Groups (PGs), and 
Grama Shakthi People’s Company (GSPCs) operating at the Grama Niladhari Division (GND) level are the 
institutions that will be actively involved in the project together with the beneficiary farmers at the community 
level. Given the transformative nature of the project, institutional coordination across the relevant sectors is 
emerging as a critical task for the PMU in developing an effective project implementation mechanism to achieve 
convergence with other programs. The institutional arrangement is further described in Annex 2 of the PAD. 
 
27. Implementation arrangements:  Overall project implementation is the responsibility of the Ministry of 
Agriculture (MOA). Since the institutional capacity of MOA is limited and special skills are required to implement 
the complex project activities, the project will draw expertise from the Ministry of Irrigation, Water Resource 
and Disaster Management (MIWRDM), Department of Agriculture (DOA), Department of Agrarian Development 
(DAD) and Irrigation Department (ID), as well, and acquire outside expertise, including consulting services. The 
day-to-day management and operation of the project is the responsibility of the Project Management Unit 
(PMU), headed by a Project Director (PD) appointed by MOA and assisted by national level Deputy Project 
Director’s offices in MIWRDM and MSPCLG as well as provincial level Deputy Project Director’s offices. The 
project will give attention to institutional coordination across departments, agencies, and strategic partners 
involved in the implementation of project activities. Specifically, as the MoA has an existing PMU under the 
ASMP, core functions such procurement, FM and safeguards would maximize the use of existing capacity.  Overall 
project oversight is the responsibility of the National Project Steering Committee (NPSC), established in the 
Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs (MNPEA) and chaired by its Secretary. The main responsibility 
of the NPSC is to provide strategic guidance for the implementation of the project and to act as the interface 
between the central and provincial institutions. The NPSC also approves the annual work program and budget 
for the project, endorses the working arrangements with strategic partners, and is briefed by the Bank (and the 


PD) on the outcomes of implementation support and review missions carried out with the Bank team at least 
biannually. 

 
28. The PMU is responsible for ensuring that: (i) all project activities are planned, financed and 

implemented as per the project annual work program and budget, (ii) project implementation is in line with 
operational guidelines of the Project Implementation Plan (PIP), (iii) project procurement and financial 
management activities are carried out in timely manner as per the World Bank’s Procurement for IPF Borrowers 
(2016), the project fiduciary manuals and the procurement plan, and (iv) social and environmental safeguards 
applicable to the project are fully complied with. The PMU is also responsible for monitoring project activities, 
preparing the quarterly and annual project progress reports, and ensuring that all reports (including financial 
reports) are submitted to the World Bank in timely manner.  

 
 .    
F. Project location and Salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 
 

The proposed project will be implemented in 11 districts in the dry zone climate vulnerability hot spots, 
covering at least 5 major watersheds. The mean annual rainfall is under 900mm (much of it being received 
during the northeast monsoon season from November to January) and mean annual temperature ranges 
between 28°C to 32°C. Droughts that persist for more than three months are common. It has a climax 
vegetation of dry evergreen forest and moist deciduous forest, with forests giving way to a stunted, 
shrubby, drought-tolerant vegetation in its driest parts. The forests found in most parts are secondary 
vegetation, which developed after hundreds of years of repeated clearing and cultivation. The natural 
vegetation has adapted to the annual change from flood to drought. The forests have been largely cleared 
for agriculture, timber or grazing, and many of the dry evergreen forests have been significantly degraded. 
Several protected areas have been established to protect some of remaining natural forests. Agriculture, 
settlements and other development activities have fragmented most of the forests giving rise to human-
wildlife conflicts, particularly with elephants. Overall, about 30% of Sri Lanka’s labor force is engaged in 
agriculture, and in the dry zone that has been the frontier for irrigation based development, directly or 
indirectly connecting entire population to agriculture. However, most farm households have multiple 
livelihood strategies as income from one source is insufficient for living. The predominant form of 
settlement in the project area is ‘village’ organized around a tank that is part of a cascade system. Although 
many of these small tank based villages have been incorporated into large and medium scale irrigated 
agricultural development schemes managed by the government, a substantial number of tank-villages that 
are rain-fed, persists. Most settlers in the project area have been granted land ownership and smallholdings 
predominate, and sub-division and fragmentation is common in tandem with the occurrence of large 
operational holdings – all devoted to food crop cultivation. Irrigation communities in the dry zone are 
connected with the government system of administration and management, including for irrigation 
management. Additionally, highland agriculture and illegal slash and burn agriculture also can be observed 
alongside small-scale inland fishery activities which take place in man-made tanks.

SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY 

 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

In order to mitigate potential environmental and 
social impacts that may be caused due to physical 
interventions and to ensure all negative impacts 
associated with project investments are avoided 
and/or mitigated, appropriate environmental and 
social management measures will be guided by the 
EAMF. The EAMF provides detailed analysis of the 
scale of due diligence required (such as 
environmental assessments, environmental 
management plans, etc.) for potential activities 
under the project. Additionally, a RPF has been 
prepared to identify and mitigate land-related social 
impacts under the Project. A ToR for the proposed 
Strategic Environmental Social Assessment (SESA) 
has also been included in the EAMF. SESA will inform 
the mini-watershed planning process to ensure 
broader watershed-level impacts are integrated into 
the planning process. 

Performance Standards for Private Sector 
Activities OP/BP 4.03 

No 
There will not be any financing of private sector 
entities under this project and therefore this policy is 
not applicable for this project. 

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 Yes 

OP4.04 applies to all types of natural habitats 
including natural forests. There is the possibility of 
impacting catchment forests due to dam 
rehabilitation activities. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 Yes 

Project-supported agricultural activities will take 
place on existing agricultural areas and there will be 
no expansion into forest areas. No activities on 
commercial forestry is supported by the project. 
However, dam improvement work may impact some 
of the catchment forests.  There will be watershed 
protection activities, which would have positive 
impact on forests. These impacts will be managed 



through the safeguard instruments that will be 
developed under OP 4.01 and OP 4.37. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

Because of the standardization, intensification and 
diversification of agricultural activities under the 
project, changes in the application of pesticides for 
pest and disease control are foreseen. It is not clear 
at this point, if the project would finance the 
procurement of pesticides. A Pest Management Plan 
(PMP) that has been prepared under the Agriculture 
Modernization Project building on Integrated Pest 
Management (IPM) principles has been adopted by 
this project. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 No 

As of now, no project activities are expected in the 
vicinity of or affect physical cultural resources (PCR), 
as defined by OP 4.11.  There are also no new 
construction of irrigation infrastructure planned. 
Mitigation measures if any activity takes place closer 
to PCRs and measures on PCR chance finds will be 
included as part of the mitigation measures defined 
in EAMF under the OP 4.01. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 No 
There is no conclusive evidence/information 
available that establishes the presence of indigenous 
people in the project area. 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

The project will support civil works and other 
activities associated with construction, rehabilitation 
and reconstruction of small-scale market 
infrastructure, tank systems, water harvesting 
structures, irrigation schemes, etc. At present, these 
activities are envisaged to take place on existing 
canals and schemes or land belonging to individual 
farmers, and the need for taking private land under 
the project is not expected. However, there may be 
need for additional land, albeit minimal, for 
catchment area treatment, reestablishment of canal 
reservations, and rehabilitation/reconstruction of 
irrigation schemes. Further, there may be 
encroachers or others using the land necessary for 
the civil works thus requiring adequate mitigation 
measures to be put in place during project 
implementation.  Accordingly, a Resettlement Policy 
Framework (RPF) has been prepared in accordance 
with OP/BP 4.12. Further, to support the mini-
watershed planning process, a ToR for the proposed 
Strategic Environmental Social Assessment (SESA) 
has also been included in the EAMF. 


Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 Yes 

The project plans to improve and rehabilitate small 
dams and the EAMF will include the process to be 
adopted on safety of dams including required 
expertise under the OP/BP 4.01. irrigation schemes 
to be reconstructed/rehabilitated would entail 
minor works to improve existing capacity of the 
tanks to ensure the cascade system functions 
efficiently. The Dam Safety and Water Resources 
Management Project financed by the World Bank  
has already rehabilitated most of the larger tanks 
and their respective dams and has also set up dam 
safety panel to monitor the interventions and 
operations. They will continue to provide guidance 
to the decisions that will be taken on this project.  All 
the requirements applicable to the project will be 
identified early during the implementation stage so 
that all the necessary plans and organization set-up 
are completed on time. 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

No 
The proposed project activities do not have any 
impacts to the international waterways and 
therefore this policy is not triggered. 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No 
There are no disputed areas where project 
interventions are undertaken and therefore this 
policy is not triggered. 

 
 

KEY SAFEGUARD POLICY ISSUES AND THEIR MANAGEMENT 

 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential 
large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
The project area covers hot spot areas spanning Ampara, Batticaloa, Trincomalee, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu, 
Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Puttalam, Kurunegala, Hambantota and Moneragala Districts in Eastern, Northern, 
North Central, North Western, and Uva Provinces. The first stage of the Project (2018-2021) will cover three Hot Spot 
Areas, whereas the second stage of the project (2020-2022) and third (2022-2024) will cover the balance eight 
districts. However, the exact locations for the specific interventions under the Project have not been identified, and 
the selection of activities will be determined only during implementation.  
 
The project is classified as an Environmental Category B.  It is expected to bring positive environmental and social 
benefits to the project areas through the scale-up of climate-resilient agricultural technologies and farming practices 
that help improve soil health, water-use efficiency and crop products, catchment area treatment to promote more 
efficient use of surface water and more sustainable use of groundwater for agriculture and development of waterbody 
capacity of climate hotspots, and overall improvement in the productivity of small-holder farmers. Components 1 and 
2 may involve physical activities that could have adverse environmental and social impacts if these aspects are not 

 

fully integrated into hot-spot area development plans and negative environmental and social risks are not identified 
and mitigated properly. Likewise, some activities supported under the project, such as small scale market 
infrastructure, construction and rehabilitation of irrigation canals, water storage facilities, etc.,  are likely to cause 
social risks and impacts, including land acquisition, impacts on livelihoods, loss of assets, etc. Although the project 
activities will be confined to rehabilitation of existing infrastructure and support to existing farmlands, some of the 
project districts consists of known physical cultural resources that can be impacted during works carried out under the 
Project. 
 
The promotion of climate smart agriculture systems and related value chains under the project could also lead to 
changes in the application of pesticides for pest and disease control. At present, project-supported climate-smart 
agricultural activities are envisaged to take place on existing farmland, and no expansion or creation of new 
agriculture systems into fragile habitats is foreseen. Likewise, the project will bring improvements to watershed 
protection and promote agricultural practices that are expected to reduce pressure on natural habitats and the 
likelihood of encroachment into sensitive ecosystems. However, some activities may negatively impact natural 
habitats because of the proximity of project activities, such as the construction or upgrading of rural infrastructure. 
The project plans to undertake catchment treatment as part of village-level watershed plans to make them more 
climate resilient and, which may bring positive impacts on natural forests in the upper catchment areas due to 
additional protection measures. Such areas that require additional protection related activities are expected to be 
identified through SESAs.  
 
Some negative impacts to forests are expected during tank rehabilitation work and while the project will primarily 
support the increase in the storage capacity of tanks through removal of excess sedimentation and establishment of 
mechanisms to reduce future sedimentation, some inundation of forests may still be possible, particularly in those 
areas where small tanks have been abandoned and natural forest regeneration has taken place on the tank bed.  
 
 
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area: 
Based on the available information, no potential indirect negative environmental or social impacts are expected under 
the project.The project interventions will spread across 11 hotspot areas where the nature/scope of future activities is 
presently not known. Regardless, the SESA proposed to be carried out during implementation for each hotspot will 
help in identifying any indirect and/or long-term impacts of future activities and mitigating such impacts as part of 
project interventions. 
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts. 
Alternatives to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts can be considered only during implementation once the 
project area and the specific activities are known. In principle however, the EAMF and the RPF include measures that 
need to be adopted in order to avoid or minimize adverse impacts. For instance, a 'negative list' has been prepared 
under the EAMF which among others indicates types of sub-projects that will not be financed under the project (e.g., 
activities that involve significant conversion or degradation of critical natural habitats, activities that would increase 
human-wildlife conflict, construction of large new infrastructure within or directly adjacent (in buffer zones) to 
protected areas, etc). Likewise, to avoid impacts of land acquisition, the RPF indicates that to the extent possible, sub-
project activities will be carried out in the existing footprint of the infrastructure facility, utilize public land or land that 
is voluntarily donated, and only in exceptional basis will there be acquisition of private land under the Project. 
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower 


capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
An Environmental Assessment and Management Framework (EAMF) has been prepared to guide the screening of 
activities for physical investments, technical assistance, project supported-advisory, and policy support interventions 
and resulting implementation from an environmental perspective and mitigation actions to manage their 
environmental impacts. The EAMF defines the screening and decision-making process based on the screening, the 
content, procedures and responsibilities for the preparation and implementation of individual sub-project 
Environmental Assessments (EAs) and Environmental Management Plans (EMPs) to address site-specific risks and 
impacts and subsequent monitoring and reporting requirements. The EAMF also includes sectoral environmental 
management guidelines for the subsectors of agricultural processing, which will be applicable under the matching 
grant program. To ensure impacts to natural habitats are mitigated, the EAMF prescribes proper due diligence 
mechanisms, including relevant preventive and mitigation measures to protect local ecosystems and habitats to be 
included in the respective sub-project EMPs with special attention given to ensure risks and impacts due to human-
elephant conflict are mitigated where such conflicts exist and using successful co-existence models that already have 
been demonstrated within the country. In order to ensure negative impacts to forests are minimized, the EAMF 
includes screening criteria and relevant mitigation measures. In addition, a separate Pest Management Plan (PMP) 
prepared under the Agriculture Modernization Project developed based on Integrated Pest Management (IPM) 
principles has been adopted by this project.  
 
Likewise, the RPF sets out principles and guidelines to identify and assess the potential social impacts and risks, 
prepare mitigation plans as part of sub-project preparation, institutional arrangements and processes to be followed 
for the Project. This includes: (i) principles and procedures for screening and assessing impacts; (ii) the criterion and 
due diligence processes based on risks, including the provisions for entitlements and eligibility criteria; (iii) guidelines 
for preparing time-bound action plans to ensure compliance with WB's OP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement and 
national regulations relating to land acquisition; (iv) institutional arrangements for implementing resettlement action 
plans; (v) guidance for public consultation process and disclosure of safeguard documents; (vi) mechanisms for 
grievance redress, monitoring and evaluation of process and outcomes; and (vii) responsibilities of the GoSL and WB in 
relation to the preparation, implementation and progress review of social safeguards documents for the various CSIAP 
sub-projects.  
 
In addition to the EAMF and the RPF, as part of hot-spot area development, Strategic Environmental and Social 
Assessments (SESAs) will be undertaken to be integrated into the village-level plans. All irrigation infrastructure 
related interventions require a screening to be included in the SESA to verify whether upstream medium to large scale 
dams are present and connected hydrologically and to assess their dam safety status and, if needed, outline follow-up 
actions. If the presence of upstream and hydrologically connected dams is confirmed and these have not been 
rehabilitated or strengthened and have dam safety implications, the project will undertake an inspection and 
evaluation of the safety of the dam, its appurtenances, and its performance history, and a review and evaluation of 
the mandated dam owner’s operation and maintenance procedures. A report will be provided on the review’s 
findings, including recommendations for any remedial work or safety-related measures necessary to upgrade the 
existing dam to an acceptable standard of safety.  Necessary dam safety measures or remedial work will be financed 
under the project. When substantial remedial work is needed, these will be undertaken, including recruitment of a 
competent professional to design and supervise the work, and the Dam Safety Panels established under the 
Department of Irrigation and Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka will provide the guidance and continuous due diligence 
as necessary. As part of SESAs, physical cultural resources will be documented, and the EAMF includes screening 
criteria to ensure sub-projects will not produce any negative impacts to such resources. The EAMF also includes 
procedures to be adopted during a chance find.  
 


In terms of capacity, the Ministry of Agriculture has recently been exposed to world Bank-financed Project while the 
Irrigation Department has two ongoing operations supported by the Bank. In addition, some of the provincial councils 
(e.g., Northern and Eastern) have been involved in World Bank financed operations. However, a comprehensive 
capacity building program for implementation of safeguards instruments prepared under the Project as well as the 
social and environmental management within the sector, will be prepared during implementation. 
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, 
with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
The primary key stakeholders are smallholder farmers, producer organizations, productive alliances, agribusiness 
entrepreneurs, implementing organizations, government departments/units, including technical and managerial staff 
of participating agencies. The project will actively promote youth and women in all key project interventions to ensure 
that they are fully engaged in and also benefit from all project activities.  
 
During the preparation of the safeguards instruments, consultations were held on 18 June 2018 in Anuradhapura and 
on 21 June 2018 in Colombo, and feedback received during these consultations have been included as part of project 
design and minutes of the consultations with details of the participants, have been included as part the RPF. 
Additionally, the EAMF and the RPF also include consultation strategy which among others emphasizes that all 
stakeholders will be consulted in a culturally appropriate manner while preparing site-specific safeguards instruments 
as well as during implementation. The process of consultation will be documented and account taken of the results of 
consultatoins, including any agreed actions resulting from the consultation. The RPF and the EAMF also requires that 
all the social and environmental assessment documentation and site specific safeguards action plans (e.g., EMP, SIMP, 
RAP) will be made available to the public by the PMU through the project website and notices through media (as 
relevant), prior to start of civil works, and or tending of works contract. The EAMF and the RPF have also been 
disclosed in-country as well as through World Bank's external website.

Corporate Review Decision Following the corporate review, the decision was taken to 
proceed with the preparation of the operation. 

 

I. Key development issues and rationale for Bank involvement  
 
1. Benin is one of the world’s least-developed countries, with an annual per capita income of 
approximately US$830 in 2017. Poverty remains widespread, with a poverty rate estimated at about 48 
percent ($1.90 a day poverty line – 2011 PPP) in 2017.  With an average per capita GDP growth rate of 1.3 
percent (2005-2015) driven primarily by the services sector, poverty reduction has been limited, 
highlighting the need to ensure a broad-based and stronger growth. There are significant regional 
disparities in poverty rates and rural poverty rates are higher than those in urban areas. Fewer female-
headed households fall below the national poverty line than male-headed households.  
 
2. The country’s economic performance has been hampered by low competitiveness and high 
informality.  Following the temporary slowdown experienced in 2015, economy activity rebounded driven 
by the recovery of private consumption and supported by increased cotton production, strong activity at 
the Port of Cotonou, and rising telecommunications and transport sector activity. However, economic 
performance in Benin remains hampered by a weak business enabling environment. The high cost and 
unpredictable supply of electricity is a key constraint for private sector development. Agriculture’s export 
is concentrated in the cotton sector, and agriculture suffers from supply chain deficiencies, including in 
the provision and distribution of inputs as well as on the marketing side. Approximately 90 percent of the 
labor force is engaged in the informal sector – agriculture, informal commerce and other services 
activities. 
 
3. The first pillar of the Fiscal Reform and Growth series on fiscal consolidation is justified given the 
Government’s effort to create fiscal space and improve the efficiency of public spending. In the run-up 
to 2016 Presidential elections, increases in the wage bill and out-of-budget expenses led to significant 
increases in public debt (up by almost 20 percent of GDP) and in the fiscal deficit (up from 2.1 percent of 
GDP in 2014 to 8 percent in 2015). The Government contained expenditures in 2016 to face the drop of 

tax revenues and managed to reduce the fiscal deficit from 8 percent of GDP in 2015 to 6 percent of GDP 
in 2016.  In 2017, several measures were implemented to boost domestic revenues and reduce primary 
current spending and the fiscal deficit remained stable despite a surge in public investment spending. The 
DPO series supports the authorities’ effort to create fiscal space by improving revenue collection and 
managing more efficiently public expenditure, with an emphasis on wages and transfers.  In addition to 
the DPOs, the Government program is supported by an ECF program with the IMF approved by the IMF 
Board on April 7, 2017, providing macroeconomic and fiscal anchors that will support the implementation 
of the reforms. The first review of the Program, carried out in September 2017, confirmed that the 
authorities are committed to responsible fiscal management. This was also confirmed (at the staff level) 
by the preliminary results of the second review of the Program, which is currently under way. 

 
4. The second pillar aims at promoting agricultural productivity and strengthening the power sector 
which is a Government’s priority to create productive formal jobs and support inclusive growth. 
Agriculture employs over 50 percent of the population and is the economy’s leading formal sector foreign 
exchange earner. The country has a large endowment of arable and fertile land and adequate water 
resources. However, Benin’s comparative advantage in agriculture remains largely unexploited as the 
governance structure and relatively low food-safety standards had a negative impact on the sector’s 
competitiveness. Also, the inconsistent supply of electricity is frequently noted as a leading constraint to 
private sector growth, particularly in the light manufacturing and agricultural processing sectors. 
Strengthening the financial viability of the power sector and promote private sector participation is 
essential to increase electricity production capacity in a sustainable way. Focusing on these important real 
sectors will help improve productivity, create higher paying jobs and livelihoods, and enhance the 
country’s effort to reach the World Bank’s twin goals of poverty reduction and shared prosperity. 
 
5. The third pillar supports the Government’s efforts to improve the delivery of social services, 
both in terms of equity and quality.  Although Benin has recorded some progress in terms of access to 
education and health services over the past decade, significant variations persist depending on the income 
groups and locations. The reforms supported in this pillar will help addressing this issue. In addition, the 
recent SCD, and other studies, has identified that one major constraint in the delivery of better social 
services lies in the excessive concentration of responsibilities at the central level.  The Government has 
launched a series of initiatives aimed at increasing the role of local government and communities and at 
improving the allocation of public resources across regions. The proposed operation will support these 
initiatives. 
 

II. Proposed Objective(s) 
 
5. The overarching goal of the proposed FRGC series is to boost real economic growth, reduce poverty 
and increase opportunities for the poorest in the population. The program development objectives of 
this FRGC series are to: a) support macroeconomic stability by strengthening fiscal management; b) 
promote economic growth by increasing the productivity and competitiveness of the agricultural sector 
and strengthening the power sector’s financial viability and production capacity; and c) improve social 
service delivery.  
 

III. Preliminary Description 
 
6. The first pillar of the DPO series will focus on supporting macroeconomic stability by strengthening 
fiscal management. Not only is adequacy of the macroeconomic and fiscal framework a prerequisite for 
sustainable economic growth but budgetary and debt sustainability is necessary to the delivery of 



effective public services that maximize the impact of available revenues on beneficiaries, including the 
poorest segments of the populations. In addition, increasing fiscal space will help relax fiscal constraints 
to accommodate the financing of needed infrastructure projects.  
 
7. The second pillar will seek to promote economic growth by increasing the productivity of the 
agricultural sector and strengthening the power sector’s financial viability and production capacity. This 
series focuses on measures aimed at increasing the productivity of the agricultural sector by supporting a 
policy, regulatory, and institutional framework that strengthens agriculture value chains and enhances 
diversification, promotes higher quality standards for agricultural products and supports greater access 
to credit in the primary sector. Moreover, the measures supported by the operation strengthen the 
financial viability of the power sector that is necessary to attract private sector participation and, thus, 
increase electricity production capacity, including in renewables, and access to electricity in a sustainable 
way. 
 
8. The third pillar contributes to addressing the key constraints to a more sustainable, efficient 
and equitable allocation of resources to build and maintain the human capital of Beninese adults and 
children. The measures supported under this pillar address two main issues: (i) the geographically uneven 
deployment of qualified primary teachers and health workers, and (ii) the limited and unpredictable 
resources allocated by the central government to communities to finance non-salary inputs and 
investments necessary to maintain quality service delivery. In particular, the proposed pillar supports the 
Government’s efforts to deploy teachers and health workers to underserved communities and ensure 
that local governments receive a sufficient and regular flow of funds to meet priority social sector needs, 
particularly those for the poorest members of communities served.  
 

 

IV. Poverty and Social Impacts and Environment Aspects 
 
Poverty and Social Impacts 
 
9. The FRG series is expected to have a positive impact on poverty reduction through different 
channels. This impact has been strengthened by the inclusion of the third pillar on human capital 
development that could have both a direct and indirect influence on the level and distribution of poverty.  
 
10.  Prior Actions 1 to 3 support measures to create fiscal space and are expected to facilitate the 
delivery of essential public services and to contribute to a macroeconomic environment conducive to 
economic growth and private sector employment creation. A stable and predictable macroeconomic 
environment is necessary to limit uncertainty, to attract and sustain both domestic and foreign 
investment, to grow the formal economy and to generate increasingly productive employment 
opportunities. Furthermore, the creation of fiscal space allows for an increased allocation of fiscal 
resources to the delivery of essential social services, a direct contribution to poverty reduction and 
improved quality of life. Increased fiscal space also allows for implementation of the Government’s public 
investment plans, which is conducive to the crowding-in of increased levels of private investment. As 
noted, the failure of growth to lead to poverty reduction in Benin largely reflects the highly informal 
nature of the economy and the lack of high productivity, high wage and secure employment opportunities. 
Fiscal and debt sustainability, and the macroeconomic certainty it engenders, along with better 
infrastructure and improved delivery of essential services will encourage and foster economic growth that 
is more formal in nature and thus more effective in reducing poverty.  
 



11. Prior Action 2 provides a potential exception, as the recommendations of the tax expenditure 
analysis have not been finalized yet and could entail removing exemptions that benefit the poor. 
Eighteen percent of taxes expenditure on VAT are related to basic foods; removing these exemptions 
could possibly have negative distributional impact on the poor. However, this scenario is unlikely given 
that tax exemptions on basic foods are regulated by a regional policy. In case some recommendations of 
the tax expenditure analysis suggest removing exemptions that potentially benefit the poor, a 
distributional impact analysis will be carried out to inform the Poverty and Social Impact Assessment 
(PSIA).  
 
12. Prior action 4, 5, and 6 focus on increasing agricultural productivity and competitiveness and 
contribute to the Government’s poverty reduction goals. In 2015, 60 percent of the rural population lived 
below the US$1.90 per day poverty line. As the rural population share is greater than the urban share, 65 
percent of the poor reside in rural areas. As noted previously, limited agricultural growth (around 3.5 
percent per year, which is approximately the rate of population growth in the country) has contributed to 
overall growth, but the impact on poverty reduction has been limited. Diversifying production into more 
valuable crops, and raising productivity should boost incomes among those involved in agriculture. 
 
13. Prior actions supported in the power sector pillar promote reliable access to electricity and a 
more cost-effective electricity provision and should have a direct and positive impact on the poor. As 
discussed above, only 29 percent of Benin’s households have access to electricity, and due to the 
significant disparities between urban and rural areas, only 6 percent of the rural population has access to 
electricity. The measures supported under this series will support the financial viability of the power 
sector which is a necessary condition to attract private investments, increase power production, improve 
power transmission and distribution, and ultimately improve access to electricity in Benin. Increased 
access to electricity is strongly correlated with improved education and health outcomes and associated 
increases in human capital and earning potential. Furthermore, access to electricity liberates non-paid 
family time demands, particularly for women and girls, and further increases quality of life and 
opportunities for investment in human capital, including in girls and women. Increased and more reliable 
access at affordable prices should also have a significant impact on firm creation, firm growth and 
resultant employment opportunities, particularly in the higher productivity formal sector. 
 
14. A full-fledged PSIA has been carried out to assess the potential impact of electricity pricing 
reforms in Benin. The PSIA concluded that improving the financial situation of the SBEE and thus reducing 
the gap between SBEE’s service unit cost and revenues per kWh are prerequisites for the expansion of 
SBEE operations throughout the country and greater access for poor households to electricity. The PSIA 
study also concluded that the current social policy of subsidizing the tariff for the poor is not effective and 
suggested some possible options to strengthen the policy including adopting a tariff policy based on usage 
and eliminating fixed costs for small customers. 

 
15. Prior action 9 provides measures to improve education service delivery is expected to have 
indirect positive effects on poverty reduction. Schools quality play a determinant role in education 
outcomes. The 2017 SCD concluded that low human capital contributes to income inequality, undermines 
long term economic growth and the prospects of the poor to realize shared prosperity. Improving school 
quality (through the pupil to teacher ratio) is likely to improve learning outcomes and increases grade 
attainment. As education outcomes improve for the poor, their will have better job opportunities that 
offer higher earnings and security.  

 



16. Prior action 10 supports the improvement of health services in rural areas through the 
recruitment of new health workers. Providing affordable health care service to the poor remains a 
challenge in Benin particularly in the rural areas.  Addressing health care needs of the poor requires a 
multidimensional strategy integrating availability of health services, their quality, geographic and financial 
accessibility. While the provision of new health workers will improve availability of health services in rural 
areas, we do not expect this measure alone to improve significantly health outcomes for the poor. 
 
17. Prior action 11 aims at strengthening social safety net programs through the promotion cash 
transfer which is expected to have substantial positive impact on poverty reduction in the short term. 
There is a body of evidence around the world that well-designed cash transfers program substantially 
improves lives of the poor including higher levels of asset holdings, consumption, food security, 
employment, income and saving. However recent studies show the impacts of conditional or 
unconditional cash transfers on living standard are transitory and fade away in the long run.   
 
Environment Aspects  
 
13. The policies supported by the proposed DPF are not likely to have negative impacts on the country’s 
natural assets. All the actions supported throughout the first operation are policy-oriented; they do not 
support environmentally impactful investments or involve policy actions with significant environmental 
consequences.  The measures supporting domestic resource mobilization and efficient management of 
public expenditure pose no risk to the environment. Measures designed to strengthen economic 
competitiveness are also largely environmentally neutral.  
 
14. Strengthening the financial viability of the power sector will support increased access to electricity 
and is expected to have a positive environmental impact. Households in Benin, particularly rural 
households, are highly dependent on biomass for their daily energy requirements. The reform program 
supported under the energy sector is likely to have positive environmental impacts and would help in the 
reduction of greenhouse gases occasioned by the predominance of fuel biomass (fuelwood, charcoal and 
plant wastes). Strengthening the financial viability of the power sector is likely to produce climate change 
mitigation co-benefit, since strengthening the financial viability of the sector is likely to promote the 
development of new energy efficient production capacities.  In the agricultural sector, measures intended 
to diversify agriculture away from a reliance on cotton could have a potentially positive environmental 
effect as agriculture becomes less mono-culture based and increasingly diversified. 
 
15. Over the last 20 years, the Government has made significant strides in mainstreaming 
environmental sustainability in projects. EIA is a legal requirement and it is widely applied to all 
developmental projects.  Environmental assessment is a necessary condition to obtain the approval to 
implement any development project. It has been set up in the Law N° 98-30 relating to the environmental 
framework and in the Decree N° 2001-235 relating to the environmental assessment procedures. The 
national environmental protection agency (ABE) has the capacity to implement, monitor, and report on 
mitigating measures and/or environmental and social management plans; and have been working in 
direct collaborations with the environmental and social specialists of the Bank funded projects.

B. Introduction and Context 
 

Country Context 
 
1. India continues to be one of the world’s fastest growing large economies and has experienced a 

substantial decline in poverty. The Indian economy registered gradually rising growth from 5.5 
percent in 2012-13 to 8 percent in 2015-16. This was supported by robust private consumption, a 
resilient services sector, and some revival in industrial activity. Since the 2000s, India has made 
remarkable progress in reducing absolute poverty. Between 2004 and 2011, poverty declined sharply 
from 38.9 to 21.6 percent at the international poverty line ($1.90 PPP/day). With over a 100 million 
people escaping poverty, the pace of poverty reduction in India exceeded that of the developing world 
as well as that of Middle Income Countries (MICs) in this period. High economic growth, rapid rise in 
rural wages, greater rural-urban integration and increase in non-farm activity, especially construction, 
were the key drivers of poverty reduction. Since 2011, robust economic growth may have aided 
further reduction in poverty. However, trends in the construction sector and rural wages suggest that 
the pace of poverty reduction may have moderated. 

 
Sectoral and Institutional Context 

 
2. Agriculture continues to be important for rural Indians and there are 68 percent of the rural 

population dependent on it for livelihoods and about 49 percent of the labor force works in the 
agricultural sector but paradoxically it contributes only around 10 to 11 % to National gross domestic 
product (GDP). The Government of India’s new agenda of “Doubling Farmer’s Income”, which not only 
emphasizes upon productivity enhancement, intensification and diversification but also on agri-
processing, Agri-logistics, resource use efficiency, agriculture marketing and sustainability could 
possibly transform the Indian Agriculture. The opportunities in the agribusiness sector and local level 
primary value addition are growing with the changing consumer basket and increasing urbanization 
and demand for diversified and nutritious foods. Small producers have the opportunity to directly 
participate in this value chain if they are organized and provided with appropriate infrastructure, 
technology and information support. 



3. Non-farm economy, in recent times, has emerged as an important livelihoods source in rural 
India. A shift away from agriculture toward nonagricultural wage employment and reduced reliance 
on agricultural income has become evident. Non- farm activities contributed 65% rural income in 
2016-17 (Chand, 2017). Diversification into non-farm interventions (both self-employment and 
wage employment) marks the shift from low-productivity jobs to high productivity and it is an 
important pathway for poverty reduction and employment generation. Non-farm rural jobs are 
predominantly in manufacturing, services (including public administration, education, health, 
community, other personal or household services) and trade and transport (including wholesale 
and retail trade, hotels, restaurants, transport, storage and warehousing and communication).  
 

4. The Ministry of Rural Development, Government of India launched the National Rural Livelihood 
Mission in 2011 as its flagship program to enhance rural livelihoods and reduce rural poverty in the 
country. The world bank supported National Rural Livelihoods Project provided intensive support 
to the launch and scale up of the NRLM over the last 7 years. The National Rural Livelihood Mission 
(NRLM) has now been scaled up to o all 29 states of the country.  The intensive approach 
successfully demonstrated by NRLP in around 500 blocks is now being implemented across nearly 
2500 blocks across 29 states through the NRLM program. A total of 45 million rural women are 
currently part of Self-Help Groups and they have cumulatively leveraged nearly 25 billion USD of 
financing from commercial banks since the launch of the NRLM program in 2011.  

 
5. Ministry of Rural Development has subsequently launched two critical programs that aim to 

leverage the National Rural Livelihood Mission and scale up efforts to enhance agriculture incomes 
and on-farm incomes for the rural poor namely the Mahila Kisan Sashiktikaran Program (MKSP ) 
and the Startup Village Entrepreneurship program . The Mahila Kisan Sashaktikaran Pariyojana 
(MKSP) is launched as a sub-component of the Deendayal Antodaya Yojana-NRLM to improve the 
status of women in agriculture, who constitute 33% of the total agricultural labour force, and 
enhance economic opportunities available to them. The program exclusively focus upon small and 
marginal farmers, sustainable agriculture practices and vulnerability reduction. Community 
Resource Persons (CRP) are identified as best practitioners (locally named as Pashu Sakhi, Krishi 
Sakhi etc.) and are instrumental in promoting farm sector livelihoods (agriculture, animal 
husbandry and NTFP), through community to community sharing and learning – as a “proof of 
concept”. The ‘Start-up Village Entrepreneurship Programme’ (SVEP) launched by Government of 
India in 2014-15 aims to promote and support existing rural entrepreneurs by providing bouquet 
of business development services including entrepreneur capacity building, seed & growth capital 
along with handholding support for business development. Currently, the programme is being 
implemented in 47 Blocks across 14 states with support of 5 technical support agencies. Results 
from SVEP and other world bank supported programs to promote SMEs will inform the scaling up 
of enterprise development initiatives to be taken up under NRETP ( NRLP-AF) 

 
6. The Government of India has recently launched Mission Antyodaya to improve the well-being of 10 

million households from 5000 economic clusters (covering around 50,000 Gram Panchayats) by 
addressing multiple dimensions of poverty through convergent actions under wide range of existing 
development schemes and following a saturation approach. The movement of Panchayats away 
from poverty will be tracked through a mobile based application i.e. “Panchayat Darpan” using a 
set of indicators having differential weightage scheme. In a list of 24 indicators, 30% weightage has 
been provided on GP level Infrastructure development; another 30% on Human Development 
outcomes and rest 40% weightage has been given to livelihoods promotion. Mission Antyodaya 
further accelerates economic transformation process building on the NRLP outcomes 



 
7. One of the central lessons learned during the last seven years of implementation of NRLM has been 

that while investments in building institutional platforms of rural poor households is a critical 
foundation for sustainable poverty reduction, it is not sufficient unless these institutions are 
engaged in higher level production systems and have better market interface. Integration of core 
social mobilization and leveraging of financial resources have been adequately demonstrated. The 
next level challenge is to leverage social capital into economic opportunities and crowd in private 
investments; and engage with more commercial partnerships to integrate rural households into 
higher-level income opportunities. Therefore, one of the main thrusts of the NRETP (NRLP- AF) will 
be to develop value chains using end-to-end investments in selected commodities and facilitating 
access to finance to support enterprises in agriculture and allied sectors, thus contributing to 
productivity and profitability. The proposed project will build on existing investments and 
institutional capital to bring further income increase and inclusive growth in rural areas.

D. Project Description  
        
Project Beneficiary:  

1. The proposed NRETP (NRLP AF) intends to support 100 districts from the existing 13 NRLP States 
towards high end technical assistance and investment support towards deepening and scaling up of 
the economic transformative initiatives that were introduced as part of dedicated funds under NRLP. 

 
1 Define technical and financial services that will be provided/considered  



Additionally, it would support to the Mission Antyodaya program that intends to further accelerate 
economic transformation in selected areas, building on the NRLP outcomes.  

 
2. While MoRD through their own increased budget allocation would continue to saturate and bring 

remaining rural poor into the fold of women SHGs,  the specific investments under additional financing  
will work with targeted households that are already part of SHGs and would focus on strengthening 
of existing network (higher level federations i.e. VO and above) of community organizations of women 
having potential to be mobilized into producer groups and producer organizations and transit to next 
generation economic initiatives like high value agriculture including market access, enterprise and 
skills development etc. MoRD will directly reach out to over a million households through these 
initiatives. The project will support around 50000 individual enterprises; and around 100,000 youth 
will be trained and placed with in formal job markets using the resources available under DDUJKY and 
other skilling & entrepreneurship program of the Government of India. 

Project Component 

3. Component 1: Institutional and Human Capacity Development 
This component will continue to finance technical assistance consultancies, human resources, 
training and development of training material/approaches. Financing under this component will 
endeavor to place skilled professionals to work with NRLM at the national, state and district levels. 
As mentioned in the section on rationale, the TA will be focused on helping the National and State 
teams transition to a new phase of the NRLM that involves greater focus on economic initiatives such 
as high value agriculture and value chain development, enterprise and skills development. Given that 
experiences from these initiatives are relatively nascent, the additional financing support will 
emphasize sourcing of technical support from agencies (Public, Private and NGOs) with the requisite 
technical expertise in rural enterprise development.  National, regional and international experiences 
and skills may be sourced for this objective.   

 
4. In addition, a new sub component focused on providing technical assistance for Mission Antyodaya 

will be introduced. Specifically, as part of this sub component:  
 

a. TA will be provided for Mission Antyodaya at the national, state and district level.    
b. Support under this sub-component will be for 13 NRLP states and nearly 100 districts in those 13 

states. The 100 districts with the highest intensity of the NRLM implementation will be selected 
for the project. These districts will be the districts with the highest amount of mobilization and 
capitalization (both the catalytic capital from NRLM and the finance from commercial banks) and 
the possibilities of having transformative economic potential. Additionally, and as far as possible, 
the project will strive for coordinated technical or investment support with the blocks and 
panchayats selected under Mission Antyodaya and those under NRLP.   
  

5. Component 2. State Livelihood Support  
The activities to be financed under this Component will remain essentially the same but with further 
refinements to focus on the next generation institutional and investment support as described above 
in the rationale. Sub component 2.1 (State Rural Livelihoods Support) will remain the same but 
district level support will be focused on 100 districts that will be selected for project coverage under 
this NRETP (NRLP AF). Under sub component 2.2 (Institution Building and Capacity Building) financing 
will be oriented towards the mobilization of the producer groups and producer organizations. Under 
sub component 2.3 (Community Investment Support) the focus would be on financing community 



organizations mainly towards enterprise and skill development initiatives. The quantum of financing 
under sub component 2.4 (Special Programs) will be significantly scaled up and most of this financing 
will be focused on scaling up initiatives like high value agriculture including market access, enterprise 
and skills development etc.  that were introduced under the dedicated funds under this sub-
component during the project restructuring undertaken in January 2016. 

 
6. Component 3. Innovation and Partnership Support: There is no change in the activities to be financed 

under this component. The component will continue to finance pilot initiatives and technical 
assistance consultancies that support innovative livelihoods activities in agriculture, livestock, youth 
employment, among others, for rural poor households.  Learning and documentation of experiences 
from these initiatives will be emphasized. 

 
7. Component 4. Project Implementation Support: There is no change in the activities to be financed under this 

component. This component will continue to strengthen the National Mission Management Unit for effective 
project management at the national level, finance the Monitoring and Evaluation activities and ICT initiatives.  
Learning and documentation of experiences under the economic transformative investments and institutional 
strengthening programs will be emphasized. 

 
E. Implementation 

 
1. Institutional and Implementation Arrangements:  The MoRD through National Rural Livelihoods Promotion 

Society (NRLPS)/National Mission Management Unit (NMMU) will be responsible for overall technical 
assistance, guideline formulations, National level partnerships, coordination, monitoring, supervision and 
release of funds to thirteen participating States. At the State level, the project will be implemented by the 
State Rural Livelihoods Missions (SRLMs) set up under NRLM as per the agreed framework detailed out in 
Project Implementation Plan (PIP). Each participating States will carry out a diagnostic study of pro-poor 
agriculture value chain and potential of cluster based enterprise development based on which they will 
prepare their Annual Action Plan (AAP) or multi-year State Perspective and Implementation Plan (SPIP). 

 
 
 
 . 

   
F. Project location and Salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 
 

The additional finance would cover about 100 districts in the current 13 states. The states are spread across 
different agro climatic zones with varied natural and geographical features ranging from wet and humid to 
dry and deciduous as well as include some coastal areas. All the states have previous experience in 
implementing NRETP (NRLP AF) supported livelihood activities in varied agro climatic zones. There is also 
prior experience of working in different geographies and with environmental and social setting of the rural 
areas, which are primarily agrarian. The expected locations influenced by additional financing are likely to 
be similar to those covered under the ongoing NRETP (NRLP AF), and therefore, poses no significant risks of 
potential cumulative and localized significant adverse environmental impacts. Livelihood activities would 
continue to centre around the sustainable use of natural resources, where these are available at project 
locations. NRETP (NRLP AF) NRETP (NRLP AF) The additional financing will be spread across 100 Districts in 
13 high poverty states. The states and project areas were identified based on their high incidence of rural 
poverty and socioeconomic backwardness as well as higher concentration of marginalized population 
groups such as scheduled tribes (indigenous peoples) and scheduled castes. States like Bihar and UP have 
substantial population of Scheduled Castes (SC) and Other Backward Castes (OBC) who are more vulnerable 
and marginalized compared to general population. On the other hand, states like Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, 
Odisha and parts of Rajasthan, MP, and Maharashtra are dominated by tribals. Within these geographies, 
the NRETP (NRLP AF) will prioritize districts/blocks with higher levels of social mobilsation and financial 
capitalization, which will overlap with pockets of higher tribal and marginalized populations.

KEY SAFEGUARD POLICY ISSUES AND THEIR MANAGEMENT 

 OPS_SAFEGUARD_SUMMARY_TBL 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential 
large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
The project proposes to scale-up the existing livelihoods promoted through dedicated special funds. The livelihoods 
include varies use of natural resources and linked processes, such as, Agriculture, Dairy, Small ruminants, Fisheries, 
Non-Timber Forest Produce (lac culture, hill broom, tamarind etc.). The project will also support Non-farm enterprises 
including small processing units and value addition. The project has been consciously promoting special initiatives for 
environmental sustainability of livelihoods such as community managed sustainable agriculture, fodder cultivation and 
stall feeding of milch animals and goats etc. However as the project proposes to scale-up the same interventions 
through additional financing, improper management of any of these livelihood activities and unawareness among the 
SHG members may result in negative impacts, such as: (i) indiscriminate use of chemical inputs in agriculture leading 
to contamination of soil, water and surroundings; (ii) degradation of common grazing lands due to increased pressure 
of grazing and improper pasture management practices; (iii) decreased regeneration capacity of NTFP species in forest 
areas; and (iv) over use of water resources, particularly ground water etc. Most of these activities are small-scale 
interventions, spread over wide areas in several villages. Further, any potential adverse environmental impact and risk 
from these activities can be mitigated, contained and even reversed. Therefore, no potential large scale, significant 
and/or irreversible impacts are envisaged. In addition to Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01), the safeguard policies 
on Natural Habitats (OP/BP 4.04), Forests (OP/BP 4.36) and Pest Management (OP/BP 4.09) have been triggered 
recognizing the importance of integrating sustainable management practices in forest-dependent and agriculture-
based livelihoods. The safeguard policy on Safety of Dams (OP/BP 4.37) has not been triggered as the project funds are 
unlikely to be used for community-level civil works such as small dams, embankments, etc. (Project funds would not 
support activities involving excavations, etc., that may impact physical cultural resources. Therefore, OP/BP 4.11 is not 
triggered. The key social safeguard issues and impacts associated with the NRETP (NRLP AF) are: ensuring project 
interventions and implementation processes are aligned with the socio-cultural context in tribal areas and respond to 
their development priorities; inclusion of traditionally marginalized social groups such as scheduled castes, migrant 
labor, and other households identified under socioeconomic census survey (SECC); promoting strategies that reduce 
gender gaps and advance women’s economic empowerment; and mitigation of any localized, adverse impacts from 
small scale infrastructure that would be coming up in project areas. No adverse long terms impact on tribals and 
indigenous population are expected from this project. OP 4.10 is triggered as states and districts having substantial 
tribal population are included in Project areas. OP. 4.12 (Involuntary Resettlement) is not triggered as involuntary land 
acquisition is not envisaged. Small scale community level, infrastructure such as citizen service centres, training 
centres and custom hiring centres are expected to come up largely in pre-existing facilities. However, some of these 
may require small land parcels that are expected to be leased or donated by Panchayats or local government 


departments or individual donors with proper MoUs and due diligence. Given the size of small scale infrastructure, a 
large portion of which is expected to be rented/leased with no or minimal construction, the risks of labor influx are 
not going to be significant. Project interventions are not expected to cause any adverse livelihood impacts and 
restriction of access to land and resources as a result to land taking by the project.  
  
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area: 
Describe any potential indirect and/or long-term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area: No 
severe or long-term impacts are expected due to proposed livelihood activities, mainly implemented through the 
women Self Help Groups. Agriculture, livestock, fisheries, non-timber forest produce and non-farm sectors are the 
predominant sectors in which rural poor households are involved and individual and household level investments in 
these sectors generally do not result in potential indirect and/or long-term impacts in the project areas. Further, as 
the experience of existing Bank projects has shown, the nature of activities/works taken up by the SHGs and 
federations under the ongoing project is likely to remain so during the additional financing. No adverse long term 
social impacts are envisaged from the AF interventions and investments. The potential long-term positive impacts are 
expected to be: social, economic and financial empowerment of the poorest households, especially of Scheduled 
Castes and Scheduled Tribes, and women. The poorest and most excluded households would have greater access to, 
security and sustainability of livelihood resources, and enhanced household incomes. The project villages would most 
likely see greater cohesion amongst the poorest social groups, greater capacity and assertiveness among the poor in 
claiming their rights and entitlements, and better participation in local government structures and processes. Gender 
relations could improve as collective action gives women self-esteem and confidence to voice their needs and 
priorities in both the public and private spheres. Overall, the social dynamics and rural institutional environment are 
expected to be much more supportive of the livelihood needs of the poorest households.  
 
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts. 
Since this is an additional financing aiming to scale up successful interventions, no analysis of alternatives was 
undertaken. However, based on implementation experience during the ongoing project, the safeguards strategy will 
continue to mainstream the environmental best practices into the Package of Practices (PoP) of the livelihood 
activities (e.g.: stall feeding in goatary, non-chemical pest control measures in agriculture). In addition, Promotion of 
alternate green solutions like use of renewable energy, Community Managed Sustainable Agriculture are planned 
during the additional financing. 
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower 
capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The measures taken during the ongoing project for addressing safeguard policies issues will continue throughout the 
implementation of the additional financing. EMF compliance with the mandatory regulatory requirements list would 
apply to all the clusters in the project and appropriate capacity building support for compliance with regulations and 
awareness building on better environmental practices in livelihood activities would be provided. Efforts will be made 
to develop and apply a sustainability index for funding potential activities through the dedicated fund. The index will 
be based on the principles of resource efficiency, minimal adverse impacts and post-investment support continuation 
of the livelihood. An assessment of the EMF in select states was undertaken during the ongoing project .There is mixed 
experience in terms of borrower’s capacity to plan and implement the measures required for addressing safeguards 
issues. Most of the states (Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan) have had previous experience 
in implementing livelihood projects and other states have also implemented EMF and SMF under NRETP (NRLP AF). 
States that have implemented World Bank-supported livelihood projects as well as NRETP (NRLP AF) have a higher 



 

level of readiness and competency to implement the EMF. Some of these states (e.g. Bihar) have implemented the 
green solutions at a considerable scale. The above findings from these assessments are being incorporated into the 
updated EMF To streamline these capacities, it has been agreed with the Ministry of Rural Development that the 
National Mission Management Unit (NMMU) will have the Livelihood Specialists as the anchor person for EMF to 
support and monitor the implementation in the participating states. Further, the State Mission Management Unit 
(SMMU) of the State Rural Livelihoods Missions (SRLM) would have Environmental Focal Points at the state level 
(Livelihood Managers), district levels and among the block level project facilitating teams to streamline the EMF 
requirements at all levels. The Technical Partners on different value chains will be taken on board for integration of 
the best practices and regulatory requirements into the Package of Practices and Capacity Building programs. The 
NRETP (NRLP AF) social management framework (SMF), including OP 4.10 on Indigenous Peoples (Scheduled Tribes), 
will continue to apply to the AF. The SMF comprises strategies for targeting and inclusion of scheduled castes and 
schedule tribe groups/areas, consultation and participation, gender & women’s economic empowerment, citizen’s 
engagement, grievance redress and safeguard screening/mitigation planning for community projects involving 
land/infrastructure. The SMF addresses the issues and needs of tribal people and incorporates the key requirements 
of O.P. 4.10 especially with respect to free, prior and informed consultations and broad community support. The SMF 
includes specific provisions for informed consultations, participation and inclusion of the SC/ST and other excluded 
households, with a special focus on tribal people. The SMF also provides for institutional arrangements and capacity 
building activities of project staff, community institutions and partner agencies. Community projects involving 
productive infrastructure and land donation would follow consultative, transparent and voluntary procedures. MORD 
and the 13 SRLMs have implemented the SMF and its constituent strategies with varying levels of intensity and quality 
in the ongoing NRLP satisfactorily. Under the NRETP (NRLP AF), the capacities and performance of the social 
development staff and partners would be strengthened through a range of measures. NRETP (NRLP AF) aims to 
intensify interventions, financing & technical support for high value agriculture, rural value chains, skills and 
enterprises, producer organizations, innovative livelihood approaches, digital financial inclusion as well as productive 
infrastructure for post-production processes and value addition. Technical Assistance will also be provided to 
convergence (Mission Antoyodaya). Partnerships with technical resource agencies from private and non-profit and 
public sector will be strengthened. Increased investments in high value agriculture, enterprises, productive 
infrastructure and financing of producer organizations would need more explicit criteria for inclusive beneficiary 
targeting and benefit sharing as well as social safeguard screening to minimize elite capture and social exclusion. 
Dedicated HR and Capacity building program on socially inclusive and gendered value chains/enterprises, social 
safeguard screening and risk mitigation and social sustainability will be supported to ensure satisfactory social 
performance of project counterparts. To respond to these focus areas in the AF, MORD has updated the existing SMF 
especially with respect to social inclusion protocols, social safeguard screening mechanisms and inclusive beneficiary 
targeting and benefit sharing criteria for financing of producer organizations and productive infrastructure. Additional 
measures on staffing, capacity building, technical assistance, knowledge programs as well as citizen engagement and 
grievance redressal would be implemented. The results framework will continue to track and report on gender, 
inclusion, citizen’s engagement and women’s economic empowerment. NRETP (NRLP AF) will significantly advance the 
gender mainstreaming and women’s economic empowerment agenda through strategies/specific interventions on 
women led producer organizations and enterprises, Start-up Village Entrepreneurship Program (SVEP) and upgrading 
of skills in selected self-employment occupations for women SHG members and youth. Interventions on digital 
payments, financial inclusion/literacy, Business Correspondents (BC) and enterprise financing will lead to significant 
financial empowerment of rural women. Support to Mission Antoyodaya will strengthen women’s advocacy and 
agency in delivery of social safety net and entitlement services for the rural poor. Nutrition sensitive agriculture and 
interventions on food handling and hygiene will benefit the women disproportionately. The results framework will 
continue to track and report on gender, inclusion, citizen’s engagement and women’s economic empowerment. Client 
has also been organizing regular reviews and lesson learning events on the gender, social inclusion and vulnerability 



reduction dimensions of the SMF. A discrete stocktaking review was undertaken at Midterm stage of the project. 
Overall the project has been performing satisfactorily on mobilsation, inclusion and financial and economic 
empowerment of women and marginalization communities particularly tribals and SC households. SMF 
implementation and reporting would need to improve further on safeguards, GRM and benefit sharing dimensions of 
productive infrastructure and economic clusters. As described above, these are the aspects that are being updated in 
the SMF  
 
 
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, 
with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
The key stakeholders in the proposed project include the SHG members, groups and federations of rural poor in the 
project districts, technical partners, relevant government departments etc. The existing safeguards arrangements will 
continue to apply. If required, the existing EMF document will be updated based on a short field assessment and 
would be disclosed in English and the local language (Hindi) on the websites of the NMMU, State Departments of Rural 
Development and on the Bank’s InfoShop. The most important stakeholders of the project are the rural poor and their 
organizations, including SHGs, federations, producer organizations and government and non-governmental 
organizations working on rural poverty reduction and livelihoods advancement. The MoRD has held stakeholder 
consultations to inform the design and implementation of the project and address the limitations of existing rural 
development programs that target the poorest and most excluded groups. The following field consultations were also 
held.

B. Introduction and Context 

 


Country Context   
China’s success in reducing extreme poverty since the economic reform period is widely recognized as an 
event of global significance. Based on the international poverty line of US$1.90 per day (expressed in 2011 
purchasing power parity), the World Bank estimates that the incidence of poverty in China declined from 
877.8 million in 1981 to 87.4 million in 2012 (or from 88.3 percent to 6.5 percent of the total population).  
These World Bank estimates indicate that about 790 million Chinese escaped poverty during this period, 
representing about 72 percent of global poverty reduction. These estimates of declining poverty have 
been matched by broad-based improvements in nutritional status, educational attainment, longevity and 
other health outcomes, as well as other indicators of well-being. In fact, China was the first country to 
achieve the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of halving the number of people living in poverty by 
2015, and it did it ahead of schedule. This highlights the country’s leading role in global poverty reduction. 
 
In its Thirteenth Five Year Plan (13th 5YP), Chinese government made an ambitious commitment to 
eliminating rural poverty by 2020, ten years before the WBG’s target of 2030. The Plan includes an explicit 
poverty eradication goal: “All rural residents falling below China’s current poverty line will be able to lift 
themselves out of poverty” and underlines the importance of focusing poverty efforts: “We will identify 
and register those living in poverty throughout the country …(and) will strengthen dynamic statistical 
monitoring of these populations….”. Poverty eradication in China refers not only to help people earn more 
than a minimum income threshold, but also have access to basic goods and services. Consequently, the 
plan includes a list of anti-poverty programs in eight fields: locally viable industries, labor services, finance, 
relocation from inhospitable areas, transportation, ecological conservation, education, health care and 
social security. 
 
The Chinese government has established a comprehensive poverty reduction strategy to achieve the goals 
of the 13th 5YP. Central to this strategy are two institutional innovations which have the potential to 
provide important global lessons to other countries. The first is accurately targeting poverty households, 
villages and counties with the establishment of the National Poverty Registration System (NPRS).  The 
NPRS, established in 2013, is a census of all poor people and villages in China which timely tracks a wide 
range of detailed data about the characteristics of the poor and their main causes of poverty. The first is 
accurately targeting poverty households and villages through the establishment of the National Poverty 
Registration System in 2013.  The NPRS is a census of poor villages and people in China (about 70 million 
at its inception), which timely tracks characteristics of the poor and their main causes of poverty. The 
database is closely integrated into the reporting, prioritization, and accountability lines running upward 
from the village, county, region, and national levels. It provides critical information from the annual 
assessments of which households or villages have exited poverty, are at risk of falling back into poverty, 
or face challenges exiting from poverty. It thus plays a key role in both the identification of the remaining 
poor and the monitoring of programs to eradicate poverty.  
 
Secondly, since 2016, China has introduced the concept of decentralization of poverty reduction efforts 
with the aim to empower county governments to achieve their poverty targets. It consolidates large 
number of earmarked poverty reduction funds into a program-based budgeting system tailored to local 
context. and hold local governments accountable for achieving their poverty reduction targets. It works 
through consolidation of dozens of rural and agricultural earmarked funds which county governments are 
now authorized to use to develop a poverty reduction program tailored to local context.  The designated 
poverty counties have now been put fully in the driver’s seat for achieving poverty reduction goals. 



 

Nevertheless, the program development and implementation remains to be a great challenge for the 
county governments, as little technical guidance and support is provided to them from higher authorities.   
 
The proposed Program for Results operation (PforR) enhances these institutional advancements through 
connecting planned activities more closely to poor households and villages in the NPRS database, and 
aligns fiscal inputs with results by introducing improved planning, budgeting and monitoring systems for 
poverty programs in Guangxi. It also aims to help to improve the monitoring of poverty reduction 
programs in one of the most impoverished regions of the country. The lessons from adopting these 
innovations in Guangxi can serve as learning experience to similar complex settings in the rest of the world 
and will help the WBG in supporting other countries eradicate extreme poverty by 2030. 

 
Sectoral and Institutional Context  

Guangxi poverty reduction program is a continuing success, which is supported by strong government 
leadership, substantial and increasing funding, and broad assistance from society. In the areas of more 
intense poverty, it has brought about 18 percent annual reduction in rural poverty from 4.68 million poor 
in 2013 to 2.61 million poor in 2016.  However, Guangxi is still one of the 10 provinces in China with rural 
poverty rates above the 7 percent and, given its population size, is one of the six provinces with more than 
3 million rural poor (as of 2016), partly due to low soil fertility in the karst mountain areas and low levels 
of infrastructure and connectivity to other regions in China.   Moreover, as of 2013, the poor in Guangxi 
represented approximately 0.8 percent of the global poor. In this regard, helping the region to achieve its 
poverty eradication goal, would have a noticeable contribution to global poverty eradication. 
 
The Guangxi 5YP aims at achieving poverty eradication not only through households having a regular 
source of income above the minimum poverty threshold, but also in terms of access to housing, basic 
health care, compulsory education, appropriate roads to villages, safe drinking water, access to electricity 
and access to telecommunications. This is akin to a multi-dimensional definition of poverty, and is defined 
in Guangxi as the 8+1 “haves”. Despite of rapid poverty reduction in recent years, projections indicate 
that, to achieve poverty eradication, poverty reduction rates for the period 2016-2020 will have to be 
faster than the ones experienced in 2013-2016. Analysis of data indicates that poverty reduction is closely 
linked to rural net incomes, and that agricultural activity is the main driver of growing rural incomes. 
Moreover, data from the NPRS shows that when asked about the main cause poverty, lack of income was 
the cause mentioned more often by interviewees. Nevertheless, in some counties, other gaps such as lack 
of access to roads or safe drinking water can be the significant cause of poverty. 
 
Mountainous areas of Guangxi are exposed to extreme events, such as heavy rains and floods and to a 
lesser extent longer dry spells on a seasonal basis, as well as climate variability. In addition, Guangxi is also 
classified with high river flood risks and with medium water scarcity risk, especially in karst mountain areas 
where majority of the rural poor are located.  Areas with medium water scarcity could potentially 
transition to more adverse condition with climate-induced drought, affecting crops and/or resulting in 
agriculture competing with drinking water requirements. Mountainous conditions combined with average 
annual rainfall of 1,500-2,000 mm could result in floods and landslides, which could cause damages to 
rural roads.  Guangxi’s present hazard level may increase in the future due to the effects of potential 
climate change. For example, rainfall intensity (which is already above the national average) is expected 
to increase across a range of climate scenarios (Ying et al, 2014 and Wang et al 2015, respectively).  
Knowledge about, and adoption of, climate resilient and climate smart agronomic practices and 



technologies among Guangxi farmers and farmer cooperatives needs to be strengthened to address these 
climate change vulnerability issues in rural areas.   
 

PforR Program Scope  
Guangxi 13th 5-Year Plan (5YP), sets a target of lifting all rural people out of poverty by 2020. Specifically, 
the 5YP sets its main goals to lift: (i) all 4.52 million registered rural poor people out of poverty (end-2015 
figure); (ii) some 5,000 remaining poor villages out of poverty status; and (iii) 54 poverty counties out of 
poverty status. Guangxi Rural Poverty Reduction Program (GRPRP) is summarized in the document: 
“Guangxi Tackling Poverty Thirteen Five Year Plan”, issued in December 2016. It defines the poverty 
reduction strategy for the region to achieve the poverty eradication objectives of the National 13th 5YP. 
 
Within the GRPRP lies the Guangxi Consolidated Poverty Reduction Program (CPRP). The CPRP represents 
a sub-set of the GRPRP in the following ways: (i) it covers 54 designated national and provincial level 
poverty counties; (ii) over 40 earmarked funds from national, regional, municipality and county sources 
are pooled together to constitute the Consolidated Poverty Reduction Fund (CPRF); (iii) expenditures are 
prioritized by the counties in conformance with the 13th 5YP Poverty Reduction Plan priorities; and (iv) 
program activities are targeted at poverty households and villages identified in the national poverty 
registration system. At the heart of the CPRP’s more integrated and locally-driven approach is an annual 
mechanism of bottom-up budgeting in the designated poor counties for meeting their poverty reduction 
targets, coupled with transparent and accountable financing, monitoring and evaluation support from 
higher levels of government. 
 
The proposed PforR will support a sub-set of the activities, funded under CPRF with some exclusions and 
in a circumscribed geographic area. Moreover, the proposed PforR will also support enhanced 
expenditure monitoring efforts that the region will be able to report on budget allocation and execution 
by its major subprograms.  
 
The timeline of the proposed PforR is 2018 – 2021, which are the remaining years of the 13th 5YP, and 
one additional year for verifying results.  
 
The geographic boundary of the proposed PforR is circumscribed to 28 selected counties out of 54 poverty 
designated counties. The subset of 28 counties have high poverty rates (above 11 percent) or large 
poverty headcounts (above 60,000) and is representative of the rural poor in Guangxi. As of 2016, the 
selected 28 counties account for 12.6 million rural population (some 30 percent of rural population); and 
for 1.8 million rural poor, approximately 52.5 percent of the rural poor in the region. Moreover, the 
selected counties are diverse in several dimensions. Most of them are located in mountain areas -usually 
associated with high poverty rates- and a few in the river plains at the center of the region. Among the 28 
counties, there are 20 so called “deep poverty” counties, with poverty incidence rate of about 18 percent 
in 2016. There are also 9 autonomous counties (which sit specific ethnic minorities) and the proportion of 
ethnic minorities among the poor is 67.6 percent, slightly higher than in non-selected counties, 63.9 
percent. The age and gender distribution is like in the rest of the poverty-stricken counties in the region 
(i.e., lower share of adult females and higher share of elderly than the region’s average). 
To ensure the sharper focus on achieving the Government 2020 poverty reduction targets, the Result 
Areas (RAs) of the proposed PforR cover a key subset of the Government program activities, which are to 
the extent feasible, aligned with the government’s own targets. The RAs were selected considering that 
they: (i) make a strong contribution to achieving the government’s 2020 poverty alleviation targets; (ii) 

must be linked to specific measurable results; (iii) provide “value added” in terms of interventions that 
are innovative, scalable or expand upon on-going and planned piloted initiatives; and (iv) incentivize 
behavioral changes.  
 
Results Area 1: Improved Income Generation for Rural Poor. The goal is to increase the direct impact of 
the CPRP on the incomes of the targeted poor households through enabling rural poor to engage in 
agriculture-related economic activities and skills development. The proposed PforR would encourage: (i) 
increased allocation of the CPRF funding towards development of farmers cooperatives and poverty 
reduction leading enterprises; (ii) enhance institutional mechanisms associated with these two programs 
for improved poverty targeting and fund-use efficiency through introducing poverty reduction 
accreditation mechanisms for the enterprises and improved operational and governance standards and 
poverty targeting of farmer cooperatives; and (iii) significantly scale selected vocational skill training 
activities, and improving poverty and gender targeting of these programs.  
 
Results Area 2: Improved Infrastructure for Rural Poor. This results area supports the delivery of basic 
rural infrastructure for the designated poor villages in the targeted poverty counties under the CPRP 
funding arrangements. The goal is to ensure that the registered poor households have access to adequate 
rural drinking water supply and rural roads, which are required to meet Guangxi eight plus one "haves", 
multi-dimensional poverty eradication criteria needed to graduate households from poverty. The types of 
measures to be supported under the PforR include drinking water supply and rural roads. In addition, the 
proposed PforR would strengthen Guangxi infrastructure project management capacity with an aim to 
improve the efficiency and effectiveness of CPRF expenditures, and thus their poverty reduction impact 
through developing and adopting an IT-based pipeline project management system.   
 
Results Area 3: Cross-cutting Issues for Enhanced Program Implementation.  This Result Area supports 
the improvement of institutional arrangements and capacity through the introduction of poverty 
reduction program budgeting and enhanced monitoring and evaluation systems, with an aim to enable 
the governments to better align budget allocation with the expected output/outcomes and timely 
monitor the progress, efficiency and effectiveness of program implementation. The key activities are 
clustered around two themes: (i) enhancement of the CPRF program-based budgeting systems; and (ii) 
strengthening of the monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of poverty reduction activities. 

 
C. Proposed Program Development Objective(s)  

 
Program Development Objective(s)  

The proposed PforR development objective is to enhance the impact and efficiency of the Guangxi 
Consolidated Poverty Reduction Program in the targeted counties.   

 
D. Environmental and Social Effects 
 

The Environment and Social Systems Assessment (ESSA) finds that, in general, the existing legal and 
regulatory framework of environmental, health and safety, and social in China, and in Guangxi are 
consistent with the World Bank’s PforR Policy and Directive. During the PforR preparation, initial 
environmental and social screening was conducted based on the whole 13th 5YP in order to provide 
insights for the definition of the PforR boundary. Activities with potential significant adverse 



environmental and social impacts were excluded from the PforR boundary. These include ecological 
resettlement, major infrastructure construction projects (i.e. class 4 and higher roads), extractive 
activities, disaster relief and preparedness, and returning farmlands to forests. In addition, there are some 
activities subject to limitations, such as rural tourism development, which is limited to guest rooms, 
catering and agri-tourism, without involving physical cultural resources. In addition, the PforR excludes 
any activity subject to EIA Report, especially those located in natural forests; in or near physical cultural 
resources at/above county level; or in or near significant natural habitats. 
 
Some activities supported under the PforR may have potential negative impacts or risks. Pest 
management and livestock waste management are considered the main issues from an environment, 
health and safety perspective. Guangxi is promoting livestock farms to be established and run by farmers’ 
cooperatives under the context of poverty reduction. Livestock waste management is handled by 
individual farmers, who often have inadequate capacity of livestock raising. The ESSA thus recommends 
enhancing the technical capacity of staff in county livestock bureau and enhance technical training and 
support to farmers (PAP action). The current pest management system is aligned with the international 
good practices. The key aspects in the pest management system, such as mandatory system for 
production and sales permits for pesticides, pest disease monitoring and forecasting, and trainings for 
farmers, are satisfactorily performed by relevant institutions. 
 
The assessment of social risks of the activities to be supported under the PforR, concluded that there 
would not be significant social conflicts caused by its activities. However, the PforR would have limited 
social risks in terms of land acquisition or voluntary land donations and land transfers, effective 
participation and consultation, and grievance redress mechanism. The ESSA recommends developing a 
community participation and consultation manual, which will be the PAP action. 
 
OP 7.50 on International Waterways is triggered as the Program activities could potentially involve water 
extraction for rural water supply systems and irrigation from the Pearl River Basin, which is regarded as 
an international waterway, as certain tributaries of the basin originate or flow through Vietnam.  
 
Consultations and information disclosure. Between November 2017 and January 2018, meetings were 
held with representatives from Guangxi region, and three counties government institutions to discuss 
policies and procedures on land acquisition and resettlement, land use right transfer, ethnic minority 
development, among others. Formal public consultation meetings were held during April 14-15, 2018, in 
Nanning and in Du’An county. An electronic copy of the draft ESSA report was uploaded on Guangxi 
government official website and hardcopies were made available together with the consultation 
announcement to key stakeholders prior to formal consultations.

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 

 
Uzbekistan is gradually moving away from a state driven development model towards a more diversified and 
private sector led economy. This structural change – which has accelerated significantly in the past year – is 
also taking place within the context of significant macroeconomic policy shifts, the most prominent of which 
has been the recent move towards greater currency convertibility and a significant devaluation in September 
2017. These developments play a strong role in shaping the country’s development agenda going forward. 
 
Agriculture continues to play an important part in Uzbekistan’s economy and in 2016 accounted for 17 percent 
of GDP, 15 percent of export revenues, and over one-third of employment. As noted in the May 2016 
Systematic Country Diagnostic, the agriculture sector can produce significant results in terms of economic 
growth and employment in the medium-term and diversification of outputs and exports have considerable 
space to expand.  
 
Horticulture plays an important role promoting a gradual shift away from the traditional crops (cotton and 
wheat) and public intervention towards a more liberal and diversified agricultural sector. Agriculture value 
added has grown at an average annual rate of 6.5 percent since 2003 and the strongest growth has come from 
crops other than wheat and cotton. With a growing domestic and export market, the area devoted to 
horticulture has increased steadily, primarily by displacing land used to grow cotton. The economic impact of 
the fruit and vegetables subsector is also large, accounting for 50 percent of the value of crop output and over 
35 percent of agriculture export value. Despite delayed returns and higher investment costs, horticultural 
crops generate revenues to farmers significantly higher than wheat and cotton.  The horticulture sector 
provides an important source of all-season jobs in rural areas and is a significant employer of women.   
 
The proposed Additional Financing will also contribute to Uzbekistan’s accelerating reform agenda, which is 
creating rapid structural change. Structural reforms will create both opportunities and risks – exchange rate 
depreciation has created a clear opportunity to expand exports. Price liberalization is also expected to 
contribute to the development of more competitive industries and a diversified economy. At the same time, 
the negative impacts of reform could include job losses in inefficient industries and lower overall growth while 
the economy adjusts. Significant fiscal resources may also be required to maintain currency reserves and 
address financial risks in state-owned enterprises and the banking sector. In this context, additional 
investment to increase private sector participation in the economy and finance sectors with the potential for 
growth and job creation can be an important element to mitigate the costs of structural transition. 

 
Sectoral and Institutional Context 
 

The Horticulture Development Project (HDP) is part of a portfolio of agricultural investments aimed at 
diversifying agriculture into higher value crops, intensifying agricultural yields and productivity, and fostering 



greater and better rural jobs. Approved in June 2014, HDP focused on addressing several constraints facing the 
horticulture sector: (i) improving access to technologies, knowledge and markets; (ii) strengthening technical 
and managerial capacity in the farming and agri-business sectors; and (iii) introducing new financial products. 
The design of HDP drew on the implementation experience of the Rural Enterprise Support Program (RESP), 
which established a successful model for long term agricultural finance through private and state owned 
banks.  
HDP’s primary project beneficiaries are farmers, farmer groups, private enterprises, agro-firms, and agro-
processing enterprises, involved in the country’s horticultural sub-sector. Secondary beneficiaries are the 
Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs) through improved skills and acquisition of a more diverse menu of 
suitably adapted financial products; and the national network of private growers through training and 
technical assistance. At the same time, the project was designed to support the growth and development of 
small and medium enterprises in the rural areas, creating more and better paying jobs in the agro-processing, 
trading and export sectors, and increasing the value added of the agricultural sector. 
 
The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to enhance the productivity and profitability of the horticulture 
sector in the project area. The project has three components: Component 1 (Agricultural Support Services); 
Component 2 (Access to Credit); and Component 3 (Project Management). The original Project IBRD Loan in 
the amount of US$150 million was approved by the Board of Directors on June 12, 2014 and became effective 
on October 5, 2015.  The project was restructured in 2016 to accommodate new co-financing for HDP through 
a technical assistance program by the European Union (EU). This grant will total Euro $21.0 million and replace 
IBRD financing for Component 1.   
 
To date, 92 percent of the loan (US$137.9 million) has been disbursed primarily under Component 2. Thus, 
during the first two years of implementation 97 percent of funding for the second component was disbursed 
to finance 223 sub-loans.  
 
The rapid rate of disbursement of the project’s Access to Credit Component demonstrates the significant 
demand for credit in the horticulture sector. This was anticipated, given the RESP experience, the sector 
analysis, and expressions of interest by potential PFIs. The PFIs have a pipeline of sub-project beneficiaries 
that meet the criteria in the HDP Credit Guidelines. In view of rapid credit line disbursement and significant 
unmet demand for investment in the agribusiness sector, the Government of the Republic of Uzbekistan has 
submitted a request to the World Bank for an additional loan to scale-up the investment and working capital 
sub-loans and lease financing activities. 

 
C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  
 
 
Original PDO  
The project development objective is to enhance the productivity and profitability of horticulture sector in the project 
area. 
 
Current PDO  

 



 

No change is proposed to the PDO, which will remain “to enhance the productivity and profitability of 

horticulture sector in the project area”.  The project area, however, will be expanded to all thirteen regions 

(full coverage of the country) and the closing date is proposed to be extended a further two years to 2023.  

 
Key Results 
 

PDO level results will continue to measure changes in productivity and agribusiness performance levels and 

have been adjusted to accommodate the scale up within the project. Some intermediate results indicators 

have been adjusted to reflect the increase in the volume of credit and scale out to additional beneficiaries. 

Adjustments have also been made to Component 1 indicators and technical assistance related activities.  

 
Project performance has demonstrated solid achievements and the additional financing will build on positive 
results. A preliminary beneficiary survey was carried out in July and August 2017 among fifty-five randomly 
sampled HDP beneficiaries. The survey found:  

 

 Strong job creation, with the number of permanent jobs within HDP financed enterprises increasing 
on average 78 percent after the enterprise received sub-project financing. Of these new jobs, more 
women were hired than men, with sub-loan beneficiaries reporting a doubling in permanent jobs 
held by women.  

 Enterprise sales increased on average 281 percent and enterprise profits 250 percent.  

 Increased exports with a 10 percentage point (from five to 15 percent) increase in exports after 
receiving HDP support. Several beneficiaries reported entry into entirely new export markets 
(Turkey, Ukraine, India, Great Britain, Malaysia, Turkmenistan) 

 Adoption of new crops, varieties or agronomic practices, with 15 percent of HDP loan recipients 
introducing new crops or new crop production systems.  

 
 
D. Project Description  
 

 
The project design will maintain the same three components with the additional financing supporting the 
scaling-up of the original project’s credit line for loans and leases under Component 2 - Access to Credit. This 
component will continue to focus on improving access to financial services for farmers and agribusinesses and 
will support additional financing for the purchase of new cultivars, seeds/seedlings, water-saving irrigation 
facilities (such as drip irrigation), cold storage and other cold chain facilities, and value added 
handling/processing equipment and facilities.  
 
The institutional arrangements will remain the same. The environmental safeguards category will remain “B.” 
The results monitoring framework has been revised to reflect the additional credit, introduce new sector 
indicators, and revise some target values given changes in circumstances both within and outside of the 
project. 

 
E. Implementation 
 


Institutional and Implementation Arrangements 
 

Overall responsibility for implementation continues to rest with the Rural Restructuring Agency (RRA). The 
RRA is a specialized organization that was created for implementing investment projects in the agriculture and 
rural sector. The additional financing will use the same on-lending modality to channel resources through PFIs 
on the same lending terms and conditions used under the parent HDP. Under the original HDP, nine banks 
have been qualified as PFIs and it expected that additional banks will apply under the proposed additional 
financing. The same due diligence process will be followed new PFIs as were used in the parent HDP. Terms 
and conditions of the credit line and the associated credit line guidelines will remain largely the same with 
minor adjustments. 

 

 
  

 .    
F. Project location and Salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 
 

Project activities under the first component will take place as planned under the original project within the 
fields and laboratories of participating research institutes and on farm demonstrations among participating 
producers. Under the second component, the sub-projects to be supported by the Credit Line will be based 
on demand for proposed activities. Project activities will now be implemented in all 13 provinces of the 
country, expanding the project area from the original eight provinces. The main physical characteristics of 
the new provinces are as follows: (1) Bukhara province is primarily desert plain. Water resources are limited 
and agricultural production is reliant on the Zarafshan and the Amudarya rivers. The Amu-Bukhara and 
Amu-Karakul machine canals draw water from the Amudarya for the irrigated oasis located in the south 
(Gijduvan, Bukhara and Karakul). Horticulture activities are primarily located in these irrigated oasis. (2) 
Karakalpakstan includes the southern half of the Aral Sea, where significant ecological change is occurring. A 
new salt marsh desert Aralkum is being formed due to the drying out of the Aral Sea and the lower reaches 
of the Amudarya River are drying up. The desert occupies more than 13.67 million hectares (more than 80 
percent of the territory). Horticulture production is limited but does occur in irrigated areas. (3) Navoi 
province is occupied by the Kyzylkum plateau in the northwestern part of the region, the Nurata mountain 
ranges in the east, and the Zerafshan River in the south. The climate is continental, deserted, and arid. 
Horticulture production is widespread within the region with a number of processors and exporters located 
in the region. (4) Syrdarya province is located in the center on the west side of the Syr Darya river and 
immediately west of Tashkent province. The steppe occupies part of the region and the south-eastern part 
of the region is vulnerable to crop damaging dry winds and dust storms in the summer. Horticulture 
production is widespread within the province, although concentrated in higher rainfall areas. (5) 
Surkhandarya province is located in the extreme south east with flat areas in the central and southern parts 
of the region and mountains in the north, west and north-west. The climate ranges from the dry desert in 
the south, to the sub-tropical in the north (Uzun). Horticulture production is widespread in the river valley 
and the central zones of the region.

SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY 

 
SAFEGUARD_TBL 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

The OP is triggered as the proposed project activities 
and subproject that would be supported under 
credit line, could generate a series of adverse 
impacts. Category A-type subprojects are excluded 
by the project. To address other activities the client 
has updated the parent Environment and Social 
Management Framework(ESMF) which will guide the 
EA process during the project implementation. The 
updated ESMF takes into consideration the new 
geographic locations and, in particular, the scaling-
up credit line resources and the needs for further EA 
institutional capacity building. In this regard under 
the Project AF, the RRA will hire additional 
Environmental Specialists in all participating oblasts, 
where regional RRA PIUs will be established. 

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 No 
The ESMF provides screening criteria to be applied 
to exclude any projects that could have an impact on 
natural habitats. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No 

The ESMF provides screening criteria for exclusion of 
any projects that could have an impact on forests, 
rights of forest communities or traditional uses of 
forests. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

As in the case of agricultural production or agro-
processing sub-projects, there might be needed pest 
management activities if this OP is triggered. The 
ESMF has a special section specifying provisions for 
preparation of simple pest/pesticide management 
plans as part of the application process and 
supporting IPM. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 No 
The ESMF provides screening criteria for exclusion of 
any projects that could have an impact on physical 
cultural resources. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 No This OP is not applied in the country 



 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 No 

The project will support construction of new 
buildings and processing, and cold storage facilities 
only in the case when land acquisition is not 
necessary and when people have not been displaced 
prior to the application for purposes of the proposed 
subproject and there are no resettlement issues. For 
such cases the investor should have the 
landownership title as well as proof that the land at 
the moment of subprojects application is not 
occupied or used illegally. 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 No 
The project will not support activities which are 
dependent on an existing dam (e.g. irrigation works). 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

No 

Any credit investments would be limited to 
rehabilitation or modification of existing minor 
schemes in ways which would not increase the 
amount of water abstracted or have any other 
impact on the water source or local hydrological 
regime (e.g. replacing conventional irrigation with 
drip irrigation in an existing irrigation scheme would 
be still eligible). Creating a new scheme which will 
lead to increasing water abstraction from the rivers 
will not be financed under the project. This 
determination would be made in the screening 
process. 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No 
The project will not support any activities in disputed 
areas. 

 
 

KEY SAFEGUARD POLICY ISSUES AND THEIR MANAGEMENT 

 OPS_SAFEGUARD_SUMMARY_TBL 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential 
large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
The project will maintain its category B classification and will not trigger any new safeguards policies. The scope and 
scale of the project’s activities will continue to be limited as they will occur through the project’s existing sub-project 
mechanism. As a result, the project’s safeguards issues can be addressed by application of the rules and procedures 
established under the HDP Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) as well as by any implementing 
mitigation and monitoring measures stipulated in any site specific Environmental and Social Management Plans 
(ESMPs).  
 
Potential environmental impacts. The project will continue supporting various types of horticulture related production 
and processing sub-projects. Subprojects will remain limited in terms of spatial scale and take place through sub-
projects of limited duration and size. HDP’s credit line guidelines prohibit financing to category A sub-projects and as a 
result, no significant environmental impacts that fall under the Category A classification and for which a full 



 

 

Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) would be required are expected. Credit guidelines also prohibit selection of 
sub-projects located in protected areas, critical habitats or culturally or socially sensitive areas.  
 
A portion of sub-projects are expected, however, to show the potential for limited adverse environmental impacts 
that would fall under the Category B under Bank OP/BP 4.01. This is primarily due to activities related to small-scale 
agro-industries; small-scale rehabilitation, maintenance, and upgrading of various premises or storage facilities; and 
plantation of new orchards and/or vineyards.  The potential adverse environmental impacts of proposed types of sub-
projects can be summarized as follows: (a) agricultural production: soil erosion, loss of soil productive capacity, soil 
compaction, soil pollution, surface and underground water pollution, loss of biodiversity; (b) agro-processing: 
contribution to surface-water pollution, wastes generation, odor; (c) small-scale construction and/or rehabilitation of 
the existing premises: soil and air pollution; acoustic, construction wastes, and potential asbestos issues, etc. All these 
impacts are expected to be easily mitigated through good project designs and best implementation practices. 
 
The sub-projects to be implemented under the Credit Line are also expected to generate a number of both direct and 
indirect positive impacts. Direct positive impacts will be generated by increased production, products and goods which 
would result in creation of new jobs and respectively, more employment and increased income. Indirect positive 
impacts will relate to overall improving of business environment, introduction of advanced agricultural technologies 
and techniques, contribution to poverty reduction and food safety.  
 
Potential social impacts. Issues related to the risks of child and forced labor in the cotton harvest have been a 
challenge in the agricultural sector in Uzbekistan and efforts to eliminate these practices have received high level 
support within Government. Production in the horticultural sector is significantly more labor intense than in cotton 
and wheat, the peaks of seasonal labor demands are more dispersed across various crops, and the profits are higher. 
To mitigate any residual risks of child and forced labor, and to ensure that the project contributes to improved labor 
relations and practices in the agricultural sector of the country, the project envisions continued close collaboration 
with the International Labor Organization (ILO). Starting from 2018, research activities to monitor labor relations in 
the horticultural sector and to provide recommendation for creating decent working conditions would be 
implemented jointly with the ILO.  The project will also participate in the Third Party Monitoring (TPM) and Grievance 
Redress Mechanism (GRM) set up by the World Bank for the agricultural portfolio in the country to focus on issues of 
child and forced  adult labor. The TPM/GRM will be funded by a separate TF.  
  
Acquisition of land. As all proposed activities are likely to be implemented within the existing agricultural land and 
settlement boundaries, the proposed project will likely not have an impact on wildlife and natural habitats and thus, 
OP/BP 4.04 (Natural habitats) is not triggered. It is also expected there will be no impact on physical cultural 
resources, which are generally not placed in the vicinity of agricultural land. Therefore OP/BP 4.11 "Physical Cultural 
Resources" is not triggered.  
    
 Private businesses will be eligible to become project beneficiaries under the condition that they have not acquired 
and/or would not acquire land for the needs of activities to be supported with the project proceeds, through a process 
which involved and/or would involve officially supported expropriation. Additionally, project funds will not support 
any sub-loans used to invest in a business which would require the involuntary displacement of existing occupants or 
economic users of any plot of land, regardless of its current ownership, or loss of, or damage to, assets including 
standing crops, kiosks, fences and other. The project operational manual will define a screening procedure to be filled 
by PFIs, and the implementing agency will closely monitor the screening procedure, with the support of the Bank task 
team. With these restrictions in place, the project does not trigger OP/BP 4.12 "Involuntary Resettlement". 
 

 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area: 
 
The cumulative negative impact of expanded horticultural production and processing is expected to be limited, 
particularly as expansion of the horticulture sector and successful implementation of sub-project activities are 
expected to lead to more efficient use of land and water resources compared to Uzbekistan’s current dominant 
commercial crop sector (cotton and wheat). The expected cumulative impacts are expected to be mostly positive and 
includes improved knowledge on best agricultural and manufacture practices, with consequent improvements in the 
status of the environment in the country. 
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts. 
Project design includes a prohibition on category A sub-projects which is expected to prevent larger scale negative 
impacts.  A "no project" scenario was considered but would result in continuation to the the current structure of 
agricultural prodution, which is dominated by cotton and wheat, which also have specific negative evnrionmental and 
social impacts. 
 
To boost employment of women, and encourage access of female entrepreneurs to loans, the project will closely 
collaborate with the Women’s Committee of Uzbekistan and the Association of Business Women of Uzbekistan for 
policy level activities for mainstreaming gender in the sector, publicizing information about female role models, as 
well as providing targeted capacity building to female entrepreneurs to enable them to access funding through the 
project. 
 
The project will have explicit focus on targeting more vulnerable farmers, both directly and indirectly. To achieve 
indirect effects, eligibility criteria for sub-loans would also consider the social impact of the project, including direct 
job creation, the multiplier effects of supporting suppliers down the value chain, as well as contributions towards 
improving community infrastructure. Trainings for the PFIs on social responsibility of business and labor rights would 
be conducted, to ensure better screening. Through Additional Financing, a share of the project resources would also 
be ring-fenced to target smaller farmers and entrepreneurs directly. 
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower 
capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
Safeguards instruments. The primary instrument for managing safeguards policy issues is the ESMF prepared for the 
initial HDP project and which remains valid for the additional financing to the project. The document has been 
updated for the AF to address the new geographic locations and any other relevant changes from the parent project, 
including in terms of Environmental Assessment  (EA) capacity building activities (see below). The ESMF document 
outlines environmental assessment procedures and mitigation requirements for first component’s activities and the 
sub-projects which is supported by the second component’s Credit Line and, it provides details on procedures, criteria 
and responsibilities for subprojects preparing, screening, appraisal, implementing and monitoring. The document also 
includes Environmental Guidelines and Best Practices for different types of proposed sub-projects providing analysis of 
potential impacts and generic mitigation measures to be undertaken for subprojects in agricultural production, agro-
processing and storage and cooling manufacturing sectors at all stages - from identification and selection, through the 
design and implementation phase, to the monitoring and evaluation of results.  Furthermore, the ESMF provides a 
monitoring plan format which considers monitoring indicators, timing, methods, institutional responsibilities, etc. in all 
phases of the project's implementation.  
 
The project's original social assessment, prepared in 2014, was updated to cover the new regions, as well as provide a 



summary of more up to date analysis of the key issues. Issues related to labor rights and working conditions in 
horticulture sector, as well as access of women entrepreneurs to credit were flagged up. To address these, additional 
capacity building measures to be implemented in collaboration with the ILO, the Farmers Council and the Association 
of Business Women were designed for implementation under the additional financing. The project also participates in 
the Third Party Monitoring (TPM) and Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM) set up by the World Bank for the 
agricultural portfolio in the country to focus on issues of child and forced  adult labor. To date RRA has been found in 
compliance and the GRM is actively receiving and responding to inquiries, however no complaints issued thus far.  
 
Institutional capacity. The project will continue be managed and implemented by the Rural Restructuring Agency 
(RRA), an institution that is currently implementing the Second Rural Enterprise Support Project, GEF Climate Change 
and Land Degradation Project, and other donors' projects. The RRA's capacity for implementation of the ESMF and of 
the participating Financial Intermediaries (PFIs) are adequate, based on the Bank supervision missions in 2016-2017. 
All sub-projects have been subject to screening and assessment and for those classified as Category B separate 
Environmental and Social Management Plans (ESMPs) have been prepared. Supervision has confirmed these are being 
implemented in a satisfactory manner and no outstanding issues have been identified.   
 
Further capacity building is anticipated with respect to several technical asepcts of horticulture production, as 
identified during the initial project implementation which are related to Integrated Pest Management (IPM), soil and 
water conservation, including field demonstrations. New training on EA is also required for Participating Financial 
Intermediaries (PFIs) which should strengthen the ability of their representatives to identify potential environmental 
and social impacts as well as their knowledge on the EA rules and procedures. The revised ESMF proposes necessary 
activities in this regard.  
 
To accommodate the scaling up of activities for the project, it was agreed the RRA will hire additional Environmental 
Specialists in all participating oblasts, where regional PIUs will be established for all WB and other IFIs RRA projects will 
be implementing (including for Livestock Development Project which was recently approved by the Board). While the 
RRA ES will have the major coordinating role on EA, the PIU ESs will be responsible for assisting the PFIs in 
implementation of the Credit Component of the project, including reviewing environmental EIA studies and/or 
environmental management plans, monitoring their implementation, advising and guiding PFIs on specific 
environmental issues and management options and ensuring that potential cumulative impacts are addressed. One of 
the major area of their responsibility will be inspection of environmental compliance at worksites, ensuring the ESMP 
provisions are fully implemented. The PIUs ESs will advise PFIs in terms of integrating environmental requirements 
into bidding documents, and analyzing contracts and their implementation in terms of environmental management 
and mitigation issues. ESs will be responsible also for analyzing the environmental conditions of the subprojects’ area 
and identify main environmental parameters. On a quarterly basis PIUs ESs will prepare short reports on implementing 
ESMF and site specific ESMPs for supported sub-projects. They will also identify the status of environmental 
compliance of sub-projects implementation, and, when needed will undertake relevant measures and agree with the 
sub-project beneficiaries on corrective measures and/or proposing to the PFIs and RRA canceling sub-project 
financing. 
 
The project will also support a series of activities on human capacity building. This would include: (a) capacity building 
in collaboration with the ILO to increase compliance with national legislation and ILO conventions on child and forced 
labor, and broader labor issues, ratified by Uzbekistan; (b) training on strengthening project environmental 
management capacity for sub-projects environmental assessment; (c) training and information dissemination for sub-
project beneficiaries and farmers on several important horticulture sector development issues, identified during the 
initial project implementation which are related to Integrated Pest Management, soil and water conservation, 


including field demonstrations; and (d) training EA practitioners in the country that are working on preparing EA 
documents as well as familiarizing representatives from State Ecological Expertise on WB EA rules and procedures and 
proposing relevant recommendations on harmonizing the National EA requirements with the WB ones. 
 
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, 
with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
As part of the initial project preparation RRA disclosed and consulted the ESMF with all interested stakeholders. This 
process involved submission of the draft summary of the ESMF to the Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources 
and other relevant ministries for their review and comments. The Executive Summary of the original document in 
Russian was posted on websites of MAWR for its access to the public on January 17th, 2014. On February 13, 2014, 
the RRA organized a consultation on the draft document. After the consultation, the draft ESMF was revised to 
consider inputs from consulted parties. The final version for the parent project was posted on the website of the 
Ministry of Agriculture on February 14, 2014 and submitted to the World Bank's external website on March 10, 2014. 
For the HDP AF the updated ESMF was posted by RRA on its website for further virtual public consultation in the 
provinces which have been already included in the parent project. Face to face public consultations with the 
participation of main stakeholders and farmers were organized in the new project provinces by RRA in October 2017. 
For that purpose RRA has provided to key stakeholders (oblast agriculture, environmental and sanitary authorities and 
environmental NGOs) hard copies of the draft ESMF.  During the consultations overall the draft ESMF was supported 
by the participants, the few received comments were related to clarifying the EA roles and responsibilities and  
simplifying the EA rules and procedures and providing awareness activities for the potential subprojects beneficiaries 
in this regard. The minutes of consultations have been shared with the Bank.
