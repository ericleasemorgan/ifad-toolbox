Executive Summary 

Project Overview: The cashew nut sector stands out as one of the highest value-added flagship 

sectors featuring in the Government's Action Programme (GAP, 2016-2021), given its: (i) high 

potential to contribute to employment and income generation; (ii) contribution to food and 

nutritional security; and (iii) great export potential. Cashew nut is the country's second-largest 

agricultural export product after cotton, and accounts for 3% of the gross national product (GNP) 

and 25% of the income from agricultural exports. The project area alone generates more than 87% 

of national production. However, it is among the areas with the highest poverty rates, with an 

incidence of poverty rising from 36.2% in 2011 to 40.1% in 2015, well above the national average 

of 30.2%. With the strategic orientations of both Benin and the Bank in mind, the project design 

places particular emphasis on: (i) food and nutritional security; (ii) development of the sector's 

value chain, including local processing of raw cashew nuts (RCN); (iii) employment of youth and 

women; (iv) climate change (CC), strengthening population resilience and improving endogenous 

production systems. The project’s sector objective is to contribute to poverty reduction and improve 

food and nutritional security; its specific objective is to support a sustainable increase in stakeholder 

income and sector productivity. The project's total cost is UA 14.59 million and will take 5 years 

to execute. The main expected outputs include: (i) re-profiling 145 km of access roads; (ii) building 

and equipping 5 RCN storage warehouses each with a capacity of one thousand tonnes; (iii) 

rehabilitating 15,000 ha of old cashew nut plantations and supporting the creation of a modern 

cashew orchard of 3,000 ha for an expected improved yield of 700 kg per hectare; (iv) supporting 

job creation, identified in the various links of the sector, for 10,000 youths and women; (v) 

supporting the construction and equipment of 20 satellite RCN shelling units for the benefit mainly 

of women and 20 walnut and cashew apple processing units; (vi) installing 5 mini-power plants of 

10Kwc and 30 improved village water systems for communities and industrial processing units; 

and (vii) providing assistance to stakeholders in the sector to access bank credit through a 

facilitation fund hosted by the National Agricultural Development Fund (FNDA). In total, the 

project will directly reach more than 75,000 stakeholders in the sector, 30% of whom are women. 

Needs Assessment. RCN production in 2017 was estimated at 100,000 tonnes on 213,000 ha by 

200,000 small-scale producers. The sector's main constraints to development include: (i) the low 

yield of plantations (350 kg/ha compared to a world average of more than 900 kg/ha); (ii) the 

inadequacy and/or poor quality of agricultural infrastructure (storage warehouses, access roads); 

(iii) the low capacity of processing units (10% of national production); (iv) the non-existence or 

limited availability of bank credit; and (v) the organisational weakness of sector stakeholders. 

Value-added for the Bank. The project area has significant agricultural potential that has not been 

fully developed but is also one of the regions with the highest rates of poverty in the country. The 

project will contribute to the sustainable alleviation of food and nutrition insecurity and persistent 

poverty by focusing on women, youths, smallholders and private RCN processing initiatives, 

thereby contributing to attaining the Bank's High 5 strategic objectives, including "Feed Africa," 

"Industrialise Africa" and "Improve the quality of life for the people of Africa." 

Knowledge Management. The project will promote cropping systems that combine cashew nuts 

with food crops to meet food and nutritional security needs, while raising the RCN production and 

processing level for the market (increasing stakeholder income). The project will serve as a test 

model for sustainable management of tree plantations, based on the capacity of cashew tree 

plantations to sequestrate carbon, combat land degradation (climate change mitigation and 

adaptation), diversify and strengthen the livelihood of local communities, thus contributing to 

poverty reduction in the project area.

MANAGEMENT REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 

CONCERNING A LOAN AND GRANT PROPOSAL TO THE REPUBLIC OF BENIN TO 

FINANCE THE CASHEW NUTS SECTOR AND AGRICULTURAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP 

DEVELOPMENT SUPPORT PROJECT (PADEFA-ENA) 
 

Management hereby submits this report and recommendations concerning a proposal to extend an ADF loan 

of UA 7.12 million and award an ADF grant of UA 5.91 million to the Republic of Benin to finance PADEFA-

ENA. 

I. STRATEGIC THRUST AND RATIONALE  

1.1. Project Linkages with Country Strategy and Objectives  

1.1.1 The Government launched its Action Programme in December 2016 (PAG, 2016-2021), entitled 

"Benin Revealed"1 (PEA 2017), as the sole reference framework for Government action. The agricultural 

strategy, as outlined in the PAG, aims to make agriculture the main driver of wealth and job creation. The 

strategy comprises 7 agricultural development clusters (PDAs) and the promotion of 6 key agro-food sectors, 

including cashew nuts. The agricultural component of the PAG is based on the National Plan for Agricultural 

Investment and Food and Nutritional Security (PNIASAN, 2017-2021), which operationalises the Strategic 

Plan for the Development of the Agricultural Sector (PSDSA, 2017-2025). The key outcomes targeted through 

the Investment Plan include: (i) an annual increase in agricultural production of at least 6% between 2017 and 

2021; (ii) increased yields and reduced post-production loss rates in the agricultural, livestock and fisheries 

sectors; (iii) improved local processing rates for agricultural products; and (iv) increased employment created 

in priority value chains (for at least 30% of women).  

1.1.2. Youth employment remains a major and priority concern for the government (PAG, 2016-2021). 

Innovations in cashew value chains offer important employment opportunities for young people, including 

women. The project offers agricultural SMEs the opportunity to: (i) optimise access to finance and markets; 

(ii) promote best practice and innovative business models; and (iii) create employment opportunities. 

PADEFA-ENA will support young innovators to create effective business strategies and improve the 

productivity of the cashew nut value chain in Benin. 

1.1.3. The proposed project is fully in line with the main thrusts of Benin's national cashew nut sector 

strategy (SNFAB, 2016 - 2020), the implementation of which it aims to facilitate. The national cashew nut 

sector strategy is based on the following strategic thrusts: (i) improved orchard productivity; (ii) improved 

local capacity to process cashew nut products; (iii) organisation of the cashew nut marketing chain; (iv) cashew 

nut sector research; (v) cashew nut sector stakeholder organisation; (vi) cashew nut sector financing; (vii) 

regulation and legal framework for cashew nut sector development; and (viii) cross-cutting issues (gender, 

environment, climate change, public private partnerships, etc.). 

1.2. Rationale for the Bank’s Involvement 

1.2.1 Aimed at contributing more to the reduction of poverty and regional inequalities in the country, the 

Bank's interventions (CSP, 2017-2021) focus primarily on economically and socially disadvantaged areas with 

significant agricultural potential, including the support measures targeting the cashew nut and livestock 

sectors, and the development of infrastructure to bolster production, processing and access to basic services. 

The proposed project is of particular interest in the cashew tree-prolific area. Cashew nut is the second most 

important export product after cotton; it provides 3% of the country's GNP and 7% of its agricultural GNP; 

8% of the export revenue and 25% of export agricultural receipts. The project impact area (Alibori, Atacora, 

South Borgou, Donga and Collines) alone represents more than 87% of the national production provided by 

nearly 200,000 small-scale farmers. These regions are among the areas with the highest poverty rates, with 

the income poverty rate increasing from 36.2% in 2011 to 40.1% in 2015, above the national average of 30.2%. 

Furthermore, the cashew tree has the dual advantage of generating income in rural areas and sequestering 

carbon in increasingly soil degraded areas, such as the project region. The potential of the cashew nut sector 

includes the high carbon capture capacity, the existence of a local but also a sub-regional market for the sale 

                                                 
1  The choice of this name reflects the ambition of the highest authorities to further reveal the country’s economic potential to the world, thus strengthening 

Benin’s attraction.

of white and roasted almonds, the potential of the rapidly expanding organic fair trade market in Europe, and 

job creation opportunities for youths and women. The major constraints for the sustainable development of 

the cashew nut sector include the absence of coherent and specific policies and actions to promote the sector, 

the low quality of the main final products, such as cashew nuts and kernels, the low productivity of the varieties 

used, inappropriate post-harvest processing of nuts by farmers and wholesale traders, lack of mastery of 

efficient RCN processing techniques by processors, difficulties in accessing bank financing, difficult access 

to efficient inputs and equipment, low level of stakeholder organisation and poor stakeholder management 

capacity.  

The Bank's strategy for the period 2017-2021 aims to support the Government in implementing GAP (2016-

2021) for the structural transformation of the economy and poverty reduction. As a reminder, the CSP (2017-

2021) is structured along two main thrusts: Pillar 1 - develop agricultural and agro-industrial value chains; 

and Pillar 2 - strengthen infrastructure to support competitiveness and regional integration. The Bank's 

interventions under the first pillar support the development of agricultural value chains and agribusiness, 

including assistance for transformative investments; improving the agricultural sector's business environment 

to foster greater private sector involvement; skills development and entrepreneurship, particularly for youths 

and women; access to financing through risk-sharing mechanisms; and rural economic development through 

increased income and improved access to basic social services. Moreover, the proposed project is in line with 

the Bank's Ten-Year Strategy (2013-2022), particularly three of the “High 5s” to transform Africa socially 

and economically: “Feed Africa”, “Industrialise Africa” and “Improve the quality of life for the people of 

Africa.” The project is fully consistent with the Bank's objectives to contribute to the creation of 25 million 

jobs for the youths by 2025 as outlined in its Jobs for Youth in Africa Strategy. 

1.3. Aid Coordination 

1.3.1 The annual net flows of aid from development partners to the country represent nearly 30% of the 

state expenditure budget. Technical and financial partners (TFPs) are organised into joint thematic cooperation 

groups chaired by the Government, with a TFP as facilitator. The sector distribution of the Bank's active 

portfolio reflects the predominance of transport infrastructure (50%), followed by agriculture (33%) and 

energy (13%). This situation illustrates the portfolio's alignment with the Country Strategy (CSP, 2012-2016). 

The Bank is among the main stakeholders in the transport and agricultural sectors. The recent opening of its 

Country Office in Benin, with the effective presence of a Country Manager since January 2018, will contribute 

to strengthening the Bank's role and leadership in the thematic groups and TFP coordination.

II. PROJECT DESCRIPTION  

The sector objective of the project is to contribute to poverty reduction and improvement of food and 

nutritional security in Benin. The specific objective is to contribute sustainably to raise the income of 

stakeholders and the productivity of the cashew nut chain in Agricultural Growth Pole No. 4 (AGP 4).  

2.1. Project Components 

2.1.1 The project will be grounded on a sector value chain and integration approach to create an enabling 

environment for developing small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the cashew nut sector, for the 

employment of youths and women, and the creation of a sustainable impact on local development. 

2.1.2 Summary of Components: The project will be implemented over five years (2019-2024) through 

three components, the main achievements of which are described in detail in Annex C3 and summarised in 

the table below:

A1: Support for adaptation and carbon sequestration through sustainable management of old and new cashew 

tree plantations. Support for producing improved plant varieties to meet the rehabilitation needs of old 

plantations on 15,000 ha and creating a new 3,000 ha nursery by: (i) supporting agricultural research to 

increase existing mother trees (600 per 120,000 grafts per year), germs (5 per 200 higher tree clones); 4 

polyclonal nurseries of 5 hectares each and 30 irrigated woodlands of 5 hectares each; (ii) establishing 20 

demonstration plots and school grounds for disseminating innovations and new technologies: adapting 

farming and production system resilience to climate change and impact mitigation.  

A2: Supervising producers and creating pools of private service providers, supporting the training of 50 

agricultural advisers to train 25,000 farmers. Supervising 5,000 youths and women private service providers 

in 6 new trades identified for sustainable employment.  

A3: Socio-economic infrastructure rehabilitation/re-profiling of 145 km of feeder roads and building of 5 

cashew nut storage warehouses (1,000 tonnes each); drilling of 15 boreholes with manual power pumps and 

15 improved drinking water supply systems. Equipping 10 villages with a 10 KWp photovoltaic electricity 

system to supply villages and processing units. 

 

B1: Assistance for resilient land tenure security: (i) support for preparing the 20 Rural Land Plans (RLPs); (ii) 

support to Rural Municipalities for disseminating land transaction tools.  

B2: Organising, structuring and strengthening of stakeholders. The activities will be structured around the 

following thrusts: (i) support for structuring within the sector, in particular POs at village level; municipal and 

divisional associations; (ii) support for national professional federations in the various sector links; and (iii) 

institutional support at the grassroots level (IFA).  

B.3. Support for youths and women's entrepreneurship: Support for job creation for 10,000 youths (30% of 

whom are women) in the sector; Support for access to finance for stakeholders in the sector (30% of whom 

are women). Nutritional awareness of 1,500 people, 30% of whom are men. Identifying and strengthening 

existing incubator capacity to support young people in the sector.

2.2. Technical Solutions Adopted and Alternatives Explored 

PADEFA-ENA aims to support the entire cashew nut sector. Improving the quantity of RCNs produced and 

the quality of nut processing are the two key challenges for strengthening the competitiveness of the cashew 

nut sector in Benin, which faces stiff competition from its regional neighbours. It was decided to support the 

entire sector, including the thematic (Component A is intended to support the upstream part of the sector, and 

Component B the downstream) or geographical aspect (central and northern regions covered by the ATDA4, 

with 87% of the national cashew tree nurseries covered by the programme alone). PADEFA-ENA will 

contribute to improving the quality and quantity of cashew nuts and almonds produced, increasing 

employment and income in rural areas (farmers, stakeholders in new trades/private service providers (PSP), 

labourers employed by farmers or women workers in processing units, cashew nut collection and marketing 

agents). It will also help to raise the level of carbon sequestration in cashew plantations, while securing rural 

land rights (through support for the existing rural land plan) and enhancing food and nutritional security 

(through the promotion of appropriate food crop systems together with cashew plantations). 

Table II-2: Alternative Solutions Explored and Reasons for their Rejection  

Alternative Solutions Brief Description Reason for Rejection 

Building the project exclusively 

with the cashew nut industry inter-

professional group (IFA)) 

Supporting only members of the 

cashew nut sector inter-professional 

group (IFA) in Benin. 

The impact of the project on many 

stakeholders in the sector will be 

limited and can be equally 

frustrating for major stakeholders 

who are not members of the inter-

professional group. 

Financing activities through grants 
The project will finance the various 

stakeholders through grants. 

Financing processing and marketing 

activities will create disparities on 

the local market, and will penalise 

non-beneficiary private operators. 

The only activities to be subsidised 

are the rehabilitation of old cashew 

plantations and building the capacity 

of stakeholders. 

 

Establish new monoculture 

plantations. 

Plants grown on new plantations 

subsidised under the project are 

spaced in such a way that no other 

crops can be grown. 

Monoculture plantations will 

compete with food crops in the 

project area, implying the failure to 

achieve the project's objective of 

food and nutritional security. 

2.3. Project Type 

The PADEFA-ENA is an investment project financed by the ADF (loan and grant), the Government and 

project beneficiaries. 

2.4. Project Cost and Financing Arrangements 

2.4.1. The project's total cost, excluding taxes and customs duties, is estimated at CFAF 11.624 billion, or 

UA 14.594 billion (UA 1 equivalent to CFAF 796.489 in January 2019), of which UA 4.889 million in foreign 

exchange (33.50% of total project cost). The cost includes a 5% provision for physical contingencies and 3% 

for price escalation yearly. It should be noted that while contingencies for price escalation cover all capitalised 

activities during the five years of project implementation, the situation is different for physical contingencies, 

which do not cover items such as vehicles, operating costs (including staffing), etc. Thanks to this approach, 

project resources are better optimised. The project cost estimates are based on prevailing market prices in the 

country and in relation to the most recent achievements in the various areas of relevance to the project.

2.4.4. The project will be financed by a total ADF allocation of UA 13.03 million (CFAF 10.378 billion), 

comprising a loan and a grant of UA 7.12 million and UA 5.91 million, respectively. Therefore, the ADF is 

contributing 89.28% to the overall project funding, the Government CFAF 1.038 billion (10% of the ADF 

contribution and 8.93% of the total project cost) and the beneficiaries CFAF 207.565 million or 1.78% of the 

project cost. The following tables show the project's sources of financing by component and expenditure

2.5. Project Target Area and Beneficiaries 

The project zone is the area which comprises the agricultural growth pole N ° 4 (AGP 4) managed and 

administered by ATDA4, a public autonomous establishment. AGP 4 spans the entire Donga and Collines 

Divisions (“Départements”), and partly Borgou (South) and Zou Divisions (Djidja Municipal Council), with 

an estimated population of 2,150,000 of whom slightly over 50% are women. The project will cover the 

following fifteen municipal councils: Tchaourou, Parakou, N'Dali, Nikki, Pèrèrè located in the south of 

Borgou Division, Savalou, Bantè, Dassa-Zoumè, Glazoué, Savè, Ouessè municipal councils in Collines 

Division, Djougou, Ouaké, Bassila and Copargo municipal councils in Donga Division, and lastly Djidja 

municipal council in Zou Division. The direct beneficiaries are: (i) cashew nut farmers; (ii) cashew nut traders; 

(iii) raw cashew nut processors; (iv) exporters; and (v) the inter-professional cashew nut sector (IFA) and its 

regional and divisional constituents. The project will indirectly benefit the end consumers, as well as 

stakeholders involved or associated with the project at various levels, namely the Benin Cashew Development 

Authority, ATDA4, the DDAEPs of Borgou, Donga, Collines, Atacora, Zou, and Plateau Divisions, the 

Cashew Research Centre (CRA-Centre)/INRAB; the standardisation and quality support structures (ABSSA 

and ANM); DPV, DLROPEA, ANDF and DQIFE; the Faculties of Agricultural Sciences in Abomey Calavi 

(FSA/UAC), Ketou and Parakou, the National Fund for Agricultural Development (FNDA), and the 

Professional Association of Banks and Financial Institutions of Benin (APBEF). 

2.6. Participatory Approach to Project Identification, Design and Implementation 

Extensive consultations were held on the project at all stages of its preparation. The contacts established during 

the April 2017 identification mission were pursued during the preparation phase in January 2018, both in AGP 

4 and Cotonou. Meetings were held with administrative and local authorities, technical structures, professional 

agricultural organisations (OPAs), women's groups, private partners, as well as ongoing projects and TFPs 

involved in the cashew nut sector. This process will continue and will be relayed in the field by AGP 4 

DDAEPs, who are to serve as facilitators for all stakeholders. Moreover, implementing the project will require 

the establishment of mechanisms that will closely involve and empower the respective stakeholders, especially 

farmers and the private sector (agricultural SMEs). This approach will be pursued during project 

implementation and Bank supervision missions. The sustainability of interventions undertaken, particularly 

with regard to productive capital (ageing plantations and new cashew nurseries), requires full ownership by 

the stakeholders concerned, hence the option to prioritise the targeting of the most committed communities 

that must meet selection criteria (requests, land security, organisation method, contributions, commitments, 



 

7 

 

etc.). A presentation was made on project components and activities during the PADEFA-ENA appraisal 

mission, at a participatory workshop attended by all stakeholders. 

2.7. Consideration of Bank Group Experience and Lessons Learned in Project Design  

2.7.1 The 2017 portfolio review of Bank-financed projects in Benin identified project implementation 

weaknesses, including inadequate reporting or failure to address issues highlighted in audit reports, limited 

availability of quality staff for projects, and irregular physical and financial monitoring of projects. The 

institutional set-up envisaged under the project, namely delegated project management (MOD) and boosting 

of public-private partnership, addresses the underperformance of previous or ongoing projects. Project 

activities as concerns works, services and access to bank credit that fall within the ambit of the private sector 

will be pooled and entrusted, on a competitive basis, to specialise implementing agencies that will play the 

delegated project management role. The same review highlighted the need to: (i) facilitate access to bank 

financing for stakeholders in the sector by using reliable microfinance institutions; (ii) set up an effective 

monitoring and evaluation system; (iii) finance research and development activities; and (iv) provide priority 

support to beneficiaries through sustainable technical structures charged with exercising oversight functions 

on behalf of the State. All these issues were considered and incorporated in the project design during the 

formulation stages to avoid repeating the same mistakes. 

2.7.2. The project design took into account the exposure of the project impact area (PIA) to climate change. 

A study correlated the decrease in cashew nut yields with the increase in temperature and decrease in rainfall, 

predicting a reduction in rainfall amounts by up to 12% by 2050 in the area (Bello et al., 2016). The project 

will help to reduce carbon emissions and strengthen the adaptive capacity and resilience of the rural 

communities and endogenous agricultural production systems in the project area. 

2.8. Key Performance Indicators  

2.8.1 The key performance indicators are provided in the logical framework. Using the project's baseline 

situation, monitoring will mostly cover: (i) the rural poverty index within the project area; (ii) additional CO2 

sequestration; (iii) cashew tree productivity; (iv) average cashew tree and associated food crop production; (v) 

quantity of cashew nuts processed and certified; (vi) number of jobs created in the sector, of which 30% for 

women; (vii) the surface area of rehabilitated or newly created plantations; (viii) number of grafted plants 

produced; (ix) number of infrastructure built or rehabilitated (RCN storage warehouses, number of RCN 

satellite units for cashew shelling/processing, and production of cashew apple juice, etc.); (x) number of 

cooperatives created or structured with at least 30% of women on management committees; (xi) number of 

professional farmers' organisations (OPAs), youths and women trained in various segments of the value chain; 

(xii) number of managers and technical staff trained to supervise stakeholders (30% women); (xiii) additional 

production sold; (xiv) number of women and youths who received support from the project, including nutrition 

awareness; (xv) number of farmers and processors trained on best production or processing practice (30% 

women); (xvi) number of cooperatives and economic interest groups (EIGs) aligned on OHADA, including 

women's cooperatives; (xvii) number of organised and contracted supply networks, number of RCN satellite 

shelling units (100% women) created; and (xviii) number of stakeholders (30% women) trained in 

environmental management. 

2.8.2 Further gender-disaggregated indicators will be added when finalising the monitoring and evaluation 

system, and establishing the baseline situation, using the results-based management approach. These will 

include: (i) the proportion of women in each beneficiary group; (ii) the involvement of women and youths in 

producer and infrastructure management groups; and (iii) the area of cashew tree plantations operated by 

women and youths. Particular emphasis will be placed on monitoring socio-economic impacts (disaggregated 

data for women and youths, monitoring the performance of POs).  

2.8.3  As regards impact indicators, particular emphasis will be placed on targeting the parameters that can 

be monitored and collected internally, and on defining those that relate specifically to women and youths. The 

main indicators are: (i) the percentage of the rural population living on an annual income below the poverty 



 

8 

 

line; (ii) the percentage of the rural population living in food and nutrition insecurity; (iii) the production of 

additional cashew nuts; (iv) the volume and percentage of locally processed cashew nuts; (v) the degree of 

organisation of POs, including the performance of socio-professional organisations; (vi) the number of 

additional jobs created (including 30% for women's groups) in the sector (private service providers, PSP); and 

(vii) the number of additional agricultural businesses/SMEs created in the sector. 

2.8.4. The project’s internal monitoring and evaluation will be conducted by the monitoring and evaluation 

specialist of the Project Management Unit (PMU), in close liaison with all partners. Particular emphasis will 

be placed on targeting the relevant women-specific parameters (systematic disaggregation of data). Using the 

baseline situation, the monitoring will specifically cover: (i) the level of additional production (tonnes) and 

crop yields (t/ha); (ii) the increase in farmers' income, with particular reference to youths and women; (iii) the 

number of jobs created (support for the installation of young PSPs; development of new modern plantations, 

etc.); (iv) rate of infrastructure development (number of storage warehouses built, kilometres of feeder roads 

rehabilitated, etc.); (v) effective organisation of supervision and training (number of professional agricultural 

organisations and persons trained, including gender mainstreaming), (vi) women's involvement in decision-

making bodies and the rate of their access to land (at least 30% in new plantations); and (vii) the project's 

nutritional impact. All selected indicators under the project will be reconciled with those under the PNIASAN. 

MAEP’s DPP will conduct external monitoring jointly with CAA and DGFD. The various supervision 

missions and periodic activity reports will systematically report on progress towards achieving the indicators. 

III. PROJECT FEASIBILITY 

3.1. Economic and Financial Performance 

Table 3.1: Key Economic and Financial Data 

ERR = 29.84% 20% NPV = CFAF 9.319 billion 

The economic analysis was based on direct project costs and benefits. The project is based on the development 

of the cashew nut sector and includes several stages leading to the attainment of its set objectives. Thus, the 

economic analysis is based on the notion of operating cost centres and operating income net of taxes. 

Therefore, the following process steps were considered and analysed: 

i. Cashew nuts production and sales phase (field edge sale), both in terms of old plantations 

(15,000 ha), to be developed by farmers on bank credit financing through the Facilitation Fund 

with the FNDA, and new plantations (3,000 ha) that the project will support; 

ii. The raw material processing stage into cashew kernel and cashew apple juice, requiring both 

semi-industrial and industrial processing; 

iii.  The export sales stage of part of the raw walnut; 

iv. The sales stage of the finished products that constitute the almonds and juice from industrial 

processing, and involves two types of sales(local and export sales); 

v. Only agricultural production and production from semi-industrial and industrial processing 

from the “project” situation were considered. 

The economic analysis was conducted over the project’s 25-year lifespan, taking into account the “project” 

situation and the current level of cashew nut production yields under the project, which will increase from 350 

kg per hectare to 700 kg in the coming years for the plantations developed.  These yields per hectare will 

increase from 1,000 kg to 1,200 kg in the year of full production (full operation) for the new plantations 

established under the project, i.e. around 2027. It is also assumed that the project will start production one 

year after completion, in 2024/25. Furthermore, through the Facilitation Fund to be made available to farmers, 



 

9 

 

the project will only support investments during the implementation phase, in other words over the period 

2020-2024. The table below outlines the activities eligible for the Facilitation Fund hosted by FNDA. The 

Fund amounts to UA 3,608,700 (CFAF 2,874,286,000). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Finally, the unit prices and costs used are those applicable in the country and recorded during the field mission, 

at the level of producers, processors and authorised institutions in the sector. Details of the project economic 

analysis tables and other assumptions used to conduct the economic analysis are given in Appendix B7. 

 At the economic level. The project is economically viable and is relatively responsive to a 10% 
increase in economic expenditure, since the economic rate of return of 29.84%, although 

interesting, drops to 27.41% with an NPV of 6.562 billion, i.e. a decrease of CFAF 2.7 billion 

compared to a decrease of 2.43 points in profitability. Moreover, a 10% drop in income reduces 

economic profitability by nearly 4.30 points or approximately CFAF 4.910 billion.  The 

combination of both has a significant impact on the project's economic profitability: a 

simultaneous increase in operating costs of 10% and a 10% increase in income gives an ERR 

of 22.76% and an NPV of 20% (CFAF 2.126 billion), which indicates that the project remains 

relatively sensitive to these two factors occurring concurrently. Even under this scenario, the 

return on investment would be achieved after 2 to 3 years of project implementation (2027), 

i.e. three years after the project becomes operational – another proof that the project is 

economically viable. The project will also create thousands of jobs for both youths and women 

wishing to participate in the sector (see jobs under project Components A and B). 

 At the financial level. The financial analysis focused mainly on income generated along the 
supply chain by the various stakeholders: nursery growers, cashew nut farmers on old and new 

plantations, processors and raw nut exporters. 

 Nursery growers. The project will give them greater control over grafted plant production 
systems through the series of training sessions that they will undergo, improve their 

farming methods and increase the area under cultivation. Three pricing assumptions for 

the transfer of grafted plants studied on three types of farms will also boost nursery 

growers’ additional income per hectare compared to a no-project situation (see Annex 

B.7 for more details).  

Regarding the income derived by the other stakeholders, the financial gains for all stakeholders amount to 

CFAF 263.287 billion, i.e. an annual income of around CFAF 13.364 billion (see further details in Technical 

Annex B7).

3.2. Environmental, Social and Climate Impact 

3.2.1 Environmental and Social 

The Project has been classified under Category 1 according to the Bank's Environmental and Social Safeguards 

Instruments and in compliance with Benin's relevant regulations. Given the project’s specificity, an 

Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) was defined and validated at the national level. 

Overall, project activities will have major positive environmental impacts but will also entail some significant 

risks. Activities likely to have negative impacts include rehabilitating and extending cashew plantations, 

setting up socio-economic/community infrastructure, etc. 

Potential negative impacts. The project's negative environmental and socio-economic impacts include 

pressure on land resources and the risk of encroaching on the forest cover. There are very strong pressures on 

land due to the extension of the cultivated area following easy access to inputs and credit. Vegetation is 

destroyed and used to satisfy agricultural, livestock and people’s needs for forest products and derivatives. 

Declining soil fertility and low use of fertilisers for food crops cause the expansion of clearing and burning of 

savannahs and forests, at the expense of crops.  

Potential positive impacts. Therefore, project activities will have considerable positive impacts, among which 

development of production systems that would guarantee farmers significant and sustainable income, in 

addition to helping them to master innovative, value added-generating practices. Other positive outcomes 

include diversification of activities, improvement of the quality of life for youths and women, better access to 

social infrastructure and facilities, expansion of trade and income-generating activities, opening up of 

production areas, improvement of access to basic social services (health agencies, maternities, etc.), 

development of the production and distribution subsectors, etc. It is also worth mentioning the regeneration 

of degraded land, the improvement of the forest cover and the increased carbon sequestration capacity. 

Consultations with various project stakeholders showed high enthusiasm and total support for the project. 

According to them, the project will reduce emigration and foster local development. The project will also 

contribute to strengthening the resilience of people and ecosystems to climate change. 

Mitigation measures. The project provides for the construction of a number of socio-economic facilities and 

infrastructure to improve the population's access to them and open up certain production zones. Various other 

measures are also planned to improve the project's positive impacts, to which must be added the 

recommendations made during consultations. The risk of increasing pressure on land resources and 

encroaching on the forest cover figures among the major project environmental and socio-economic impacts. 

The following measures and recommendations were proposed: information and awareness-raising campaigns 

among all stakeholders; involvement of local authorities and communities, establishment of a consultation 

forum, building the capacity of the various stakeholders in the sector and setting up a programme to support 

the preservation and restoration of natural resources. The Environmental and Social Management Plan 



 

11 

 

(ESMP) has identified various measures, some of which particularly concern the construction of feeder roads 

and support infrastructure. These will be included in the bidding documents and service providers will be 

required to implement them during works. Moreover, in addition to the project, which incorporates the cost 

of certain activities, the ESMP provides for an additional CFAF 430,000,000 to cover environmental and 

social measures, among others. 

3.2.2 Climate Change: Spatial and temporal variations in rainfall are a real concern in undertaking 

agricultural activities in the project area as well as in all of the country's central and northern regions. The 

project would ensure the application of good agricultural practice by promoting the deployment of appropriate 

technical procedures. Where they exist, tools for establishing warning systems, such as collecting, processing 

and communicating climate data to stakeholders, are insufficient and/or obsolete. The project will contribute 

to improving these procedures by building capacity in terms of equipment, data collection and processing in 

the DDAEP areas, as well as ways of communicating with stakeholders. Training DDAEP officers in proper 

data collection is essential, as is the facilitation of a monthly meteorological sheet with trends observed. The 

project will support all activities already carried out in the region by INRAB to disseminate drought-resistant 

varieties of food crops produced on the sites. 

3.2.3 Gender mainstreaming and women's empowerment: the project will promote the inclusive 

approach with the strong involvement of youths, women, disadvantaged groups, local authorities and the 

private sector. 

3.2.3.1 Gender analysis of the cashew nut supply chain. Cashew nut cultivation involves men and women 

throughout the value chain, but with different roles and responsibilities. Given the perennial nature of cashew 

nuts, cultivation is mainly dominated by men because of women's limited access to land, which is a major 

constraint to their access to production. It is estimated that 90% of the plantations are owned by men. The 

presence of women in the sector as regards the production function is 10%, mostly comprising smallholders 

(less than 5 ha). Overall, women process, market and distribute the processed products since they have more 

expertise in conquering the market and the consumer. To overcome the gender inequalities observed, the 

project plans to carry out the following activities:  

3.2.3.2 Strengthen women's productive capacity. The project will provide training for all women directly 

involved in the project and traditional leaders on land security and women's rights to acquire land. An 

awareness-raising campaign on community user rights, conflict prevention and management mechanisms will 

be organised to facilitate support to women cashew nut cooperatives in acquiring land and land title in the new 

plantations. Out of a planned area of 3,000 ha of new cashew plantations, at least 30% will be allocated to 

women. To achieve this, the project will organise women producers into structured and operational groups to 

facilitate access to and use of the allocated plots. Farmers will be sensitised to cultivate some crops in 

association with cashew nut farming (maize, soya and groundnuts) to combat malnutrition and promote 

balanced nutrition. The project also includes a set of integrated services for women to improve their access to 

socio-economic infrastructure and innovative production technologies. The rehabilitation of rural roads, 

construction of storage warehouses, consolidation centres and installation of improved village water supply 

(HVA) will help to overcome the difficulties associated with the evacuation and preservation of cashew apples 

and nuts, and will facilitate access to drinking water in the villages around the sites to be developed. To take 

better account of women's needs in terms of access to factors of production, the project will help women to 

access processing materials and equipment through the Access Facilitation Fund under the FNDA. Women, 

individually or in cooperatives, will be able to benefit from the financing upon presentation of a bankable 

business plan. 

3.2.3.3 Building management, transformation and social life skills. As part of the plan to build technical 

capacity, all women directly involved in the project will receive literacy education, to reduce or eliminate the 

high rate of female illiteracy in the region. To build on the past record of women's leadership and strengthen 

their presence in governance structures in this very weak sector, the capacity of women in cashew apple and 

nut processing cooperatives and that of women farmers will be strengthened, particularly in simplified 

accounting, cooperative management, procurement and inventory management, leadership and 



 

12 

 

entrepreneurship, business plan development, capital mobilization, marketing and networking, to facilitate 

their access to finance. They will also benefit from capacity building in cashew nut and apple processing, as 

well as in equipment maintenance. The project's support for life skills development will focus on reproductive 

health, family planning, nutrition, social cohesion, culture of peace and conflict management. From a 

reproductive health perspective, modules on reproductive health, social cohesion and nutrition will be 

provided during the various training sessions envisaged under the project and dedicated to women. 

3.2.3.4. Improving gender knowledge. PADEFA-ENA will also contribute to strengthening the low level of 

gender responsiveness among stakeholders. To achieve this, a monitoring/evaluation system will be set up as 

part of project monitoring. The system will incorporate gender-disaggregated measurement indicators for 

knowledge enhancement on the different categories of beneficiaries, and for monitoring the impact of 

interventions by gender. Furthermore, a gender organisational audit of stakeholders will be conducted with 

the support of a consultant or a gender consulting firm. This audit will propose a gender-based technical 

capacity-building programme to address identified weaknesses. Support will also be provided for the 

introduction of gender training modules for agronomists and agricultural specialists at the Calavi, Ketou and 

Parakou Agronomic Science Faculties (ASFs) to ensure that gender equity is sufficiently reflected in 

agricultural operations. The feasibility of this curriculum consolidation will be discussed with the heads of the 

universities of Abomey-Calavi, Ketou and Parakou, and will depend on the medium-term training objectives 

of these institutions.  

3.2.3.5 Improvement of women's representation on decision-making bodies. The project will promote 

women’s integration and leadership in management committees and executive boards of professional 

organisations with the objective of attaining a 30% quota of women in decision-making positions. The project 

will also structure at least 50% of women's organisations active in the cashew nut sector. A gender specialist 

will be recruited into the project management unit to carry out and coordinate the proposed activities. 

3.2.3.6. Gender Marker System Categorization. The project is classified under Category 2 of the Gender 

Marker System. Details of comprehensive gender analysis and action plan are given in Technical Annex B.7. 

A CFAF 830 million budget (i.e. UA 1 million) has been set aside for gender promotion and women’s 

empowerment activities.   

3.2.4 Youth and Women's Employment and Inclusion: the project area has a high youth population 

(over 40% of the population). Relatively, more young men are employed (54%) than young women (59%). 

Moreover, young people aged 14-24 represent a significant share of the labour force in the informal sector 

compared to the overall population (91.1%), more so for young men (94.1%). The project will improve youth 

and women’s employment indicators. It will contribute to developing, structuring and financing new trades 

(private service providers, PSP) with a view to creating new jobs in rural areas, increasing cashew nut 

production (nurseries, maintenance specialists, grafters, plant health specialists, storage warehouse managers, 

input distribution kiosk managers, maintenance and care technicians, etc.) and processing (raw cashew nut 

shelling, cashew apple juice manufacturing, cashew shell processing). In this context, the project will finance 

training and contribute to the installation of 300 young PSP volunteers (30% of whom women). This material 

capacity building, combined with technical capacity building, will improve the productivity of young 

agricultural entrepreneurs and subsequently their income. Moreover, during the rehabilitation of old 

plantations and the establishment of new cashew orchards, youths trained by the project will be invited by 

SME promoters to provide remunerated service. The project will support ongoing initiatives in some 

municipal councils in the project area to train and set up young nursery operators. Therefore, an innovative 

financing mechanism will be carefully studied and put in place to facilitate the installation of the young people 

targeted. The technical expertise of the Faculty of Agricultural Sciences (FSA) of the National University of 

Abomey-Calavi will be leveraged in this regard. A consulting firm will also be hired to assist young 

entrepreneurs to prepare their feasibility studies and business plans. Girls must account for at least 30% of the 

young entrepreneurs supported by the project. Furthermore, the project's support for the establishment of 

private agro-industrial units will promote the employment of youths and women in particular. This will be the 

case with the planned establishment of 20 satellite cashew nut shelling units, mainly for women’s 

cooperatives, and the creation and/or modernisation/strengthening of 10 cashew apple juice production units 



 

13 

 

through the Facilitation Fund. The project will facilitate access to financing for these ongoing initiatives and 

encourage new operators to set up business in the various links of the sector. Overall, the project will help to 

generate 10,000 jobs for young people and women in the cashew nut value chain. The group of women 

involved in processing activities will be among the major target groups for nutrition awareness activities, 

linking them to processed products that provide nutritional benefits. 

3.2.5 Forced Resettlement: PADEFA-ENA's activities will not lead to any people displacement or 

resettlement. 

IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION 

4.1. Implementation Arrangements 

4.1.1 Procurement Arrangements. Procurement of goods (including services other than those of 

consultants), works and consultancy services financed by the Bank under the project will be in accordance 

with the Procurement Framework for Bank Group-financed Operations, October 2015 edition, and the 

provisions set forth in the Financing Agreement. More specifically, procurement will be carried out as 

follows: 

 The Borrower Procurement System (BPS): procurement methods and procedures (PMP) 
under Benin's procurement system, including its implementing legislation and decrees (Law 

No. 2017-04 of 19 October 2017 on the Public Procurement Code and its subsequent decrees 

and implementing regulations), using national standard bidding documents or other bidding 

documents as approved during project negotiations for low-complexity works and goods 

contracts provided for under the project and generally available in Benin, for which the 

fiduciary risk is considered relatively low.     

 The Bank's Procurement Methods and Procedures (BPM): the Bank's standard procurement 
methods and procedures, based on relevant standard bidding documents for larger and more 

complex works and goods contracts, as well as consultancy services, deemed most appropriate. 

4.1.2 Procurement Risk and Capacity Assessment (PRCA): country, sector and project risk assessment 

as well as assessment of the executing agency’s procurement capacity were conducted and the results used to 

guide the decision on the choice of the procurement system (Borrower or Bank) for specific activities or set 

of similar activities under the project. The project executing agency is the Territorial Agricultural 

Development Agency of Pole 4 (ATDA4) supervised by the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries 

(MAEP). ATDA4 is a financially autonomous social, cultural and scientific public institution/legal entity. 

ATDA4 is not fully operational because only members of the Board of Directors and some managers have 

been appointed. Consequently, the procurement risk is deemed high. The ATDA4 procurement bodies 

(Procurement Officer, Public Procurement Commission and Public Procurement Control Unit) do not exist, 

and staff of the Project Coordination Unit have not yet been appointed or recruited, including the procurement 

specialist to be dedicated to the project and who would have the necessary qualifications and experience. To 

reduce the risk to "moderate" or even "low", the Government has decided that ATDA4 will use the 

procurement organs of its parent ministry (MAEP) for procurement purposes. An assessment of MAEP’s 

capacity, expertise and experience have revealed that it is competent in this regard, given its experience in 

managing several projects financed by various donors, including the Bank. Moreover, ATDA4 shall recruit a 

procurement specialist dedicated to the project, whose profile and qualifications shall be approved beforehand 

by the Bank. Furthermore, it shall set up its own procurement organs. The Borrower and the Bank shall agree 

on a procurement plan for the first 18 months of the project, which shall be updated annually or as required, 

to take into account actual project implementation needs. Any amendment to the plan shall be subject to the 

Bank's prior approval. Appropriate risk mitigation measures have been included in the PERCA action plan 

indicated in Paragraph B.5.9 of Annex B5. 



 

14 

 

4.1.3 Financial Management and Disbursement. ATDA4 was established on 27 February 2017. 

Appointed by the Council of Ministers on 13 June 2018, its Board of Directors comprises a Director General 

(DG), a Director of Administration and Finance (DAF) and technical staff. The PADEFA-ENA steering 

committee is presided by the Chairperson of the ATDA4 Board of Directors. However, it should be noted that 

ATDA4 still has no financial management system in place to guarantee transparency, traceability and 

accountability regarding the use of project funds. To get to that level, the Beninese Government shall first 

establish and operationalise ATDA4 by taking the following measures: (i) finalise the organisational chart in 

accordance with the principles of internal control, in particular the separation of incompatible functions, with 

the appointment/recruitment of managers, especially those in the Directorate of Administration and Finance 

(Heads of Administration and Maintenance, Accounting and Finance, Procurement) and staff assigned to them 

(Accountant, Cashier). It is worth mentioning that on 17 April 2018, the Government appointed an accountant 

to manage funds for ATDA4 operations. The accountant is under the supervision of the Inspectorate General 

of Finance and the Bureau in charge of analysis and investigation; (ii) prepare the Administrative, Financial 

and Accounting Procedures Manual covering expenditure management cycles (procedures for the 

procurement of goods and services), assets management (fixed assets, stocks), cash flow management (orders, 

disbursement, cash flow monitoring and control) and resource mobilization (capital call, direct payments), the 

accounting, financial and budgetary information cycle, the staff management cycle and the control and internal 

audit cycle; (iii) implement an integrated multi-project and multi-station management system for maintaining 

the project's budgetary, analytical and general accounts; the general accounting should be compatible with 

private commitment-type accounting, in line with SYSOHADA principles and norms; (iv) set up  internal 

audit mechanisms within the General Directorate, by recruiting an internal auditor to ensure that the project's 

internal control system is operational and effective; and (v) establish external audit mechanisms, including the 

recruitment of independent external auditors in accordance with the terms of reference agreed with the Bank 

and in line with the Bank's requirement to submit audit reports by 30 June of the year following the year 

audited. Pending the establishment of project management and operationalisation structures, the overall 

fiduciary risk, including the inherent risk and the risk of non-control, and resulting from the assessment of the 

ATDA4's financial management capacity, will remain high. Details are provided in the Technical Annexes of 

the Appraisal Report. With regard to the line of credit component and/or a guarantee fund to partner banks to 

finance targeted and/or dedicated investments in the cashew nut production, processing and marketing sector, 

an agreement will be signed with the National Agricultural Development Fund (FNDA). An assessment of the 

FNDA has shown that it is relatively new given its date of establishment; its structure is gradually being set 

up. Although not all key positions have yet been filled, there is a recruitment plan in place to address this 

weakness in the very short term. The Fund is supported by the Government of Benin and certain technical and 

financial partners, including the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, the Belgian Cooperation 

Agency and the European Union Delegation. Through various multifaceted support measures, the structure 

obtained all the management tools required for its operation as of end-2018, particularly the administrative, 

accounting and financial procedures manual, including an organisation chart and job descriptions, an 

operational procedures manual for various windows, and a monitoring/evaluation manual. Furthermore, the 

Fund also set up a computerised accounting and financial management system. However, these tools have not 

yet been put to the test since they were installed quite recently. Therefore, it is imperative that prior to 

allocating resources to FNDA: (i) the recruitment process for key staff must be finalised; (ii) staff must be 

trained on using the management tools and a copy of each manual must be given to every staff; (iii) the 

integrated accounting and financial management system must be configured to record expenditure by activity 

and resources by source of financing, since the FNDA is meant to receive funding from various sources.  

Disbursements: Fund resources will be disbursed in accordance with Bank rules and procedures, particularly 

as contained in the Disbursement Manual. The following three payment methods will be used: (i) direct 

payment for the procurement of works, goods and services; (ii) the special account method for operating 

expenses to be charged to the ADF grant. A special account will also be opened under the ADF loan to receive 

facilitation funds meant for the FNDA; and (iii) reimbursement for expenditures pre-financed by the 

Borrower/Donee, in agreement with the Bank. The FNDA will open a dedicated account only for facilitation 

funds transferred periodically from the dedicated loan account.  Two agreements will be signed in this regard: 

(i) an agreement between the Donee and FNDA specifying the terms and conditions for providing the funds, 



 

15 

 

including FNDA management fees and any interest during reimbursement to the Caisse Autonome 

d'Amortissement (CAA); (ii) an agreement between FNDA and the Caisse Autonome d'Amortissement (CAA) 

specifying the terms and conditions for reimbursing the funds to CAA upon project completion and where 

applicable, after a grace period. FNDA will be required to check the loan applications to be financed, in 

addition to closely monitoring the funds disbursed to financial service providers. Regular reports will be 

prepared and forwarded to both the project and the Bank. Facilitation funds will be disbursed based on a six-

monthly budget through approved applications. Regular periodic reports will be produced and forwarded to 

the project and the Bank. A counterpart account will be opened to receive counterpart funds. The fiduciary 

risk of cash management will remain high if the above provisions, which guarantee the permanent availability 

of counterpart funds, are not adopted. 

4.1.4 External Audit. Project audit shall be carried out by an audit firm acceptable to the Bank, recruited 

for a period of one year renewable, depending on the quality of services delivered and over a period not 

exceeding three financial years. The terms of reference shall require the Bank's approval and include yearly 

audit of funds made available to FNDA, at the same time as the project itself. The auditor shall give an opinion 

on the performance of the special account, its compliance with contractual clauses, the performance of 

agreements and dossiers submitted and financed. Upon project completion, this mission will be entrusted to 

FNDA's external auditor and a copy of the auditor’s reports shall be sent to the Bank. The ATDA4 shall 

forward the PADEFA-ENA audit reports to the Bank latest 30 June of the year following the end of the audited 

financial year. Audit fees will be paid from project resources, using the direct payment method. 

4.2. Monitoring  

4.2.1 The project will be implemented over five years, from the first quarter of 2019. The Bank will 

organise the launch mission when the team is in place and all necessary conditions have been met for a quick 

and efficient start of the project. 

4.4.2 Internal monitoring/evaluation will be provided by the project’s Internal Monitoring and Evaluation 

Department (SSEI), and will cover physical and financial monitoring, by component and expenditure 

category, in addition to assessing the project's impact on beneficiaries and the environment using relevant 

indicators established in a concerted manner. The SSEI will be supported in the beginning by a consultant to 

establish/confirm the baseline situation, and implement a monitoring and evaluation system incorporating 

verifiable indicators. The baseline study will include the gender profile in agriculture, to deepen the knowledge 

of beneficiary groups, especially on socio-economic aspects. This system must be operational latest six months 

after project take-off. In this regard, the project will produce quarterly and annual activity reports highlighting 

implementation status and outcomes of various components, in line with the performance indicators set out in 

the logical framework. 

4.2.3 The MAEP Directorate of Planning and Forecasts (PPD/MAEP) will be charged with external 

monitoring and evaluation, jointly with CAA and DGFD. The project will make resources required for this 

purpose available to the DPP, CAA and DGFD. Provision has been made for a mid-term review to ensure that 

the project is running smoothly and to propose any necessary adjustments. A joint final assessment is also 

scheduled towards the end of the project to draw lessons and build on project achievements. The AfDB 

Country Office in Benin will play an important role and participate in Bank supervision missions and 

monitoring meetings organised by the Government. In addition, the Bank will monitor the implementation of 

project activities through quarterly progress reports submitted by the PMU. Below is a summary of the project 

implementation schedule.

4.3. Governance. Progress has been made in economic and financial governance. Reforms have been 

implemented to strengthen public finance management and mitigate fiduciary risks. However, there is still 

need for improvements with regard to domestic resource mobilization, public resource programming and 

allocation. Although progress has been made in aligning the public procurement system with WAEMU 

guidelines, sluggish procurement persists as one of the main weaknesses that hamper the implementation of 

development programmes. 

4.4. Sustainability. The project aims to initiate real sustainable development, by placing sector 

stakeholders at the heart of decision-making while building their capacity to assume new responsibilities. An 

intervention process governed by eligibility criteria will be adopted to ensure the effective involvement of 

beneficiaries and avoid potential conflicts. The project will support communities to enhance their technical 

and organisational capacity, thereby fostering better expertise and ownership. Specifically, committees will 

be set up or revitalised at site for the proper management and regular maintenance of collective socio-

economic infrastructure. Private sector involvement in cashew nut processing and marketing activities is also 

a guarantee for sustaining the dynamics of the value chain. The sustainability issue, including the maintenance 

and management of infrastructure set up, was a central concern during project design. Therefore, measures 

will be taken for each type of infrastructure to ensure proper management and maintenance: maintenance of 

rehabilitated rural roads (comprehensive agreement signed with municipal councils); private sector 

involvement (through a PPP mechanism) in the management of storage warehouses; and the establishment of 

committees to manage improved village water supply systems. 

4.5. Risk Management. The foreseeable inherent project risks include: (i) risk related to land conflict. 

This could be mitigated by supporting the social assessment process for cashew plantations to be rehabilitated 

and new farms to be established. In this regard, the project provides support for land tenure security at the 

sites; (ii) transhumance risk, which could be mitigated by supporting municipal councils in developing 

endogenous conflict management mechanisms; and (iii) risk related to the low level of support from 

stakeholders in the sector, which will be mitigated through information/awareness campaigns and support for 

strengthening cooperatives and trading platforms at all levels of the value chain; (iv) as regards the risk of 

work execution delays, the mitigation measures would include having recourse to suitable procurement and 

parcelling methods, bidding documents for service roads and construction of storage warehouses prepared 

with the assistance of the delegated contracting authority. 

4.6. Knowledge Building. PADEFA-ENA will contribute to the training and knowledge consolidation 

of the various stakeholders, especially producers, through Component B "Develop value chains", especially 

thanks to the support and training provided by technical departments in terms of outreach, structuring and 

organisation. Using inclusive methods, it will also enable young people and women to develop technical and 

entrepreneurial skills, and to set themselves up on lands with infrastructure and modern farming equipment. 

Finally, the project will establish an integrated knowledge management and sharing system for project 



 

17 

 

activities through the regular dissemination of knowledge and experience on its website and that of ATDA4.
