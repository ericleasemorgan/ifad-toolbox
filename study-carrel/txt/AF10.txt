Project Summary 

1. The Integrated Agricultural Value Chains Development Project in Congo 
(PRODIVAC) will primarily focus on the corridors of the major commercial centres of 

Brazzaville and Pointe Noire, and the farming basins in the departments of Plateaux, Pool, 

Bouenza, Cuvette and, Niari. PRODIVAC is consistent with the National Development Plan 

(PND 2018-2022) drawn up by the Government of Congo and which targets agriculture as one 

of the main pillars of diversification, growth, competitiveness, sustainable job creation and 

poverty reduction, in response to the poor performance of the oil sector. The general objective 

of the project is to contribute to the improvement of food and nutrition security as well as 

diversification of the national economy. Its development objective is to promote competitive 

and resilient agriculture by developing agrifood value chains in Congo. Project activities will 

focus on four value chains (cassava, maize, poultry and fish) that have been prioritized by the 

direct stakeholders concerned, based on market demand, their contribution to the national 

economy (import substitution) and their potential impact on farming households, youth and 

women. 

2. PRODIVAC activities will benefit 355,000 persons, 40% being women and 40% 
being young people in various segments of targeted agricultural value chains. The project 

comprises the following components: (i) skills development and promotion of agricultural 

entrepreneurship; (ii) improvement of the productivity and resilience of agricultural production 

systems; (iii) institutional development and public-private dialogue; and (iv) project 

coordination and management. The total project cost over a six-year period is estimated at 

EUR 85.4 million (CFAF 56 billion), financed through a loan of EUR 73.2 million from the 

Bank and contributions of EUR 7.3 million from the Government of Congo and EUR 4.9 

million from beneficiaries.  

Needs Assessment.  

3. Development of the four agricultural value chains targeted by the project is plagued 
by several constraints. For cassava, these are: (i) low yields of approximately 8 tonnes per 

hectare (t/ha), relative to a potential of more than 25 t/ha; (ii) unregulated rudimentary and 

hygienic conditions for processing cassava into flour and "chikwangue"; and (iii) the lack of 

transport means, inaccessibility to farming areas and harassment on the highways. For the 

poultry (chickens and eggs) sector, the constraints are: (i) difficulties in the supply of day-old 

chicks, livestock feed (mainly maize as well as vitamin and trace element supplements); and 

(ii) weak veterinary advisory support services. For maize, which is the main raw material in 

the manufacture of animal feed, the constraints are: (i) the limited (technical and 

entrepreneurial) capacities of small producers; (ii) difficult access to quality seeds and other 

technologies; and (iii) insufficient infrastructure and equipment for production and marketing. 

Finally, for fish, the constraints are: (i) inaccessibility to production basins; (ii) insufficient 

advisory support; (iii) poor organisation of sector stakeholders; and (iv) supply difficulties for 

improved fish feed, good quality fry and other plant ingredients. These four value chains are 

equally hamstrung by significant financing constraints. 

4. Value-Added of the Bank: The Bank's added value comes from its experience gained 

through operations in the rural and agricultural sector. The project took into account the lessons 

learned from assessment of the report from the Bank's Independent Evaluation Department 

(IDEV) on AfDB support for AVC1 development, which includes recommendations on the 

following key principles: (i) analyse the entire value chain; (ii) develop a strategy to ensure

inclusiveness; (iii) maintain adaptability to market changes; (iv) think in terms of profitability 

with added value; and (v) develop plans to create a sustainable impact. PRODIVAC is 

consistent with the strategic objectives of inclusive and sustainable growth found in the Bank's 

2013-2022 Ten-Year Strategy, Pillar 1 on “Promoting agro-industrial value chains” of the 

2018-2022 Country Strategy Paper (CSP). Furthermore, this operation constitutes a major 

contribution2 to implementation of the National Agricultural Development Plan (PNDA) 2018-

2022, whose operational budget has been estimated at over CFAF 1000 billion, with a financing 

gap of over CFAF 959 billion, or nearly 84% of needs. PRODIVAC's conceptual approach took 

the guidelines of the "Feed Africa" strategy into consideration, including the flagship 

programmes on Technologies for African Agricultural Transformation (TAAT), youth 

entrepreneurship development in agriculture and agribusiness, risk-sharing mechanisms in 

agricultural finance, and the Africa Climate-Smart Agriculture (ACSA) flagship programme. 

The project's design is also consistent with the guidelines of the Subregional Forum on Boosting 

the Rural Economy in Central Africa, jointly organized by the Bank and the International 

Labour Office (ILO) in February 2019 in Brazzaville.  

5.  Knowledge Development: PRODIVAC will generate knowledge on themes related 

to improving the economic environment of the various crop sectors (inclusive sector policies, 

promotion of local products and development of standards, trade and tariff policy, development 

of appropriate financial products and trade ties, financing of innovations, incubation of 

agricultural enterprises and financing of innovations, etc.). The development of financing 

mechanisms in partnership with financial institutions will produce positive experiences as well 

as best practices and approaches that could be used in other value chains and countries to 

support the development of financial products tailored to youth enterprises and the financing 

needs of small, medium and large enterprises. As part of knowledge management, an electronic 

library containing all relevant documents from the agricultural sector, an inventory of best 

practices, local knowledge and innovations will be set up and made accessible to stakeholders 

and the public. This activity will be developed as part of institutional support to the Directorate 

for Studies and Planning (DEP) in the Ministry of Agriculture. The project's monitoring and 

evaluation system and a communication strategy will be developed to produce and disseminate 

the information developed. The knowledge generated by the Project will improve the 

interventions of ongoing projects, enhance the design of new projects and boost participation 

in policy dialogue. 

  

                                                 
2  The Bank's expected contribution to the agro-industrial sector during implementation of the CSP is estimated at UA 290 

 million, or about CFAF 232 billion, representing 24% of the financing gap.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF BANK GROUP MANAGEMENT TO THE 

BOARD OF DIRECTORS CONCERNING A PROPOSAL TO AWARD A LOAN TO THE 

REPUBLIC OF CONGO TO FINANCE THE INTEGRATED AGRICULTURAL VALUE 

CHAINS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IN CONGO (PRODIVAC) 
 

Management hereby submits this report and its recommendation concerning a proposal to award 

a loan of EUR 73,200,000 (seventy-three million two hundred thousand euros) to the 

Government of the Republic of Congo to finance the Integrated Agricultural Value Chains 

Development Project in Congo.  

 

I. STRATEGIC GUIDELINES AND OBJECTIVES 

1.1. Project Relation to Country Strategy and Objectives  

1.1.1  PRODIVAC is consistent with the National Development Plan (NDP 2018-2022) 

prepared by the Government of Congo whose two strategic priorities are: (i) reform of the 

education system as well as skills development and vocational training; and (ii) diversification of 

the economy with priority given to the agricultural, tourism and industrial sectors. The government 

holds the view that agricultural sector diversification would generate supplies for the processing 

industry, capitalize on attendant opportunities and synergies and reduce dependency on the outside 

world for food. This operation is a major contribution to implementation of the National 

Agricultural Development Plan (PNDA) 2018-2022, whose operational budget is estimated to 

exceed CFAF 1000 billion, with a financing gap of over CFAF 959 billion, or nearly 84% of needs. 

The project will contribute to the reduction of food imports estimated at approximately CFAF 600 

billion per year and mainly consisting of meat products, more than 50% of which is meat and eggs.  

1.1.2 PRODIVAC is consistent with the strategic objectives of inclusive and sustainable 

growth outlined in the Bank's Ten-year strategy 2013-2022, as well as the High-5 priorities. It is 

also consistent with the Bank's Country Strategy Paper (CSP) 2018-2022, which seeks to diversify 

and enhance the competitiveness of the Congolese economy, with a view to ensuring inclusive and 

sustainable growth, mainly through two pillars, namely: (i) promotion of agro-industrial value 

chains; and (ii) strengthening of human capital and governance. The Bank's expected contribution 

to the agro-industrial sector during implementation of the CSP is estimated at UA 290 million, or 

about CFAF 232 billion, representing 24% of the financing gap. The project design is consistent 

with the guidelines of the Bank's “Feeding Africa” Strategy, which focuses on the value chain 

approach, productivity improvement and resilience, with the adoption of technologies 

(Technologies for African Agricultural Transformation (TAAT); Africa Climate-Smart 

Agriculture (ACSA). The project is aligned with Job for Youth strategies, including the ENABLE 

YOUTH initiative. Lastly, the project will contribute to the strengthening of women's economic 

empowerment and the establishment of appropriate financing mechanisms for the agricultural 

sector. Its design is also consistent with the guidelines of the Subregional Forum on Boosting the 

Rural Economy in Central Africa, jointly organized by the Bank and the International Labour 

Office (ILO) in February 2019 in Brazzaville. The forum highlighted the need to develop youth 

skills and entrepreneurship, innovations and investments to improve the productivity and 

attractiveness of the agricultural and rural sectors, diversify income sources and ensure social 

inclusion.

1.2.  Rationale for Bank Intervention 

1.2.1  The Bank's intervention, which is a response to the request of Congolese authorities, is 

justified by the need to support the Congolese economy's diversification strategy by mobilizing 

major investments for the structural transformation of the agricultural sector. Indeed, the agro-

industrial sector presents many opportunities in terms of income generation for small producers, 

job creation, especially for youths and women, and improved food and nutritional security. 

Through the constraints identified, the Bank's various missions made it possible to propose priority 

intervention areas in four value chains namely: cassava, maize, poultry and fish. 

1.2.2 With regard to cassava, the main constraints identified are: (i) low yields of about 8 

tonnes per hectare (t/ha) in rural areas, relative to a potential that exceeds 25 t/ha; (ii) unregulated 

rudimentary and hygienic conditions for processing cassava into flour and chikwangue; (iii) lack 

of transport means, limited access to production areas and harassment on the highways. Regarding 

the poultry sector (chicken and eggs) the constraints are: (i) challenges in the supply of day-old 

chicks, livestock feed (mainly maize as well as vitamin and micro-nutrient supplements); and (ii) 

weak veterinary advisory and support services. With regard to maize, which is the main raw 

material in the production of animal feed, the constraints are: (i) the limited (technical and 

entrepreneurial) capacities of small producers; (ii) difficulties in accessing quality seeds and other 

technologies; and (iii) inadequate production and marketing infrastructure and equipment. Lastly, 

regarding fish, the constraints are: (i) inaccessibility to production basins; (ii) insufficient advisory 

support; (iii) no stakeholder organization within the sector; and (iv) challenges in supplying 

improved feed, good fry and other plant ingredients. 

1.2.3 In rural financing, the main constraints are: (i) the unsuitability of the products offered 

(high interest rate, recovery period not concurrent with production cycles, etc.); (ii) the existence 

of uncontrolled agricultural risks; and (iii) considerable shortage of medium- and long-term 

lendable resources. In addition, the financial inclusion rate of the rural population, estimated at 

6%, remains low. The main reasons for such a low bank penetration rate include high poverty 

which accounts for insufficient incomes and the sheer size of the informal sector within which 

most economic actors operate.  

1.2.4 The project will help to eliminate the above-mentioned constraints by promoting 

inclusive agricultural and rural entrepreneurship. PRODIVAC supports competitive market-driven 

agriculture with strong private sector involvement. In addition, the project will support women's 

economic empowerment, entrepreneurship and youth skills development and the establishment of 

an appropriate agricultural financing mechanism. Lastly, the project will sustainably improve 

agricultural productivity by facilitating access to factors of production (improved and resilient 

inputs, machinery, labour, capital, land), soil fertility management and the improvement of rural 

infrastructure. It will achieve this mainly by opening up access to production  areas. The project 

will focus its operations on a limited number of value chains, namely: (i) cassava (Chikwangue, 

flour and other products); (ii) poultry (broilers and eggs); (iii) maize (for animal feed, direct 

consumption and breweries); and (iv) aquaculture/fish farming (fresh and salted/smoked fish). The 

selection of these value chains is informed by certain economic, environmental, social and 

institutional considerations namely: (i) market demand; (ii) their contribution to the national 

economy (import substitution and export growth); (iii) their potential impact on agricultural 

households, the youth and women; (iv) their production and productivity growth potential; (v) their 

contribution to food security and improved nutrition; and (vi) the opportunity to build on and 

consolidate past project interventions with a view to maximizing the outcomes of the current 

project.

1.3.  Aid Coordination 

1.3.1 The Ministry in charge of Planning currently plays a significant role in the coordination 

of operations. However, aid coordination in the agricultural sector will be further improved over 

the next years through the establishment of a thematic working group on agriculture and rural 

development in January 2019. The main donors in Congo’s agricultural sector are the World Bank 

which is financing the Commercial Agricultural Development Project with USD 100 million and 

the International Fund for Agricultural Development which is financing the Congo Inland 

Fisheries and Aquaculture Development Project (PDPAC) with USD 7.7 million. 

1.3.2 PRODIVAC will develop synergies and complementarities with ongoing investment 

projects and will mobilize co-financing and establish partnerships with future initiatives and 

projects. The project will also develop complementarities with an ongoing integrated initiative that 

connects small producers with an industrial processing plant in Loudima, Bouenza. The plant will 

have an annual production capacity of 16,000 tonnes of flour (bio-fortified with micro-nutrients) 

supplied at a social rate (less than 30% of the price of non-fortified flour) to the World Food 

Programme (for school feeding programmes and refugees as a substitute for rice imports) and to 

the national market. This approach will be developed through a public-private partnership with the 

participation of the government and United Nations agencies (WFP, FAO, IFAD). In addition, a 

request for the mobilization of parallel co-financing of UA 20 million from the Green Climate 

Funds is being prepared for approval in 2020. Lastly, expected partnership with the next IFAD 

project currently being designed will maximize the project's expected impact. The following table

2.2.  Technical Solution Adopted and Alternatives Explored 

2.2.1 Inclusive value chains and targeting of potential production areas. The project will focus 

its operations on a limited number of value chains (cassava, maize, poultry and fish) prioritized by 

direct stakeholders based on market demand, their contribution to the national economy (import 

substitution) and their potential impact on agricultural households, youths and women. The project 

aims at improving the competiveness of agricultural products, optimizing processing and 

marketing operations and facilitating business partnerships between small producers and private 

operators. Its focus will be on improving downstream agricultural production activities 

(processing, enhancing value-added and marketing), which should serve as a lever for improving 

production and adopting resilient technical routes. 



5 

 

2.2.2 Promotion of public-private partnership and facilitation of business partnerships among 

stakeholders. Agricultural sector transformation requires the involvement of the private sector 

which is the engine of growth, while the State plays the key role of defining strategic guidelines 

and facilitating the control and monitoring of development policies and actions through incentives 

and improvement of the business environment. There are opportunities to establish business 

partnerships between producer groups and private operators such as the Congo Sugar Refining 

company (Société agricole de raffinage industriel du sucre (SARIS)), the agro-pastoral company 

(ATORA), the Congolese Food Development and Distribution Authority (CODDIPA), Eco-Oil, 

AgriCongo, supermarkets as well as institutional markets such as the World Food Programme and 

public institutions (schools, public services). There is also the gradual emergence of a new class 

of agricultural entrepreneurs capable of investing in private farms and developing business 

relationships with small producers. PRODIVAC's interventions will help to facilitate negotiations 

between stakeholders or groups of stakeholders in the drafting of contracts. The simple contract 

farming model will be promoted for group marketing, and to facilitate financing within the value 

chains.  

2.2.3 Risk hedging and sharing facility: Target sectors will be financed through a technical 

mechanism linked to financial institutions in order to ensure the promotion of rural financial 

services and the sustainability of supply within the various segments of targeted value chains. The 

financing mechanism will make it possible to develop suitable financial products, including 

"mobile banking". This will involve: (i) the establishment of a direct credit window. PRODIVAC 

will set up a fund to provide partner financial institutions with stable lendable resources to 

adequately meet the financing needs of supported MPMEAs. Partner financial institutions (PFIs) 

will receive loans at an access rate of 3% per year, but will contribute 30% of the amount required 

to finance MPMEAs. The interest rates applicable to end borrowers will not exceed 9% per year. 

Beneficiaries' access to the window will be subject to: (i) a cash contribution of about 10%; (ii) 

the establishment of a mechanism known as a Guarantee Fund to support loans to MPMEAs and 

large companies operating in the sectors of the various PRODIVAC chains. Indeed, this Guarantee 

Fund is a hedging and risk sharing facility (HRSF). The project will consent to the establishment 

of a partial guarantee fund that will cover 50% of the risks in the event of default. Beneficiaries 

will also participate by providing commercial contracts appended to business plans within the 

context of productive partnerships. The conditions for the use of the HRSF will be discussed and 

specified with the PFIs concerned before the partnership agreements are formalized. Interest rates 

will be based on market rates and promoters will contribute 10% of the loan amount requested; 

and (iii) the creation of a capacity-building programme for stakeholders in the various 

sectors. 

 

2.2.4 This mechanism will be managed by a Financial Operator (FO) who will be selected on 

the basis of an analysis conducted with the support of an individual consultant. Consideration will 

be given to the strengths and weaknesses of existing refinancing and guarantee institutions 

(Garantie de l’Association Pointe Noire Industrielle, Support Fund for the Socio-economic 

Reintegration of Disadvantaged Groups, Agriculture Support Fund, etc.). The FO will be 

responsible for reviewing funding requests submitted by MPMEAs through partner financial 

institutions. This activity will make it possible to support the operationalization of the functional 

financing mechanism, prepare management tools, build the capacities of bank loan officers, 

promote the development of new financial products and the financial education of beneficiaries. 

2.2.5.  Skills development and youth entrepreneurship: With regard to technical and vocational 

training, PRODIVAC will finance: (i) the upgrading of the equipment of the Education, Training 

and Apprenticeship Centres (CEFA) in Dolisie, Brazzaville and Pointe Noire, financed through a 

previous Bank project; (ii) the upgrading of the equipment of Lycée Technique Industriel and 

Lycée d'Enseignement Professionnel Agricole in Brazzaville; (iii) the development and/or 



6 

 

adaptation of existing curricula to promising economic niches to facilitate youth access to 

employment; and (iv) the establishment of a platform/mechanism for anticipating skills needs and 

those of related occupations by building the capacity of teachers, business advisors, chambers of 

agriculture and all stakeholders in the education sector. With regard to youth entrepreneurship, 

PRODIVAC will finance the following activities: (i) prospective studies to identify 

entrepreneurship opportunities for the youth, raise awareness on entrepreneurship among the youth 

and provide guidance on existing entrepreneurship opportunities. Such awareness-raising will be 

conducted through workshops, for and media programmes, focusing on the success stories of 

young people who have prospered in the field of agricultural entrepreneurship; (ii) support for the 

establishment and assistance of 300 micro-, small- and medium-sized agricultural businesses 

(MPMEA) for youths through an incubation process of close supervision, coaching and mentoring; 

(iii) support for incubation centres, including the two Songhai centres in Congo and other public 

or private structures specializing in the business incubation process; and (iv) facilitation of a 

platform for young entrepreneurs. This activity will be developed in collaboration with the 

Ministry of Small and Medium Enterprises and with the support of specialized (international and 

national) technical assistance.4 

2.2.6 Competitive fund for innovation and promotion of youth entrepreneurship and 
agricultural start-ups. The project will finance an innovation fund to support entrepreneurs, youths 
and producers’ organisations (POs) who present innovative ideas and initiatives for improving 

value chain quality and performance, including: (i) the development of new products or markets; 

(ii) equipment and process testing; (iii) the use of alternative energy; (iv) new technologies that 

are more environmentally-friendly; (v) expertise in food quality and safety; (vi) the use of new 

information and communication technologies to market and promote products, including fortified 

cassava flour etc.; and (vi) the certification and labelling of processed products. Annual 

competitions will be organized at the national level to identify ideas and initiatives with the 

potential for large-scale impact. This fund will be managed with Association Pointe Noire 

Industrielle (APNI), which is already implementing a small- and medium-sized enterprises 

development programme, in collaboration with the Pointe Noire Chamber of Commerce, Industry, 

Agriculture and Crafts (CCIAM). Individual technical assistance will be mobilized for the 

development of operational procedures based on similar successful experiences (Tony Elumelu 

Entrepreneurship Program, AgriPitch, the Ivorian Competitive Fund for Agricultural Innovation, 

etc.). CCIAM will encourage financial institutions and operators in the telecommunications and 

private sector to co-invest in this fund, including buying shares in youth start-ups. 

2.2.7.   Sustainability of rural infrastructure. Actions to improve access will mainly be 

rehabilitation activities carried out from time to time to maintain critical areas (muddy segments, 

steep-sided low-lying areas, watercourse crossing points, steep slopes, etc.) to enable a given 

stretch of a road to be used all year round. The structures will be built of durable materials and 

designed to ensure proper drainage. Drawing lessons from road maintenance governance, the 

project will support local authorities and value chain actors to initiate local management by 

involving and empowering them at all implementation stages. This principle will strengthen local 

governance and the project's sustainability by enabling local authorities to play their roles in 

territorial development planning and infrastructure management in an inclusive manner. To this 

end, all sub-projects to be carried out under the project will be selected through a participatory 

process that involves the local authorities, economic actors and producer organizations in the 

relevant production areas.

2.5.  Project Area and Beneficiaries 

2.5.1 The project will primarily cover the corridors of major marketing and consumption 

centres of Brazzaville and Pointe Noire and the production areas in the Plateaux, Pool, and 

Bouenza Departments. The departments of Cuvette and Niari, in which the Songhai centres are 

located, will also be covered by the project, in particular with regard to the youth entrepreneurship 

component. However, the project will be flexible enough to support private investments outside 

these zones as well as priority sectors depending on market trends. Some project activities (access 

to financing, youth innovation funds, policy dialogue, etc.) will be more relevant from a thematic 

(value chains) and geographic perspective given their cross-cutting nature. The three departments 

selected have enormous potential for the development of agriculture, poultry and fish farming, 

with huge swathes of fertile land that remain unexploited. Furthermore, the project’s intervention 

in these areas, especially in the Pool Province, will contribute to peacebuilding and social cohesion.   

2.5.2.  The population of the three departments in the project area (25% of the country’s 

surface area) is 746,024 inhabitants, representing about 15% of the national population. 



9 

 

Agriculture is largely unmechanised and is practiced on very small farms of about 1 to 2 ha 

which produce 90% of the food yield. In this context, 70% of agricultural workers are women. 

The sector is characterized by slash-and-burn farming as well as low labour and surface area 

productivity. The real agricultural land occupancy rate remains low and output is insufficient for 

all sectors selected. These departments are connected to Brazzaville by national roads RN1 and 

RN2 and the Brazzaville-Pointe-Noire railway, which should create opportunities for produce 

marketing and the supply of inputs. Proximity to major urban centres is certainly an asset in 

terms of marketing and supply, but also a constraint due to the rural exodus of young workers 

drawn by more attractive conditions and opportunities.  

2.5.3.  Beneficiaries: The project will impact 355,000 persons in the different segments of the 

selected agri-food value chains. It will primarily target youths, women and vulnerable groups, 

including indigenous peoples, by increasing employment and income-generating opportunities in 

production and processing activities. It will do so by enhancing the attractiveness and profitability 

of such activities, supporting the development of agricultural entrepreneurship, providing adequate 

advisory support and promoting production-related activities (services, transport, marketing). 

More specifically, the project will seek to: (i) increase their incomes and enhance their economic 

independence; (ii) strengthen their decision-making ability and representation; (iii) promote 

women’s rights and financial autonomy; and (iv) reduce their workload. Women and youths will 

be targeted through the application of quotas and specific actions (Sub-components 1.2 on Youth 

Entrepreneurship Development and 2.3 on Women's Empowerment) to ensure their economic 

empowerment. The indirect beneficiaries of the project will be the populations of the departments 

of Brazzaville, Pointe Noire, Pool, Plateaux, Bouenza, Cuvette and Niari, who will benefit from 

improved market access for targeted agricultural products and job creation for young people. 

2.6.  Participatory Approach to Project Identification, Design and 

 Implementation 

2.6.1 In addition to consultations with government authorities and technical services of the 

ministries6 concerned by the project and with technical and financial partners in the agricultural 

sector, extensive consultations were also held with all stakeholders in the agricultural value chains. 

The various project formulation missions carried out visits to markets and private companies and 

held group discussions with young entrepreneurs as well as civil society and private sector 

organizations in Brazzaville and Pointe Noire. The missions made field visits to the Pool, Plateaux 

and Bouenza Departments and held consultations with the relevant stakeholders (producer groups, 

women's cooperatives, youth groups, local authorities and decentralized technical services). They 

also held consultations with several financial institutions, including the Bank of Central African 

States, commercial banks (UBA, BCI, BGFI-Bank) and microfinance institutions (CAPPED, 

MUCODEC and Crédit du Congo). The mission also met with major private operators in the 

Congolese agri-food sector, including SARIS, ATORA, CODDIPA and the Federation of 

Congolese Entrepreneurs, UNICONGO. 

2.6.2 These consultations made it possible to determine, among other things: (i) the production 

areas and priority sectors; (ii) market trends and trade flows; (iii) business opportunities and 

potential value added in the value chains; (iv) the interventions of previous projects; (v) the 

regulatory business environment, constraints on effective and adequate private sector involvement 

and participation; (vi) innovations and technologies to improve production and processing; (vii) 

the position and aspirations of women and youths in value chains; (viii) experiences and 

                                                 
6  The Mission worked closely and with the wide involvement of the technical services of the following ministries: Agriculture, Livestock and 

Fisheries; Forestry; Planning, Equipment and Major works; Equipment and Road Maintenance; Small and Medium Enterprises, Craft s and 

Informal Sector, Technical and Vocational Education, Skills Training and Employment; Scientific Research and Technological Innovation; 

Women's Development and Gender Integration in Development; Youth and Civic Education; Trade, Supply and Consumer Affairs; etc.

constraints in accessing finance, especially for agricultural, agri-business and MSMEA 

development in the medium and long terms; (ix) lessons learned from previous projects; and (x) 

specific issues to be explored in different areas. These consultations revealed that all segments of 

the agricultural value chains were underdeveloped and fragmented, and faced several constraints. 

Processing and marketing, in particular, have remained weak links in the agricultural value chains. 

Consultations with stakeholders will continue during project implementation to ensure the 

effective implementation and sustainability of operations. 

2.7. Bank Group Experience and Lessons Reflected in Project Design 

2.7.1.  Since 1967, the Bank has contributed UA 356 million to financing development 

operations in the Republic of Congo. Apart from the agricultural sector study conducted in 2012, 

the Bank’s agricultural sector investments in Congo date back more than 20 years. Its portfolio 

performance in Congo is considered satisfactory overall. The experience gained from cooperation 

with Congo during implementation of the country strategy and projects highlights the importance 

of: (i) focusing on selectivity and flexibility in project design and implementation; (ii) paying 

special attention to both physical investments and governance; (iii) building partnerships with the 

private sector; (iv) focusing on large, core/transformative, integrated projects; and (v) ensuring 

better quality at entry and applying a more pragmatic and realistic approach when programming 

operations. These lessons are reflected in the new Country Strategy Paper (CSP 2018-2022) 

through which the Bank intends to play the role of catalyst in the agribusiness sector, which is 

crucial to diversification of the Congolese economy.  

2.7.2  The project integrated the lessons learned from the IDEV (currently BDEV) evaluation 

of the Bank's support for AVC7 development, whose recommendations focus on the following key 

principles: (i) analyse the entire value chain; (ii) develop a strategy to ensure inclusiveness; (iii) 

maintain the capacity to adapt to market trends; (iv) think in terms of profitability with added 

value; and (v) develop plans to create a sustainable impact.  

2.8.  Main Performance Indicators  

2.8.1.  PRODIVAC's impact indicators are (i) a reduction in the chronic malnutrition rate from 

21% to 18%; (ii) an increase in agricultural-sector growth from 7 to 11%; and (iii) a significant 

reduction in food imports. Over six years, the project's outputs will directly benefit approximately 

125,000 people (and indirectly benefit about 355,000 people, of whom 40% are women and 40% 

are young people) in various segments of the cassava, maize, poultry and fish value chains. The 

project is expected to produce the following results: (i) an increase of at least 40% in the marketed 

volumes of the targeted value chains; (ii) a significant reduction in post-harvest losses and animal 

mortality (at least 60% on average); (iii) at least 400 small- and medium-sized agricultural 

enterprises promoted through the refinancing and financing risk-hedging mechanism; (iv) an 

improvement in the Rural Women's Empowerment Index (1 = low and 5 = high) from 1 to 3.5; (v) 

an increase in the agricultural loan portfolio of at least 7.5 billion outstanding loans at the end of 

the project; (vi) an average increase of more than 70% in the yield and output of the targeted 

sectors; and (vii) improved food diversity via greater production and consumption of iron-rich 

foods.

III.  PROJECT FEASIBILITY 

3.1.  Economic and Financial Performance 

3.1.1.  Financial performance was assessed for ten (10) typical models of farms and enterprises 

engaged in the production, processing, quality improvement and marketing of cassava, maize, 

poultry and fish, which reflect the range of activities that the project will support.  The financial 

analysis shows that these investments will contribute to boosting the net profits of these 

operations/companies substantially, which is evidence that the activities supported by PRODIVAC 

will be profitable. These results (Table 3.1) show that project support will improve the financial 

performance of MSMAEs engaged in production, processing, conservation and marketing.  

3.1.2. The economic analysis results show that the project benefits are very positive. The 

project's basic economic rate of return is 20.1%. The net present value is estimated at EUR 104.4 

million. However, this amount should increase if project benefits pertaining to the reduction of 

micro-nutrient deficiencies and chronic malnutrition, access to safe drinking water and sanitation, 

and the economic empowerment of women are factored into the equation. Indeed, reduction of 

malnutrition and access to safe drinking water will help to improve the overall health status of 

households, and lead to, inter alia, increased labour productivity for household members and 

reduced spending. Supporting young people through business incubation will strengthen their 

managerial capacity and boost self-employment and employment for other young people. 

Table 3.1: Significant Economic and Financial Figures 
 

ERR (baseline scenario): 20.1%  NPV amount: 104.4 (EUR million) 

 

3.1.3.  The sensitivity analysis based on a 30% increase in costs, a 30% decrease in benefits and 

a three-year delay in generating benefits, a 20% increase in input prices and a 20% decrease in 

product prices confirms the project's robust positive economic effects and impacts with economic 

rates of return of 17.9%, 16.2%, 15.3%, 10.2% and 17.6% respectively.  

3.2.  Environmental and Social Impacts 

Environment 

3.2.1  The project is classified under Category 2 of the Bank's Integrated Safeguards System 

(ISS) and the Bank's Climate Safeguards System (CSS), equivalent to Category B at the national 

level, although many sites and activities have not yet been identified at this stage of project 

preparation. Activities included in Component 2 of the project are likely to generate negative 

environmental impacts, such as: (i) pollution and waste generation during infrastructure 

construction works; (ii) pollution and waste generation during product processing within the 

various value chains; (iii) risks of land and water pollution and of the endangerment of the health 

of users by agrochemical products; (iv) degradation of the flora and fauna during the operation of 

quarries and borrow pits for construction work; (v) risk of accidents on construction sites and at 

processing unit sites and; (vi) the risk of transmission of communicable diseases on the various 

sites.  

3.2.2 However, the expected negative impacts will be limited in time. Given that the location 

and environmental and social characteristics of all investments are not known, an Environmental 

and Social Management Framework (ESMF) has been prepared in accordance with the 

requirements of the Bank's Integrated Safeguards System. The ESMF indicates the mitigation and 

management procedures, and measures that will have to be implemented by the project once the 

sites and sub-projects are known. These measures are outlined in the Environmental and Social 

Management Framework (ESMF) Plan and include: sub-project analysis and screening 

procedures; consultation, communication and conflict management procedures; environmental 



12 

 

and social management plans (ESMPs) and environmental and social clauses to be included in 

bidding documents and sub-project implementation contracts; guidelines on forests and wetlands; 

and guidelines on pesticide and pest management. The project’s activities will yield many positive 

impacts for both local communities and the environment. Therefore, the participatory approach 

involving local communities in the rehabilitation of road infrastructure, the promotion of more 

sustainable and climate-smart agricultural practices and the reduction of post-harvest losses will 

boost the livelihood resilience of rural households, restore soil fertility and increase tree cover, 

thereby significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  

3.2.3  Functions pertaining to environmental protection measures will include (i) screening of 

sub-projects and identification of their category using environmental and social selection forms; 

(ii) recruitment of consultancy firms/consultants to prepare ESMPs after validation of the process 

by the Directorate-General for the Environment; (iii) inclusion of environmental clauses into the 

recruitment process for implementing companies; (iv) monitoring/evaluation of the 

implementation of sub-projects; and (vi) coordination of audits. As a whole, the environmental 

and social function needs to be strengthened within the institutions involved in project 

implementation. Moreover, institutional and technical support, training and awareness-raising 

measures will have to be adopted to build institutional and human capacities. Such measures will 

seek to: (i) operationalize PRODIVAC's environmental management strategy; (ii) foster the 

emergence of local expertise and professionals in environmental and social management; (iii) raise 

the professional awareness and level of responsibility of the staff in production companies; and 

(iv) protect the urban and rural environment, health and safety of beneficiary communities. 

3.2.4  The total cost of the project ESMF is CFAF 374 million with provisions of (i) 

CFAF 110 million for studies including ESMPs, the Pest and Pesticide Management Plan (PPMP) 

and the Environmental and Social Management Systems (ESMS) Manual for each value chain; 

(ii) CFAF 105 million for training and awareness-raising; (iii) CFAF 50 million for compensation 

for any asset damage and; (iv) CFAF 79 million for monitoring/evaluation.   

3.2.5  Consultations were conducted under the ESMF at different periods of project 

preparation. Participants’ comments were integrated into the ESMF that has been validated by the 

Bank and the summary was published on 26/08/20198. 

Climate Change 

3.2.6  The impacts of climate change are evident in Congo through, inter alia, rising 

temperatures and increasingly erratic rainfall that affect the national agricultural sector, thus 

increasing the vulnerability of local communities to this phenomenon. PRODIVAC is proposed 

for classification in Category 2 for Climate Change as it will integrate the appropriate adaptation 

measures for all the selected sectors. These measures will be simple, affordable, already validated 

and tested in the country or sub-region and accessible to smallholders. They will include the 

dissemination of short-cycle varieties and the planting of cover crops and leguminous shrubs 

(agroforestry) on farms. Co-financing is being sought under the Adaptation Window of the Green 

Climate Fund. The eligible activities are those that fall under Component 2, which seeks to 

strengthen the resilience of agriculture through : (i) the dissemination of improved seeds, farming 

best practices and climate-smart technologies; and (ii) the construction of backbone infrastructure 

to ensure the sustainable development of agricultural value chains.

Gender  

3.2.7.  The project is classified in Gender Category No. 2, according to the Bank's Gender 

Marker System (GMS)9, as it will help to reduce the gender gap in terms of access to production 

factors and income. Women, who represent about 50% of the population of Congo and 70% of the 

agricultural workforce and contribute 80% to traditional subsistence agriculture, 22% to 

commercial agriculture, and nearly 90% to the processing of agricultural products, are more 

vulnerable to poverty. The project's targeting strategy takes this reality into account and will ensure 

that women have at least 40% representation in project activities. In addition, the project is 

investing approximately EUR 5 million to finance specific activities for the economic 

empowerment of women to (i) process and sell cassava products; (ii) process and sell fish; (iii) 

promote improved village poultry farming; (iv) organize women's groups and cooperatives, and 

capacity building; and (v) promote basic actions in nutrition, hygiene and sanitation.  

3.2.8.  In addition to sex- and age-disaggregated data, gender-specific indicators are included in 

the results-based logical framework to measure the women's empowerment index in agriculture. 

This index measures women's increased capacity to make strategic life choices within their 

households and communities, focusing on five areas of agricultural empowerment, namely: (i) 

production (women's role in family decision-making on agricultural production); (ii) resources 

(women's access to productive capital, access to and decision-making power over loans); (iii) 

control over income use; (iv) women's individual leadership and influence in the community; and 

(v) time allocation for women. This index will be used as a diagnostic tool and a monitoring 

indicator to measure how the project affects women's empowerment.  

3.2.9.  Specific activities for young people have been developed in sub-component 1.2. These 

activities include: (i) the identification and promotion of agricultural entrepreneurship 

opportunities; (ii) the establishment and support of micro, small and medium-sized agricultural 

enterprises run by young people, via, inter alia, innovative business incubators and financing; (iii) 

the establishment of a platform to exchange information, experience and networking among 

entrepreneurs (competitions will be organized to find a tool developer); (iv) the establishment of 

a competitive fund to innovate and promote entrepreneurship and agricultural start-ups owned by 

young people; and (v) the promotion of incubators for young people, especially by boosting 

existing initiatives such as Songhaï Center and CEFAs financed by previous Bank projects.   

Social Aspects 

3.2.10.  PRODIVAC will have major positive impacts on the living conditions of rural 

communities by improving the production structure in various agricultural sub-sectors and 

increasing access to basic infrastructure, such as rural roads, markets, drinking water and sanitation 

facilities. Project activities will focus on skills development and youth employment in rural areas, 

gender inclusion, improvement of the living conditions of beneficiaries, cooperative 

entrepreneurship to improve the distribution of value throughout the various value chains. The 

project will generate cross-cutting benefits for small family farms, women, young people and small 

and medium-sized enterprises in terms of improved incomes, greater productivity, and better living 

conditions for agricultural families. Finally, through the local development participatory approach 

adopted, PRODIVAC will help strengthen the social inclusion of minority groups, particularly 

indigenous peoples, and the reduction of inequalities along the value chains. 

 

                                                 
9 According to the Bank's GMP, a project is classified under the Category 2 if it reduces gender 

inequalities and or, women's economic empowerment is one of the effects of the project, but not 

the main one. 

 



14 

 

Forced Resettlement 

 

3.2.11  PRODIVAC activities will not involve the acquisition of land, the forced resettlement of 

communities and/or restriction of their access to resources or livelihoods. Support for the 

development of specific value chains will essentially entail guiding cooperative groups and private 

companies that own land in their production, processing and marketing activities, using 

technological packages, capacity-building, and better access to finance and partners in the value 

chains. The improvement of seeds, cuttings, fry and chicks will be conducted by existing research 

institutions and private investors who will use their own land. Seed and cutting growers and private 

investors will conduct their activities on their land and in accordance with the applicable national 

land tenure policies and laws.  

3.2.12  With regard to core infrastructure, the project will adopt an active approach that favours 

the participation and empowerment of sector stakeholders and local authorities at all stages of 

implementation (from planning to works completion). Requests for support must come from the 

Departmental Council or the Rural Community. Infrastructure sites such as markets and other 

buildings will be owned by local communities or the Departmental Council, which will be 

responsible for their management and maintenance. Rural access roads will be rehabilitated on an 

as-needed basis, focusing on critical points (muddy segments, steep-sided low-lying areas, 

watercourse crossing points, steep slopes etc.) with as much local support as possible. The Project 

will set up local and departmental complaint management committees that will also be responsible 

for initiating and supervising the payment of any compensation arising from the destruction of an 

asset or restriction of access to a resource as a result of project activities. Financial provision for 

such compensation has been made in the ESMP, in particular for infrastructure construction or 

rehabilitation sub-projects.  

IV.  EXECUTION 

4.1.  Implementation Arrangements 

4.1.1 National Steering Committee (CNP): PRODIVAC will have a National Steering 

Committee chaired by the Minister who serves as AfDB Governor (or his or her representative) 

with the Minister of Agriculture (or his or her representative) acting as deputy chair. The members 

of the National Steering Committee will include: (i) representatives of the ministries concerned by 

the project, in particular the Ministries of Agriculture, Planning, Finance, Forest Economy, 

Technical Education and Employment, SMEs, Industry, Social Affairs, Health, and those handling 

youth and women’s affairs; (ii) a private-sector representative, UNICONGO; (iii) a representative 

of Congolese producer organisations, the National Confederation of Congolese Producer 

Organisations (CNOP) and; (iv) a representative of the local authorities in the project area. This 

arrangement was adopted due to the selection of PACIGOF/PADEC, under the supervision of the 

Ministry of Planning, to host the Coordination Unit and given that the project spans several sectors. 

The mandate of the National Steering Committee, which will meet at least twice a year, is to: (i) 

review and approve the annual work plans and budgets prepared by the project; (ii) review the 

semi-annual progress reports, annual reports, mid-term review reports and project completion 

reports; (iii) ensure that programme/project activities are consistent with the sector programmes 

and strategies of the Ministries concerned by the project; (iv) review progress made towards the 

achievement of project objectives; (v) facilitate the coordination of project activities between the 

various implementing entities; and (vi) analyse implementation risks and obstacles and provide 

the necessary guidance to ensure the attainment of expected results. 



15 

 

4.1.2 Project Coordination Unit (PCU): The PCU will be hosted within the 

PACIGOF/PADEC Coordination Unit,10 which has proven experience in the administrative and 

fiduciary management and coordination of Bank projects and those of other financial partners. In 

addition, it is already involved in improving the business climate and supporting small and 

medium-sized enterprises. Consequently, this arrangement will yield efficiency gains by pooling 

certain resources and functions, including procurement, financial management, communication 

and knowledge management, administration, and human resources management. The PCU is 

expected to: (i) facilitate inter-sector coordination; (ii) monitor implementation of the 

recommendations from the CNP's deliberations and those of audit reports, portfolio reviews, mid-

term reviews; (iii) ensure the fiduciary management of the project; and produce any other 

document that falls within its remit. PACIGOF/PADEC coordination will be strengthened through 

a Deputy Coordinator; assistants responsible for fiduciary management, internal and external 

monitoring and evaluation (monitoring of implementation, outcomes and impact in collaboration 

with the National Statistics Institution), value-chain development and financing; a private-sector 

development and entrepreneurship expert, an environmental and social protection expert and 

support staff. The technical departments of the Ministries involved in implementing the project 

will be responsible for the technical execution of the components under their purview. Each 

directorate will designate a focal point to monitor day-to-day activities.  

4.1.3 Departmental Offices: Three departmental offices of the Project will be established in 

the departments concerned. They will be located in Kinkala, Djambala and Madingou. Agricultural 

sector leaders will be the project's focal points at the district level. The two Songhai centres will 

be directly monitored by the National Coordination Unit. The departmental offices will be 

responsible for the following tasks: (i) project coordination at the departmental level and 

establishment of ties with local authorities; (ii) preparation and monitoring/evaluation of AWPB 

(Annual Work Programme and Budget) at the departmental level and drafting of progress reports; 

(iii) provision of technical support for implementation of the technical components of the Project; 

(v) regular and close monitoring/supervision of the project and service providers; (vi) assessment 

of the agreements and performance contracts of local service providers; (vii) stakeholder 

mobilization for the implementation of operations; and (viii) development of synergies and 

partnerships within their respective project areas. Departmental office staff will comprise: (i) the 

office manager, who is an institutional development and capacity-building expert or a specialist in 

a similar field of expertise; (ii) an agricultural engineering technician; (iii) an agro-pastoral 

production systems technician; (iv) an agro-business advisor (processing and marketing); (v) a 

monitoring/evaluation and knowledge management assistant; (vi) an administrative and financial 

assistant; and (vii) support staff (one assistant, two drivers and two watchmen). 

4.1.4  Technical Assistance and Launch Support: In view of PRODIVAC's specific focus on 

innovative approaches to integrated value-chain development, including the promotion of youth 

entrepreneurship and the development of financing mechanisms, it is suggested that targeted 

technical assistance be mobilized to launch the project quickly and implement it efficiently. It will 

focus on: (i) developing strategic programming and country programme management tools; (ii) 

building the capacity of implementation stakeholders and launching specific institutional support 

activities; (iii) refining targeting and implementation approaches; (iv) reconfiguring the 

monitoring/evaluation system; (v) developing the scale-up strategy; and (vi) launching financial 

services access activities. To that end, the FAO's technical assistance will be mobilized to develop 

the seed sector and promote climate-smart technologies. With regard to skills development through 

technical and vocational training and entrepreneurship, ILO technical assistance will be mobilized 

to support the relevant technical ministry. PRODIVAC will also support the development of 

partnerships between the Compacts of the Bank-funded Multinational Programme Technology for

Africa Agricultural Transformation in (TAAT) and national research programmes on cassava, 

maize, poultry and fish farming.  

4.1.5  Implementation Stakeholders: Implementation stakeholders comprise specialized 

private companies, consultancy firms, specialized public entities and any other specialized 

structures, depending on the most appropriate procurement method. Technical Assistance and 

Local Support: The experience and lessons learned from project implementation in Congo 

highlight three major limitations: (i) delays at project launch (ii) weak implementation teams and 

operators; and (iii) onerous procurement procedures. Accordingly, technical assistance in the form 

of short-term individual consultants will be mobilized to: (i) update the manual and configure the 

PACIGOF management system; (ii) prepare the implementation and monitoring/evaluation 

manuals; (iii) prepare the implementation and bidding documents for 300 km of rural roads, in 

addition to the two TA packages for the financing and innovation fund component. These expenses 

will be covered as soon as the project is approved by the PACIGOF project.  

4.1.6  Procurement Arrangements: All goods and works obtained through international 

competitive bidding and consultancy services financed by the Bank shall be procured in 

accordance with the Procurement Policy for Bank-Group Funded Operations (dated October 2015) 

and using the appropriate standard bidding documents of the Bank. Goods and works obtained 

through national competitive bidding shall be procured in accordance with national public 

procurement laws, using the country's standard bidding documents, and with the provisions set out 

in the financing agreement. A procurement plan for the first 18 months was prepared by the 

Government during the appraisal mission and will be regularly updated during the project 

implementation phase. The procurement arrangements are outlined in the technical annexes. 

Financial Management and Disbursement Arrangements 

4.1.7 The fiduciary risk for PRODIVAC's financial management is assessed as moderate. The 

financial management arrangements within the PADEC/PACIGOF Project Coordination Unit at 

the Ministry of Planning, meet the Bank's minimum requirements as defined in the policy on 

"Financial Management of Projects Financed by the African Development Bank" issued in 

February 2014. This Unit, which has already implemented the PADE (WB) and PACADEC 

(ADB) projects, has relevant experience in implementing projects financed jointly by the Bank 

and the World Bank. Lessons learned from the implementation of completed PADE/PACADEC 

projects were factored into the assessment of the executing agency's capacity and financial 

management risk. These lessons will help to improve PRODIVAC's financial management 

through the risk mitigation measures proposed in the financial management action plan presented 

in the annex. These measures will make it possible to maintain a moderate level of fiduciary risk 

and to provide, with reasonable certainty, reliable financial information that is consistent with the 

Bank's minimum requirements.    

4.1.8 The fiduciary team will carry out its tasks under the supervision of the current 

administrative and financial officer whose capacities were deemed to be acceptable by the 

appraisal mission. The team's capacities will be strengthened via a project-funded on-site training 

programme. PRODIVAC’s financial management will be based on the existing system used by 

the PACIGOF/PADEC Project Coordination Unit (premises, equipment, manual, software, 

support staff, etc.). The current Coordinator, as well as the Deputy Coordinator to be recruited, 

will be responsible, in accordance with their respective terms of reference, for the administration 

of project resources, and shall authorize, together with the project accountant (or administrative 

and financial assistant) the disbursement of funds allocated to the project. Financial monitoring 

reports will be prepared in a format to be determined during the negotiation phase, and submitted 

to the Bank 45 days after the end of each quarter.  



17 

 

4.1.9 The recruitment of the external auditor will be the responsibility of the unit, and may be 

carried out in consultation with the Court of Auditors and Budgetary Discipline as part of the 

recourse to national systems as decided during the mid-term review of the Congo Country Strategy 

Paper. The external auditor's TORs will be adapted to take project specificities into account, and 

validated during the negotiations for the recruitment of an independent firm with experience in 

auditing Bank-financed projects. Audits will be carried out in accordance with the ISA/ISSAI 

international standards. The financial statements audited by the independent firm will be sent (see 

table for frequency) to the Bank no later than six months after the end of the financial year 

concerned. Due to the institutional arrangements of each implementing entity, and the 

arrangements described above, the possibility of recruiting a single auditor for all projects executed 

by the Ministry of Planning has not been considered. However, to the extent that the capacities of 

the Court of Auditors and Budgetary Discipline so permit, the Court may include  the organization 

of audit missions to Bank-financed projects in its annual programmes. A provision from loan 

resources will be allocated to cover the expenses of missions to be conducted under PRODIVAC 

and other Bank projects. 

4.1.10 Disbursement Arrangements : Loan resources will be disbursed in accordance with the 

Bank's Disbursement Manual as soon as the loan agreement enters into force and the conditions 

precedent to the first disbursement have been fulfilled. In general, three methods are used to 

disburse funds, namely: (i) the direct payment method; (ii) the working capital or special account 

method; and (iii) the reimbursement method. A disbursement letter setting out the specific 

disbursement terms of the project will be the subject of negotiations between the Bank and the 

Borrower. Counterpart resources will be disbursed in accordance with national procedures that 

provide for the opening of an account for external financing. Two special accounts will be opened 

in Brazzaville to receive Loan resources intended to cover operating costs and community 

activities. Project sub-accounts will be opened in the antennas with the authorization of the 

Ministry of Finance. 

4.2.  Monitoring  

4.2.1.  Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) will be based on four main pillars, namely: (i) the 

results-based logical framework that defines the results indicators (impacts, outcomes and 

outputs); (ii) the Annual Work Programmes and Budgets (AWPBs) that define the programme 

implementation activities, outputs and priorities; (iii) the monitoring/evaluation manual to be 

developed at project commencement and that will define the approaches, methods and tools for 

collecting, analysing data and disseminating the results achieved in terms of outputs, outcomes 

and impacts; and (iv) an IT platform to develop a consolidated geo-referenced monitoring and 

evaluation system, integrating the key indicators of the NDP in relation to ongoing projects, 

private-sector investments and the monitoring and evaluation systems of the NDP.  PRODIVAC 

monitoring and evaluation will include: (i) (ex ante) quantitative and qualitative impact studies 

that will facilitate the design of impact matrices and change trajectories; (ii) continuous internal 

monitoring of activities using a simple and reliable (digital) data collection system; (iii) 

participatory self-assessments with the active involvement of direct actors and stakeholders; (iv) 

supervision missions and ad hoc external assessments as identified by the supervision missions 

and stakeholders; (v) a mid-term review carried out jointly by the Bank and the Government at the 

end of the third year; and (vi) a final appraisal and impact study at project completion to facilitate 

the preparation of the final project report and inform the completion mission.  

4.3.  Governance  

4.3.1.  In terms of global governance, Congo scores 42.8 out of 100 and is ranked 42nd out of 54 

African countries on the Ibrahim Index of African Governance (IIAG). Under the impetus of the 

IMF, the Government has undertaken to conduct, with international assistance, an in-depth study 

on the governance situation in Congo. The Bank and the World Bank are supporting the country 



18 

 

to improve public finances and the business climate through the PADEC and PACIGOF projects. 

Specifically, governance risks in project implementation will be related to procurement, financial 

management, and land management. In this context, the Bank conducted detailed risk assessments 

at Borrower, sector, and project level during project design and, significant measures complete 

with action plans were prepared. PRODIVAC will also support the digitisation of agricultural land, 

linked to a geographical information system, to provide the country with an adequate land 

management tool. In addition, the participatory approach to local development, participation by 

the private sector, non-governmental organisations and beneficiaries in the steering and 

implementation of activities will promote citizen control as a guarantee of good governance. 

4.4. Sustainability  

4.4.1.  The possibility of sustainability and scale-up of the Project's achievements over the long 

term is high. Economic and financial analysis sensitivity tests show that the project remains 

profitable despite a reduction in profits, an increase in input prices and a decrease in product prices. 

The sustainability of investments and expected benefits is based on participatory and 

entrepreneurial approaches to capacity building, including (i) the structuring and 

professionalization of value chain organisations and actors on the basis of expressed demand, (ii) 

partnership with financial institutions to ease access to finance; (iii) the business and 

entrepreneurial dimension and the development of youth skills; (iv) the choice of proven and 

locally manageable techniques and technologies; and the participation and empowerment of value 

chain and local government actors for management of the infrastructure built; and (v) women’s 

economic empowerment. The Project, in collaboration with local authorities, will support the 

establishment of a sustainable management and maintenance mechanism for each infrastructure 

project, based on the organisation of beneficiaries into user associations, establishment of a 

management committee and maintenance fund.  

4.5.  Risk Management  

4.5.1.  The main risks that the project could face: (i) vulnerability to climate change; (ii) low 

capacity of youth support systems and value chain actors; (iii) low interest of financial institutions 

in developing specific financial products; (iv) reluctance of smallholders to innovate; (v) low 

capacity of service providers and (vi) inadequacies in rural infrastructure sustainability 

mechanisms. To mitigate these risks, the following actions will be taken: (i) the dissemination of 

smart agricultural technologies (community agroforestry, short-cycle and attack-resistant seeds, 

etc.); (ii) strengthening of links between agricultural promoters and chambers of agriculture/trades 

whose capacities will be built; (iii) promotion of internal value chain financing mechanisms and 

financial education for beneficiaries; (iv) technical assistance to financial institutions including the 

training and involvement of credit officers in the agricultural entrepreneurship process; (v) the 

adoption of demonstration farms that promote peer training of farmers; and the involvement of 

beneficiaries and local actors in the monitoring of works, the mobilisation of specialised technical 

assistance and the signing of performance contracts with service providers and project 

implementation unit staff. Residual management risks will be minimised through the competitive 

recruitment of staff and partners; the development of annual performance contracts, renewable 

based on good performance; and capacity-building for project management teams at different 

levels. 

4.6.  Knowledge Management  

4.6.1.  As part of knowledge management, an electronic library will be established to store all 

relevant documents from the agricultural sector, an inventory of best practices and identified local 

knowledge and innovations. The library will be accessible to stakeholders and the public. This 

activity will be developed as part of institutional support to the Directorate of Studies and Planning 

(DEP) of the Ministry of Agriculture. The tools and means of communication will be shared with 



19 

 

other projects in the agricultural sector, in particular PADEC and PDAC. A flexible knowledge 

management system, incorporating data, studies and documentation on the agricultural sector held 

by TFPs will be developed to ensure: (i) continuous information to improve programme 

performance; identification, analysis, documentation and dissemination of best practices; (ii) 

interactive and inclusive communication with project managers and all stakeholders; and (iii) 

visibility for policy dialogue and advocacy. Mechanisms of communication with beneficiaries 

upstream, during and downstream of the interventions will be developed. Project-generated 

knowledge will thus help to improve the interventions of ongoing projects, inform the design of 

new projects and boost participation in policy dialogues on themes that may affect improvement 

of the economic environment of sectors (inclusive sector policies, promotion of local products and 

development of standards, trade and tariff policy, etc.). The development of financing mechanisms 

in partnership with financial institutions will generate experiences, best practices and approaches 

that could be used in other value chains and countries to support the development of financial 

products tailored to youth enterprises and the financing needs of small, medium and large 

enterprises.
