Project Executive Summary 

1.1 Project Overview: A Global Environment Facility (GEF) grant of USD 5,329,452 (UA 
3.807 million) was mobilized to finance the project entitled “Building Resilience for Food 
Security and Nutrition in Chad’s Rural Communities ”. This co-financed grant will be used to 
maximize the impact of the Programme to Build Resilience to Food and Nutrition Insecurity 
in the Sahel (P2RS), funded with African Development Fund (ADF) resources. P2RS, 
approved by the Board of Directors in October 2014, was designed for a 20-year period 
tosustainably increase agro-sylvo-pastoral and fisheries productivity in the Sahel. In addition 
to the regional component, some countries are implementing their own national projects. P2RS 
Project 1 involves seven Sahel countries most affected by food crises, including Chad. The 
project will serve as a basis for GEF co-financing. The P2RS-Chad component, placed under 
the supervision of the Ministry of Agriculture, specifically aims to strengthen the resilience of 
rural communities through the development of agriculture and livestock, irrigation systems and 
regional markets for agricultural inputs and livestock products. The implementation of P2RS 
Project 1 is under way and involves both central and decentralized entities responsible for 
agriculture, animal resources, the environment and nutrition. GEF’s co-financing, which 
targets the same objectives as the initial P2RS, will be implemented concurrently with the Chad 
component. The GEF Project Identification Form (PIF) was approved on 28 April 2015 and 
endorsed by its Chief Executive Officer and Chairperson on 13 September 2017. The aim of 
the GEF project is to help restore and maintain the basic productivity of the natural resources 
on which people depend. The idea is to strengthen food security and nutrition by using 
sustainable and resilient agro-sylvo-pastoral systems in the target regions. 

1.2 The underlying concept of the GEF project is that resilience in the Sahel will be 
impossible if equal attention is not paid to both  the rational and sustainable management of 
the natural systems that support rural livelihoods. The proposed project will also seek to restore 
and maintain the productivity of natural assets in fragile ecosystems through: (i) the 
improvement of agro-sylvo-pastoral productivity in arid zones; (ii) the promotion of integrated 
ecosystem management to protect biodiversity; and (iii) knowledge building and monitoring 
and evaluation. It aims to build the resilience of communities and households regularly affected 
by climate-related extreme events, through a sustained increase in the productivity of natural 
resources, thus helping to enhance food security and nutrition in Kanem and Bahr el Ghazal 
provinces. Therefore, the project will enable stakeholders to contribute to the restoration of 
biodiversity in fragile ecosystems. On this basis, the GEF project will be implemented in the 
regions targeted by the initial P2RS over a four-year period. The Ministry of Agriculture, which 
oversees the initial P2RS, will remain the executing body for the GEF project. The activities 
will be implemented by the existing Project Implementation Unit (PIU) and managed by the 
same steering committee. It should be noted that the GEF project has already been approved 
by the GEF Chief Executive Officer and Chairperson, and has now been submitted to the Board 
of Directors for approval. 

1.3 Needs Assessment: In line with the rural development, environmental management 
and climate change priorities and the Chad Vision 2030 for Development, whose main 
objective is to make Chad an emerging country by 2030, the Government has developed and 
launched a number of sectoral policies and national development strategies, including the 
National Development Plan 2017-2021, which succeeds the previous National Development 
Plan 2013-2015, the National Poverty Reduction Strategies I and II, the National Biodiversity 
Strategy and Action Plan (2014 - 2020) and the National Adaptation Programme of Action on 
Climate Change (NAPA, 2009). The project interventions will help to reduce land degradation 
and promote sustainable management of natural resources, thereby building economic, social 
and climate resilience. As such, it is in line with thrust 4 of the Vision 2030 paper, which aims 



 

v 
 

to improve the quality of life of the Chadian people by creating a healthy environment with 
preserved natural resources. 

1.4 Target Beneficiaries: The project’s direct beneficiaries are the 11,000 smallholder 
farmers who engage in subsistence agriculture and livestock farming on marginal lands and 
derive their income from agriculture, livestock farming or the gathering of wood and non-wood 
products. Through the various activities that will be initiated, the project will help to bolster 
their resilience to food and nutrition insecurity and improve access to agro-pastoral and 
transhumance resources, which should be developed with an emphasis on resource 
sustainability and diversification.  

Professional organizations, grassroots community organizations and actors at both local and 
central levels involved in the implementation of the planned activities will have their capacities 
strengthened through the activities proposed by the project. 

1.5 Bank’s Value Added: The Bank will build on and develop implementation approaches 
and principles based on its long experience in the Sahel, especially in water mobilization and 
control, sustainable natural resource management and resilience-building among vulnerable 
groups. In Chad,, the Bank has developed and implemented a number of projects in the rural 
development sector, including the Surface Runoff Water Enhancement Project (PVERS), the 
Natural Resources Management Project in the Sudan Region (PGRN-ZS) and the Food Crops 
Cultivation Project in the Sudan Region (PCVZS). These have shown that technical support 
for production through the dissemination of appropriate soil fertility management techniques 
and access to water, accompanied by adequate medium- and long-term investments in a 
participatory approach are necessary to cope with shocks and reduce the adverse effects of 
climate change. Through this GEF financing, the Bank will draw on this wealth of experience  
to undertake more sustained investments in support of the organization of farmers, women and 
young people, focusing on the mainstreaming of environmental, climate issues and nutrition 
issues.   

1.6 Knowledge Building: The project will support environmental awareness and 
stakeholder capacity-building, focusing on improving integrated landscape management and 
agro-sylvo-pastoral planning. The project will also comprise sustainable land and forest 
management technologies as well as the dissemination of best practices in Sahelian agriculture 
and biodiversity conservation to stakeholders. The knowledge that will result from the 
implementation of these approaches and techniques, as well as the lessons learned therefrom, 
will be capitalized for dissemination and development  during the design and management of 
future projects.  

Lessons learned will be captured in quarterly and annual progress reports, technical reports 
and the mid-term review and completion reports.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION TO THE BOARD OF 
DIRECTORS CONCERNING A PROPOSAL TO  FINANCE  FROM GEF 

RESOURCES  THE PROJECT TO BUILD RESILIENCE FOR FOOD SECURITY 
AND NUTRITION IN CHAD’S RURAL COMMUNITIES 

 

Management hereby submits the following report and recommendation for a GEF grant 
of USD 5,329,452 (UA 3.518 million) as additional resources to finance the Project to 
Build Resilience for Food Security and Nutrition in Chad’s Rural Communities, as part 
of the P2RS Programme. 

1. STRATEGIC THRUSTS AND RATIONALE 

1.1 Project Linkages with Country Strategy and Objectives 

1.1.1 The Government's development programme is set out in the Vision 2030, the objective 
being for Chad to "become an emerging middle-income country by 2030, whose economy is 
driven by diverse sustainable sources of growth and value-added activities". The National 
Development Plan (NDP 2017-2018) is the first operational planning paper of the Vision 2030. 
It replaces the NDP 2013-2015 and the successive national poverty reduction strategies (2003-
2006; 2008-2011), which give priority and special attention to agriculture and rural sector 
development, with a view to increasing food production and improving the incomes of rural 
communities. The Programme to Build Resilience to Food and Nutrition Insecurity in the Sahel 
(P2RS) was designed to sustainably increase agro-sylvo-pastoral and fisheries productivity in 
the Sahel, thus facilitating the achievement of Vision 2030. The three main components of 
P2RS are (i) rural infrastructure development; (ii) value chains and regional markets 
development; and (iii) project management and coordination. The initial P2RS will serve as 
the basis for GEF co-financing. The project is  in line not only with Chad's Country Strategy 
Paper (CSP) 2015-2020,  focused on "the development of infrastructure to promote robust and 
more diversified economic growth", but also  with the objectives of the Bank's Ten-Year 
Strategy since it will help Chad to move along a growth path that protects livelihoods, promotes 
greener growth and stimulates economic development. The project is also consistent with two 
of the Bank's five priorities, namely: “Feed Africa” and “Improve the quality of life for the 
people of Africa”. 

1.1.2 The GEF Project Identification Form (PIF) was approved in April 2015 and validated 
on 13 September 2017 by the Facility’s Chief Executive Officer and Chairperson for an amount 
of USD 5,329,452. The project aims to build the resilience of communities and households 
regularly affected by extreme weather events, through sustained growth in natural resource 
productivity, which will help to improve food security and nutrition in Kanem and Bahr el 
Ghazal provinces. The project will thus enable stakeholders to contribute to the restoration of 
biodiversity in fragile ecosystems. The GEF project is fully aligned with national strategies and 
P2RS, in that it aims to reduce and reverse trends in desertification, land degradation and 
biodiversity loss, which will improve productivity and food security while preserving the 
natural resources that support agro-ecological production. 

1.2 Rationale for the Bank’s Involvement 

1.2.1 Chad is increasingly confronted with problems of environmental degradation and 
extreme weather events, which are much more pronounced in such sectors as agriculture, 
livestock, fisheries and health. All policy papers (Vision 2030, National Development Plan, 
poverty reduction strategies) highlight the importance of protecting natural resources in a 
context of worsening weather phenomena in Chad, and the need to implement actions that 



 

2 

promote food security and build the adaptive capacities of affected populations. However,  
capacity to sustainably managenatural resources in the face of climate change is limited due to 
the shortage of human and financial resources in existing administrative entities (ministries, 
government agencies and local governments). 

1.2.2 The project is in line with the Bank's Ten-Year Strategy (2013-2022), the ultimate 
goal of which is sustainable inclusive growth. The focus is on protecting livelihoods, enhancing 
water, electricity and food security, promoting the sustainable use of natural resources, creating 
jobs, stimulating innovation and developing the economy. It will help to achieve the objectives 
of the Ten-Year Strategy by strengthening agro-sylvo-pastoral productivity and promoting 
integrated ecosystem management and inclusive growth. Undertaken in the Sahel, a region that 
attracts particular attention because of the difficult living conditions and vulnerability of its 
rural populations, but also because of its agricultural potential, the project will have an impact 
on agriculture and food security, thus helping to achieve two of the Bank’s “High 5s”. Given 
that the project also aims to promote innovative production techniques such as agroforestry and 
sylvo-pastoralism, activities that are mainly carried out by women, it will also help in the 
implementation of the Bank's Gender Strategy. Through its adaptation actions, the project will 
also help in the implementation of the Bank's 2016-2020 Climate Change Action Plan (CCAP), 
contributingapproximately 80.21% of the budget of components (1) and (2). 

1.2.3 As on 1 October 2018, the African Development Bank has 15 operations in Chad, with 
a net commitment of UA 214.23 million. Under the CSP 2016-2020, the Bank's support is 
based on two pillars: (i) infrastructure development to promote inclusive green growth; and (ii) 
promotion of good governance to increase the effectiveness of public actions and make the 
economic framework more attractive.  The Bank's strategic approach is to help create 
conditions conducive to more inclusive economic growth and to improve the country's 
integration into a sub-regional economy. Since the project's interventions aim to reduce land 
degradation and promote sustainable natural resource management, this will improve socio-
economic resilience while strengthening agro-pastoral and transhumance resources, which 
should be developed to enhance sustainability and diversify growth in the country. 

1.3 Donor Coordination  

1.3.1 A Technical and Financial Partners Committee, established in April 2011, is 
responsible for harmonizing donor interventions in Chad. The committee is composed of nine 
thematic groups and is chaired by France. The committee acts as a platform for dialogue, 
consultation and collaboration on development issues and on bilateral and multinational 
cooperation between Chad and its partners. A State/partners committee has also been set up to 
encourage dialogue with national authorities and improve aid management. A matrix of 
interventions for 2018-2021, which presents all partners’ planned interventions, has helped to 
better assess their areas of intervention and improve the division and coordination of work. Aid 
coordination has facilitated co-financing with technical and financial partners such as BADEA, 
the OPEC Fund, BDEAC, UNDP, EU and IsDB. 

2. PROJECT DESCRIPTION 

2.1 Objectives of P2RS (Core Project) and GEF Project  

2.1.1 Objectives and Components of the Initial P2RS: The P2RS Chad project served as a 
basis for mobilizing co-financing for the GEF project. The P2RS programme aims to eliminate 
the structural causes of acute and chronic food and nutrition crises by helping vulnerable 
households to increase their production and income, secure access to basic social infrastructure 
and services, and increase their livelihood options. It was designed for a 20-year period in four 



 

3 

phases, the first of which (Project 1) will be implemented over a five-year period, from 2015 
to 2019. The overall cost of P2RS Project 1, which covers seven CILSS countries, amounts to 
USD 271.77 million funded by ADF-XIII in the form of grants and loans, representing 85% of 
the total cost of Project 1. The remaining 15% is funded by (i) the governments of the countries 
involved in this first phase (Burkina Faso, Chad, the Gambia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger and 
Senegal); (ii) the Permanent Interstate Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel (CILSS); 
and (iii) beneficiaries. 

2.1.2 In Chad, P2RS is under the technical supervision of the Ministry of Agriculture. The 
project strategy  is based on the development of agricultural and livestock farming products, 
the promotion of irrigation systems, accessibility to input markets and capacity-building for 
private and public institutions and communities in the agricultural sector. In that regard, the 
project is  constructing  pastoral and village water infrastructure in targeted rural districts and 
will help vulnerable households to not only improve their productivity through rational and 
sustainable management of natural resources but also to have better access to markets. A value 
chain approach based on growth sub-sectors is currently being used to ensure, maintain and 
increase access to and the marketing of agricultural products. The basic project will be 
implemented through three components, covering: 

(i)  Rural infrastructure development: This component aims to increase and improve 
agricultural production, processing and marketing infrastructure, which is 
indispensable for increasing the competitiveness of promising agricultural 
sectors and strengthening the resilience of agricultural operations in the Sahel. 
The main activities focus on the development of pastoral infrastructure and 
facilities, conservation, processing and marketing infrastructure, and basic 
social infrastructure. 

(ii)  Development of regional value chains and markets: This component aims to 
increase on a sustainable basis the production and productivity of the main agro-
sylvo-pastoral farming systems and to strengthen nutrition.  

(iii)  Programme management: The last component aims to define and deliver the 
institutional architecture for the management and coordination of all project-
related aspects, including procurement, monitoring and evaluation, and 
communication. 

2.1.3 A standing committee, composed of representatives of the central administration of 
the rural sector and all the actors involved in the development of the regions within the project 
area, is responsible for managing and making decisions concerning P2RS. 

2.1.4 Objectives and description of the GEF project: Entitled "Building Resilience for Food 
and Nutrition Security in Rural Communities in Chad", the GEF project will be based on the 
activities planned under the original project, to increase their impact on the environment and 
on the people. The activities are grouped into three components: (i) improvement of agro-
sylvo-pastoral productivity in drylands; (ii) promotion of integrated ecosystem management to 
enhance resilience and biodiversity; and (iii) knowledge management and monitoring and 
evaluation, in accordance with the GEF eligibility criteria for the areas of intervention under 
which this project is funded, namely land degradation, biodiversity and sustainable forest 
management. The components and activities are presented in Table 2.1 below. 

The GEF project’s main expected outcomes  are as follows: (i) improvement of rural 
communities’ agricultural production practices and the management of natural pasture to 
support food security and resilience; (ii) use by rural communities of improved agro-pastoral 



 

4 

technologies and their access to production assets for enhanced livelihoods and reduced 
vulnerability; (iii) improved  management of forests  and/or reforestation areas, to generate 
sustainable flows of ecosystem services; (iv) enhanced integrated landscape planning for 
habitat resilience and preservation; (v) enabling  natural environment is enhanced through 
mechanisms for the conservation of land, woody biomass and biodiversity, (vi) lessons learned 
are captured and knowledge is disseminated; and (vii) the project impact is monitored and 
evaluated. 

2.1.5. The first objective of the initial P2RS is to develop rural infrastructure, value chains 
and regional markets. The additional GEF project will build on the first objective (development 
of rural infrastructure) to undertake investments in irrigation schemes development,  establish 
cereal banks, agricultural input shops and livestock feed shops, and ensure sound land and soil 
management (soil conservation/regeneration techniques and sustainable forest management). 
The second objective of the initial P2RS (development of value chains and regional markets) 
will be strengthened in the additional GEF project through crop diversification, identification 
of resilient seed varieties and selection of other income-generating activities. The additional 
GEF project will therefore increase the attention given to sustainability and resilience in the 
initial P2RS. Its purpose is to enable stakeholders to restore and maintain the productivity of 
natural resources and biodiversity in fragile ecosystems, in order to ultimately improve their 
livelihoods and the natural resources on which they depend. This approach is based on the 
premise that agro-sylvo-pastoral systems are essential for improving food and nutrition 
security.

2.4.2 Experiences and lessons learned by the Bank: The AfDB has been active in the Sahel 
for many years, mainly in the following areas: water management and control, development of 
agriculture, livestock farming, fisheries, and natural resource management. Its experience 
shows that investing in the medium and long terms in the resilience of rural households is 
essential for helping them to cope with shocks (famine, drought, conflict, etc.) and for reducing 
their vulnerability. As at 1 October 2018, the Bank's net commitments in Chad for active 
operations amounted to UA 214.23 million. After a portfolio review conducted in 2013, key 
lessons were learned from previous CSPs and ongoing rural development initiatives. These 
include: the need for greater selectivity in terms of country allocation, division of labour and 
implementation capacity; the need for greater economic integration, stronger partnerships and 
co-financing (to increase the economic and social impact of interventions); the need to 
consolidate governance gains and build Chad's institutional capacities; and the need to promote 
the role of the private sector, particularly in the agricultural sector. 

2.5 Project Impact Area  

2.5.1 The proposed project will be implemented in the Sahel regions of Kanem and Bahr el 
Ghazal, where food insecurity is most acute in Chad, mainly due to difficult agro-ecological 
conditions and high malnutrition rates. The project beneficiaries will be smallholder farmers 
engaged in subsistence agriculture and livestock farming on marginal land, and who derive 
their income from agriculture, stock-breeding or the gathering of wood products. The project 
will specifically target 11,000 land operators who will receive training in integrated natural 
resource management (INRM) and sustainable land and water management (SLWM) with 
demonstrations. It will also train 150 local employees in sustainable INRM policies and 
practices, distribute resilient seed varieties to 100 households, and assist 10 local producer 
groups (including at least five women's groups) to diversify their incomes through agroforestry 
and sylvo-pastoral activities. As the land on which they depend is characterized by sand dunes 
and low-productivity wadis, the beneficiaries live on non-irrigated agriculture. The project will 



 

8 

address this issue by promoting sustainable land management, site-specific soil conservation 
systems and mixed cropping systems, the construction of rural hydro-agricultural 
infrastructure, and crop diversification with the cultivation of appropriate species. Low 
agricultural productivity, lack of income opportunities and lack of rural socio-economic 
infrastructure are the main causes of poverty in these areas. Poverty and insecurity are further 
exacerbated by the weakness of community-based organizations, coupled with inefficient 
service delivery, lack of resources (especially land in the wadis) and weak decision-making 
power and scarcity of information. 
 
2.6. Participatory Approach for Project Identification, Design and Implementation 
 
2.6.1 During the identification of the core programme, extensive consultations were held, 
and a participatory approach was adopted for the development of the programme. During the 
preparation and appraisal phases, discussions and a workshop were held with key institutions 
and stakeholders, including national institutions responsible for agriculture, fisheries, 
livestock, environment, health and water (20 September 2016 to 5 October 2016). The 
consultative process was extended to civil society (NGOs, including women's organizations, 
farmers' organizations, etc.). Meetings were held with communities, key actors in production 
systems, and administrative and local authorities, which provided an opportunity not only to 
share information on the project and collect data on impact areas, but also to discuss planned 
activities. Women's organizations were involved in these meetings to better understand the 
difficulties they face and better capture their challenges and needs. These elements were fully 
reflected in the design of the intervention and this participatory approach will be maintained 
during the project implementation. Various stakeholders will also be involved in the 
development of the envisaged monitoring and evaluation system to ensure smooth 
implementation and achievement of goals. 

2.7 Consideration of Bank Group’s Experience and Lessons Learned in Project 
 Design 

2.7.1 The Bank has extensive experience in resilience-building programmes in the Sahel 
region. For instance, it implemented a USD 4 billion (2014) grant operation aimed at promoting 
stability and economic growth in the region. In addition, the Bank, through the African Water 
Facility (AWF) established in 2006, has funded 9 national and 11 multinational projects 
focusing on capacity-building for integrated water resources management, and established 
appropriate frameworks for collaborative water management, for example for Lake Chad, 
among other interventions. Several statements have been made on the issue of water security 
in the Sahel, reiterated as a priority for the Bank. The lessons learned from these previous Bank 
interventions, as well as the P2RS design, and the actions implemented during the design of 
the proposed project, are presented below in table form:

1. Institutional and organizational 

weaknesses 
The project is based on existing structures, including 
P2RS, and on national project implementation bodies, 
which allows for smooth implementation.

implementation  

Inclusion in the project design of participatory and 
regular monitoring and evaluation activities with 
sufficient financial allocation 

 
2.8 Key Performance Indicators  
 
2.8.1. The impact, outcome and output indicators are those mentioned in the logical 
framework, which will be measured using the existing monitoring and evaluation (M&E) 
system developed under P2RS. The impact indicator, which will serve as a gauge for the 
development objective, is the improvement of food security and nutrition following the 
adoption of sustainable and resilient agro-sylvo-pastoral systems in the Sahelian regions of 
Chad. Monitoring tools reflecting the multifocal nature of the project will also be developed 
for the GEF project activities, in accordance with the requirements of this institution. 

3. PROJECT FEASIBILITY  

3.1 Economic and Financial Performance  

3.1.1 Economic and financial analyses carried out were based on the premise that incentive 
measures, sustainability considerations and an enabling environment are essential for the 
success of any intervention, all of which conditions the P2RS and the proposed project plan to 
fulfil. The measures envisaged in this regard are: (i) a multi-stakeholder participatory process, 
the creation of three nurseries, the construction of hydro-agricultural infrastructure, the 
establishment of land-use plans and the provision of training in sustainable land and water 
management; (ii) the establishment of pilot areas, training of beneficiaries, promotion and use 
of improved stoves, and the adoption of a forest certification system to encourage the 
sustainable use of land and forests; (iii) the development of grazing plans, the reseeding of 
grazing land, the adoption of species testing based on extension services to ensure the 
availability of healthy animals; (iv) fencing to prevent crop destruction, seed trials, extension 
services and cereal banks to improve crop productivity; (v) pilot/learning sites for training 
activities to encourage soil conservation; and (vi) identification, training and prioritization of 
IGAs to improve livelihoods, mainly for women and young people. 

3.1.2 The implementation of the GEF Project in parallel with the core project (P2RS) is 
expected to build food security and improve nutrition in the project areas. The adoption of 
sustainable and resilient agro-sylvo-pastoral systems will improve agricultural production and 
enhance the availability of fodder resources for livestock. Similarly, integrated space 
management will increase land availability for crops and restore soil condition. The 
dissemination and use of improved stoves, the promotion of related IGAs will reduce the 
pressure on wooded areas and curb deforestation and land degradation. The implementation of 
project activities focused on building resilience and food security will amplify the economic 
benefits of the project, as well as the positive impacts on living conditions and the quality of 
life.  



 

10 

3.1.3 A number of socio-economic benefits should stem from the project, including: (i) 
greater food and nutrition security resulting from the overall increase in agricultural and 
livestock products; (ii) reduced vulnerability due to crop diversification and the cultivat ion of 
resistant seed varieties; (iii) constant flows of agricultural and forest ecosystem services with 
improved habitat resilience and preservation; (iv) the introduction of a sustainable forest and 
IGA management certification system, which will further stabilize incomes; and (v) increased 
awareness and a more favourable environment for managing the ecosystem and combating 
climate change. 

3.2 Environmental and Social Impacts  

3.2.1 Environment: P2RS, the core project, is classified in Environmental Category 2 and 
has undergone Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA), in accordance with the relevant 
procedures of the Bank, as well as its policy and regulatory framework. The purpose of the 
SEA is to integrate environmental, socio-economic and institutional concerns into the design 
and implementation of P2RS. For instance, P2RS-funded infrastructure investments will have 
short-term negative environmental impacts specific to the area. The assessment led to the 
development of an Environmental and Social Management Framework Plan (ESMFP) 
outlining the various mitigation and enhancement measures. The GEF Project specifically aims 
to increase the attention devoted to environmental protection in the core project, which should 
produce a generally positive environmental impact. 

Assessment of environmental conditions during the field visits confirmed that the proposed 
project will have positive impacts. A number of negative environmental impacts are 
foreseeable in the construction and works implementation phases, but they will be limited, 
reversible and controllable, subject to monitoring and the implementation of appropriate 
mitigation measures. These measures will comprise the preparation and validation of a sub-
project selection procedure that is consistent with Chad's regulations, the establishment and 
monitoring of land-use plans in each council or municipality within the project impact area, 
the development of environmental and social project management guides, and the promotion 
of best practices in agriculture and natural resource management. 

3.2.2 Climate Change 

To combat climate change, Chad is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions 
unconditionally by18.2% and conditionally by 71% by 2030, through adaptation and mitigation 
measures. Climate change adaptation is a major concern for the country, which has developed 
its National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA), among other documents, in an effort 
to reduce its climate vulnerability. 

The GEF Project is committed to promoting climate resilience by improving food and nutrition 
security. Livelihoods will be diversified through the introduction of mixed cropping systems, 
crop diversification, agroforestry and the identification of alternative activities that would 
generate incomes while at the same time contributing to climate change adaptation. The project 
will support resilience by promoting (i) sustainable agriculture and livestock production, 
including sustainable management of grazing areas; and (ii) better planning of landscape 
development to ensure the resilience of communities and ecosystems. To build the capacity of 
beneficiaries, the project will support the setting up of micro-projects to demonstrate 
appropriate soil conservation techniques, train local staff in sustainable integrated natural 
resource management (INRM), provide training in sustainable forest management and arable 
land management, and a demonstration of participatory land-use planning to better adapt to 
climate change and reduce climate vulnerability. The project will also contribute to mitigation 
actions through reforestation and the establishment of agro-forestry plantations. It will also 



 

11 

foster the implementation of the Bank's 2016-2020 Climate Change Action Plan (PACC2) by 
mobilizing external climate financing. 

3.2.3 Gender: Chad is ranked 150th out of 187 countries on the Gender Parity Index. While 
discrimination against women is clearly prohibited, the principle of equality is undermined by 
resistance and the existence of de facto inequalities between men and women. Barriers rooted 
in traditional practices favour men, thereby hindering the internalization and appropriation of 
laws. The proposed project will mainstream gender-related issues by specifically targeting the 
implementation of activities usually dominated by women, and for which they have recognized 
know-how (trade, market gardening, rice cultivation, small livestock breeding, traditional 
poultry farming, processing, marketing, etc.) and from which they can derive an income. At 
least five women's organizations will benefit from income diversification assistance through 
agroforestry and sylvo-pastoral activities. The project will also have to ensure that women have 
access to project resources by identifying other income-generating activities to be implemented 
in association with households, and that they are fairly represented in project management and 
executing bodies. 
 
3.2.4 Social: A number of socio-economic impacts are envisaged, including: (i) reduced 
vulnerability to climate and other shocks; (ii) diversification of activities, income generation 
and job creation; (iii) better access to socio-economic services; and (iv) food production 
security. The increased resilience of the population brought about by the new infrastructure 
and techniques will improve the socio-economic situation of the beneficiaries, mainly women. 
Improving the delivery of ecosystem goods and services and building resilience will help 
ensure overall food and nutrition security. 

3.2.5 Inclusive green growth: Within a context of diversified, pro-poor growth in a healthy 
environment that preserves natural resources, the project will promote inclusive growth by 
equitably allocating resources to activities, which will benefit all participating communities at 
all levels. The project will help men, women and young people in rural areas to improve dryland 
productivity on the basis of a sustainable and environmentally-friendly agro-ecological model. 
Improved agro-pastoral techniques, such as rural hydro-agricultural infrastructure and grain 
banks, will also provide opportunities for rural men, women and youth to participate in non-
agricultural activities, thereby improving their livelihoods and reducing vulnerability. 

3.2.6 Involuntary Resettlement: The project activities will not entail any involuntary 
resettlement and land acquisition since they will be implemented within the existing P2RS 
areas in the Kanem and Bahr el Ghazal regions. 

3.3 Project Rationale 

3.3.1 Given the extent of poverty in Chad, there is a tendency to forget that improving the 
exploitation of natural resources can enable the country to use the huge assets at its disposal to 
bring sustainable solutions to the recurrent food and nutrition insecurity that prevails in its 
territory and to the problem of environmental degradation. While the unavailability of arable 
land is an obstacle, it may be resolved by investing in integrated natural resource management 
and strategic actions for resilience. 

3.3.2 The funding being sought is supposed to benefit the inhabitants of the Kanem and 
Bahr el Ghazal regions. The project will have positive socio-economic impacts as well as 
generate many benefits for the biophysical and human environment. The GEF funding will 
contribute to rebuilding Chad's fragile ecosystems by enabling local communities and 
institutions to rehabilitate degraded lands and forests and preserve biodiversity, while building 
resilience and ensuring food and nutrition security.

3.4 Project Objectives and Description 

3.4.1 P2RS, the core project, aims to increase on a sustainable basis agro-sylvo-pastoral and 
fisheries productivity in the Sahel. The GEF project strengthens this core component by adding 
to it substantial environmental benefits and a sustainability dimension. 

The expected outcomes of the financing may be outlined as follows:  

x Improved agricultural, rangeland and pasture production in support of security 
and resilience; 

x Improved agro-pastoral technologies and access to production assets for 
enhanced livelihoods and reduced vulnerability; 

x Improved forest management and/or reforestation to generate sustainable flows 
of agro – and forest ecosystem services; 

x Enhanced integrated landscape planning for habitat resilience and preservation; 

x Enhanced enabling environment through mechanisms for the conservation of 
woody biomass and biodiversity; 

x Lesson learned captured and knowledge disseminated; and 

x  Project impact monitoring and evaluated.    

3.4.2 This multi-focal project contributes directly to GEF Objective LD-1: Maintain or 
improve flow of agroecosystem services to sustain food production and livelihoods. As part of 
this objective, the project contributes to GEF Outcome 1.1 (Improved agricultural, rangeland 
and pasture production in support of security and resilience), Output 1.2 (Improved agro-
pastoral technologies and access to production assets for enhanced livelihoods and reduced 
vulnerability) and Output 1.3 (Improved forest management and/or reforestation generate 
sustainable flows of agro – and forest ecosystem services).   

3.4.3 It also contributes to GEF Objective LD-3 which seeks to: reduce pressures on natural 
resources from competing land uses in the wider landscape, through Outcome 2.1 (Enhanced 
integrated landscape planning for habitat resilience and preservation). 

3.4.4 Under GEF Objective LD-4 (“biodiversity” focal area), which deals with the 
conservation of biodiversity and its sustainable use in marine and terrestrial areas and in sectors 
of economic activity, the project will manage the human-biodiversity interface through 
Outcome 2.2 (Enhanced enabling environment through mechanisms for the conservation of 
land, woody biomass and biodiversity).   

3.4.5 The fourth GEF objective is SFM-2: Enhance forest management: Maintain flows of 
forest ecosystem services and improve resilience to climate change through sustainable forest 
management by means of Outcome 1.3 (Improved forest management and/or reforestation to 
generate sustainable flows of agro – and forest ecosystem services).

4.  IMPLEMENTATION 

4.1 Implementation Arrangements  

4.1.1 The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) that is currently executing the P2RS Project 
will be the same for the proposed project, and no other one will be set up. The PIU will also be 
responsible for implementing the three components of the GEF additional project.  

Due to the interdisciplinary and inter-institutional nature of the project, its Implementation Unit 
will comprise representatives of institutions implementing related agreements, such as those 
involved in rural development support, agricultural production, pastoral systems, food and 
nutrition techniques, and forestry and agricultural research. Representatives of leading 
government institutions in the sectors of agriculture, food security, water, livestock, 
infrastructure, etc., will also be involved.   

4.2 Procurement Procedure 

4.2.1 All procurements of goods, works and consultancy services financed by the Bank's 
resources shall be made in accordance with the Procurement Policy for Operations financed by 
the Bank Group ("Procurement Policy" of AfDB "), October 2015 edition and in accordance 
with the provisions mentioned in the Financing Agreement. In accordance with this policy and 
following the various evaluations conducted, it was agreed that: (a) all the following Goods 
and Works acquisitions: (i) cooking stoves, (ii) goods for micro-projects, (iii) mobiles materials 
and, work on (i) the development of small irrigated areas and ponds, (ii) the construction of 
water points, (ii) the construction of cereal banks, input shops, shops for animal feeding;(ii) the 
rehabilitation of the program’s headquarters will be in accordance with the country's 
procurement system ("National System") embodied by Decree No. 2417 / PR / PM / 2015 of 
December 17th, 2015 on the Public Procurement Code (PPC); (b) the following acquisitions 
(i) all selections of consultants; (ii) community-based contracts; and (iii) the acquisition of the 
Plan Vivo system and standard used for certification of forest products and agroforestry will 
be in accordance with the Bank's procurement system ("System of Procurement" of AfDB ").  

4.2.2 The use of the National System improves efficiency through, inter alia, the following 
actions: (i) better ownership of the procurement system to be used by the executing agency; 
(ii) a saving of time with the absence of a second control (after that of the national entities) that 
represents, the a priori review of the Bank. However, the Bank reserves the right to ask the 
borrower to return to the use of the Bank System if: (a) the legal framework for Chadian public 
procurement changes to evolve into a system unsatisfactory for the Bank; (b) the provisions in 
force were not complied with by the executing agency or (c) the appropriate risk mitigation 
measures included in the Risk Assessment Action Plan were not complied with. . It is indicated 
that the procurements funded by the GEF are subject to respect for the rule of origin. A waiver 
will be asked to have the same rules for the procurements funded by the GEF and the 
procurements funded by the ADF grant already approved. 

4.2.3 Procurement Risk and Capacity Assessment (PRCA): In order to take into account the 
specificities of the project, the Bank assessed: (i) risks at the national, sectoral and project 
levels; and (ii) the capacities of the implementing agencies. The results of these evaluations 
concluded at a Moderate risk level for contracting and determined, subject to the application 
of proposed mitigation measures, the group of acquisitions to be concluded under the Bank's 
system and those acquisitions likely to be implemented, without major risk, according to the 
National System.

4.3 Financial Management and Disbursement Procedures  

4.3.1 Financial Management: This GEF funding integrates the P2RS objectives with more 
substantial environmental benefits and a sustainability dimension. The P2RS Management Unit 
(PMU), set up within the Ministry of Agriculture, will therefore be responsible for 
implementing these activities as well as financial management. It has its own accounting and 
financial administrative procedures manual (it will be updated accordingly). The financial 
management system is composed of an Administrative and Financial Manager (AFM) and an 
Accountant. TOMPRO multi-project accounting software is operational and in use. This 
software allows i) to keep the accounts of several projects at once, ii) to generate the main 
accounting sheets and journal, general ledger and account balance and iii) to prepare the 
consolidated and specific financial statements. The RAF and the Accountant are trained on its 
use. The interim and annual reports produced for the P2RS are satisfactory and show that they 
effectively control the use of the software. The accounting system in place is therefore adequate 
and can produce accurate and reliable information. The GEF complementary financing accounts 
will be integrated into the P2RS accounts with the possibility of disaggregation of expenditures 
by source of financing. This allows for accurate and specific financial information on GEF 
funding. 
 
4.3.2 Audit: The Audit of Accounts, relating to activities financed from GEF resources, will 
be carried out as part of the audit of the P2RS annual accounts. Thus, the consolidated and 
specific accounts for all financings will be audited each year by the same independent external 
audit firm, meeting the required criteria and in accordance with the terms of reference (TOR) 
acceptable to the Bank. The audit report must reach the Bank no later than six months after the 
close of the financial year concerned.  

4.3.3 Disbursement procedure: The project will use the Bank's disbursement methods, 
namely: (i) direct payment, (ii) special account (SA), and (iii) reimbursement methods, in 
accordance with the rules and procedures set out in the Disbursement Handbook. A separate 
foreign exchange special account will be opened for the project with the Central Bank of Chad 
and a local currency account with the same bank, which will be used by the Project 
Implementation Unit to finance operating and other recurrent costs, eligible under the project. 
To facilitate the payment of eligible operating costs, a separate local project sub-account, to be 
managed by the Ministry of Agriculture through the Project Implementation Unit, will be 
opened at a commercial bank acceptable to the Bank, in accordance with existing rules and 
regulations. The management of bank accounts, including the payment of eligible expenses, the 
preparation of requests for the withdrawal of funds from the special account (SA) and the 
documentation of all direct payments, will be subject to the existing procedures within the 
executing body (EB), and placed under the general responsibility of the Director-General of the 
Ministry in charge of Agriculture. The Bank will issue a Disbursement Letter, the content of 
which will be reviewed and agreed upon during the negotiations. 

4.4 Monitoring 

4.4.1 The monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of progress towards achieving project 
outcomes and objectives will be conducted on the basis of the goal and outcome indicators 
identified in the results framework and annual work and budget plans of the project. M&E 
activities will be performed in line with M&E policies and guidelines of the Bank and GEF. 
The day-to-day monitoring of project implementation will be the responsibility of the Project 
Implementation Unit (PIU) and will include the preparation and implementation of annual 
work plans and budgets, and the drafting semi-annual progress reports (SAPRs) of the project.  



 

15 

4.4.2 Specific reports that should be prepared as part of the monitoring and evaluation 
programme are: the project launch report, the annual work plan and budget, project progress 
reports; the annual project implementation review, technical reports, co-financing reports, and 
a completion report. In addition, GEF monitoring tools for the land degradation (LD), 
biodiversity (BD) and sustainable forest management (SFM) focus areas will be updated and 
supplemented by the project team at the mid-term and the final evaluations. 

It is extremely important for the project to use internationally recognized results-based 
monitoring and evaluation frameworks throughout the project implementation process. 
Responsibility for monitoring will rest with the Ministry of Agriculture, which will be 
supported by the Ministry of the Environment. This work will be done in collaboration with 
the Bank and the project team. The information collected through M&E will be taken into 
account in the activities to help to ensure knowledge management, identify and share best 
practices, identify problems and constraints, and promote sustained improvement of the project 
and its contribution to the implementation of national and regional strategies on food security 
and rural development.   

4.4.3 The M&E mechanism will be fine-tuned to ensure that it mainstreams gender issues, 
with special emphasis on the definition of specific parameters for women and young people. 
The parameters to be monitored and evaluated will include, for example, the level of women's 
involvement in decision-making bodies, and the number of young people trained.

4.5 Governance 

4.5.1 In Chad, governance is still a cause for concern in the area of public finance 
management, including public procurement. In addition to using the direct agreement method, 
the procurement process is extremely slow. The existing institutional and organizational 
framework does not function properly due partly to non-compliance with applicable rules and 
procedures and partly to the weak human resource capacity of the entities in charge of this 
process.  

To address these issues, supervision missions, financial and procurement audits will be 
conducted to ensure that the services provided and the works performed are consistent with the 
disbursements made. 



 

16 

4.5.2 Mitigation measures provided to address these issues include: (i) the development of 
a tailored-made financial management procedures manual that will provided the  staff of the 
Project Implementation Unit with programme implementation guidelines; (ii) the use of 
MoFL's internal audit services to conduct project pre-audits; and (iii) the acquisition of serial 
accounting software to capture and process transactions and to interface with IFMIS so as to 
facilitate timely financial reporting, considering the IFMIS-related operational problems; and 
(iv) the implementation of a system of timely submission of the interim quarterly progress 
report (IQPR). 

4.6 Sustainability 

4.6.1 Carrying out activities and building infrastructure that are economically, financially 
and technically viable will enhance the sustainability of project interventions. Sustainability 
factors include: proper sizing and targeting of infrastructure, stakeholder participation and 
ownership (men and women), and beneficiary involvement at all stages of planning and 
implementation, the quality of facilities and equipment, and viable production activities adapted 
to the agro-ecological zone. To ensure post-project sustainability, preference will be given, in 
the conduct of each operation, to reliable and simple but resilient mechanisms, which will 
enhance the scope and coherence of the actions implemented.  

4.6.2 The project aims to build resilience by improving food security and nutrition through 
the enhancement of agro-sylvo-pastoral productivity in drylands. Training in integrated natural 
resource management (INRM), sustainable land and water management (SLWM) and the 
proposed awareness campaigns will provide tools and approaches for maintaining commitment 
and sustainability after the project completion. All stakeholders will be involved in the 
implementation of project activities, including beneficiary communities, to ensure ownership 
and commitment, as well as the viability of improved agro-sylvo-pastoral production 
infrastructure. The project will strengthen the principles of sustainability which lay emphasis 
on the use of a participatory approach during project preparation. This is important as it helps 
to ensure the relevance of the investments and to build institutional capacity at the community 
level in order to guarantee the sustainability of planned activities. The sustainability will be 
achieved by strengthening and consolidating the institutional framework using existing national 
systems. 

4.6.3 The project will lay a great emphasis on building the capacity of beneficiaries and 
strengthening their institutions, such as interest groups, associations or cooperatives. 
Beneficiaries will be mobilized, organized into viable autonomous entities, trained and 
empowered, so they may view their activities as a business rather than a means of survival. 
Awareness and training on gender mainstreaming at the community and local government 
levels will ensure that women and young people continue to participate in and benefit equitably 
from all project activities.    

4.7 Risk Management 

Description Classification Mitigation Measures  

Climate risks, exemplified by the 
recurrent droughts and floods, rainfall 
deficits, extreme heat, which expose the  
country’s natural resources to severe 
degradation. Indicators of this situation 
include land degradation, desertification, 
deterioration of vegetation cover, 
increasingly frequent conflicts between 
farmers and herders, the decimation of 
wildlife, the drying up of Lake Chad and 

2 (moderate) The project’s special emphasis on resilience, for 
example, agricultural practices, crop diversification, 
heat-resistant species, and water management. This will 
gradually reduce the impacts of climate variability. The 
planned project activities will help rural communities to 
better adapt to shocks and improve resilience.

Description Classification Mitigation Measures  

food insecurity. The sectors most 
severely affected by climate risks are 
agriculture, livestock, fisheries, health 
and housing.  
Institutional and organizational 
weaknesses: Exemplified  by 
insufficient coordination between 
governance structures at national, local 
and community levels   

2 (moderate) Strengthen existing structures, particularly those of 
CILSS and national project executing bodies, encourage 
cooperation and communication between the structures 
to allow smooth implementation of the project. 

Agriculture, livestock and fisheries - 
Declining productivity in these sectors 
may impoverish the people and expose 
them to food insecurity. In the 
agricultural sector, for example, fallow-
free cultivation, poor agricultural and 
land-use practices have reduced soil 
fertility, decreased crop yields and led to 
wind/soil erosion. Fishing, on the other 
hand, is threatened by substantial 
desiccation of important water resources, 
attributed to frequent recurring droughts, 
reduced vegetation around watercourses, 
deforestation and overgrazing.  

2 (moderate) Improved crop varieties and hardy livestock, control of 
livestock population levels to ensure that they match the 
carrying capacity; training in improved land-use 
practices; diversification of livelihoods and construction 
of transport infrastructure. 

Conflicts between farmers and 
herders: The project area has been 
identified as a transhumance area, 
although agriculture continues to be 
practised in the wadis. The source of the 
conflict lies mainly in the increasingly 
fierce competition for land and natural 
resources (pasture and water), due to the 
increased frequency of droughts and 
rainfall deficits.  

2 (moderate) Mediation efforts, activities that are tailored to the 
requirements of each group, bearing in mind their 
distinct but closely related realities and needs 
 
 

Conflicts between the project and the 
communities: Poverty and insecurity are 
exacerbated by weak community 
organization, coupled with inefficient 
service delivery, lack of resources and 
weak decision-making powers and 
information facilities. 
 

2 (moderate) Establishment of broad-based consultation mechanisms 
and awareness programmes, including a communication 
plan, development of capacity building/training 
programmes and organization of workshops. 

Environmental impacts - natural 
resources and biodiversity. The P2RS 1 
core project is classified in 
Environmental Category 2 (AfDB 
Environmental and Social Safeguards). 
 

1 (low) Project activities may have negative impacts ranging 
from low to moderate, which should be outweighed by 
the overall environmental benefits  
 
Compliance with Chadian regulations, preparation and 
monitoring of land-use plans, preparation of sub-project 
ESMPs, promotion of agricultural and natural resource 
management best practices 

Health, Nutrition and Hygiene - Risk of 
epidemics, malnutrition and poor hygiene 

2 (moderate) Early warning mechanisms, hygiene programmes, 
improved nutrition programmes, improved and 
increased livelihoods and rural communities assets 

Energy and transportation 
infrastructure facilities - These will 
include irrigation infrastructure, 
boreholes and socio-economic 
infrastructure. These infrastructure 
facilities should minimize the effects of 
extreme droughts and floods  

2 (moderate) Development of climate-resilient energy sources, 
diversification of energy sources, construction of 
climate-resilient infrastructure  

4.8 Knowledge Building  

4.8.1 The project should generate substantial knowledge that will add value to the overall 
design and management of future similar interventions. The lessons and experiences will be 
shared within the Bank and other institutions interested in implementing similar projects, 



 

18 

through project progress reports, audit reports, the mid-term review report and the completion 
report, especially as they will be part of the knowledge transfer and dissemination tools. The 
project will promote community participation and management of agro-sylvo-pastoral 
infrastructure. It will work closely with women's organizations and key stakeholders to ensure 
the sharing of information and learning materials dealing with empowering women and young 
people to build resilience for food and nutrition security. The project will also focus on building 
the capacity of key staff, and the beneficiaries will be fully involved in the implementation of 
planned activities. Exchanges with project beneficiaries will also be an opportunity to acquire 
the valuable knowledge that will be shared. The project will also collaborate with local NGOs 
and community-based organisations (CBOs) to increase their capacity and knowledge so that 
they may be able to continue to carry out sustainable activities for the promotion of food and 
nutrition security. Knowledge-building information will be systematically collected and 
documented in monitoring/evaluation and supervision reports, as well as in the periodic reports 
that will be shared at the Bank.
