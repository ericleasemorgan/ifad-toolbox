I. Introduction and Context
Country Context
Since 2003, Nigeria has continued to record high, sustained economic growth driven by non-oil 
sector, whereas the performance of the oil sector has slowed down.  Over the last decade, reported 
GDP growth rate has consistently remained between 6 to 8 percent. Key drivers of this strong 
growth are trade (retail and wholesale), agriculture, and telecommunications sectors.  These three 
sectors alone accounted for about 80 percent of GDP growth during 2009-2012. However, annual 
GDP growth rate declined from 7 percent in 2011 to 6.6 and 6.4 percent in 2012 and in the first half 
of 2013 respectively.  Growth has slowed in oil and gas, agriculture and trade but growth in the oil 
sector is slower than in agriculture.  The slowdown in agriculture and trade is related to the impact 
of 2012 flooding which disrupted crop production calendar and growing security problems in some

parts of the country that continues to restrict flows of trade. Oil production has stagnated or declined 
since 2010 due to increasing oil theft in the Niger Delta, and destruction of pipeline infrastructure. 
As a result, oil output in the first half of 2013 was about 10% lower than during the same period of 
2012.   
Rising oil prices ushered in surplus Balance of Payments (BoP) since 2011.  Reserves declined 
however to US$45 billion between April and early October, 2013, reflecting lower oil output,  
weaker oil prices, and more cautious attitudes of investors. While these inflows have strengthened 
Nigeria’s balance of payment and reserve position, they also pose major risk because of its 
vulnerability to shocks or swings in oil prices. Therefore, diversification of the economy is critical if 
Nigeria is to sustain a strong balance of payment position. The Nigerian Government has achieved 
significant budget consolidation since 2011, but dwindling oil production outlook presents fiscal 
uncertainties.   Government fiscal consolidation program is yielding results. Government  deficit 
reduced from an estimated 5.7 percent of GDP in 2010 to 1.9 percent in 2012.  While oil output 
appears poised to recover somewhat in the second half of 2013, Nigeria faces an important 
challenge in that oil revenues are not expected to increase in the medium term at the nearly the pace 
of GDP or the population of the country, reinforcing the need to deepen  significantly other sources 
of Government revenues. 
Nigeria needs effective institutions and good governance to achieve sustainable and inclusive 
growth.  Good governance is critical for improving the effectiveness and efficiency of public 
expenditures and services. Although, some pockets of effectiveness and capability in actually 
implementing reform have emerged, as reflected, for example, in the macroeconomic consolidation, 
consolidation of the banking sector after 2009 crisis, progress in implementing the power sector and 
the agricultural reforms. Important weaknesses and risks that still need to be addressed include the 
enforcement of regulations, inter-agency coordination and supervisory capacity.

Sectoral and Institutional Context
The competitiveness of the agriculture value chains and diversification of the productive base of the 
economy away from oil is a key pillar of the Federal Government’s Agricultural Transformation 
Agenda (ATA). The ATA represents the Government’s renewed focus on value addition to targeted 
commodities for enhanced food security, employment creation and sourcing of raw materials for 
industries and generally for agriculture to serve as engine for a broad-based economic development 
in Nigeria. The ATA is designed to focus on self-sufficiency via import substitution, lowering of 
food costs, increasing real wages and driving down inflation, engendering a rapid transition to an 
export-oriented agricultural economy. It is also to diversify the economy thereby increasing foreign 
exchange reserves, stabilizing the exchange rate and significantly increase the level of foreign direct 
investment (FDI). Key policies and institutional reforms are aimed at: (a) broadening the reach of 
the fertilizer subsidy program and making it more efficient and business oriented; (b) improving the 
investment framework through the development of Staple Crop Processing Zones (SCPZs); (c) 
improving the marketing of agricultural products; (d) promoting investment in productivity-
enhancing technologies. In parallel, the Government seeks to expand and improve large-scale dam 
and irrigation infrastructure which has significant deficiencies that negatively impact agricultural 
productivity, notably in the North where the bulk of Nigeria’s dam and irrigation infrastructure is 
located. 
The agricultural sector is considered an engine of growth capable of generating broad-based 
development outcomes needed for rapid economic transformation. The sector has been central to 
Nigeria’s poverty reduction and employment generation efforts, and retained this importance in 
recent times as the largest contributor to  non-oil growth (40.2% and 34.5%  of GDP in 2011 and in 
the first quarter of 2012 respectively) and important in overall economic growth as well. Self-

sufficiency and import substitution are explicit policy goals of agricultural development strategies in 
Nigeria, resulting from the growing and substantial food import bills  (US$ 2 billion) and policy 
responses (export bans) from a number of exporting countries witnessed during the recent global 
financial and food price crisis.    
The agriculture sector has been growing over the last decade, but not fast enough to meet the food 
security, employment and poverty challenges. Indeed, in recent years, food imports have been 
growing at a faster pace than the population growth (about 11% against,  2.8%) , and though the 
country has met the MDG1 on hunger, still 8.5% of total population were leaving below the  
minimum level of dietary energy consumption in 2011. Low productivity of major staple crops  – 
measured as average yield per hectare - as a result of  very low use of improved inputs , limited 
access to extension services by farmers) and limited investment by the private sector confine the 
sector well below its potential for growth. Power and road infrastructure, low-cost and long term 
financing, access to competitive inputs and supplies, as well as inconsistent policy environment are 
consistently identified by the private sector  as major challenges to their engagement in the sector. 
Rather than trying to drive the entire agricultural sector forward at the same time as in many past 
strategy documents, the ATA focuses on a few key first moves - priority food staples and traditional 
export crops, and intends to develop these for growth and employment creation, with the 
expectation that the rest of the sector will subsequently follow. Within agriculture, a major driver of 
growth is staple food crops, which contributed 35.8 percent to the agricultural GDP in 2011. 
Although in Asia irrigated agriculture was more prominent than in Nigeria, the ATA approach is 
similar to the Asian Green Revolution (GR) strategy, where an initial focus on import substitution 
for wheat and rice in high potential irrigated areas led the successful rural transformation that 
followed. Like the Asian model, the ATA assigns a lead role to the state in driving and orchestrating 
the strategy within each of the selected value chains, and in using financial incentives and import 
charges to encourage this growth. Unlike Asia, however, the ATA aggressively promotes private 
sector-led growth and is relying on public-priva te partnerships rather than state run marketing and 
financial institutions.

Relationship to CAS
The proposed SCPZ Support Project is fully aligned with the World Bank group Agricultural Action 
Plan 2013-2014, and features in the mix of instruments proposed under the New CPS (2014-
FY2017). Indeed the WBG new Agricultural Action identifies agricultural productivity, linking 
farmers to markets, and increasing non-farm income as key areas to put emphasis in order to help 
countries meet the MDG1, in one hand. in the other hand, the overarching objective of the Bank 
new CPS is to support the Government's Visions 20:2020 and Transformation Agenda for inclusive 
economic growth,  through a strategic focus on energy and agriculture sectors as cornerstone to help 
the country reduce poverty and increase shared prosperity. More specifically,  and under the first 
pillar (Federally led structural reforms for growth and jobs), the new CPS aims inter alia at boosting 
agricultural productivity, improving farmers' linkages with agro-processors, and scaling up Nigeria's 
resilience to current and future climate variability. 
The proposed SCPZ support project would contribute to the achievement of Pillar I of the new 
Country Partnership Strategy on growth and competitiveness. The CPS recognized that diversified 
growth and increased productivity is a prerequisite for accelerated poverty reduction and shared 
prosperity. With the dwindling fortune of the oil sector in Nigeria, agriculture offers a sure pathway 
to a diversified and sustained economic growth. However, low productivity and lack of 
competitiveness of the agriculture sector is inextricably linked to poor infrastructure and limited 
access to the market that increases transaction cost and limit margin to the farmers. This project 
would therefore contribute to laying foundation for diversified growth by providing critical public

infrastructure necessary for improved market access and to attract private sector investment in 
agribusiness; a subsector that can offer inclusive and broad development impact. 
The Proposed SCPZ support project will be complemented by ongoing and upcoming operations in 
the World Bank portfolio such as Fadama III/Additional Financing, CADP, WAAPP, RAMP, the 
irrigation project (TRMING), the Development Financing support project, as well as non-Bank-
funded projects supporting  ATA (AfDB-ATASP2, IFAD- Cassava and Value chains support 
project). Those operations are mostly oriented toward improving productivity and ramping up 
production in the SCPZ catchment areas, critical to improving competitiveness of the processing 
segment of the value chains, recognizing that addressing the challenge of low productivity in the 
agriculture sector requires targeted investments in technology, irrigation, rural roads, market 
information, and increasing access to finance. It will also take advantage of sector reforms initiated 
under the series of DPOs; with the second operation focusing inter alia on improving the 
institutional framework and business environment for SCPZ through the preparation of SCZP 
Policy, legal and Institutional framework to foster a predictable business environment for the private 
sector. 
An effective institution is necessary for managing sustainable and inclusive growth and 
competitiveness. Governance represented by deficient institutions can explain the under-
performance of agriculture sector, and its lack of competitiveness. Governance represents the 
foundation for the two pillar of the CPS. The CPS emphasized the fact that the ways in which public 
functions are carried out, public resources are managed and regulatory powers are exercised 
strongly influence the performance of the main sector actors, the focus of sector policies and their 
concrete outcomes. The SCPZ project would support an aspect of this by providing institutional 
development as part of the project design.

II. Proposed Development Objective(s)
Proposed Development Objective(s) (From PCN)
The Project development objective (PDO) is to increase market linkages for farmers and strengthen 
the institutional framework for inclusive public and private investment in selected agribusiness 
clusters. 
 
The Project will contribute to the broader objectives of the FGN’s SCPZ Program consisting of 
‘increasing food production and reducing the demand for imports, adding value through processing, 
reducing cost of doing business for processors, and attracting new investment to create jobs, 
especially in rural areas, and to drive the economy’.  The expansion of the agribusiness- farmer 
linkage models under the SCPZ program through the right mix of public and private investments 
will ultimately, improve agricultural productivity, generate shared growth and substantially reduce 
poverty in rural areas.

Key Results (From PCN)
The mandatory corporate indicator on beneficiaries is as follow: Number of direct beneficiaries 
(directs: benefiting farmers, workers in the SCPZ processing area, and  holders of small and 
medium businesses along value chains in the SCPZ; disaggregated by gender). Indirect beneficiaries 
include family members of and beneficiaries from ancillary activities, estimated as the total 
population in hosting communities.

iv. Number of  businesses successfully implemented in the SCPZ with Project support (with 
the aim at strengthening agribusiness-farmers linkages and creating economic opportunities for the 
communities along the value chains, disaggregated by gender).

III. Preliminary Description
Concept Description
The concept of the Staple Crop Processing Zones under ATA as proposed by the Federal 
Government of Nigeria  is based on the following three guiding principles: (i) take an integrated 
approach to the value chain by addressing critical upstream and downstream bottlenecks and 
facilitating market linkages; (ii) offer a superior operating environment that reduces the cost of 
doing business, and iii) take a private sector-led approach. The Operating Principles are the 
following; (i) investment-driven strategic partnerships with the private sector; (ii) integrated value 
chain approach; (iii) Self-sustaining, government-support and private sector managed. 
  
The SCPZ program aims to channel infrastructure investments to facilitate efficient value chain 
linkages and reduce the cost of doing business, and improve the competitiveness of Nigeria’s agro-
industrial production. By creating an enabling business environment around selected value chains 
clusters, the FGN and State Governments seek to attract private sector investors to set up processing 
plants in high food production areas, in order to boost import substitution, create wealth 
opportunities for farming communities, reduce post-harvest losses, create sustainable employment 
in agro-production, processing and related activities, and drive rapid rural development.  
 
The proposed Project will support the FGN to implement the first model SCPZ and assist in 
building blocks for its sustainable expansion. The project approach to the Government's SCPZs 
Program consists of test running the concept gradually in limited number of sites, as an integrated 
agribusiness supply chain project, with strong farmers –agribusiness linkages aim to overcome the 
multiple, interlocking constraints in infrastructure provision and productivity growth along 
agricultural supply chains. Project will focus its support on Cassava supply value chain in Kogi 
State (at least 70% of project funding), with an open window for limited support in the form of 
technical assistance for up to three other sites/States with strong business case, and  based one 
following minimum criteria :  alignment with Government priority value chains and located in one 
of the SCPZ sites, existing or ready-to-implement  private investment project(s) with sizable 
financing,  high potential for improving agricultural productivity and  generating benefits for 
farmers,  strong support of state Government and local communities, existence of other Bank 
assisted project or partnership with other Donors funded project, and possible IFC intervention. 
 
Project activities will be clustered around the following areas of intervention :  
 
(a) Support to public infrastructure development for the model SCPZ in Kogi State (around 
75% of project total cost) :  consists of  support to Government to develop off-site infrastructure and 
subsequently identify and attract private sector investors willing to invest in on-site development,

operations and maintenance of the zone. The Project is also considering  to  support part of the on-
site infrastructure to guarantee minimum utility services (internal roads, water, gas, power) for up to 
3 private investment projects (covering up to 40% of the 250 hectares of the core zones).  
 
(b) Support to farmers-agribusiness linkage and to economic opportunities along the value 
chains (around 15% of total project cost). In coordination with FADAMA III Additional Financing 
( FADAMA III AF) and other relevant operations in the portfolio, the project will provide support 
to link  farmers, SMEs and communities in the catchment areas with the processing units as  
follows: (i) Improving Farmers productivity: the project will work with agro-processors to 
develop off-take agreements with farmers , aimed at structuring their organizations, and facilitating 
their access to inputs and services, such as  financing, extension, mechanization, land clearing, 
equipment and small scale production and marketing infrastructures,  grading, quality and standards, 
as well as skills development. Project will partner with Fadama III Additional Financing which will 
provide on-farm support to assist farmers deliver on the contracts; (ii) Promotion of economic 
opportunities for the community: The Project will establish a matching grants scheme to support 
activities aim at strengthening agribusiness farmers linkages which could  create jobs and increase 
income for the communities, thus contributing to reducing poverty in the project intervention areas. 
This will include support to women and youths and their groups, promoting development of 
mechanization services, transport, application of chemicals, business planning for SMEs, training , 
financial literacy, and ancillary activities of the value chains. 
 
(c) Institutional development in SCPZ (around 10% of total project cost): (i) Structuring of PPP 
for zone development, operation and maintenance: project will provide support for the 
establishment of a Specific Purpose vehicle (SPV) with a Board inclusive of all relevant 
stakeholders (Federal Government, State Government, Local Government, Developer, and Tenants). 
It is envisioned that the PPP transactions will result in specific contracts between the SPV and 
private investors; (ii) Land and safeguards management: for appropriate management of farm land 
allocation to the nucleus farms and for coordinated implementation of the SCPZ Master Plan in the 
catchment areas, the project will assist the State Government in developing responsible land 
allocation and management procedures following World Bank and international guidelines and 
standards, as well as adequate instruments and M&E system for environmental and social 
safeguards; (iii) Technical assistance to FMARD: The proposed Project will provide institutional 
support to FMARD and the SCPZ-Authority being established to regulate the SCPZS, in terms of 
technical assistance (TA), training, and experience sharing of best practices from across the world, 
and for scaling up the program to other sites based on lessons learnt from the pilot SCPZ in Kogi 
State; (iv) Technical assistance selected States for development of agribusiness clusters: 
Specific TA might include market assessment, SCPZ detailed feasibility studies, attracting private 
investor and structuring PPP, promotion of the program within the country and abroad, etc. The 
project will also support FMARD to support selected States, and upon their request, in developing 
their SCPZ projects. 
 
(d)  Project coordination: dedicated project management and coordination structure will set up 
and early as before negotiations, to initiate the implementation of the project and until the SCPZ 
institutional framework is established and fully operational.
