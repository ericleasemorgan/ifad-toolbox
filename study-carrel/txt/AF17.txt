1. INTRODUCTION 
 

1.1 Basic Information 
 

1.1.1 Locate on the Gulf of Guinea, Gabon straddles the Equator and covers an area of 

267,667 km2. The country is bordered to the North by Cameroon, to the North-West by 

Equatorial Guinea and to the South-East by Congo-Brazzaville. It has a coastline of 800 km 

along the Atlantic Ocean. Its relief is linked to the equatorial nature of its climate, its 

hydrography and vegetation. It comprises three distinct geomorphological areas:  the coastal 

plains, mountain ranges and plateaus in the interior. Annual rainfall varies between 1,500 and 

3,000 mm.  Dense, rich equatorial forest covers 85% of Gabon’s territory. In addition, there are 

16 million hectares of fertile land, only 495,000 ha of which are farmed. Gabon also has a 

significant waterways and maritime domain, a 10,000-km2 network of inland waterways, parks 

and reserves covering 11% of the territory, and an exceptionally rich biological diversity of 

almost 9,000 animal and plant species. 
 

1.1.2 Gabon’s economy is heavily dependent on oil, which accounts for 31% of GDP, 49% 

of fiscal revenue and 85% of export revenue. The fall in world oil prices has caused a significant 

loss of revenue for the country and led to slower growth averaging about 5% over the past few 

years. Gabon faces a socio-economic paradox: although belonging to the group of Middle-

Income Countries (MIC) because of its income per capita, it is also classified among Least-

Developed Countries (LDC) because of its social indicators, with a poverty rate of 32.7% and 

an unemployment rate of 35.7% for young people between the ages of 15 and 24 (26% for the 

labour force aged 25 to 341). Gabon’s average Human Development Index (HDI) of about 0.684 

ranks it 112th out of 187 countries (UNDP, 2014). Thus, Gabon’s economy has all the 

characteristics of a rent economy which creates few jobs and is focused on exports of 

unprocessed primary commodities (after oil, wood is the country’s second most important 

economic resource), despite a strong diversification potential.  
 

1.1.3 Gabon’s agricultural sector (excluding the forestry sector) plays a marginal role in the 

country’s economic and social life. Over the past five years, its contribution to GDP has 

declined and is now about 3% compared to 16% in 1970. The downward trend in the sector’s 

value added is mainly due to the dominance of the oil sector in the economy (39% of GDP, 

49% of fiscal revenue and 85% of export earnings) resulting in rural-urban migration to the 

centres for petroleum-related activities.  Agriculture, stockbreeding and fisheries under the 

combined impacts of this rural-urban migration and an ageing farming community have 

declined by almost 80% in terms of annual food production. This has created chronic food 

deficits and insecurity, which are threatening a high proportion of Gabon’s population. This 

deficit is offset by imports, about 20% of which come from neighbouring countries. In fact, 

Gabon imports over 275,000 tonnes of food products and 80% of its imports consist of wheat, 

rice and poultry meat. The food import bill is currently estimated at CFAF 350 billion per year. 

As a result, Gabon is now heavily dependent on food imports with an import dependency ratio 

of almost 60%. 

 

1.1.4  However, the agricultural sector has strong potential such as: (i) a wealth of natural 

resources and the availability of arable land; (ii) favourable agro-ecological conditions; (iii) a 

favourable equatorial climate; (iv) strong demand for food, market garden and livestock 

products; (v) a relatively high literacy rate; and (vii) the recent emergence of associations and 

individual initiatives in rural areas to tackle the economic crisis. However, development of the 

agricultural sector has been impeded by many constraints, which have led to a shift from family 

agriculture to subsistence farming systems. The main constraints are: (i) low population density 

with wide regional disparities; (ii) an ageing, unskilled and scarce rural labour force; (iii)

traditional, non-intensive production systems; (iv) an unfavourable economic environment 

(remoteness of production areas, which results in high transport costs between those areas and 

areas of high consumption as well as a lack of decentralized trading facilities); (v) weak 

organization of producers; (vi) a poorly organized agricultural research system that is barely 

operational and weak institutional capacity of advisory and support services; and (vii) lack of 

coordination among the different actors operating in rural areas. 

 

1.1.5 Having recognized its heavy dependency on the oil sector and food imports, Gabon in 

2010 launched its Emerging Gabon Strategic Plan 2025 (PSGE 2025). Focused on three pillars 

(Green Gabon, Industrial Gabon and Services Gabon), PSGE is a roadmap that will guide the 

transformation from a rent-based economy to a high value-added and diversified economy 

while preserving the country’s vast natural wealth. The Government’s declared ambition, 

through the PSGE and, in particular, its ‘Green Growth’ pillar is to transform the agricultural 

sector into one for economic diversification and a driver of inclusive growth. In future, the 

agricultural sector will have to meet the country’s food requirements, achieve food trade 

balance, create more jobs and promote least-cost marketing of primary food products by 

producing them locally. The significance of agribusiness in absolute terms in GDP and 

employment remains relatively low in Gabon at 1.5% and 4.7%. This situation is due to low yields 

and post-harvest losses of about 30%, little processing of agricultural products and marketing of 

agricultural produce that is severely handicapped by the lack of transport infrastructure as well as 

logistic and distribution centres for the storage and redistribution of agricultural products.  

 

1.1.6 Therefore, an Agricultural Development Strategy was prepared in order to achieve 

Government’s objectives then set out in a Green Gabon Operational Plan, whose proposals were, 

among others, based on an integrated sector and project-based approach.  The economic 

potential of Green Gabon will be fully realized through the plant, animal, fisheries and 

aquaculture sub-sectors to be developed via programmes and projects organized around three 

tiers of actions: the core elements (protection, knowledge and regulation), the drivers of 

competitiveness (vocational training, research and business framework) and actions to add 

value (conservation, processing, marketing and certification, etc.). Reforms have been initiated, 

for instance the professionalization of existing actors, the contribution of new actors, including 

unemployed youth and agri-business developers, new profiles and new skills. Furthermore, the 

transformation of agriculture will create new needs and innovating trades linked to the 

development of value chains for which active preparation must be made by both the public 

(vocational training, training of officials, innovative financing tools, etc.) and private sectors.  
 

1.1.7 This request made by the Government of Gabon for assistance under MIC-TAF is in 

keeping with this context.  Its purpose is to finance a study with the following objectives: 

preparation of a project to implement the agricultural development and transformation strategy 

(PASTA) and the promotion of youth entrepreneurship in the agricultural sector and 

agribusiness (PEJA). The first component of this study (PASTA) will make a comprehensive 

analysis of the different challenges and formulate a project to support public action to create an 

incentive framework and enabling environment for the development of the agricultural sub-

sectors slated for promotion. In its second component, the study of which is the subject of this 

request, will also design specific support for entrepreneurship through the formulation of a 

project to promote youth entrepreneurship in agriculture and agro-industry (PEJA).  

 

1.8  Therefore, the aim of this operation is to support the transformation of the agricultural 

sector by developing the value chains of growth-bearing sub-sectors and promoting youth 

employment in the agricultural sector and agribusiness. It is consistent with the two pillars of 

the Country Strategy Paper (2016-2020 CSP) for Gabon, namely: Pillar 1 “Support for 

economic diversification through infrastructure development and business climate 

improvement”; and Pillar 2 “Support for the Human Development Strategy”. The main thrusts 

of the project to be formulated are in keeping with the Bank’s Ten-Year Strategy (2013-2022) 



 

3 

as well as with the strategic directions of the Bank’s new agricultural sector strategy, which 

prioritizes the development of value chains and agricultural entrepreneurship. They are also in 

line with the High-5 priorities, which aim to feed Africa by 2025 and improve the quality of 

life of the people of Africa. They are closely aligned on the post-Dakar strategic directions, 

namely to: (i) develop agribusiness areas and agricultural corridors to accelerate investment in 

integrated infrastructure; (ii) obtain new private sector investments in agriculture; (iii) develop 

solid value chains for key basic products; (iv) improve farmers’ access to agricultural inputs; 

(v) establish a financing facility for the operating cycle of agricultural cooperatives with high 

potential in terms of youth employment in agriculture; and (vi) transform the education and 

training system into development tools that will provide training in trades that meet the 

economy’s needs. 
 

1.2 Operation’s Objectives 
 

Strategic and Specific Objectives: The objective of this technical support is to: (i) contribute to 

Gabon’s food security by achieving self-sufficiency in food products by 2025; (ii) make Gabon 

a top industrial crop product exporting country; and (iii) improve the population’s living 

conditions by promoting profitable and job-creating agriculture for young people. More 

specifically, the operation aims to prepare an Agricultural Transformation Strategy Support 

Project with the following complementary components: (i) development of value chains of 

promising sub-sectors; (ii) promotion of youth entrepreneurship in the agricultural sector and 

in agribusiness-PEJA, (iii) formulation of a support project for the Ministries and institutions 

responsible for PASTA-PEJA; and (iv) establishment of the PASTA-PEJA management 

mechanism. 
 

1.3 Departments responsible for the Preparing the Operation 
 

1.3.1 The two Departments responsible for preparing this technical operation include the 

Agriculture and Agro-Industry Department (OSAN), through the Agriculture and Agro-

Industry Division (OSAN.2) and the Regional Centre Operations Department (ORCE), in close 

cooperation with the Bank’s Field Office in Gabon (GAFO). This operation will be jointly 

monitored by OSAN.2 and GAFO. 
 

1.4 Justifications for use of MIC Fund 
 

1.4.1. The technical support requested will facilitate the preparation of a project to implement 

the operations identified in the Green Gabon Operational Plan 2025, which is aligned on the 

country strategy (2016-2020 CSP). This project should contribute to the diversification of 

Gabon’s economy and improvement of the population’s living conditions by developing 

selected value chains and promoting youth employment in the agricultural sector. It will enable 

the Bank to support Gabon in its agricultural sector transformation strategy with a view to 

boosting its contribution to the national economy  
 

  



 

4 

1.4.2 In particular, the Bank’s assistance will help to: (i) increase the supply of locally 

produced food crop products at prices the people of Gabon can afford; (ii) boost exports of 

industrial agricultural products; (iii) create jobs along the value chains of targeted agricultural 

sub-sectors; and (iv) build the capacity of both public and private sector agricultural sector 

actors. 
 

1.4.3 The operation is in keeping with the Revised Guidelines for the Administration and 

Utilization of the Middle Income Country Technical Assistance Fund: (i) preparation of 

investment projects and sector studies (see par. 2.3.2, 2.3.5); (ii) capacity building and 

institutional support activities (see par. 2.3.3 and 2.3.4); (iii) private sector promotion activities 

(see par. 2.3.6). 
 

 

2. DESCRIPTION OF OPERATIONS 
 

2.1 Description of Preparatory Activities for which Resources have been Requested 
 

2.1.1 Guiding Principles: The preparation study on the Project to Support the Agricultural 

Transformation Strategy and the Promotion of Youth Entrepreneurship in Agriculture and Agri-

Business (PASTA-PEJA) will be guided by a number of principles: 

 

 Capitalization on the achievements and lessons learned from implementing 

previous  agricultural projects and programmes, but also the search for 

successful examples and new technologies developed and mastered in the 

country that should be scaled up to produce a significant impact in terms of the 

sector’s development, 
 

 The reference frameworks for PASTA-PEJA will be the Agricultural Sector 
Development Strategy (2014), the Green Gabon Plan (2015), PNIASAN, in 

addition to other agricultural sector and sub-sector studies, 
 

 The exit and sustainability strategy: the project’s interventions will be made in 
line with predetermined roles and responsibilities of the stakeholders, in 

particular manufacturers, local communities, users and deconcentrated 

government services concerning the maintenance and sustainability of 

investments and the supply of services to communities. 
 

2.1.2 Study’s Main Activities: The objective of the PASTA-PEJA study is to formulate two 

sub-projects: PASTA and PEJA. It will be organized in four components:  
 

2.1.2.1. The first component proposes support to the Agricultural Transformation Strategy 

(PASTA) by drawing on a comprehensive inventory of the analyses and studies already carried 

out. The aim of this component is to design a sub-project that will contribute to the 

transformation of Gabon’s agriculture by promoting growth-bearing sub-sectors that will 

diversify Gabon’s economy (both in the case of essential basic products and agro-industrial 

products), particularly by focusing it on the promotion of value chains and operationalization 

of the multiservice hub concept developed by the Government for wealth creation. The 

operation’s objectives are in line with the Bank’s High-5 priorities, which aim to feed Africa 

by 2025 and improve the quality of life of the people of Africa. They are particularly aligned 

on the post-Dakar strategic directions, namely to: (i) obtain new private sector investments in 

agriculture; (ii) develop solid value chains for key basic products; (iii) improve farmers’ access 

to agricultural inputs; (iv) develop youth employment in agriculture; and (vi) transform the 

education and training system into a development tool that will provide training in trades that 

meet the economy’s needs. Therefore, the formulation of the support will incorporate key 

elements linked specifically to: (a) capacity building for public, private and community 

institutions in the sector; (b) the development of facilitating infrastructure, both material (tracks, 

markets, warehouses, drinking water supply and sanitation, training structures and agricultural 



 

5 

support services, etc.) and immaterial (in particular, ICT, which may have positive impacts); 

(c) the promotion of public-private partnerships; (d) the promotion of vocational integration 

and youth entrepreneurship to revive agricultural activities and create a new class of 

professional agricultural entrepreneurs; and (e) improvement of the sector’s governance, etc. 

The preparation of PASTA will contribute to the identification and prioritization of key actions 

to be included in the project. These actions will contribute to the transformation of Gabon’s 

agriculture. It will be necessary to: 
 

 Review the ongoing reforms and initiatives or those planned under the Green 
Gabon Plan  

 Conduct studies on the value chains of sub-sectors among those identified and 
prioritized in the Green Gabon Operational Plan following justification of their 

selection 

 Identify catalytic projects/actions that could support the transformation of 
Gabon’s agriculture and that will constitute the body of PASTA 

 Formulate the PASTA project in accordance with three guiding principles: adopt 
an integrated upstream-downstream sector approach for growth-bearing sectors 

mutually agreed upon with the Government, apply a project approach, i.e. all the 

proposed actions will be formulated as projects that will contribute to the 

achievement of mutually pre-determined objectives to boost entrepreneurship 

and ensure pragmatic and effective public action. Indeed, the Government’s 

intervention that will be supported by PASTA will create an incentive and 

enabling environment for the development of the sub-sectors slated for 

promotion.  Its intervention will focus on the following areas: (i) organization of 

farmers; (ii) structuring of relationships between the different operators from 

production to placing on the market; (iii) financing of value chain actors; (iv) 

regional development; (v) agricultural research and development, training and 

guidance; (vi) availability of inputs and mechanization; (vii) enhancement of 

production (conservation, processing and marketing); (viii) rural development; 

and (ix) multiservice hubs. It will also aim to provide incentives to private 

investment and provide impetus to youth entrepreneurship in the selected sub-

sectors, where they will play a key role as the main actors for the development 

of productive agriculture: improvement of yields, participation in financing of 

equipment, provision of services, etc.  
 

2.1.2.2. The objective of the second component is to work directly towards the employment 

of young people in the agricultural sector and agribusiness.  This objective will be achieved in 

the first component (PASTA), through incentive rather than direct measures. The promotion of 

youth entrepreneurship in the agricultural sector and agribusiness (PEJA) will be achieved by 

an operational sub-project underpinning PASTA, aimed at fostering the integration of young 

people in the different segments of the value chains of the sub-sectors to be promoted.  PEJA’s 

operationalization will have to take into account the following two major Government concerns: 

(i) the need to begin the sustainable transformation of the rural environment by developing 

profitable and competitive activities that will attract economic operators, including young 

people; and (ii) the urgent need to help to reduce unemployment by spurring the interest of 

young people in profitable economic activities in the agricultural sector. In accordance with the 

strategic directions of the PSGE (2015-2025) and the Human Capital Strategy (2014-2018), the 

project will adopt a specific approach for young people in the agricultural sector to facilitate 

their integration into the different segments of the value chains. This framework should lead to 

the emergence of modern agricultural, agro-industrial and service enterprises fostered by 

improved access to financing and equipment, the development of productive, processing and 



 

6 

marketing infrastructure to be established under PASTA. Preparation of this component will 

provide an opportunity to review the different models already tried and tested as well as 

experience gained both at the national level and in other countries. It will also help to define 

the most efficient operating methods, taking into account the diversity of the targets and 

opportunities to increase absorption and enhance attractiveness. The projects that are ongoing 

or under preparation also deserve special attention in terms of capitalization and possible 

synergy. The “agripreneur” model developed by the International Institute of Tropical 

Agriculture (IITA) could also serve as a guide in the formulation of the project, while taking 

into account the specificities of Gabon and the existing structures. Ultimately, the results of the 

studies and reflections will contribute to the design and preparation of the project that could be 

financed from Bank resources, while specifying the implementation conditions. In this context, 
an inclusive approach will be adopted that will encourage the involvement of territorial 

communities, the technical services concerned by youth employment, major projects and 

programmes implemented such as GRAINE.  
 

2.1.2.3. PEJA is expected to foster youth employment and curb rural-urban migration by 

promoting the different links in the value chains of the pre-selected sub-sectors promoted in 

PASTA. In particular, it will be necessary to:  
 

*  Identify and analyse the labour market and opportunities relating to the growth-

bearing sub-sectors. This section of the study aims to capitalize on the analysis 

of all the sectors, sub-sectors and associated value chains conducted under 

PASTA to identify those areas that will provide more opportunities and 

increased contributory capacity for the transformation of the agricultural sector, 

job creation, GDP growth as well as the needs of major projects initiated such as 

the GRAINE project;  
 

*  Select the beneficiaries. It will be necessary to define the conditions to facilitate 

access by young people to the entrepreneurship promotion mechanisms to be 

established as well as the selection criteria and methods to be developed and 

applied.  
 

*  Build young people’s skills. This part of the study will comprise a diagnostic 

review of agricultural training programmes and strategies. It will assess the 

technical and physical capacity of the various existing training institutes and 

centres in relation to the skill building requirements of developers, and will 

propose possible solutions from an institutional, human resource, training 

content and budget standpoint, etc. 
 

*  Propose a mechanism for financing developers. It will be necessary to prepare a 

financing framework that will be able to support in different forms the initiatives 

of young people and women, taking into account the targeted profiles and 

activities. Financing mechanisms will be identified (including innovative ones) 

that will guarantee the lasting access by beneficiaries to financing by local 

financial institutions;  
 

* Support developers. This section of the study will consider the conditions for 

providing the best possible support to developers to enable them to establish and 

start up their activities under the best conditions. This stage is critical for the 

success of the activity’s start-up period and will allow for the necessary 

operational adjustments.

The conclusions of the different preliminary studies along with consideration of the experience 

acquired in the area can be used to support the project’s formulation. A quantified estimation 

of the different targets will be proposed at the same time as the preparation of the logical 

framework and definition of the key indicators. The proposed project components and activities 

will be described and the implementation conditions specified, with possible partners as well 

as the project’s expected benefits and risks and mitigation measures to be taken into account.  
 

2.1.2.4. Component 3 entails building the capacity of the state-owned institutions responsible 

for monitoring and implementing the project. These institutions will be identified beforehand, 

then provided with institutional support to enable them to monitor the activities being carried 

out under good conditions, and to develop certain strategic aspects while building capacity and 

adopting an inclusive approach. The necessary measures and procurements should be listed 

with their corresponding costs.  
 

2.1.2.5. Component 4: PASTA-PEJA project management. This component will concern the 

project management modalities. It will be necessary to: (i) propose an institutional and 

coordination mechanism for PASTA-PEJA activities; (ii) prepare an administrative, accounting 

and financial procedures manual and establish a PASTA-PEJA accounts management system; 

(iii) establish a communication and sensitization plan; and (iv) establish a baseline situation and 

a monitoring and evaluation system. The study terms of reference (TOR) are presented in annex.  

 

2.2 Description of Expected Outcomes: The operation will be implemented over 18 

months, eight of which will be dedicated to the conduct of the PASTA-PEJA study (excluding 

the time taken by the administration to approve the deliverables) that will entail two main phase. 

The first four-month phase will consist of comprehensive sector reviews and an overview of 

the implementation status of the agricultural sector development strategy. It will identify all the 

measures and projects/programmes that have not yet been implemented and could be 

incorporated in PASTA-PEJA. All the preparatory/intermediate analyses and studies to be 

carried out during this phase will help to determine the strategic directions of the support project 

to be presented at a national validation seminar. The second phase will be implemented over a 

4-month period and will consist of assessing the technical, financial, socio-economic and 

environmental feasibility of PASTA-PEJA. This phase will culminate in the presentation of the 

following provisional documents: (i) the PASTA- PEJA feasibility studies, (ii) the DD of the 

infrastructure to be established and; (iii) the project environmental and social impact assessment 

(ESIA), which will be examined at a second national seminar. The observations made at this 

seminar will be taken into consideration by the consultant in the final versions of the reports. 

At the end of this phase, it will also be necessary to prepare the project’s management, in 

particular by: (a) establishing the baseline situation and the monitoring/evaluation system; and 

(b) preparing the administrative, accounting and financial procedures manual as well as the 

PASTA-PEJA accounting system. 
 

3. ESTIMATED COSTS OF PREPARATORY ACTIVITIES  
 

3.1 Estimated Cost of Study: The study’s total cost, including provisions for physical 

and financial contingencies, is estimated at UA 1.11 million (CFAF 913.583 million), excluding 

taxes and customs duties. The total cost is broken down into foreign exchange costs of UA 

661,867 (CFAF 544.358 million) and UA 448,928 in local currency (CFAF 369.225 million). 

The main components of the study costs concern: costs incurred by the consultant who will be 

responsible for the study (fees, specific studies, travel expenses, organization of report 

restitution and validation workshops, etc.); procurement of the necessary equipment of the 

SCU, costs of external auditor and counterparts, study management and coordination costs, etc. 

A summary of the estimated project cost by component and by expenditure account is presented 

below, while the details are presented in the annexes.

5.2 Draft Annual Work Programme and Procurement Schedule: The organization and 

management of this operation is presented in detail in the annexes combining the institutional 

arrangements, financial management and auditing requirements as well as the supervision and 

monitoring/evaluation of this operation. During the project’s appraisal, the Donee prepared a 

procurement plan (PP) which sets out the procurement methods. It will be submitted for review 

and approval by the Bank prior to the signing of the Letter of Agreement. 

 

5.3 Study Organization and Management: Planned over an 8-month period, the study 

will be conducted by a consulting firm to be recruited based on international shopping drawn 

from a shortlist using the QCBS method. The General Secretariat of the Ministry of Agriculture 

and Agricultural Entrepreneurship responsible for implementing the GRAINE programme 

(MAEAPG) will be the executing agency. In this regard, its capacity will be built up by the 

Study Coordination Unit (SCU) established under the MICT-TAF operation relating to the 

GRAINE Programme Support Project – Phase 2 (PAPG-2). This SCU will be set up at the 

General Secretariat and will be responsible for coordinating and managing the PASTA-PEJA 

study. As a reminder, the Ministry will appoint an official with the required qualifications and 

confirmed experience in agriculture and rural development to the position of Study Coordinator 

who will be assisted by a procurement specialist, an accountant and support staff (2 drivers and 

1 secretary). These will be recruited based on open competition, and performance contracts will 

be signed. In addition, the Gabonese Authorities will designate a team of seven (7) national 

counterparts (value chain development, agro-industry, rural engineering, development of 

agricultural entrepreneurship, governance and institutional aspects, development of rural 

institutions and gender), who will work closely with the international experts. A Steering 

Committee will also be established for the operation, to be chaired by MAEAPG’s secretary-

general, whose duties will entail monitoring the conduct of the study, analysing the consultant’s 

provisional reports and formulating recommendations and guidelines. To ensure the successful 

conduct of the study, plans have been made to build the SCU’s capacity by procuring IT and 

office automation equipment.  
  
6. FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS  
 

6.1 Financing/Disbursement Conditions and Audit: Disbursements will mainly be 

made by the direct payment method (for the payment of consultant’s service contracts to 

conduct the study and external audit). A special account will be opened exclusively for the 

operating costs of the MIC-TAF implementation unit and study coordination, at a Bank in 

Libreville deemed acceptable by the Bank. 



 

11 

 

6.2 Financial Management: The operation’s financial management framework will be 

compliant with MIC-TAF guidelines for small-scale operations funded by the Bank Group. The 

MIC-TAF Coordination Unit, which is the same as the one for the PAPG.2 project, comprises 

a coordinator, a procurement specialist, an accountant, a secretary and two drivers. The 

accountant will be recruited based on open competition and the evaluation report on this 

recruitment should be submitted to the Bank for its no-objection opinion. He/she should have 

at least 5 years accounting experience, two of which should be with development projects 

financed by donors, in particular AfDB or the World Bank, in addition to a university degree in 

accounting. 

  

6.2.1. Accounting software will be purchased by the consulting firm and transferred to the 

SCU  in order to maintain the accounts and produce the annual reports of this MIC-TAF 

operation (balance sheet, sources and uses tables for the period and cumulative periods, 

explanatory notes, special account reconciliations statement, and fixed assets inventory) and 

the six-monthly production of financial monitoring reports (FMR) to be submitted to the Bank 

latest 45 days after the end of the six month period. The accounts will be produced in 

compliance with the OHADA accounting principles. 
 

6.2.2. It is also planned that the consulting firm will prepare the administrative, financial and 

accounting procedures manual. This manual will describe the procedures applicable in the 

different management cycles and define the internal control mechanisms to be established. It 

will be used during the conduct of the study and for the future project. Therefore, the consultant 

will envisage updating these management tools during the implementation of the PAPG.2 

project, with a view to incorporating all the organizational specificities and implementation 

modalities of the finalized project. 

 

6.2.3. This MIC-TAF operation will be the subject of a single audit to be performed on 

completion of the project’s 18-month implementation period. The audit will be conducted by 

an independent firm of external auditors to be recruited based on open competition, in 

accordance with the Bank’s standard terms of reference. The related costs will be paid by the 

PAST-PEJA MIC-TAF fund. The audit report will be submitted to the Bank latest six months 

after the completion of the MIC-TAF activities. 

 

6.3 Suspension of disbursements: Disbursements of MIC-TAF resources will be 

governed by the Bank’s disbursement rules, in general, and those on the suspension of 

disbursements, in particular. 
 

6.4 Letter of Agreement: Following approval of the Request, the Bank will prepare a Letter 

of Agreement in accordance with the format in Annex 3 of the new MIC-TAF Guidelines 
(November 2011). The Letter of Agreement will be signed between the Bank and the Republic 

of Gabon, and will become effective following its signature. The conditions precedent to first 

disbursement will be to provide AfDB to its complete satisfaction:  

 

 

(i)  Evidence of the opening of a special account in a bank acceptable to AfDB for 

the purpose of receiving the proceeds of the grant; and  

 

(ii)  Evidence of the recruitment of a national coordinator for the study and the other 

members of the Study Coordination Unit (accountant and procurement expert), 

on the basis of open competition and with the Bank’s approval. 

 
 

 

7. ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL ASPECTS 



 

12 

 

The project is proposed for Category 3 of the Bank’s environmental and social assessment 

procedures since it does not entail any activities that might generate negative environmental 

impacts.  
 

8. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

8.1 Conclusions: The conduct of the aforementioned studies will contribute to the fine-tuning 

of PASTA-PEJA preparation and provide the project owner with all the required elements for 

the design and sizing of the project as well as an assessment of the investment’s feasibility. It 

will also allow for smooth preparation of project management. 

 

8.2 Recommendations: It is recommended that the Bank award the Republic of Gabon, 

in accordance with the above conditions, a grant not exceeding UA 991,095 from MIC Fund 

resources. This grant will mainly be used to finance consultancy services as described in this 

memorandum and the terms of reference (TOR) presented in annex.

Subject: Request for an ADB Grant to Finance Agricultural Sector Work 

 

Mr. President, 

 

In the Green Gabon Operational Plan of the Emerging Gabon Strategic Plan (PSGE), Gabon 

promises to adopt an integrated approach for the development of agricultural sub-sectors and its 

value chains in order to achieve food self-sufficiency by 2025. This requires the development of 

205,000 hectares of land as well as the intensive and eco-friendly exploitation of plant, animal and 

fish farming sub-sectors. 

 

Moreover, in February 2015, under the implementation of the Agriculture-Livestock Sector Plan, 

the Government launched an ambitious agricultural development plan called the GRAINE 

Programme, the objectives of which are to guarantee food security and self-sufficiency, develop 

cash crops (coffee, cocoa, palm oil and rubber), contribute to the economic diversification and 

create agricultural jobs, especially for young people. 

 

To establish the different institutional links of the value chain and thus ensure the achievement of 

the results of this ambitious programme, I have the honour of requesting technical assistance from 

the African Development Bank (AfDB), to be financed from the resources of the Middle Income 

Countries Technical Assistance Fund (MIC-TAF), for the preparation of: (i) an Agricultural 

Transformation Strategy based on the Development of Value Chains (STADEC); and (ii) the

4.  Description of the activities: 

 

Gabon’s economy is based mostly on the exploitation of its raw materials, mainly oil.  In 2014, 

the contribution of oil to GDP had reached 39% and it accounted for 85% of exports and 49% of 

central government fiscal revenue.  Despite its potential of over 5 million hectares, the agriculture 

sector only contributes 4.7% to GDP.  Major investments are required to provide coordinated 

responses to the challenge of the agriculture sector’s structural transformation, with a view to 

increasing its contribution to the national economy and achieving food self-sufficiency by 2025.  

The proposed studies are focused on the two following components: (A) Conduct of feasibility 

studies; and (B) Management of the studies. 

 

          Conduct of Feasibility Studies: the activities to carried out are : 

 

- Formulation of the National Agricultural Transformation Strategy based on the 
Development of agricultural value chains (STADEC) 

 

 Carry out a comprehensive diagnostic review of the different agricultural, animal 
and fishery subsectors; 

 

 Assess the constraints and opportunities for the development of agricultural 
value chains; 

 

 Carry out an inventory and propose an appropriate action plan for the 
agricultural training and research system; 

 

 Carry out an inventory and propose an efficient action plan for the production, 
certification and distribution of seeds and other agricultural inputs;  

 

 Carry out an inventory of the system for the development of cultivable land; 
 

 Carry out an inventory of mechanization among farmers; 
 

 Analyse the collection system and marketing channels for agricultural products; 
 

 Carry out an inventory of agricultural product processing; 



 

III 

 

 

 

 Carry out an inventory of the information system on agricultural product 
markets; 

 

 Carry out an inventory of the national health safety system in the agriculture 
sector; 

 

 Carry out an inventory of the epidemiological surveillance system for animal 
diseases; 

 

 Analyse both policy and institutional frameworks, financing mechanisms and 
actor involvement; 

 

 Formulate the national agricultural transformations strategy based on the 
development of agricultural value chains, taking into account the above-

mentioned inventories; and 

 

 Prepare a quantified short-, medium- and long-term action plan. 
 

Another of the consultant’s duties will be to conduct a technical, economic, financial and 

organizational feasibility study as well as an economic and social impact assessment of a 

project to be retained by mutual agreement with the government. 

 

- Prepare and formulate the GRAINE Programme Support Project 
 

The objective of the GRAINE Programme is to accelerate economic diversification in order to 

release the multi-pronged drivers of inclusive growth.  In the short-term, it aims to increase the 

share of agriculture in national wealth with a view to guaranteeing food security, control youth 

unemployment and create about 20,000 jobs.  As part of this vast State-run programme, over 

200,000 hectares will be farmed and about 30,000 volunteer families grouped together in 

cooperatives distributed in several hundred villages integrated into basic socio-economic 

infrastructure (tracks, markets, collection centres, slaughtering areas, processing units, rural 

DWS, health centres, schools, etc.).  In keeping with the PSGE and the Social Pact, this 

programme also addresses several socio-economic challenges, in particular: (i) the strengthening 

of food security through the local farming of staple products (bananas, cassava, cocoyam, oil, 

sugar cane, etc.); (ii) the diversification and enriching of Gabon’s agricultural base; (iii) the 

promotion of agricultural entrepreneurship; (iv) poverty reduction through the empowerment of 

the most economically vulnerable segments of the population; (v) job creation; (vi) economic 

development of rural areas; (vii) reduction in the volume and cost of food imports; (viii) curbing 

of rural-urban migration; and (ix) the creation of a strong agricultural community. 

 

This is the background against which it is planned to formulate a project in PPP form between 

the Government (Ministry of Agriculture) and SOTRADER.  Therefore, the consultant’s main 

duty will be to conduct a technical, economic, financial and organizational feasibility study as 

well as an economic and social impact assessment, in addition to preparing the DD for the 

infrastructure retained and their corresponding BD.  Based on this study, the consultant will be 

required to propose a project operational plan as well as the corresponding financing plan (central 

government, SOTRADER).  The aforementioned project will comprise the following main 

components : (A) Development of agricultural and rural infrastructure (tracks, markets, 

warehouses, drying areas, slaughtering areas, rehabilitation of institutes and schools providing 

training in agricultural trades, development of land, schools, DWS, electricity, health centres, 

etc.; (B) development of value chains (agricultural multi-service hubs, facilitation of access to 



 

IV 

 

improved inputs, support to mastery of technical itineraries, enhancement of agricultural 

products, organization of producers, agricultural and fishery product processing units, etc.); (C) 

Capacity building, (seeds, training and research, agricultural guidance, agricultural trades, 

health control and epidemiological surveillance of animal diseases, development of agricultural 

entrepreneurship and IGA). 

 

B.  Management of the Studies  

 

 Coordination of activities 

 Establishment of administrative, accounting and financial management 
procedures manuals 

 Establishment of a communication and sensitization plan 

 Establishment of an internal and external monitoring and evaluation plan, and 

 Monitoring of studies and production of reports. 
 

5.  Rationale for the activities 

 

Gabon faces a socio-economic paradox of belonging to the group of Middle-Income Countries 

(MIC) because of its income per capita while, at the same time, being classified among Least 

Developed Countries (LDC) because of its social indicators, with a poverty rate of 32.7% in 

2014 and an unemployment rate of 27% of the labour force. Gabon’s average Human 

Development Index (HDI) of about 0.684 ranks it 112th out of 187 countries in the Human 

Development Report (UNDP, 2014). Hence, Gabon’s economy has all the characteristics of a 

rent economy that creates few jobs and is focused on exports of unprocessed primary 

commodities despite strong potential for diversification, given the country’s significant natural 

resource capital. 

 

With a contribution to GDP of 4.7% and an annual growth rate of 3.3% between 2005 and 2010, 

Gabon’s agriculture occupies quite a marginal position in the country’s economy.  The rural 

population, in a minority, was estimated at over 225,000 in 2014, i.e. 14% of the country’s 

population.  Agricultural land is estimated at 5.2 million hectares.  Agricultural land is an 

abundant resource, almost all of which is easily accessible, especially since the low population 

density of 6.1 inh./km2 reinforces the impression of relatively unimpeded access.  However, the 

allocation of land to mining and forestry concessions leaves little or no secure land for 

agricultural activities.  The highest estimates give a figure of 500,000 hectares of land cultivated 

by an ageing smallholder population.  Overall, agricultural output is low and Gabon imported 

foodstuffs valued at over CFAF 300 billion. 

 

In 2010, in order to resolve the socio-economic paradox facing the country, the national 

authorities launched the Emerging Gabon Strategic Plan 2025 (PSGE 2025). Focused on three 

pillars (Green Gabon, Industrial Gabon and Services Gabon), PSGE is a roadmap that will allow 

the country to emerge from its dependency on the oil sector and capitalize fully on its comparative 

advantages to address the challenges by: (i) accelerating economic growth through the 

diversification of sources; (ii) reducing poverty and social inequalities; and (iii) ensuring 

sustainable natural resource management.  It is necessary to encourage the shift from a resource-

based economy towards a diversified one, in order to strengthen the competitiveness of the 

industrial and service sectors while preserving the country’s immense natural wealth. 

 

The strategic objectives of the “Green Gabon” Pillar are as follows: (i) sustainable management 

of Gabon’s forests and the country’s positioning as world leader in certified tropical wood 

(Forestry and Wood Sector Programme); (ii) the realization of agricultural potential and 

achievement of food security (Agriculture and Livestock Sector Programme); and (iii) the 

promotion of sustainable exploitations and development of fishery resources (Fisheries and 



 

V 

 

Aquaculture Sector Programme).  Therefore, PSGE aims to guarantee food security by covering 

the food requirements of the country’s population and ensuring the sustainable availability of 

high quality and affordable products. 

 

In December 2104, the President of the Republic presented a new initiative to Gabon’s partners: 

the GRAINE Programme (Gabonese Initiative for Achieving Agricultural Outcomes with 

Engaged Citizenry).  This is a programme to support the policies of establishing and developing 

agricultural cooperatives nationwide to ensure the emergence of a new generation of competent, 

productive and cohesive farmers.  It is in keeping with the PSGE and the Social Pact.  

Implemented since January 2015, the GRAINE Programme is focused on four main strategic 

thrusts : (i) assist individuals in forming cooperatives; (ii) develop plantations, provide operating 

equipment and premises for each cooperative; and (iv) provide supervision of the management of 

agricultural activities generated by the cooperative.  The GRAINE Programme is being 

implemented by Société Gabonaise de Transformation Agricole et Dévéloppement Rurale 

(SOTRADER) stemming from a Public-Private Partnership between the Republic of Gabon and 

OLAM. 

 

To assist the Government of Gabon in addressing the challenge of food security by achieving 

almost complete food self-sufficiency and also in becoming an exporter of industrial crop 

products on the one hand, and in building the institutional capacity of the support structures of 

the Ministry responsible for Agriculture and Agricultural Entrepreneurship and the Ministry 

responsible for Fisheries and Livestock to  (i) transform the agriculture sector by developing value 

chains, and (ii) support supervise and monitor the activities implemented under the GRAINE 

Programme throughout the national territory, on the other hand, the Government of Gabon has 

requested  assistance from the Bank.

Annex IV 

TERMS OF REFERENCE OF THE STUDY ON THE PREPARATION OF THE STUDY 

TO SUPPORT THE AGRICULTURAL TRANSFORMATION STRATEGY AND THE 

PROMOTION OF YOUTH ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN THE AGRICULTURAL 

SECTOR (PASTA-PEJA) 

 

I. INTRODUCTION 
 

1.1.  Located on the Gulf of Guinea, Gabon straddles the Equator and covers an area of 267,667 

km2. The country is bordered to the North by Cameroon, to the North-West by Equatorial Guinea 

and to the South-East by Congo-Brazzaville. It has a coastline of 800 km along the Atlantic Ocean. 

Its relief is linked to the equatorial nature of its climate, its hydrography and vegetation. It 

comprises three distinct geomorphological areas: the coastal plains, mountain ranges and plateaus 

in the interior. Annual rainfall varies between 1,500 and 3,000 mm. The network of waterways 

covers almost the entire national territory. Dense, rich equatorial forest covers 85% of Gabon’s 

territory. After oil, wood is the country’s second most important economic resource. Gabon is 

divided into 9 administrative provinces, 47 départements, 152 cantons, 52 municipalities, 26 sub-

prefectures and 3 304 villages and groups of villages. 

 

1.2. Gabon is under-populated, with the lowest population density in Africa. In 2013, the 

population was estimated at 1 802 728 inhabitants1, i.e. a density of 5.6 inhabitants per km². The 

annual population growth rate is estimated at 2.7%. It has the following two major characteristics: 

a high proportion of young people (36% of the population is under 15) and almost 82% of the 

population lives in urban areas, mostly in the three main urban centres of Libreville, Port-Gentil 

and Franceville. The rural areas have been abandoned in favour of the large towns and cities. The 

rural population has halved in 50 years and currently stands at only 273,000. This high rate of 

urbanization has mainly concerned people of working age, with a subsequent drop in the size of 

the rural labour force. With income per capita of USD 7,3702, Gabon is classified as a Middle-

Income Country. However, its social indicators are comparable to those of countries with low 

Human Development Indices (HDI). Furthermore, according to the Poverty Assessment and 

Monitoring Survey (EGEP 20053), one third of Gabon’s population was reported to be living 

below the poverty threshold. There are wide disparities between rural and urban areas in terms of 

development, in particular access to basic infrastructure, which is reflected in human development 

indicators in rural areas below those recorded in urban areas. Thus, the rural poverty rate is 45% 

compared to 30% in urban areas, and the illiteracy rate is 18% in rural areas compared to 9% in 

urban areas. Gabon’s ranking remains well below that of other countries in its category in terms 

of income per capita. The employment situation is quite precarious. The unemployment rate is 

worrisome and is estimated at over 20%, with unemployed youth representing 60% of the 

unemployed population.  

 

1.3. Gabon’s economy is heavily dependent on oil, which represents 50% of GDP, 60% of tax 

revenue and 80% of exports of goods. This dependency makes it even more fragile, especially 

since prices fluctuate, reserves are far from being inexhaustible and production is declining. It is 

also characterized by weak diversification and heavy dependency on the outside world, with a high 

level of public spending. Gabon’s agricultural sector (plant and animal production, fisheries, 

aquaculture and forestry) plays a marginal role in the country’s socio-economic life. Over the past 

five years, its contribution to GDP has declined and now stands at about 3% compared to 16% in 

1970. The downward trend in the sector’s value-added is mainly the result of the oil sector’s

2 Bank’s 2011-2015 RBCSP; July 2011 

3  The 2005 EGEP is the most recent source of reliable data on poverty in Gabon. This survey has not yet been updated. The 2010 MDG 

Progress Report is, however, available and reports a worrisome poverty trend that significantly reduced the likelihood of reaching the 
targeted poverty rate by 2015.

dominance in the economy and the government’s strategy that was particularly dependent on agro-

industries and cash crops. This strategy was not successful in boosting agricultural production 

mainly because of rural-urban migration to the towns in which oil activities were concentrated. 

Therefore, agriculture (including stockbreeding and fisheries) has experienced a sharp drop of 

almost 80% in the quantity of food produced annually because of the combined effects of rural-

urban migration and an ageing agricultural population.  This has created a deficit and chronic food 

insecurity that is threatening a high proportion of Gabon’s population.  This deficit is covered by 

imports, about 20% of which come from neighbouring countries. As a result, Gabon is now highly 

dependent on food imports at almost 60%.  Gabon imports over 275,000 tonnes of food products 

and 80% of its imports consist of wheat, rice and poultry meat. The food import bill is currently 

estimated at CFAF 350 billion per year. 

 

1.4. The plantain, banana and cassava sub-sectors are the main plant sub-sectors in Gabon in 

terms of areas and productions, in addition to rubber in terms of the value of its output. The most 

important animal sub-sector is poultry. Two types of agriculture co-exist in Gabon: food crop 

agriculture, which pre-dominates, and cash crop farming for agribusiness and export. Food crop 

agriculture is carried out through shifting cultivation and subsistence farming, mainly managed by 

elderly people or women in the form of private village and peri-urban farms. It is inefficient and 

production is for on-farm consumption. The main crops and activities are plantain, bananas, yams, 

cassava, market gardening and small ruminant breeding (sheep and goats). Cash crop farming is 

of a commercial nature mainly intended for agribusiness and exporting. The main plant crops are 

rubber, sugar cane, oil palm, coffee and cocoa, while livestock productions is confined to cattle 

breeding. 

 

II. STUDY CONTEXT 

 

2.1. The agricultural sector has strong potential such as: (i) a wealth of natural resources and 

the availability of arable land; (ii) favourable agro-ecological conditions; (iii) a favourable 

equatorial climate; (iv) strong demand for food, market garden and livestock products (existence 

of significant import substitution potential since 60% of food products in towns and cities are 

currently imported; (v) a relatively high literacy rate; (vii) the recent emergence of associations 

and individual initiatives in rural areas to tackle the economic crisis. However, development of the 

agricultural sector has been impeded by many constraints that have led to a shift from family-based 

agriculture to subsistence farming systems. The main constraints are: (i) low population density 

with wide regional disparities: the rural areas of concentration are the Woleu-Ntem, Ngounie and 

Nyanga provinces; (ii) an ageing, unskilled and scarce rural labour force; (iii) traditional non-

intensive production systems; (iv) an unfavourable economic environment (remoteness of 

production areas which results in high transportation costs between those areas and areas of high 

consumption as well as a lack of decentralized trading facilities); (v) weak organization of 

producers; (vi) a poorly organized agricultural research system which is barely operational, and 

weak institutional capacity of advisory and support services; and (vii) lack of coordination among 

the different actors operating in rural areas. 

 

2.2. Recognizing its heavy dependency on the oil sector and food imports, Gabon in 2010 

launched its Emerging Gabon Strategic Plan 2025 (PSGE 2025). Focused on three pillars (Green 

Gabon, Industrial Gabon and Services Gabon), the PSGE is a roadmap that will guide the 

transformation from a rent-based economy to a high value-added and diversified one geared 

towards strengthening the competitiveness of industrial and service sectors, while preserving the 

country’s vast natural wealth. Green Gabon’s economic potential will be fully developed with a 

view to ensuring food security, sustainable resource development and reducing poverty. In this 

regard, an agricultural development strategy was prepared, which aims to transform the 

agricultural sector (in the broad sense) into one that will drive Gabon’s development, with the 

following strategic visions: (i) a sector that provides access to sufficient quantities of high quality 

food through more affordable prices and ensures high quality products for all of Gabon’s 



 

X 

 

population; (ii) a competitive, job-creating, export-focused sector by increasing agricultural areas 

and developing cash crops; (iii) a sector that will help to develop and balance the distribution of 

people, activities and natural resources throughout the country, thus transforming the agricultural 

sector into a driver of rural development. 

 

2.3. In this regard, an integrated approach to protect and ensure the sustainable development 

of Gabon’s ecosystems was designed that applies to forest, aquatic and agro-pastoral ecosystems, 

and is sub-divided into seven associated development sub-sectors: agriculture and livestock, 

fisheries, aquaculture, the wood sector, Non-Wood Forest Products (NWP) and the bush meat 

(game) sub-sector. The Green Gabon Operational Plan (2015) sets out the approach and projects 

planned to promote and provide a framework for the sustainable development of Gabon’s 

ecosystems and their natural resources. Therefore, a number of projects have been identified that 

will contribute to their protection and development. These projects are organized around three tiers 

of actions: the core elements (protection, knowledge and regulation), the drivers of 

competitiveness (vocational training, research and business framework) and actions to add value 

(conservation, processing, marketing and certification, etc.). The drivers of agricultural 

transformation include academic and vocational training.  This transformation requires the 

professionalization of existing actors in their areas of expertise as well as the contribution of new 

actors, new profiles and new skills. Furthermore, agricultural transformation will create new needs 

and innovating trades linked to the development of value chains.  

 

2.4. In light of these new directions and in order to address these requirements, the 

Government of Gabon has submitted a request to the Bank concerning the conduct of a study on 

the Project to Support the Agricultural Development and Transformation Strategy and the 

Promotion of Youth Entrepreneurship in the Agricultural sector and Agriculture, based on the 

development of agricultural sub-sector value chains, which is the subject of these terms of 

reference. 

 

III. THE STUDY 

 

3.1 Guiding Principles 

 

The preparation study on the Project to Support the Agricultural Transformation Strategy and the 

Promotion of Youth Entrepreneurship in Agriculture and Agribusiness (PASTA-PEJA) will be 

guided by a number of principles which, if applied, will contribute to sustainable development, 

promote an agriculture with strong potential to diversify the economy, create wealth and jobs in 

the different agricultural areas of Gabon, and meet the food requirements of a steadily rising 

population.  These objectives, which contribute most directly to this ultimate goal, are focused on: 

 

 Capitalization on the achievements and lessons learned from implementing 

previous  agricultural projects and programmes, but also the search for successful 

examples and new technologies developed and mastered in the country, which 

should be scaled up to produce a significant impact in terms of the sector’s 

development 

 The reference frameworks for PASTA-PEJA will be the Agricultural Sector 
Development Strategy (2014), the Green Gabon Plan (2015), PNIASAN, in 

addition to other agricultural sector and sub-sector studies, and 

 The exit and sustainability strategy: the project’s interventions will be made in line 
with predetermined roles and responsibilities of the stakeholders, in particular 

manufacturers, local communities, users and decentralized government services in 

terms of maintenance and sustainability of investments as well as the supply of 

services to communities.

3.2 Study Objectives 

3.2.1. The study’s main objective is to prepare a project to support the implementation of the 

agricultural sector transformation strategy by developing the value chains of growth-bearing 

agricultural sub-sectors and promoting youth employment in the agriculture and agribusiness 

sectors. The main expected outcomes are to: (i) contribute to Gabon’s food security by achieving 

almost complete self-sufficiency in food products by 2025; (ii) make Gabon a top industrial crop 

product exporting country; and (iii) improve the population’s living conditions by promoting 

profitable and job-creating agriculture for young people.  

3.2.2. More specifically, the consultant will be required to:  

 Identify, among the programmes/projects/actions set out in the Agricultural sector 

Development Plan and the Green Gabon Operational Plan, those to be implemented 

in close cooperation with the ministries and institutions responsible for those 

projects 

 Prepare an Agricultural Transformation Strategy Support Project with its 

geographic scope, logical framework, components/activities, institutional set-up, 

cost, financing plan and support measures. This project will have two 

complementary components: (i) development of the value chains of the growth-

bearing sectors – PASTA; and (ii) promotion of youth entrepreneurship in the 

agriculture and agribusiness sectors - PEJA 

 Formulate a programme to identify actions to provide support to the ministries and 

institutions responsible for implementing PASTA-PEJA  

 Prepare detailed designs (DD) for social and economic infrastructure as well as 

support infrastructure for the sectors selected under PASTA-PEJA, the economic 

study and Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (EIES) of the support 

project; establish the baseline situation, set up the monitoring/evaluation system, 

prepare the administrative, accounting and financial procedures manual and 

establish the PASTA-PEJA accounting system 

 Prepare the project baseline situation as well as the administrative, accounting and 

financial procedures manual, and establish an accounts management system as well 

as a PASTA-PEJA communication and sensitization plan, etc. 

The study’s goal is to provide the project owner with all the required elements with which to assess 

the feasibility and appropriateness of financing the project.  

3.3. Project Schedule and Duration 

The study will be conducted eight (8) months and will comprise two main phases:  

 The first phase of four (4) months, which will entail the installation of the consulting 
firm, procurement of the necessary equipment for the Study Coordination Unit 

(SCU), preparation and sharing of its intervention strategy with the Steering 

Committee (SC) and the Bank. Thereafter, comprehensive sector reviews and an 

overview of the implementation status of the agricultural sector development 

strategy will be carried out. This phase will identify all the measures and 

projects/programmes not yet implemented and which could be incorporated in 

PASTA-PEJA. It will be based on criteria to be prepared with the objective of 

developing growth-bearing agricultural subsectors and promoting agricultural 

agribusiness entrepreneurship among young people.  Through a participatory 



 

XII 

 

process, this phase will address all the concerns of the different stakeholders and 

specific problems relating to gender, poverty, the environmental as well as the 

socio-economic situation. All the preparatory/intermediate analyses and studies to 

be carried out during this phase will help to determine the strategic directions of the 

support project to be presented at a national validation seminar, which will 

consolidate the participatory process and mobilize all stakeholders in the 

implementation of PASTA-PEJA. 

 The second phase will be implemented over a 4-month period and will consist of 
assessing the technical, financial, socio-economic and environmental feasibility of 

PASTA-PEJA. This phase will culminate in the presentation of the following 

provisional documents: (i) the PASTA- PEJA feasibility studies, (ii) the DD of the 

infrastructure to be established; and (iii) the project environmental and social 

impact assessment (ESIA), which will be examined at a second national seminar. 

The observations made at this seminar will be taken into consideration by the 

consultant in the final version of the report. At the end of this phase, it will also be 

necessary to prepare the project’s management, in particular by: (i) establishing the 

baseline situation and the monitoring/evaluation system; and (ii) preparing the 

administrative, accounting and financial procedures manual as well as the PASTA-

PEJA accounting system. 

IV. Detailed Description of the Study Content 

4.1 The PASTA-PEJA study will be structured around four components. The first component 

proposes support to the Agricultural Transformation Strategy (PASTA), by drawing on a 

comprehensive inventory of the analyses and studies already carried out. The aim of this 

component is to design a sub-project that will contribute to the transformation of Gabon’s 

agriculture by promoting growth-bearing sub-sectors that will diversify its economy (both in the 

case of essential basic products and agro-industrial products), by specifically focusing on the 

promotion of value chains and operationalization of the multiservice hub concept developed by 

the Government for wealth creation. The operation’s objectives are in line with the Bank’s High-

5 priorities, which aim to feed Africa by 2025 and improve the quality of life of the people of 

Africa. They are closely aligned on the post-Dakar strategic directions, namely to: (i) obtain new 

private sector investments in agriculture; (ii) develop solid value chains for key basic products; 

(iii) improve farmers’ access to agricultural inputs; (iv) develop youth employment in agriculture; 

and (vi) transform the education and training system into a development tool that will provide 

training in trades that meet the economy’s needs. Therefore, the formulation of the support project 

will incorporate key elements linked particularly to: (a) capacity building for public, private and 

community institutions in the sector; (b) the development of facilitating infrastructure, both 

material (tracks, markets, warehouses, drinking water supply and sanitation, training structures 

and agricultural support services, etc.) and immaterial (in particular, ICT, which may have positive 

impacts); (c) the promotion of public-private partnerships; (d) the promotion of vocational 

integration and youth entrepreneurship to revive agricultural activities and create a new class of 

professional agricultural entrepreneurs; and (d) improvement of sector governance, etc. The 

preparation of PASTA will contribute to the identification and prioritization of key actions to be 

included in the project, which will help to transform Gabon’s agriculture. It will be necessary to: 

 Review the ongoing reforms and initiatives or those planned under the Green Gabon 
Plan  

 Conduct studies on the value chains of sub-sectors among those identified and 
prioritized in the Green Gabon Operational Plan following justification of their 

selection 



 

XIII 

 

 Identify catalytic projects/actions that could support the transformation of Gabon’s 
agriculture and that will constitute the substance of PASTA. 

 Formulate the PASTA project in accordance with three guiding principles: adopt 

an integrated upstream-downstream sector approach for growth-bearing sectors 

mutually agreed upon with the Government, apply a project-based approach, i.e. all 

the proposed actions will be formulated as projects that will contribute to the 

achievement of mutually pre-determined objectives to boost entrepreneurship and 

ensure pragmatic and effective public action. The Government’s intervention that 

will be supported by PASTA will create an incentive and enabling environment for 

the development of the sub-sectors slated for promotion.  Its intervention will focus 

on the following areas: (i) organization of farmers; (ii) structuring of relationships 

between the different operators, from production to placing on the market; (iii) 

financing of value chain actors; (iv) regional development; (v) agricultural research 

and development, training and guidance; (vi) availability of inputs and 

mechanization; (vii) enhancement of production (conservation, processing and 

marketing); (viii) rural development; and (ix) multiservice hubs. It will also aim to 

provide incentives to private investment and offer impetus to youth 

entrepreneurship in the selected sub-sectors, where they will play a key role as the 

main actors for the development of productive agriculture: improvement of yields, 

participation in financing of equipment, provision of services, etc. 

4.2. The second component will be specifically dedicated to agricultural entrepreneurship 

(PEJA) though an operational sub-project aimed at fostering the integration of young people in the 

agricultural sector in the broad sense (18-40 age group). The promotion of youth entrepreneurship 

in the agricultural sector and agribusiness (PEJA) will be achieved by an operational sub-project 

underpinning PASTA and aimed at fostering the integration of young people in the different 

segments of the value chains of the sub-sectors promoted.   Its purpose is to promote the sector’s 

modernization and transformation through the different links of the value chains, by fostering 

employment and curbing rural-urban migration. In particular, it will be necessary to: (i) select 

young rural and urban dwellers with or without degrees but highly motivated to benefit from the 

programmes; (ii) build their skills (technical, managerial and marketing, etc.), depending on their 

profiles and vocation, through targeted training course, simulations and incubator modules; (iii) 

help them to set up shop (preparation of business plans, facilitation of access to funding, individual 

support, etc.); and (iv) monitor implementation. Preparation of this study will also help to establish 

a cohesive intervention framework that reflects best practice and is able to smoothly guide future 

actions in the area of agricultural entrepreneurship involving young people. 

4.3. The study’s third component will involve designing institutional support for ministries 

and related institutions to enable them to monitor the activities being carried out under good 

conditions and to develop certain strategic aspects while building capacity and adopting an 

inclusive approach.  

4.4.  The final component will concern the project management modalities: it will be necessary 

to: (i) propose an institutional and coordination mechanism for PASTA-PEJA activities; (ii) 

prepare an administrative, accounting and financial procedures manual and establish a PASTA-

PEJA accounts management system; (iii) establish a communication and sensitization plan; and 

(iv) establish a baseline situation and a monitoring/evaluation system.  

4.5.  Component 1: Study on PASTA Sub-Project 

4.5.1.  Approach for PASTA formulation: To assess all the actions to be implemented, a 

comprehensive study will be conducted taking into account the different challenges. The 

consultant will use all the existing strategic and analytical documents, in particular the PSGE, the 

Green Gabon Operational Plan 2025, the National Employment Policy, the Social Pact, the 



 

XIV 

 

National Industrialization Strategy, TFP reports on the agricultural sector, the report on the 

agricultural development strategy study, the PNIASAN, the legal texts governing the agricultural 

sector, status reports of the different ministries responsible for implementing the Green Gabon 

Plan, and any other document relating to the subject and deemed useful by the consultant. The 

main objectives of this review will be to: 

 Examine the ongoing reforms or those planned under the Green Gabon Project,  

 Conduct studies on the value chains of subsectors among those identified and 
prioritized in the Green Gabon Operational Plan following justification of their 

selection.  

 Identify catalytic projects/actions that might support the transformation of Gabon’s 

agriculture and which would constitute the substance of PASTA. 

 Formulate the PASTA project in accordance with three guiding principles: adopt 
an integrated upstream-downstream sector approach for growth-bearing sectors 

mutually agreed upon with the Government, apply a project-based approach, i.e. all 

the proposed actions will be formulated as projects that will contribute to the 

achievement of mutually pre-determined objectives to boost entrepreneurship and 

ensure pragmatic and effective public action. Government’s intervention supported 

by PASTA will create an incentive and enabling environment for the development 

of the sub-sectors slated for promotion.  Its intervention will focus on the following 

areas: (i) organization of farmers; (ii) structuring of relationships between the 

different operators from production to placing on the market; (iii) financing of value 

chain actors; (iv) regional development; (v) agricultural research and development, 

training and guidance; (vi) availability of inputs and mechanization; (vii) 

enhancement of production (conservation, processing and marketing); (viii) rural 

development, and (ix) multiservice hubs. It will also aim to provide incentives to 

private investment and offer impetus to youth entrepreneurship in the selected sub-

sectors, where they will play a key role as the main actors for the development of 

productive agriculture: improvement of yields, participation in equipment 

financing, provision of services, etc. 

4.5.2.  Phase 1: Diagnosis and Guidelines 

4.5.2.1. Analysis of the institutional framework: Several sector policy, strategy and reform 

documents have been prepared and implemented over the past two to three years. The agriculture 

and agri-business sector is particularly targeted by the reforms, which implies major institutional 

procedural changes. The consultant shall review the strategies formulated in recent years and the 

reforms announced by the Government. It shall review the status and degree of implementation of 

these reforms, particularly concerning the improvement of sector governance (legal framework, 

restructuring of ministries and agencies linked to the project, regional development, allocation of 

land, etc.), capacity building and basic infrastructure. It will identify the major functions that are 

not yet adequately covered and factors impeding the development of value chains of the 

agricultural and agri-business sub-sectors. Special attention will be paid to institutional support 

programmes being prepared in these areas with the TFPs. 

4.5.2.2.  Identification and analysis of sub-sectors to be covered under PASTA and updating 

of their studies by adopting the value chain approach. The value chain concept is an economic, 

institutional system focused on the execution of actions. Application of the value chain concept is 

of particular interest in identifying business opportunities at the macroeconomic level that explain 

the organic relationship between developing value chains and improving youth employability in 

the agriculture and agribusiness sector. For each sub-sector selected, the value chain studies and 

analyses will mainly comprise: 



 

XV 

 

i.  Identification of the value chains to be promoted: it will be necessary to demarcate 

the value chain, select the products, and analyse the context, constraints and 

opportunities.  A number of criteria should be taken into account through 

opportunity analyses. A growth and competitiveness matrix 

(supply/demand/market trends) /poverty reduction (number of 

producers/processors/ traders) / factors of success (availability of technologies and 

synergy with other programmes) will be produced for each target product obtained 

from a value chain, then prioritization and selection will be carried out in 

consultation with the stakeholders. Thereafter, the sub-sector will be selected 

following a review of existing studies and working sessions, aided by comparative 

tables (market opportunity and likely outcome in terms of poverty reduction). 

 

ii.  Preparation of the mapping of the key actors in the value chain and their 

characteristics (strengths and weaknesses), starting with suppliers of inputs, 

producers, transporters, traders, processors, final distributors and other service 

providers at different levels of the chain. A description of the value chain with links 

in terms of flows between all the key actors is expected as the starting point for the 

analysis.  

iii.  Collection and analysis of data on costs, prices and size of flows at all levels of the 

chain. This stage will identify the different types of costs, the value added structure 

along the chain, supply of inputs and final distribution / marketing of products 

processed based on predetermined criteria (export and/or import parity), value chain 

performance, competitive advantages/disadvantages of the sub-sector under 

review.  

iv.  Description of the constraints and opportunities encountered by the key actors in 

each value chain. This should include a detailed description of the main problems, 

constraints and opportunities encountered at each link of the chain, including 

political and institutional issues affecting the performance of the value chain and 

trade barriers (tariff and non-tariff), etc. 

v.  An estimation of the demand for each product in the sub-sector on the national, 

regional and international market through consultation with actors and the statistical 

review.  

vi.  Consultations with sub-sector actors as well as with all the stakeholders concerned.  

vii.  The formulation of specific recommendations on what must be done to promote the 

performance of each value chain in order to improve the volume, quality and value 

of trade.  

viii.  The proposal of a plan to develop the sub-sector and build the capacity of the value 

chain actors, with an indication of the areas of concentration of production, demand 

and areas targeted for the development of agribusiness. 

4.5.2.3. PASTA main thrusts: Based on the previous analyses (sector analysis of the institutional 

framework and justified identification of the sub-sectors to be supported), the consultant, in close 

consultation with the ministries and institutions involved, will define PASTA’s outline and main 

thrusts. The findings of the diagnosis and the main thrusts of the project will be the subject of a 

validation and sharing workshop with the stakeholders and the steering committee. 

 

 



 

XVI 

 

4.5.3. Phase 2: Project Formulation  

4.5.3.1. Following this diagnosis, and based on the recommendations of the validation workshop 

and additional analyses carried out, PATA will be formulated to focus on key actions that are 

necessary to activate the triggers. The project will target priority actions in terms of reforms and 

flagship operations. The main focal areas for PASTA’s formulation will be value chains, private 

sector promotion and agricultural entrepreneurship. This project will be fully consistent with the 

Green Gabon Operational Plan, while developing specific actions with an effective contribution 

to the development of the value chains of promising sub-sectors identified. This phase of the study 

will propose and prioritize different types of measures (regulatory, institutional, operational, 

technical, financial, etc.) capable of achieving the transformation. It will include key elements 

linked in particular to capacity building of public, private and community institutions in the sector, 

and to infrastructure development.  

4.5.3.2. The Consultant will also review the activity coordination mechanisms aimed at 

accelerating the transformation process, and at closer alignment of the activities and investments 

of the different actors in this direction. A synergy and complementarity framework will be 

prepared to ensure effective implementation based on the different projects and programmes that 

are ongoing or being planned from national funds and with TFP support. In this approach, it will 

also be necessary to ensure that the transformation process meets the many needs of Gabon’s 

population by giving the expected priority to inclusion, sustainability and appropriate nutrition. 

Furthermore, the programme’s formulation will reflect lessons learned from the PSGE. The 

priority actions will then have to be characterized and quantified, including detailed operation 

sheets, which facilitate the selection of those that could, if required, be retained in the context of 

PASTA’s implementation.  

4.5.3.3. Lastly, the consultant will formulate the Agricultural Transformation Strategy Support 

Project (PASTA) and prepare: (i) its technical, economic, institutional and environmental 

feasibility study; (ii) the DD of infrastructure to be created; and (iii) the project Environmental and 

Social Impact Assessment (EIES). The operations will be organized in three (3) parts: (A) 

PASTA’s presentation and rationale; (B) Project Description; and (C) Project feasibility. 

A. PASTA Presentation and Rationale 

A description will be given of the PASTA project, its qualitative and quantitative objectives, its 

targeted sub-sectors, its areas of intervention and its beneficiaries, its components/activities, the 

implementation procedures, its cost and financing plan and its performance indicators. A PASTA 

logical framework will be prepared (results chains, performance indicators, and means of 

verification, risk and mitigation measures.  

B. Project Description 

The integrated subsector approach assumes the project’s intervention at all levels of the links in 

the value chain of a targeted subsector. By making use of the studies on the value chains of the 

targeted subsectors, it will be necessary to identify, describe and quantify the project’s intervention 

at the level of the following components:  

 Regional development: identify, describe and give the scope of project 
interventions in relation to the contribution to regional development of the 

subsectors retained. 

 Research and development, training and agricultural guidance: support the different 
actors of the targeted value chains by providing efficient and accessible services at 

the following levels: research and development, training of entrepreneurs and 

specialized labour and agricultural extension and guidance. The aim of this part is 



 

XVII 

 

to build the capacity of the technical services of Ministries responsible for 

Agriculture, Fisheries and Livestock as well as agricultural vocational training. It 

will be necessary to propose comprehensive solutions in terms of availability and 

operationalisation of workspaces and equipment of Ministerial Department services 

to meet PASTA needs.  

 Enhancement of production: Define the project’s contribution to production value-
added through conservation, processing, marketing, certification, branding, etc., 

including the establishment of collection, processing, storage and marketing 

facilities retained under the PASTA programme.  

 Rural Development: it will be necessary to define, justify (number of beneficiaries) 
and characterize basic public infrastructure to be established in the areas of 

concentrations targeted by the PASTA project: (i) roads and rural feeder roaders to 

be improved; (ii) infrastructure and facilities for the generation of electricity and 

production of water; and (iii) health centres and schools, etc. 

 Development of multi-service hubs: to be established to facilitate the countrywide 
development of agricultural activities. These are service centres for farmers. The 

proposed services are organized based on distinct components: agricultural 

guidance; inputs and multiplication of the material; collection, conservation, 

processing and marketing of agricultural products, administrative support to 

farmers and mechanization workshops. The consultant will be required to identify 

and design the hubs that will be necessary for the development of the targeted 

subsectors. 

 Organization of value chain link actors: (i) organization of farmers (horizontal 
integration); (ii) structuring of the relationships among the different operators from 

production to placing on the market (vertical integration).  

 Supporting incentive measures: proposed to accelerate investments in the sector 
(fiscal, administrative, regulatory) and remove the main constraints identified: (i) 

measures to implement a law that will foster the development of the agricultural 

and agribusiness sectors to be developed; (ii) funding of value chain actors (through 

banks and the MFI); and (iii) administrative procedures (tax regime…) and easing 

of the business environment to strengthen the competiveness of sub-sectors. 

For each component, it will be necessary to define, identify and design all PASTA interventions 

and the implementation modalities for the subsectors retained in order to develop and enhance 

project interventions that are consistent with the Green Gabon Plan. 

4.6.  Component 2: Study on Sub-Project to Promote Youth Entrepreneurship in 

 Agriculture and Agribusiness (PEJA) 

4.6.1. The project to promote youth entrepreneurship in agriculture and agribusiness will take 

into account the following two major Government concerns: (i) the need to begin the sustainable 

transformation of the rural environment by developing profitable and competitive activities that 

will attract economic operators, including young people, and (ii) the urgent need to help to reduce 

unemployment by interesting these young people in profitable economic activities in the 

agricultural sector. In accordance with the strategic directions of the PSGE (2015-2025) and the 

Human Capital Strategy (2014-2018), the project will adopt a specific approach for young people 

in the agricultural sector in order to facilitate their integration into the different segments of the 

value chains. This framework should lead to the emergence of modern agricultural, agro-industrial 

and service enterprises fostered by improved access to financing and equipment (mechanization 

and processing), development of productive, processing and marketing infrastructure to be rolled 

out under PASTA. 



 

XVIII 

 

4.6.2. Approach for the formulation of PEJA: The project preparation activities will concern 

several services in the areas of data collection and certain targeted analytical interviews to more 

accurately identify the problems relating to the topic of “agricultural entrepreneurship/youth 

employment”. Also taken into consideration in this reflection will be the diversity of the potential 

target public: rural and urban, graduate or non-graduate, in-or-out-of-school, agriculture or other 

sectors, individuals or groups, women and men, etc. Particularly, it will be necessary to review the 

most appropriate operational mechanisms for the different categories of actors by taking into 

account and trying to develop all the existing structures, including coaching and training structures. 

Preparation of this component will provide an opportunity to review the different models already 

tried and tested as well as experience gained at the national level and in other countries, and to 

define the most efficient operating methods, taking into account the diversity of the targets and 

opportunities to increase absorption and enhance attractiveness. This will also facilitate the 

establishment of a cohesive intervention framework that reflects best practice and is able to more 

smoothly guide future actions of partners in the area in terms of transformation of the sector and 

value chains. The results of the studies and reflection will ultimately facilitate the project design 

and preparation, which can be financed from resources planned in the ongoing CSP, while 

specifying the implementation conditions. In this context, an inclusive approach will be adopted 
that will encourage the participation of local communities and the technical services concerned by 

youth employment.  

4.6.3.  Standard Model: in this analytical and formulation exercise, projects that are ongoing 

or under preparation will also deserve special attention in terms of possible capitalization and 

synergy. The “agripreneur” model developed by the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture 

(IITA) could also serve as a guide in the formulation of the project, while taking into account the 

specificities of Gabon and the existing structures. The initial phase of this project consists in 

providing support to the development of local economic initiatives for young people by improving 

the supply of non-financial services provided by local service providers or incubator structures. In 

particular, this phase prioritizes: (i) facilitation of the emergence of new ideas on business 

ventures; (ii) training of young people in business incubation centres, in the fields of agribusiness, 

production, marketing, processing and management; and (iii) support for the creation of new 

companies as well as for the preparation of business plans. The second phase aims to put in place 

a financial mechanism to facilitate the establishment of SMEs and the provision of financial 

support to them in order to limit the obstacles that hamper the development of such businesses. 

This appropriate financial mechanism involves associating local financing institutions to support 

young graduates to set up business.  

4.6.4.  Phase 1: It will be necessary to conduct all the preparatory studies required for PEJA’s 

formulations. This phase is sub-divided into five sections: 

4.6.4.1.  Section 1: Identification and analysis of the labour market and opportunities in 

growth-bearing sub-sectors. This section of the study aims to capitalize on the analysis of all the 

factors (agriculture, stockbreeding, fisheries, environment, forestry etc.), subsectors and related 

value chains, carried out under PASTA, to identify areas that provide more opportunities and 

greater contributory capacity to the agricultural sector’s transformation, jobs and GDP. After 

outlining the youth employment situation, in general, and the prospects provided by the 

agricultural sector’s transformations, in particular, the study will address the following points: (i) 

identification of potential, markets (local, national, regional and external) and other employment 

generating niches; (ii) analysis of the organizations and profitability of the different subsectors and 

value chain links, and their development prospects; (iii) promotion of access to technologies and 

innovations aimed at improving productivity in the subsectors with a special focus on the possible 

use of ICT in the agricultural value chains; (iv) identifications of opportunities and promising 

trades in the agricultural subsectors, consistent with the required level of modernization; (v) 

identification of income generating activities that could be professionalized and in time provide 

sustainable activities, etc. The consultant may be required to map the employment opportunities, 

while taking into account local and regional specificities and potential. 



 

XIX 

 

4.6.4.2. The review of job opportunities for young people (women and men) will concern the 

different agricultural subsectors and all the value chains identified and supported by the PASTA 

study, as well as the requirements of the major projects initiated such as the GRAINE project. The 

following are examples of the different potential niches and trades that should be taken into 

account and considered: agribusiness, processing, marketing and sale of products; provision of 

services, linking of actors, agricultural mechanization; sale of products, supply of inputs, supply 

of equipment; development of agricultural areas, establishment of market garden, tree-growing, 

poultry, fish farms; small-scale stock breeding, innovative stockbreeding, beef and dairy cattle 

breeding, milk processing, etc. The analysis of opportunities will take into account the existing 

situations and the processes already triggered at the individual and collective level that could be 

further professionalized. The consultant will make use of all existing documentation: strategy 

papers, subsector studies, thematic studies, project documents, etc. It will also meet with the 

different categories of young people concerned and all the structures connected with the 

agricultural sector, employment, SME/SMI promotion, etc.   In his/her analysis, the consultant will 

disaggregate data by gender to the extent possible by specifically identifying opportunities 

available to women. 

4.6.4.3. Section 2: Modalities and criteria for the selection of young people. It will be 

necessary to define the conditions of access by young people to the entrepreneurship promotion 

mechanisms to be established as well as the selection criteria and methods to be developed and 

applied. This issue is fundamental and constitutes a critical stage for ensuring that candidates have 

the required capacity and commitment to engage fully in entrepreneurship and the creation of self-

employment. Care must also be taken not to recruit people who are opportunists, attracted by 

possible near-term benefits but who lack the real spirit and will sought. The consultant will define 

all the criteria to be taken into consideration, including those linked to profiles, skills, 

qualifications and experience. It will also be required to take gender parity into account. 

Furthermore, the selection modalities should take into consideration the possibility of providing 

rural dwellers with the same opportunities of access to the programme. Therefore, the criteria could 

be differentiated by target categories. Therefore, the consultant will define all the necessary 

measures to provide a non-exclusive method of selection. Special attention will be paid to rural 

youths who represent a major segment of potential applicants. The profile “graduate of an 

agricultural training establishment” will also be closely considered with a view to enhancing the 

sector’s professionalization from an environmental standpoint and directly linked to the necessary 

its modernization. 

4.6.4.4. Section 3: Mechanisms and modalities for building young people’s skills. This section 

of the study will comprise a diagnostic review of agricultural training programmes and strategies. 

It also aims to assess the technical and physical capacity of the various existing training institutes 

and centres, to meet the developers’ skill building requirements. It will focus on: (i) an analysis of 

training supply to meet the demand of potential developers; (ii) assessment of the necessary 

infrastructure capacity to properly oversee the developers; (iii) analysis of existing capacity 

building and youth integration mechanisms; (iv) definition of a skills building approach for 

potential developers; (v) the feasibility of establishing agricultural business incubators and related 

conditions, (vi) the possibility of simulations in existing structures (enterprises, companies, 

groups, etc.). It is also necessary to ensure that existing training facilities that could be mobilized 

will still be able to provide their usual services. The study will propose the most appropriate 

training and incubation mechanisms to meet the diversified needs identified. Particular attention 

will be paid to the preparation of business plans and the related market studies as well as marketing 

corporate management and the use of new technologies. The reflection will also include the role 

that could be played by the existing agricultural extension services and building their capacity. 

Details will be provided on possible operating methods (location, actors, duration, costs, etc.). 

4.6.4.5. Section 4: Mechanisms for Financing Developers. It will be necessary to prepare 

financing that can support youth and women’s initiatives in various forms, taking into account the 

targeted profiles and activities. The consultant will be required to identify the financing 



 

XX 

 

mechanisms (including innovative ones) that will guarantee sustainable access by the beneficiaries 

to financing by local financial institutions. The study will explore the following aspects: (i) 

identification of financial institutions that provide or could provide support to developers in the 

value chains; (ii) analysis of existing supply of financial services and products, analysis of credit 

granting modalities, a comparative analysis of financing mechanisms; (iii) identification of 

existing funds and financial institutions that could support these mechanisms; (iv) identification 

of developers’ strategy and obstacles to access to financing; (v) proposal of one or more adapted 

and innovative financing mechanisms, according to category of actors; (vi) characterization and 

comparative advantages of possible operating methods; (vii) definition of eligibility criteria and 

access to financing for project sponsors, in accordance with the targeted categories, etc. The 

consultant will meet with the different local financial institutions and together with them identify 

possible measures to support potential partners to ensure the sustainability of the proposed 

financing mechanism. It will draw on the existing analyses and will explore opportunities for 

sponsoring by certain private firms. 

4.6.4.6. Section 5: Installation and support to promoters. This section of the study will 

examine the conditions that will provide optimal support to promoters to enable them to establish 

and start-up their activities under optimal conditions. This stage is critical to provide initial security 

for the activity and facilitate the necessary adjustments. The consultant will analyse the post-

incubation support mechanisms and will propose a cohesive approach that will guarantee the 

operation’s sustainability. It will also consider some possible forms of start-up support in terms of 

access to land, supply of inputs, assistance in the form of equipment, establishment of 

infrastructure, organizational structuring, etc. Furthermore, it will define the conditions for 

monitoring and overseeing developers in the initial stages of their activities to be able to guide 

them and, if necessary, readjust certain approaches. It will explore the possibility of mobilizing 

and boosting the existing advisory-support and extension mechanisms. The possible use of 

experienced personnel and/or leaders well established locally will also be considered. 

4.6.5. Phase 2. Formulation of PEJA: The conclusions of the different preliminary studies 

along with consideration of the different experiences in the area, including work carried out by 

IITA, will be used to support the project’s formulation. Therefore, a project preparation report will 

be prepared based on the analysis of all possible options and by proposing the most appropriate 

scenarios and alternatives that will be backed up by arguments. A quantified estimation of the 

different targets will be proposed at the same time as the preparation of the logical framework and 

definition of the key indicators. At this stage, it will be necessary to specify the number of 

businesses to be created, the potential number of expected jobs, anticipated potential revenue, the 

target distribution by zones/sectors/gender, etc.  The proposed project components and activities 

will be described and the implementation conditions specified.  As already pointed out, the project 

design should capitalize on experience from within the country and take into account lessons 

learned from other operators in the sector and ongoing initiatives for the promotion of youth and 

women’s employment.  To make optimal use of the resources provided, synergies and 

complementarities will be sought with ongoing projects and initiatives.  The consultant will set 

out the project’s expected benefits (social, economic, etc.) and identify the risks and mitigation 

measures to take into account.  

4.7. Component 3: Building the capacity of State-owned institutions responsible for 

project monitoring and implementation 

It will be necessary to provide institutional support to the ministries and related institutions to 

enable them to adequately monitor the activities being carried and to develop certain strategic 

aspects while building capacity and adopting an inclusive approach. The necessary measures and 

procurements shall be listed with their corresponding costs.  

 



 

XXI 

 

4.8. Component 4: PASTA-PEJA Project Management 

 Project coordination mechanism: the consultant will propose an adequate 
institutional mechanism, including project coordination and steering mechanisms. 

These proposals should take into account PASTA-PEJA’s multidisciplinary 

character and the need to involve all the ministries and stakeholders, while 

guaranteeing the mechanism’s operational effectiveness. 

 Administrative accounting and financial management: the consultant will 

define the most appropriate procurement and management methods in accordance 

with the Bank’s Rules and Procedures. Thus, to prepare the procedures manual that 

will be used for both the study and project to be prepared, the consultant will work
