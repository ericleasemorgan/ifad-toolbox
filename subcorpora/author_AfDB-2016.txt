Project Summary  

1 Project Overview  

1.1 The Malawi Agricultural Infrastructure and Youth in Agribusiness Project (AIYAP) is to 

deploy irrigation infrastructure as an enabler and facilitator to address the twin problems of food 

insecurity and high rate of youth unemployment within the context of 2011-2016 Malawi Growth and 

Development Strategy (MGDS) which identifies agriculture and food security, irrigation and green belt 

initiatives as drivers of economic growth. Malawi’s agriculture sector is highly vulnerable to the adverse 

impacts of climate change and extreme weather events, such as dry spells, droughts and floods. The 

sector is also characterized by low level of irrigation development, and low uptake of improved farm 

inputs. In addition, low profitability of smallholder agriculture is influenced by weak links to profitable 

markets which make value addition seemingly impossible because of lack of information between the 

farmers and the processors, high transport costs, weak farmer organizations, poor quality control, lack 

of market information, as well as limited participation of the youth in agricultural development and 

businesses. The proposed project, will develop two large scale irrigation schemes at Linga (Nkhata-

Bay) and Dwambazi (Nkhotakota) covering 1945 hectares, targeting 10,000 beneficiaries with special 

focus on the youth (about 50%). The project is to use irrigation infrastructure as an enabler to scale up 

the production of maize, rice, sugar and horticulture production and value chain in project areas in 

particular and Malawi in general.  

 

1.2 The project apart from mitigating the challenges arising from dependency on rain-fed production 

will also promote youth ownership of agribusiness, access to funding/credit through seed funds, loan 

facilities and risk sharing from Micro Finance Institutions, agro -processing, engaging in value addition, 

modern methods of crop diversification and market linkages. Socially, the project by introducing youth 

skill acquisition, entrepreneurship development and job creation will address social vices such abuse, 

prostitution, violent crime etc. In addition, the project will also reduce rural and urban migration as well 

as cross border migration of youth in the targeted areas. It is estimated that within four and half years 

the project will produce 500 Agripreneurs, train about 100 artisans for the maintenance of irrigation 

infrastructure, launching 175 new agribusinesses and employing about 4600 additional persons, 

including out-growers. It is expected that at least 50% of the beneficiaries will be female.  

 

1.3 The project has four components namely (i.) Irrigation Infrastructure & Watershed Management, 

(ii.) Youth Entrepreneurship, market linkages, agro-processing and Value Addition (iii.) Agro-

Cooperative Development and Enhancement and (iv) Project Management and Institutions 

Strengthening.  

2 Needs Assessment:  

The need for the Project is justified by the priorities in the Malawi Growth and Development Strategies 

II (MGDS II: 2011-2016) which emphasizes on agriculture, food security, irrigation and water 

development.  As a consequence, there is an urgent need for transformation of the agriculture sector to 

enhance sustainable growth and break the cycle of food insecurity as espoused in the National Export 

Strategy, 2015 Irrigation Master Plan and Investment Framework and the draft National Irrigation 

Policy, Green Belt Initiative and the National Agriculture Policy focusing on commercialization of 

agriculture.    In addition, the 2013-2018 Malawi National Export Strategy, identifies agriculture value 

chains driven by private operators including smallholder farmers, youth entrepreneurs, women’s 

groups, MSMEs and large businesses to boost and diversify exports in order to improve Malawi’s 

growth prospects as the bedrock of the economy. The Project is a direct response to GoM’s desire to 

enhance agricultural productivity by promoting irrigated agriculture and dynamize the sector through 

active youth participation in agribusiness for job creation in order to meet the objectives of these 

policies.

3 Cost and Financing   

The project total cost of AIYAP is estimated at $US27.50 million (UA19.36million), to be financed by 

the Bank UA16 million ADF loan, EU €2 million grant (parallel financing) about  UA 1.6 million and 

Government contribution in kind estimated at UA1.7 million.   

4 Implementation  

The project will have a PIU which staff will be externally recruited through a competitive process and 

serve on full time basis. The project will recruit competitively a Technical Adviser (TA)   at the 

commencement of implementation ENABLE YOUTH sub-component of the project. The TA will work 

with the Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources (LUANAR) for one year after which 

LUANAR will take over the full implementation of the component. The PIU will be reporting to the 

Principal Secretary for the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Water Development. There will be a 

Technical Committee comprising Directors of relevant Departments to assist with the implementation. 

The composition of the Committee will be determined by the Government. The Technical Committee 

will report to the Project Steering Committee chaired by PS MoAIWD which will approve the work 

plans and budgets and guide the project on policy matters.  

5 Bank’s Added Value  

The Bank’s intervention in this project will add significant value to the investments already made in 

agriculture and irrigation projects by the Government of Malawi, the Bank and other development 

partners. It will give impetus and acts as boost to the efforts/programmes of the GoM in youth 

development through entrepreneurship in agriculture value chains and agribusiness. The project is in 

line with the TYS 2013-2022 which focusses on inclusive growth and transitioning to green growth. 

The project focus on youth unemployment through skills development and entrepreneurship in is line 

with the TYS. Finally, the Bank’s intervention has the multiplier effect on economic development 

through infrastructure development and private sector development in line with the Malawi Country 

Strategy 2013-2017 and is aligned to three of the five pillars of Bank’s ‘High 5’ i.e. Feed Africa, 

Industrialise Africa, and Improved livelihood. 

6 Knowledge Management  

The knowledge gained through the implementation of several projects and studies in the sector in 

Malawi has been duly applied in designing this project. In the same pattern, the knowledge that will be 

generated by this Project will contribute significantly to the design and implementation of agricultural 

interventions within the Agriculture Sector Wide Approach (ASWAp) arrangement and build the 

capacity of the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Water Development (MAIWD) and other 

Ministries particularly the Ministries of Labour, Youth and Manpower Development, and Trade and 

Industries. Consequently, useful information will be generated for similar future interventions. AIYAP 

will, in addition to irrigation development, focus on agro-processing and value addition, agriculture 

cooperative development and agribusiness along agriculture value chains as well as building of 

entrepreneurship skills and generations of bankable projects in agriculture value chains which will 

provide lessons in the post-harvest management, processing and marketing of various crops to inform 

project designs of similar projects in the future. The Bank is a key member of the Donor Committee on 

Agriculture and Food Security (DCAFS) and the lessons learnt from this project will be shared with 

other Development Partners through DCAFS platform. ASWAp, through the Bank, will provide 

information generated from AIYAP to key stakeholders for knowledge sharing and coalition building 

through the agriculture sector working group. The results from the various studies and surveys, 

including the socio-economic impact study will inform the stakeholders on how to put the acquired 

knowledge attributes into practical use for better results-oriented achievements and sustained benefit 

flows.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE MANAGEMENT OF THE AFDB GROUP TO THE BOARD OF 

DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF MALAWI FOR AGRICULTURAL 

INFRASTRUCTURE AND YOUTH IN AGRIBUSINESS PROJECT (AIYAP) 
 

Management submits the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed ADF loan of UA16 

million to finance the Malawi Agricultural Infrastructure and Youth in Agribusiness Project.  

 

I STRATEGIC THRUST & RATIONALE 

 

1.1 Project linkages with country strategy and objectives 
 

1.1.1 The Malawi Growth and Development Strategy II. 2011-2016 has identified agriculture, 

irrigation and water development as some of the key priorities and drivers of economic growth and 

poverty alleviation. The Government formulated Agriculture Sector-Wide Approach (ASWAp 2011-

15) as the priority investment plan for the agriculture sector which focusses on (i) food security and risk 

management (ii) commercial agriculture, agro-processing and market development and (iii) sustainable 

land and water management and support services. The Government is implementing a Farm Inputs 

Subsidy Program (FISP) to address the food security problem and developed a National Export Strategy 

to promote crop diversification, value addition and export of agro-based commodities. The National 

Irrigation Policy which is currently at the draft level is aimed at enhancing farmers’ ownership through 

farmer managed irrigation and National Agriculture Policy, whose main objective is to commercialize 

the agriculture sector. In ASWAp, the Government also introduced a Green Belt Initiative (GBI) in 

order to promote irrigation and minimize reliance on rain-fed farming and achieve increased agricultural 

productivity for domestic and international markets. The Government is currently finalising a five year 

National Resilience Plan to break the cycle of food insecurity with irrigation as a key component. 

Regarding youth initiatives, the Government adopted the National Youth Policy in 2013 which 

recognises that the youth represent a vast human resource potential for promoting economic growth and 

if neglected it would be a lost opportunity.   AIYAP will address the twin problems of food insecurity 

and high rate of youth unemployment using irrigation infrastructure as an enabler, which will 

substantially contribute to the achievement of the objectives of these policies and strategies.  

 

1.1.2 The project is aligned with the Bank’s 2013-17 Country Strategy Papers (CSP) Pillars focusing 

on (i) addressing infrastructure bottlenecks to competitiveness and growth and (ii) supporting actions to 

expand private sector investments. While the former covers irrigation infrastructure development and 

agricultural market infrastructures the latter Pillar covers private sector investment and entrepreneurship 

in agro-processing, crop diversification and value chain development which are articulated in AIYAP. 

The country socio-economic indicators are presented in Appendix 2 and it is envisaged that AIYAP will 

contribute to improving these indicators and ultimately achievement of the Sustainable Development 

Goals (SDGs).  

 

1.1.3 Currently, only 26 percent (104,000 hectares) of the potential irrigable area (408,000 hectares) is 

under irrigation. In order to exploit this potential, Government has developed the National Irrigation 

Master Plan and Investment Framework (NIMPIF). The NIMPIF which was published in February 2015 

confirmed that the plan will be implemented in three phases: Phase I (2015-2020), phase II (2021-2025) 

and Phase III (2026-2035) comprising of approximately 20,000 hectares, 28,500 hectares and 67,500 

hectares of new irrigation schemes in Phases I, II and III respectively. The project is part of the Bank’s 

efforts to support the government of Malawi in the implementation of the Irrigation Master Plan given 

that the targeted sites are among the priority sites identified in the Master Plan which objectives are to: 

(1) accelerate economic growth, (2) reduce rural poverty, (3) improve food security, and (4) increase 

exports.  

 

 

 



 

2 

1.2 Rationale for Bank’s involvement  

1.2.1 The Bank’s Ten Year Strategy (TYS) 2013-2022, identify agriculture related infrastructure 

development as a key enabler for increased production, productivity and effective utilization of land 

resources. It also identifies agriculture and food security as an area of special emphasis. The 2016 

Bank’s Agriculture strategy: Feed Africa: Strategy For Agricultural Transformation in Africa 2016-

2025 is targeted at executing the Comprehensive African Agriculture Development Programme 

(CAADP) goals of contributing to elimination of extreme hunger, malnutrition, poverty, and increased 

prosperity, in partnership with alliances including farmers, agribusiness, and civil society, and 

exploiting regional comparative advantages and opportunities for trade and collaboration. The Bank’s 

Gender Strategy 2014-2018 calls for economic empowerment, knowledge and capacity building for 

women.  Furthermore, the Bank’s Fragility strategy “Addressing Fragility and Building Resilience in 

Africa, 2014 – 2019” which aims at effectively assisting countries build resilience to move forward 

towards more stable political and economic development with Youth employment as a special focus, as 

jobs are alternatives to rents or participation in illicit activities associated with fragile situations and 

thus help prevent the outbreak of violence related to critical unemployment.  

 

1.2.2 This project addresses all of the above key Bank strategies and policies as part of broader 

development efforts to achieve sustainable growth and poverty reduction thus, (1)  streamlining of the 

crops along value chains (economic crops) and crops to address food security as well as linking the agri-

prenuers to the value chains, ensuring that sustainable incomes will be achieved for the beneficiaries in 

particular and the country at large, (2)  focusing on youth with special emphasis on targeting women (at 

least 50% of beneficiaries) social and economic empowerment, while protecting the environment 

through various catchment activities, and (3) addressing the objectives of inclusive growth and 

transition to green growth by addressing infrastructure development, private sector development, and 

skills and technology adoption through promotion of irrigation for agriculture intensification and 

diversification.  

 

1.2.3 The project also resonates with three of the five pillars of Bank’s ‘High 5’ by addressing Feed 

Africa, Industrialize Africa, and Improved quality of life for the people of Africa.  At country level, the 

project is aimed at contributing to increase in agricultural exports, import substitution, generation of the 

much needed foreign exchange and job creation especially for the youth.    

 

1.3 Donor coordination 

 
1.3.1 Malawi’s recent progress towards the aid effectiveness agenda under Busan is mixed.  Whilst 

donor alignment with national policies remains strong, the use of the national country system and aid 

on the budget has significantly reduced following suspension of budget support in 2013. 1  Development 

Partners (DPs) are instead channelling the resources earmarked for budget support or basket funding 

through other aid modalities and off budget.2  The GOM is working with DPs to improve aid 

effectiveness guided by the new Development Cooperation Strategy launched late 2014. Successful 

outcome of   on-going PFM reforms will be indispensable in encouraging DPs to increase the use of 

country systems.   The current platform is on the Donor Committee on Agriculture and Food Security 

(DCAFS) as the key form for donor coordination, monitoring of sectoral plans and strategies and 

harmonizing interventions. The Bank is currently chairing the Irrigation Technical Sub-Group.   With 

the provision of Euro 2.00 million EU funding for catchment management in the project, the Bank is 

leveraging on collaboration with other Development Partners in Malawi.   

 

                                                 
1 According to the 2014 Global Partnership Monitoring Surrey, Malawi’s score on the aid on budget aid indicator declined 

from 62 in 2010 to 49 whilst that of use of national country system dropped from 65 to 50. 
2  51 % of planned externally financed development expenditure for FY 2014/15 is off budget.

2.2 Technical Solution retained and alternatives explore  

Table 2.2: project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection or acceptance 

Alternative  Brief description Reasons for rejection/Acceptance 

Alternative 1 

 

Invest in gravity fed irrigation 

system (technical solution 

retained) 

Gravity fed irrigation system have proved to be 

more sustainable in terms of operation and 

maintenance with locally available material, 

requiring minimal training which translates to 

sustainability and profitability of the enterprise. 

Alternative 2 Invest in rain water 

harvesting infrastructure such 

as small water holding 

structures scattered all over 

the selected districts for 

agriculture, livestock and 

domestic use 

Rain water harvesting structures cannot sustain 

the impacts of climate change and their socio-

economic impact will be spread out thinly. In 

addition, it cannot provide food and cash crops 

two to three times a year.  

Alternative 3 Invest in pumped irrigation 

development by lifting water 

mechanically to higher 

ground for crop production 

Pumped irrigation schemes were dropped on 

account of the complex nature of their operation 

and maintenance, costs are high and the capacity 

to maintain at small farm level does not exist. 

Further it contributes to carbon emission.  

Alternative 4 Introduce spate irrigation 

system  

Not sustainable due to variability of rainfall; 

non-efficiency and drudgery. 

 

2.3 Project type 

 
AIYAP is designed in the form of a stand-alone Investment Project with the main aim of supporting 

irrigation infrastructure development (civil works) as an enabler of scaling up of high value crop 

production, value chain development, youth skill development in Agribusiness and capacity building 

activities largely funded by ADF 13 Loan and EU Grant resources. 

2.4 Project Cost and Financing Arrangements 

 
2.4.1 The total project cost, including physical and price contingencies, is UA 19.36 million which 
will be financed by: (i) ADF loan (UA 16.00 million covering cost of infrastructure, purchase of 

vehicles, youth training and provision of seed capital, etc. ), EU Grant (UA 1.60 million to finance 

catchment management) and (iii) the GoM and Beneficiaries (UA 1.76 million), through provision of 

office space and salaries for the counterpart staff on the project on the part of Government and provision 

of labour for maintenance of the irrigation infrastructures on the part of beneficiaries. The resources 

from EU will be made available to the project through parallel financing, since the Department of 

Irrigation will be responsible for the management of the resources using the EU procedures.  

2.4.2  The ADF Loan will be used to finance both local costs and foreign costs. The project will 
finance local costs such as training, personnel and operating costs while most of the activities under 

infrastructure development will attract foreign costs as detailed in the summary tables below. The GoM 

does not have the capacity to finance most of the project activities and has therefore committed to 

contribute to the project in kind through staff and office space. The details are indicated in Tables 2.3, 

2.4, 2.5 and 2.6 below.

2.5. Project’s target area and population: 

2.5.1 Demographic Aspects: According to 2016 data from the Department of Statistics, Malawi has 

an estimated population of nearly 17 million people with women constituting about 51% of the 

population3. The population is characterised as follows: (i) 0 – 10 years (33%); (ii) 10 – 20 years (22%); 

(iii) 20 – 40 years (29%); (iv) 40 – 60 years (10%) and (v) those above 60 years comprise (6%).  The 

districts of Nkhotakota and Nkhata Bay have populations of 229,460 and 164,761 respectively with 

combine total land mass of 8330km² representing 9% of country total land mass of 94,080km² 

(excluding Lake Malawi which covers an area of 24,404km²). The targeted beneficiaries are 10,000 

households estimated at 6 person per household. In the two districts only 1 in 30 women and 1 in 10 

men complete secondary education. However, 1 out of 7 women and 1 out of 9 men are unemployed.  

2.5.2 Location: The project is located mostly in the Green Belt Zone covering a total of 2 Districts of 

Nkhota-kota (Dwambazi) and Nkhata-Bay (Linga) Districts in the Central Region. These Districts were 

selected because they were ranked among the Phase 1 projects in the Malawi National Irrigation Master 

Plan. 

2.5.3 Climate: The climate in Malawi ranges from semi-arid in the Lower Shire Valley, semi-arid to 

sub-humid on the plateaux and sub-humid in the highland areas in the northern parts of the country. 

Average rainfall ranges from 763 mm to 1,143 mm per annum (p.a.) with only a few areas receiving 

over 1500 mm of rain annually. Such areas include Mulanje, Nkhata Bay and the northern end of Lake 

Malawi. Rainfall (almost 90%) occurs between the months of December and March, with no rain at all 

between May to October over most of the country. Mean annual temperatures vary with altitude, ranging 

from 25o C in the Lower Shire Valley to 13o C in the highland areas. 

 

2.5.4 The project area like other parts of Malawi is largely a semi-arid country hence greatly 

threatened by droughts and other negative impacts of climate change. The semi-arid nature of the 

country makes it highly fragile and susceptible to environmental degradation hence sustainable 

management of natural resources is not an option but a priority. The area is also prone to flooding which 

has been accelerated by extensive deforestation and tree cutting in most parts of the country which was 

highly experienced in the 1970s and the 1980s during which time annual deforestation rate was 

estimated at 3.5% per annum. Deforestation was and is still caused by (i) expansion for agriculture; (ii) 

demand for fuelwood for both domestic and other uses including industrial production. Soil erosion 

constitutes one of the major types of land degradation in Nkhotakota and Nkhata-Bay area of Malawi. 

 

 

 

 

                                                 
3 Malawi is largely rural. Despite rapid urbanization, nearly 85 percent of the total population of Malawi lives in rural areas. 



 

8 

2.5.5 Water Resources: Water for the irrigation schemes is supplied from Dwambazi and Mazembe 

rivers. Dwambazi is a perennial river with a minimum monthly flow of 3,305 l/s indicating that the 

water available is more than sufficient for the development of Dwambazi irrigation scheme. Mazembe 

River with a minimum monthly flow of 224 l /s demonstrates the need for a water harvesting structure 

to harness the water required to irrigate the Linga scheme. 

2.6 Participatory process for project identification, design and implementation  

2.6.1 The ESIA:  

2.6.1.1 During the project preparation, extensive public consultations were carried out to determine the 

environmental and social impacts of the project. The consultations were also aimed at identifying the 

key environmental challenges experienced in the project locations as well as project districts. Meetings 

were held with various departmental heads at the Ministry of Agricultural, Irrigation and Water 

Development, Ministry of Trade, Ministry of Gender and Ministry of Labour and Youth Development 

at the ministries’ Headquarters in Lilongwe. Consultative meetings were also held with various heads 

of department at Nkhotakota and Nkhata Bay District Headquarters including with the District 

Commissioner of Nkhata Bay District. Further meetings were held with Dwangwa Cane Growers Trust, 

Dwangwa Cane Growers Company Ltd and Senior Officers of Illovo Sugar Company Ltd. Other 

consultative meetings were held with various community leaders led by Senior Chiefs and their deputies 

together with community members, members and executives of Farmers Associations in Linga (Nkhata 

Bay District) and in Dwambazi (in Nkhotakota District). 

2.6.1.2 The reasons for consultative meetings were: (i) to generate a good understanding of the project 

by all stakeholders within the project area; (ii) to enhance ownership of the project by local leadership, 

the community and local farmers; (iii) to understand people’s and agency expectations about the project; 

(iv) to understand and characterise potential environmental, social and economic impacts of the project; 

(v) to acquire, but also advance local benefits that may accrue from the project; and (vi) to enable 

stakeholders involved in the project to provide views, hence participating in or refining project designs. 

In addition, site-specific investigations were also conducted to gain insight to the likely environmental, 

social, and economic impacts of the project. 

2.6.2 Community Participatory Processes: The community participatory processes were organised 

by the officers from the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Water Development as well as the project 

team during the preparation and appraisal mission. Two town hall meetings at each project location 

were held where a range of issues including among others, project details, land issues, community 

development, choice of cropping, farmers associations –development, formations and operations, etc. 

were discussed and agreed upon. The team, also visited the projects sites and the existing farms on the 

land with a view for getting the understanding of the farmers, listen to their concerns – especially land 

distributions and beneficiaries of youth entrepreneurship, how to address them and incorporate them 

into the project design. Over half of the target population is youth and women who are already active in 

the agriculture sector. Most of the youth also own land that has been inherited or allocated by the 

traditional leaders in line with the customary land acquisition. Consultations also involved all relevant 

sector departments at the district and headquarter levels. The key players included the local 

administration structures spearheaded by the local chiefs headed by two Traditional Authorities, one of 

which is a woman and their assistants and included a significant proportion of the community members 

of which youth and women constituted more than 50%. The Mission met and held discussions with 

major private sector players among which are;  Crown Ministries, Illovo Sugar Company, Farmers 

Engineering Services, Public Private Partnership Commission in Blantyre, the Malawi Chamber of 

Commerce, Industry and Cooperative and Telekom Networks Malawi Limited (TNM) – a mobile 

company quoted on Malawi Stock Exchange. The project team held sessions with Civil Society 

Organisations, and Non-governmental Organisations as well as youth entrepreneurship training 

institutions in Malawi

2.7 Bank Group experience, lessons reflected in project design  

2.7.1 Experiences, challenges and lessons learnt in the implementation from the Bank’s past and 

current agricultural projects in Malawi have been taken into account in the design of the current project. 

These include the need for proper project orientation, emphasis on farmer group approach, strong M&E 

and capacity building for staff which AIYAP has incorporated by including project launching, regular 

training for implementing staff, emphasis on Cooperatives and Water Users Associations and support 

to M&E. To avoid future land disputes as noted from some of the projects due to inadequate 

consultations, adequate consultations were held with the beneficiaries and other relevant stakeholders 

during preparation and the Bank has received a letter of comfort from the Government confirming the 

support of the locals for the project. In addition, beneficiary farmers registered their names to confirm 

that their pieces of land will be made available for the project activities. Non availability of full studies 

and designs have always led to delays in disbursements and project implementation. To address this 

problems, AIYAP locations were selected based on readiness of the designs, drawings and feasibility 

studies already prepared under the National Irrigation Master Plan. In addition, the sites were also 

selected on the least cost based among the sites which are ready for development. The need for a full 

time Project Coordination Unit was noted from almost all the previous projects, therefore, provision has 

been made for the recruitment of technical experts to support the Project Coordination Team under 

ASWAp Secretariat to fully focus on the planned activities.   

2.7.2 Through the project team interaction with the DP and government officials it was noted that 

youth skill development program were bedevilled by; (1) Lack of transparency in the process of trainees 

selection, (2) In adequate or non-availability of financial support to raise start-up capital, and 

(3)Inadequate post training technical support, and (4) Uncoordinated monitoring processes. All these 

are taken into consideration in the design of AIYAP as a result, the selection processes of the trainees, 

the training as well as provision of seed capital will the carried out by an independent 

consultants/Financial Institutions. In addition the project has already confirmed with organised private 

sector – Ilovo, PressCane, etc. which have agreed to take the trainees as interns. 

2.7.3 The issues of sustainability of the irrigation facilities after project completion in Malawi have 

been highlighted in all the reports. Irrigation is capital intensive and demanding in terms of technical 

capacity. Some of the old irrigation schemes in Malawi have had to be rehabilitated.  By introducing 

value chains and agripreneur it is expected that the farmers will transit to commercial farmers who will 

be able to pay for the maintenance of infrastructure.  The project has built in resilience of the facilities 

to the effect of climate change by addressing the issues of catchment management which will be 

specifically addressed with Euros 2million mobilised from EU.   Furthermore, to enhance sustainability 

of other physical infrastructure, the facilities and resources to be provided for the youth after graduations 

will be on revolving loan basis.  To address the issue of week technical capacity to maintain the 

irrigation infrastructure, resources have been allocated to the training of technicians and artisans for 

maintenance of the infrastructure. More importantly, the project is designed to  enhance ownership of 

the infrastructures by the farmers through Farmers Associations, improving capacities for O&M, and 

importantly, using climate-smart designs (flood regulation, sediment control etc.) which objective is to 

prolong the lifespan of the infrastructures.  

2.7.4 Lessons from the Revised 2015 Country Portfolio Improvement Plan (CPIP) also highlighted 

the: (i) Weak Capacity in Financial Management , (ii)Weak Capacity of Project Implementation Units 

which are precipitated by the staffing configuration and modalities of assigning staff to project 

coordinating units,  (iii) Project Start-Up Delays, and (iv) Weak Procurement Capacity. In order to 

address these challenges, the project has embedded (i) the need to ensure adequate stakeholders 

consultations during project design to ensure ownership and compliance during implementations phase; 

(ii) Project designs and detailed feasibility studies are already in place;(iii) training on the Bank’s rules 

and procedures for consultants and contractors engaged in Bank’s funded projects will be carried out as 

part of the project launch and on regular basis thereafter (iv) baseline and annual targets data are 

established within the first year of a project where this is not available (v) reporting would be based on 

results framework including gender disaggregated data , (vi) supervision missions’ checklist to include 



 

10 

environmental and social management activities and projects’ quarterly reports and (vii) frontloading 

of procurement activities by adopting advance contracting which have been agreed with government.. 

While addressing catchment vulnerability through the catchment management program is valid, this 

doesn’t necessarily confront the challenge of weak technical capacities nor sustainability challenge of 

the irrigation infrastructure alluded to in this  

2.8. Key performance indicators  

2.8.1 The Project Results-Based Logical Framework contains key impact and outcome indicators for 

the monitoring of the performance of the Project. The main outcomes are expected are: (i) Increased 

crop production and productivity; (ii) Increase in number of youth engaging in farming and 

Agribusiness and (iii).Increase in Household Income. Progress towards achieving these outcomes will 

be monitored through the sector monitoring and evaluation system.  

2.8.2 The Project Implementation Unit will prepare quarterly and annual project progress reports 

presenting the progress on output indicators disaggregated by gender where appropriate. Outcome 

indicators will be monitored through PIU’s management system and national statistics. Indicators will 

be updated in the Implementation Progress Report (IPR) and necessary adjustments will be made as 

appropriate. A medium term report (MTR) and Project Completion Report (PCR) will be prepared. All 

of these reports are circulated widely within the Government, the Bank and to other development 

partners.   

 

III PROJECT FEASIBILITY 

3.1 Economic and financial performance. 

3.1.1. Financial Analysis: At full operation, each farmer household will be making an income of MK 
1,575,119.74 (US$2300) per year from the current average income of MK 791,349.11      (US$1150). 

The analysis at the project level has been carried out by comparing with and without project costs, on 

farm crop establishment and operational cost with the benefits. The analysis also covered the benefits 

and costs of processing some proportions of selected crops such as maize, rice, cassava and selected 

horticultural crops such as tomatoes, onions and bananas.  The discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis 

carried out on the net cash-flow gave a Financial Internal Rate of Return (FIRR) of 23%, and a Financial 

Net Present Value (NPV) of USD 3.8 million at an opportunity costs of 18%. The opportunity cost of 

18% takes into account the prevailing high interest rates on commercial loans in the country ranging 

between 42% and 47% with inflation rate of 23% and the bank interest rates on concessional loans. The 

high financial rates of returns are attributed to the benefits accruing to the project from the value chain 

development of three major crops namely rice, maize and sugarcane and other horticultural crops such 

as tomatoes, onion, bananas and chillies. In addition, there are other benefits such as employment 

generation along the value chains, spin off effects of the investments to boost local economy and other 

environmental benefits further justifies the project.  

3.1.2. Economic Analysis: The DCF analysis carried out on the net cash-flow gave an Economic 
Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) of 26% and the economic Net Present Value is estimated at USD 7.2 

million at an opportunity cost of 12%. The economic values for the goods and services were arrived at 

using a standard conversion factor of 1.1for traded goods and services while the non-traded items were 

estimated using the market prices which were good estimates of the economic values under the 

liberalized market system in the country. The results show high economic internal rates of return due to 

the focus of the project on modernisation and commercialisation of farming in the project areas for the 

selected crops which include horticulture crops. The project will also attract the participation of more 

small medium scale enterprises mostly owned by the youth in the project. The project intervention will 

also enhance productivity through capacity building of the key stakeholders in the project. Sensitivity 

analysis on the effect of increasing investments costs by 10% and reducing crop prices by the same 

margin resulted into decrease of EIRR to 25 and 24 % respectively which means EIRR is more sensitive 

to crop produce price variation. See table 3.2 for details.

3.2 Environmental and Social impacts  

3.2.1 Environment: 

3.2.1.1 In accordance with the Bank’s Integrated Safeguards Systems (ISS), the project has been 

validated as category 2 by ORQR. This implies that the anticipated negative impacts are minimal and 

can be readily managed in line with measures elaborated in the Environmental and Social Management 

Plan. The project will have both positive and negative environmental and social impacts. Positive 

impacts will include among others: (i) improved environmental and ecological conditions; (ii) increased 

agricultural activities and enhanced agricultural production and outputs; (iii) improved food security 

and nutrition; (iv) enhanced value of agricultural produce through value addition; (v) improved social 

and economic well-being of the beneficiaries through improved economic activities; (vi) enhanced 

agricultural production capacities and skills; (vii) enhanced entrepreneurial and agro-processing skills; 

(viii) improved better quality water flow downstream; (ix) increased employment opportunities; (x) 

improved infrastructure in designated project areas; (x) capacity building including institutional 

strengthening, environment and natural resources management. Negative impacts will include: (i) 

vegetation, habitat and biodiversity loss during the development and construction phase of the project; 

(ii)  generation of solid wastes as a result of excavations during construction works; (iii) compaction of 

soils and destabilization of the geological balance; (iv) chances of threats of increased incidences of 

water-borne diseases and accidental deaths at the water conservation reservoirs; (v) dust, air quality and 

noise pollution; (vi) threats of occupational health and safety; (vii) soil, rivers and wetlands pollution 

from chemical fertilizers and other agricultural chemicals during the operational phase of the project; 

(viii) threats of transmissions of HIV/AIDs and other communicable diseases. The project ESMP for 

the two sites have been developed and posted on the Bank’s website on 9 August 2016.  

 

3.2.1.2 Though the environmental and social assessments of the project based on the African 

Development Bank’s Integrated Safeguards System (ISS) and the Environmental and Social Assessment 

Procedures, validated the project as Category 2, however according to Schedule A of the Malawi’s 

Environmental Impacts Assessment Guidelines of 1997, development of agricultural land of more than 

10 hectares requires implementation of a full EIA, thus qualifying such projects under Category 1 

Projects. However, this is annulled by Schedule B 2.1 and Schedule D (D.1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, 

D8.1, D8.2, D8.5, D8.6, D8.8 and D10, of the Guidelines because the proposed project has limited and 

reversible negative environmental and social impacts. 

3.2.2. Climate Change: The Project is classified Category 2 by the Bank’s Climate Change Screening 

System. The design review includes climate change risks and proposal of adaptation measures. Risk 

management and adaptation options are integrated through promotion of gravity irrigation water flows. 

Catchment management programme has been incorporated as part of the climate change resilience 

programme. The proposed project interventions are imbedded with adaptation measures in the irrigation 



 

12 

and land and water management sub-sectors to secure and improve agricultural productivity against 

climate change impacts through enhancement of water supply and basin-wide management. Irrigation 

schemes will help address the challenges due to low rainfall while irrigation systems have been designed 

to control the flooding menace in the target areas. These measures are consistent with Malawi’s National 

Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPAs) and these include: (i) improved early warning systems (ii) 

use of improved crop varieties and livestock breeds, (iii) improved crop and livestock management 

practices, and diversification of agricultural activities within single farm units, e.g. introduction of agro-

forestry systems 

3.2.3. Gender Analysis: Malawi has a high gender disparity between men and women. The 2014 
female Human Development Index value for Malawi is 0.423 in contrast with 0.467 for males, resulting 

in a GDI value of 0.9074. Only 32% of individual holders of agricultural land in Malawi are women 

despite their significant contribution in the agriculture sector.5 Rural women in Malawi play an 

important role as subsistence farmers,6 and there is increasingly involvement of young female (91% of 

young males works and 96% of young female workers are employed in the agriculture activities).7 Yet 

their productive capacity is hindered by gender inequalities. The gender inequalities in the agriculture 

sector can be attributed to:  

(i)  Limited access to land ownership and land tenure. This has led to gender implications mainly hinge 

around women’s control over the land and agriculture inputs including improved technology, 

extension services, credit and finances. This has affected women’s decisions over the agriculture 

sectors. Sensitisation meetings have been done to promote women participation and ensuring that 

farmer participation will be based on head of household rather than on gender. However, adequate 

safeguard will be put in place to ensure that at least 30% of the women are reached.  

(ii) Low education rate and skills among women’s famers.  Illiteracy is high among rural women and 

gender inequalities persist in secondary education, 1 in 30 women compare to 1 in 10 men 

completed secondary school (reference to point 2.5 in the report). Furthermore, for example adult 

literacy rate in Nkhata Bay is 91% to 76.8 %, male to female respectively. The situation is a bit 

different for youth but still there is differential of 18 % (age of 25 – 34). Addressing female 

education and knowledge in the project would be very crucial for their effective participation. 

Sensitization, extension support and business support services will be provided by the Government 

district officers including the youth and gender officers in order to promote youth and women 

participation and development. In addition, the project include program in capacity development 

in areas of functional literacy, book keeping, business formation etc.   

(iii) Inequalities in rural employment; rural women´s participation in paid employment is hampered by 

a significant domestic work burden. Moreover, rural female workers face a greater burden 

combining domestic and probative workloads compares to their male counterparts, which further 

restrict their agriculture production capacity.  Women generally have limited control over money 

generated from sales of agriculture produce. Moreover, men, more often than not, have the overall 

say on the selection of crop types to be produced which eventually impacts household food security. 

This creates constraints regarding agricultural investments, since in real terms, women tenure 

insecurity is one decisive factor constraining agricultural production.   

(iv) Gender mobility patterns; women are more likely to move shorter distances and within districts.  

This resulted in limited access to markets. The project will promote women participation in agri-

business by providing business development services and also through collaboration with NGOs 

active in the area.

Female – male respective: Life expectancy at birth (63.7 - 61.7). Expected years of schooling (10.8 - 10.7), Mean years of schooling (3.4 - 5.20) GNI per 

capita (0.679 - 0,815) HDI values (0.423 0.467).  GDI value Malawi, 0.907. Major gap is realized in yeas if schooling, gross national income, and 

combine with low gender inequality index, which includes participation of women in decision-making. In 2014, the parentage of women in decision 

making position stands at i.e. women held 22.3% of seats in the national parliament.

3.2.4 Finally, the project will take into account these factors and support women famers in the decision 

making process. It is apparent that gender inequality is affecting the agricultural productivity in the 

targeted areas. Women farmers on average outnumber men farmers. However, women are not well 

represented in decision making positions in irrigation schemes in Malawi where women occupy as little 

as 25% of the decision making positions and are often deputies of men. For that reason the project will 

make a deliberate effort to ensure adequate participation of women (at least 40% of beneficiaries) in 

project implementation and will encourage committees and farmer-based groups to include a larger 

quota for women in management, training, community representation and decision-making, and other 

income generating activities. Women, will thus have the opportunity to participate in farm related 

income generating activities and contribute meaningfully to the socio-economic development of their 

communities. The gender perspectives have been integrated into project formulation in line with the 

Malawian Gender Equality Act, 2012 and the National Youth Policy, 2013, and also takes due 

cognizance of the Bank’s Gender Policy. 

3.2.5 Social  The outputs of this project as contained in the logframe will translate into multiple 

positive economic and social outcomes whose indicators include: (i) increased agricultural activities 

and agricultural outputs whose net impacts will include improved living standards, food security and 

improved nutrition; (ii) increased employment opportunities both directly and indirectly by people 

employed during the development works as well as those who will be employed in agro-processing, 

marketing, sale of farm inputs, etc.; (iii) improved agricultural production skills through training; (iv) 

enhanced environmental management skills; (v) improved rural as well as on-farm infrastructure to ease 

transportation; (vi) minimized post-harvest losses through the development of farm and off-farm storage 

facilities as well as processing facilities that will help improve socio-economic well-being of the 

beneficiaries. 

3.2.6 The youth profile in Malawi indicates that out of a population of 17 million people8, more 

than 40% are between 10 to 35 years old. Literacy rates within this age bracket is estimated at 81.8% 

with slightly more males (86.6%) than females (77%) being literate. Although youth constitute a 

significant proportion of the population, they lack basic opportunities that would enable them develop 

to their full potential. This has been compounded by the presence of a range of adverse conditions that 

impinge on the youth; the most perverse, being poverty. Discussions with youth groups indicated that 

lack of appropriate skills and training, limited access to land, lack of value addition equipment and lack 

of financial support are some of the major challenges facing the youth in Malawi. Therefore this project 

has built in activities that will help to address challenges being faced by the youth. The project will 

promote formation of youth farmer cooperatives to engage in agriculture as a business. The project will 

also provide training in entrepreneurship, promote entrepreneurship culture, enhance agro-processing 

and value addition and also improve access to finance through seed funds and credit schemes. 

3.2.7. Involuntary resettlement: There is no involuntary resettlement foreseen under this project. The 

project identified sites do not require land acquisition. The areas are already designated for agricultural 

production. Settlements are outside the scheme areas except in Linga where there are a few homes found 

within the scheme area. These do not pose major problems for the scheme development since the designs 

have already isolated those few homes to be affected which will benefit from the project through 

livelihood activities embedded in the Catchment Management.  

IV IMPLEMENTATION 

4.1 Implementation arrangements 

 
4.1.1 The project will be under ASWAp within MoAIWD, and will be implemented through the 

existing GoM structures. The MoAIWD is currently implementing six Bank’s projects satisfactorily 

which did not have any problems in meeting the pre-condition for first disbursement. To fast tracked 

and kick start the preliminary key activities of the project, the Government had put in place an Interim 

Project Implementation Unit which comprised of - a Project Coordinator (a Chief Irrigation Engineer), 

                                                 
8 Population and Housing Census, 2008 



 

14 

a Procurement Specialists, a Project Accountant, a Monitoring and Evaluation Expert and a Desk Officer 

to support the project. However, in order to fast-track the implementation process, the Project 

Coordinator, Supervising Irrigation Engineer, Cooperative Officer and  Procurement Specialist as well 

as the FM officer will be recruited competitively locally to serve on full time basis. The externally 

recruited staff will sign performance based contract with the GoM. The project has also allocated 

resources to recruitment a lawyer to guide the farmers on legal issues. 

4.1.2 The Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources will implement the ENABLE 

YOUTH sub-component. A Technical Adviser which will serve for one year will be recruited 

competitively at the commencement of ENABLE YOUTH to support the university after which the 

university will take over full implementation of the component. The project will partner with a financial 

institution licensed by Reserved Bank of Malawi on risk sharing of the ENABLE YOUTH sub-

component of the project. The financial institution will be competitively recruited using Quality Based 

Method of Procurement.     

The Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Water Development will sign a memorandum of 

understanding with Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources (LUANAR) for 

selection, training and evaluation of business proposals and recommendation of seed funds for the 

Agripreneurs. The Bank will only release resources for the funding of Youth Agribusiness on the 

recommendation of the LUANAR. A criteria for the selection of the youth will be developed which will 

include the minimum qualification of the Malawi Schools Certificate of Education and targeting the 

youth from the project areas. The Agripreneurs will be provided with modern farming production 

technologies on loan such as tractors and agro-processing equipment for the crops being promoted in 

the area through a Microfinance Institutions upon completion of the training at LUANAR 

4.1.3 The PCT will ensure that project resources are properly accounted for and that all project targets 

are timely delivered. The PCT will be reporting to the Principal Secretary for the Ministry of 

Agriculture, Irrigation and Water Development. There will be a Technical Committee comprising of 

Directors of relevant Departments. The Technical Committee will report to the Project Steering 

Committee chaired by PS MoAIWD which will approve the work plans and budgets and guide the 

project on policy matters. At field level the PIU will work closely with the District Commissioners 

Office especially the District Agriculture Development Officers, Irrigation Officers and Youth 

Development Officers. Program Managers, Divisional Irrigation Services Officers from Salima and 

Mzuzu Agricultural Development/ISD will provide technical support to the project.  

4.1.4 Steering Committee: The existing ASWAp Executive Management Committee in conjunction 

with members from the Department of Youth, LUANAR and Financial Institution to be recruited as risk 

sharing partner will act as the Project Steering Committee and will have the overall decision making 

responsibility. The Principal Secretary, MoAIWD will chair the Steering Committee. 

 

Procurement Arrangements 

 

4.1.5 Procurement of goods (including non-consultancy services), works and the acquisition of 

consulting services, financed by the Bank for the project, will be carried out in accordance with the 

“Procurement Policy and Methodology for Bank Group Funded Operations” (BPM), dated October 

2015 and following the provisions stated in the Financing Agreement. Specifically, Procurement would 

be carried out following: (1) Borrower Procurement System (BPS): Specific Procurement Methods and 

Procedures (PMPs) under BPS comprising its Laws and Regulations as stipulated under 2003 Public 

Procurement Act (PPA) and 2004 Public Procurement Regulations (PPR using the national Standard 

Solicitation Documents (SSDs) or other Solicitation Documents agreed during project negotiations” for 

various group of transactions to be entailed under components 3 and 4 under the Project, and (2) Bank 

Procurement Policy and Methodology (BPM): Bank standard PMPs, using the relevant Bank Standard   

Solicitation Documents SDDs, mainly for components 1 and 2 for contracts that are either: (i) above 

the thresholds indicated in Annex B5, Para. B.5.3;2, or (ii) in case BPS is not relied upon for a specific 

transaction or group of transactions; and (iii) in case BPM have been found to be the best fit for purpose 



 

15 

for a specific transaction or group of transactions. In order to gain time and specifically to meet the 

requirements of PD2 of 2015, the Interim Project Implementation Unit put in place by the Government 

has commenced the preparation of the procurement documents. In addition, the Government has 

selected to use Advance Procurement.  

4.1.6 Procurement Risks and Capacity Assessment (PRCA): the assessment of procurement risks at 

the Country, Sector, and Project levels and of procurement capacity at the Executing Agency (EA), were 

undertaken  for the project and the output have informed the decisions on the procurement regimes (BPS 

and Bank)   being used for specific transactions or groups of similar transactions under the project. The 

global rating of risk assessment was Substantial with possibility of reducing to moderate after the 

implementation of the mitigating measures. The appropriate risks mitigation measures have been 

included in the procurement PRCA action plan proposed in Annex B5, Para. 5.3.8.

4.1.7 Financial Management Arrangements:  

 

4.1.7.1 MOAIWD has prior experience in implementing projects financed by various development 

partners and currently manages a total of three projects funded by the Bank. The Bank-funded projects 

are mainstreamed within the Ministry but the financial management function is performed by 

Consultants working together with Government Accountants. The frequent rotation of Government 

Accountants has hampered the reinforcement of capacity within the Ministry thus necessitating the 

retention of Consultants to support the PIUs. The existing projects have had a number of financial 

management challenges related to the poor quality of quarterly reporting, delays in the preparation of 

annual financial statements, non-compliance with the Bank’s audit submission deadlines, late 

submission of expenditure justification documents and inadequate controls at the district level. 

 



 

16 

4.1.7.2 In order the mitigate the identified FM risks based on prior experience, the project will recruit a 

Financial Management Specialist and an Accountant on a contractual basis to work together with the 

two Accountants designated by the Accountant General. The Financial Management Specialist will have 

primary responsibility for the FM aspects and report to the Project Manager and to the Director of 

Finance at MoAIWD.  The contracted FM consultants will be subjected to annual performance 

evaluations to ensure that they support the borrower’s compliance with the Bank’s financial 

management requirements. 

 

4.1.7.3 The project’s FM will be centrally managed within the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) in 

MoAIWD. The PIU would coordinate all project FM-related issues. The overall conclusion of the 

assessment is that MoAIWD’s capacity to handle all the FM aspects of the project, satisfies Bank 

minimum requirements as laid out in the Bank’s FM guidelines subject to the recruitment on a 

contractual basis of a Financial Management Specialist and an Accountant . The overall FM risk for the 

project is assessed as Moderate (see Annex 1 – Risk Analysis summary).  

 

4.1.8 Financial Reporting and Auditing Arrangement:  

In accordance with the Bank’s financial reporting and audit requirements, the project will be required 

to prepare and submit a quarterly progress report to the Bank not later than forty-five (45) days after the 

end of each calendar quarter. The project will prepare and submit annual financial statements, audited 

by the National Audit Office or an independent private audit firm, together with the auditor’s opinion 

and management letter to the Bank not later than six (6) months after the end of the financial year. The 

detailed auditing arrangements are included in the Technical Annex B.4. 

4.1.9 Internal Audit:  

The Central Internal Audit Unit will be responsible for providing objective assurance and ensuring 

accountability in the utilization of public funds and assets. Various bank rules and guidelines (including 

procurement rules, FM guidelines and disbursement guidelines) would also provide additional guidance. 

The internal controls of the project will be spelt out in the project implementation manual which would 

include sections on accounting and administrative procedures and provide guidance on the day to day 

project FM issues. The internal control environment will be underpinned by the clear definition of roles 

and responsibilities allowing for segregation of duties. 

4.1.10 Disbursement Arrangements:  

The project would make use of the Bank’s various disbursement methods including (i) Direct Payment, 

(ii) Special Account (SA) and (iii) Reimbursement methods in accordance with Bank rules and 

procedures as laid out in the Disbursement handbook as applicable. The Bank will issue a Disbursement 

Letter of which the content will be discussed and agreed with the Government of Malawi (GoM) during 

negotiations.  

 

The government will open a special account which will be denominated in foreign currency, at a bank 

acceptable to the Bank for the Project’s use. A related local currency account will also be opened for 

eligible local currency operating costs.  

4.2 Monitoring  

 
4.2.1 The established ASWAp results framework will be used for M&E of the project performance. 

Support will be provided by the MoAIWD and Ministry Labour, Youth and Manpower Development 

(MLYMD) to undertake their roles in leading the M&E process. The M&E Units will generate gender 

disaggregated data and also assess socio-economic impacts on the target groups. The Environmental 

District Officers and Land Resources Conservation Officers will monitor the social and environmental 

impacts of the project. Project effect and impacts on the target groups will be monitored by constituting 

cross-section samples of beneficiaries. The component will facilitate stakeholder consultations, farmer 

organisation, nutrition and HIV/AIDS messages, promotion of women participation, field 

demonstrations including competitions and short-term consultancies.

4.3 Governance  

 

4.3.1 The Agricultural sector in Malawi is repositioning itself to institutionalize transparency and 

good governance as evidenced in earlier detection by the management and ordering of full investigation 

of suspected salary fraud in the ministry. It should be noted that the MAIWD was not involved in the 

Malawi Cashgate of 2013. However, the requisite fiduciary management framework still poise a lot of 

challenges which include lack of qualified and experienced project accounting staff due to high turnover 

or attrition of accounting staff, weak internal controls and non-compliance with key internal control 

procedures within line ministry.  

4.3.2 The 2015 report of Transparency International Corruption Perception Index showed that Malawi 

had slide from 37(88/176) to 31 (112/175) between 1912 and 2015. The overall score of 2015 was below 

Sub-Saharan average of 33 score. However, the overall average score for Malawi’s Country Policy and 

Institutional Assessment (CPIA) Governance component has been improving slowly between 2004-

2014 with intermittent slight decreases in 2010 (-0.1) and 2014 (-0.13). However, the theft of public 

funds amounting to about US Dollar 50 million in September, 2013 dubbed as Cash gate, exposed high 

level corruption and serious weaknesses in Malawi’s PFM system. The current administration has since 

coming into power shown strong resolve to address the root causes of Cash gate and reform the PFM 

system.  The Government is implementing the PFM Reform Action Plan to restore controls and integrity 

of the PFM system over the short term. The Government also is also implementing a broader Public 

Sector Reform Programme (PSRP) aimed at improving accountability and transparency in public 

service delivery.  Steady progress in reforms is being made as evidenced by recent improvement in 

financial reporting and completion of pay roll audit.  There are on-going efforts to strengthen the 

capacity of key governance institutions, such as the Anti-Corruption Bureau, Office of the Directorate 

of Public Procurement (ODPP) and the National Auditor General’s Office. 

4.4 Sustainability  

4.4.1 The participatory approach adopted during the project design and envisioned to be extended 

during the implementation phase will enhance the ownership of project’s activities and realizations by 

the main stakeholders ensuring its sustainability. The irrigation infrastructure will be operated and 

maintained by the Water Users Associations (WUAs) whose capacities will be developed through 

training. The project will ensure that at least 30% of women are represented in the irrigation 

management committees. Operation and Maintenance guidelines will be developed including tariff 

setting by the supervising consultant for the operation and maintenance of the schemes that takes into 

consideration past experiences in the management of irrigation schemes in the country. The WUAs are 

expected to cover the O&M costs from the contribution of farmers through water charges. Other 

sustainability of other components - Value Addition and Youth entrepreneurship and Agro-



 

18 

Cooperatives Development for Employability are hinged on making paradigm shift of agriculture from 

development to business/commercial activities.  

4.4.2 The project is financially sustainable. The analysis indicates 23% and 26% FIRR and EIRR 

respectively. It is evident that the farmers will be able to pay for the water usage (which is currently 

estimated at KWA50, 000 per annum) through the Water User Association given that farmers will be 

linked to processors who will be ready to buy their products. In order to strengthen the relationships 

between the two parties,   provisions have been made for legal services. The project also makes 

provision for the training of artisans and technicians for the maintenance of the irrigation infrastructure.  

In addition regarding the irrigation infrastructure, marketing of value added products, provision of 

institutional support and development of strong farmer groups will work in synergy to ensure 

sustainability. In particular it is expected that, under AIYAP, the farmers who will be organized in 

Farmer Associations/Cooperative Societies will operate as farming businesses. Cooperative and 

Extension Officers will be recruited to provide technical supports in farms management, operation and 

maintenance.  The analysis also indicates that the young entrepreneurs will be able to service their loans, 

as well as obtain handsome net profits for re-investments in running of their farms.    

4.5 Risk management  

 

4.5.1 One major risk is the unpredictability of agricultural markets due to trade restrictions and price 

controls on some items. The Government is being urged by DPs, for instance to deregulate agriculture 

markets including removal of bans and pegging the price on some strategic crops such as maize.   

Enactment of the Goods Control Act would help to improve market predictability.  However, there is 

already a guaranteed market for sugarcane production by linking the farmers with Dwangwa Cane 

Growers Trust and Dwangwa Cane Growers Company Ltd.     

4.5.2  Volatility of the world commodity prices 

Mitigation: The country enjoys accessibility to SADC market and the project lays emphasis on internal 

processing of raw materials and value addition. 

 

4.5.3 Project Cost Overruns: Project cost overruns due to exchange rate fluctuations, uncertainties in 

economic situation of Malawi and SADC and the rise in the cost of materials. 

Mitigation: Project is costed in USD and efficient procurement timing to address the increases, as well 

as adequate price contingencies for the unavoidable increases will is provided in the project costing. 

4.5.4 Reduced precipitation, increased temperature, change in length of rainy season, increased 

incidences of drought and floods, due to climate risks:  

Mitigation: Training regarding vulnerabilities, assisting the communities to select various adaptation 

measures; e.g. rainwater harvesting, rotational grazing, using drought tolerant varieties e.g. cassava, 

sorghum etc. 

4.5.5 Delay in providing counterpart funding:  

Mitigation: The GoM contributions will be largely be in kind in form of provisions of office spaces, 

furniture, salary and wages, allowances (including per diem of staff), payment of all utility bills, office 

equipment and payment of hotel bills for staff seconded to the project.  

 
4.6 Knowledge building  
 

4.6.1 The knowledge gained and lessons learnt through the implementation of various agricultural 

projects in Malawi, government policies as well as studies carried out in the sector have been duly 

applied in designing this project. Similarly, the knowledge that will be generated through 

implementation of this Project will be synergised with other projects on ground such as SIVAP and 

AISP to achieve maximum result. The results from the various studies and other surveys, including the 

socio-economic impact study will inform the stakeholders on how to put the acquired knowledge into 

practical use for better results-oriented achievements and sustained benefit flows. 

 



 

19 

4.6.2 At the project level, the project implementation review, quarterly progress reports, audit, sector 

M&E and completion reports will also provide information on various aspects of the project for further 

diagnosis. The knowledge obtained will be shared within the Bank and with other development partners 

as well as with RMCs.

VI 

Appendix V: FRAGILITY REPORT 

 

1. Introduction 

 

1.1 The country has few resources and is highly dependent on external aid. It is rapidly urbanizing and 

has high population growth and limited arable land. These challenges have manifested in unfavourable 

socio-economic indicators, including a high incidence of poverty.  

Malawi’s other main challenges include improving infrastructure  mainly energy and water delivery 

which are adversely affecting private sector investment, addressing a scarcity of skilled human 

resources,  provision of health care, reforming its public financial management (PFM) system, and the 

large and relatively inefficient public service  including parastatals. 

The Agricultural Infrastructure and Youth in Agribusiness Project is to address the twin problems 

of food security and high rate youth unemployment within the context of 2011-2016 Malawi Growth 

and Development Strategy (MGDS) which identified agriculture and food security, irrigation and green 

belt initiatives as drivers of economic growth. Agriculture in Malawi is highly vulnerable to the adverse 

impacts of climate change and extreme weather events, such as dry spells, droughts and floods. 

1.2 The project Fragility Assessment Report (PFAR) of the Agricultural Infrastructure and Youth Skill 

Development in Agribusiness Project (AIYAP) is based on the Country Profile Report of 2016, which 

identified the key drivers of fragility of Malawi including: the country’s dependence on a single 

agricultural export, High population density, Poverty reduction has been slow, Natural disasters and 

climate change, Weak financial sector development, Gender Inequality 

 

2 Main Drivers of Fragility for Malawi 

2.1 The country’s dependence on a single agricultural export tobacco is a risk, there is a need of 

agricultural diversification and its success will depend on adequate infrastructures (road) access and 

relaxation of remaining trade restrictions. 

2.2 High population density increases the land degradation and reduce agricultural productivity and 

damage infrastructure, and adversely affect human health and critical ecosystems.   

2.3 Poverty reduction has been slow and low human development outcomes have been exacerbated 

by high household vulnerability to weather shocks and high population growth.  

2.4 Natural disasters and climate change caused by land degradation, resulting from significant loss 

of soil fertility, soil erosion impacted severely the country through frequent occurrences of drought and 

floods, specifically for the majority of rural households who depend on the fragile natural resource base 

for their livelihoods.   

2.5 Weak financial sector development as more than 50 percent of the population are not formally 

banked. Many key barriers to financial access like limited accessibility of financial service points; lack 

of collateral,  high transaction costs; capacity constraints; crowding effect of the public sector, and the 

lack of market coordination and harmonization between public and private initiatives seeking to 

promote better access to financial services still. 

2.6 Gender Inequality keep limiting women’s access to agricultural inputs and their share in the 

benefits of production, as well as access to education, health, and other social services.  

 

3 Assessment and conclusion 

The project does not have dual objective on fragility nor specific fragility indicators for monitoring and 

evaluation but the design has duly incorporated the key drivers of fragility. The related interventions 

will help to address the key drivers of fragility as highlighted in the assessment

Project Summary 

Project Overview: The objective of the present project, which involves a loan from the African 

Development Fund (ADF) to the United Republic of Tanzania (URT) to be on-lent to the Tanzania 

Agricultural Development Bank (TADB), is to contribute to the development of the agriculture sector in 

Tanzania. The agriculture sector provides employment for about 67% of the population of Tanzania and has a 

very big potential for expansion given the abundance of arable land and the availability of inland water 

resources. However, the sector needs to be developed if Tanzania is to achieve sustainable economic 

development and poverty reduction. Specifically, in order for the country to achieve the Sustainable 

Development Goals and the Tanzania Development Vision 2025, the agriculture sector must sustainably grow 

at over 10% per annum. Unfortunately, over the past ten years, the sector has grown at an average of 4.4% per 

annum and contributed an average of 29.3% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). These rates have recently 

declined to 3.2% per annum and 26% of GDP (Q2 2016), respectively. A major problem facing the agriculture 

sector is the unavailability of medium to long-term finance to support, among other things, agricultural 

production, processing and marketing. The TADB is designed to address this through the provision of much-

needed funding to a sector that is key to the country’s development. Indeed, the requested loan from the ADF 

to the URT will be passed on to the TADB as a loan thereby enabling this institution to assist Tanzania in 

achieving its development goals by extending much-needed funding to the agriculture sector. 

Project Beneficiaries: Tanzania is heavily dependent on agriculture which accounts for 26% of GDP and 
35% of foreign currency earnings. The country has a dual agricultural economy, the smallholder farmers and 

the commercial/large-scale farmers. The smallholder farmers dominate the agriculture sector and account for 

most of the food produced in Tanzania. These farmers are expected to be the main beneficiaries of the project. 

The project will also benefit women as they represent the majority of the smallholder farmers in Tanzania. 

Women will benefit from having a portion of the funding specifically dedicated to them as well as from the 

establishment of a mentoring program to build and enhance their skills. The project will thus have positive social 

and gender pay-offs. 

Project Rationale: The project is consistent with the Tanzania Development Vision 2025 which 

emphasizes the following three as national priority goals: i) ensuring basic food security, ii) improving 

household income levels and iii) increasing export earnings. The National Five-Year Development Plan 

(FYDP I and FYDP II) also identifies the agriculture sector as a priority for the country. The specific agriculture 

sector policies and strategies, including the Agriculture Sector Development Strategy (ASDS), the Agriculture 

Sector Development Programme (ASDP), the Kilimo Kwanza Initiative of 2009 and the Southern Agricultural 

Growth Corridor of Tanzania (SAGCOT) initiative, all call for increased commercialization of agriculture. The 

latest national development initiative, the Big Results Now (BRN), identifies three priority crops for the 

agriculture sector which are maize, rice and sugarcane as they contribute to food security and import substitution. 

The project is consistent with a range of Bank Group policies and strategies including: i) the Bank’s Country 

Strategy Paper for Tanzania (CSP, 2016-2020), ii) the Bank’s Ten Year Strategy (2013-22), iii) the Bank’s High 

5s, iv) the Bank’s new Strategy for Feed Africa (2016-2025) and v) the Bank’s Gender Strategy (2014-18). 

Bank Value Added: The Bank Group has vast experience in supporting national development finance 

institutions (DFIs) in Africa. Through this operation, the Bank Group will not only provide the United 

Republic of Tanzania with the necessary financial resources to support the TADB, thereby enabling it to expand 

its operations and outreach, but will also contribute to building and enhancing the capacity of this national DFI 

through the proposed technical assistance program (TA Program) which will be funded with a portion of the 

funds that will be made available to the TADB. The Bank Group’s solid expertise and knowledge of DFIs has 

fed into the design of the TA Program which is expected to contribute to ensuring that the TADB is in a position 

to intermediate the funds provided to it in an impactful and sustainable manner. 

Institutional Development and Knowledge Building: The project will add to the body of knowledge 

already acquired within the Bank Group following numerous interventions to support agriculture as well 

as DFIs across Africa. The Bank Group will ensure that knowledge from the operation is captured through 

adequate monitoring and evaluation of its outputs and outcomes, supervision missions, mid-term review, 

stakeholder consultations and project completion reports at the end of the operation.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE MANAGEMENT TO THE BOARD 

OF DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE UNITED REPUBLIC OF 

TANZANIA TO SUPPORT THE TANZANIA AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT 

BANK 

Management submits the following report and recommendation for a loan from the African 

Development Fund (ADF) to the United Republic of Tanzania (URT) which will be on-lent to 

the Tanzania Agricultural Development Bank (TADB). The loan is for an amount of UA 67.27 

million. The present appraisal report1 focuses principally on assessing the TADB since the 

proceeds of the ADF loan are to be passed on by the URT to this national development finance 

institution (DFI) in the form of a loan. The terms and conditions of the loan from the URT to 

the TADB will be in line with those of the loan from the ADF to the URT except for the loan 

currency which will be Tanzanian Shilling. 

1. STRATEGIC THRUST & RATIONALE 

1.1. The agricultural sector provides employment for about 67% of the population of 
Tanzania2 and has a very big potential for expansion given the abundance of arable land3 

and the availability of inland water resources. However, the sector needs to be developed if 

Tanzania is to achieve sustainable economic development and poverty reduction. Specifically, 

in order for the country to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the 

Tanzania Development Vision 2025, the agriculture sector must sustainably grow at over 10% 

per annum. Unfortunately, over the past ten years, the sector has grown at an average of 4.4% 

per annum and contributed an average of 29.3% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). These rates 

have recently declined to 3.2% per annum and 26% of GDP (Q2 2016), respectively. 

1.2. A major problem facing the agricultural sector is the unavailability of medium to 
long-term finance to support, among other things, agricultural production, processing 

and marketing. The TADB is designed to address this through the provision of much-needed 

funding to a sector that is key to the country’s development. Indeed, the requested loan from 

the ADF to the URT will be used to support the TADB thereby enabling this institution to assist 

Tanzania in achieving its development goals and inclusive growth by extending much-needed 

funding to the agricultural sector. 

1.3. The present project is aligned with Tanzania’s key priorities. In highlighting the 
importance of the agriculture sector and to address the challenges facing it, the Tanzania 

Development Vision 2025 emphasizes the following three as national priority goals: i) ensuring 

basic food security, ii) improving household income levels and iii) increasing export earnings. 

                                                 

1 The present report has been prepared based on information provided by the URT and the TADB before, during 

and after the AfDB’s appraisal mission to Tanzania from the 5th to 8th of September 2016. During the mission, a 

series of meetings were held with senior government officials at the Ministry of Finance and Planning, Ministry 

of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries, Office of Treasury Registrar, Agriculture Council of Tanzania and the 

Bank of Tanzania. Extensive discussions were also held with the senior management and technical staff of the 

TADB. Furthermore, the appraisal report is informed by the lessons learnt from supporting similar projects in 

other African countries. 

2 The ongoing portfolio in Tanzania, as of September 2016, comprises 24 operations with total net commitment 

of UA 1.36 billion. The portfolio consists of 20 public sector operations and 4 private sector operations. Public 

sector operations (mostly infrastructure: transport, power and water supply and sanitation) represent 86.45% of 

the portfolio while private sector operations make up the remaining 13.55%. The ongoing operations are financed 

through various instruments. ADF loans account for 52% while AfDB public sector loans represent 27% and 

private sector loans account for 14%. ADF grants and various AfDB administered trust funds account for the 

remaining 7% of the financing. See Appendix II for additional information on the portfolio. 

3 Agricultural Land in Tanzania was last measured at 396,500 sq.km in 2016 (44.8% of total land area) versus 

369,744 sq.km in 2008 representing an increase of 7% over the period. 



 

2 

The National Five-Year Development Plan (FYDP I and FYDP II) also identifies the 

agriculture sector as a priority for the country. The specific agriculture sector policies and 

strategies, including the Agriculture Sector Development Strategy (ASDS), the Agriculture 

Sector Development Programme (ASDP), the Kilimo Kwanza Initiative of 2009 and the 

Southern Agricultural Growth Corridor of Tanzania (SAGCOT) initiative all call for increased 

commercialization of agriculture. The latest national development initiative, the Big Results 

Now (BRN), identifies three priority crops for the agriculture sector which are maize, rice and 

sugarcane as they contribute to food security and import substitution. One of the three “big 

ideas” for agriculture under the BRN is delivery of 25 commercial and out-grower investments, 

16 for sugar and 9 for rice. 

1.4. The present project is consistent with a range of Bank Group policies and 
strategies. These include: i) the Bank’s Country Strategy Paper for Tanzania (CSP, 2016-2020) 

which calls for unlocking the country’s productive capacity to promote various key sectors 

including agriculture, ii) the Bank’s Ten Year Strategy (2013-22) particularly its operational 

focus areas (private sector development), areas of special emphasis (agriculture and food 

security) and the promotion of inclusive growth by offering support to smallholder farmers, iii) 

the Bank’s High 5s especially Industrialize Africa, Feed Africa and Improve the quality of life 

for Africans, iv) the Bank’s new Strategy for Feed Africa (2016-2025) and v) the Bank’s 

Gender Strategy (2014-18) for the promotion of gender equality. 

2. COUNTRY CONTEXT 

The Economy 

2.1. Tanzania’s economy is one of the fastest growing among large Sub-Saharan 
African countries (Figure 1). Real GDP growth is expected to remain around 7% in 2016 and 

2017 (in line with 2015), according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), supported by 

continued investment in infrastructure, manufacturing and tourism. Better availability and 

reliability of power supply, a rapidly expanding services sector and an improvement in the 

country’s terms of trade due to lower oil prices are also factors that are stimulating growth. 

Furthermore, Tanzania holds significant growth potential in every major sector of the economy, 

including agriculture, manufacturing, services, tourism and mining. GDP growth is expected 

to be driven by the construction, transport, communications and financial services sectors. 

Recent offshore natural gas discoveries are projected to expand the country’s export base and 

help to further diversify the economy.

2.2. Tanzania has been able to weather recent risk aversion to emerging markets and 
financial market volatility, which led to a 24% depreciation in the local currency against 

the US Dollar in 2015, thanks to its diversified economy and net oil import position. As a 



 

3 

net oil importer, Tanzania is benefitting from the decline in global oil prices, its external 

position has improved and lower pump prices are supporting domestic consumption and 

growth. 

2.3. Relatively low wealth levels and widespread poverty are constraints on economic 
growth. However, while significant infrastructure bottlenecks hamper the country’s full 

growth potential. Tanzania is also less competitive, has lower productivity and provides a less 

favorable business environment than some of its regional peers such as Kenya and Rwanda. 

The Banking Sector 

2.4. With total assets approaching TZS 28.5 trillion at end of 2015 (USD 13.08 billion), 
Tanzania’s banking sector is the seventh largest in sub-Saharan Africa, behind South 

Africa, Nigeria, Angola, Mauritius, Kenya and Ghana. Banking assets rose at an annual rate 

of 21% between 2005 and 2015, compared with average nominal GDP growth of 17% over the 

same period. The banking system, however, remains small in a global and regional context. 

Banking system assets are estimated at around 31.3% of GDP as of December 2015 (Figure 2) 

due to low per capita income, fairly low banking penetration and low transaction volumes. 

Figure 2. Banking System Assets as a Percentage of GDP 

 
Sources: Tanzania’s National Bureau of Statistics, Bank of Tanzania. 

2.5. Lending growth grew at an annual rate of 27% between 2005 and 2015, with 
particularly high loan growth prior to 2009 levelling off to 21% over the past five years 

(Figure 3). The expansion covered most economic sectors, but the agricultural, hunting, 

forestry and fishing sectors have slowed recently to a five-year annual growth rate of 11%. 

Rapid growth continues in trade (25%), building, construction, real estate and leasing (32%), 

education (48%), health (53%), and mining and quarrying (52%). Personal and other services 

grew less aggressively over the past five years (20% annual growth rate), but have recently 

picked up with 46% growth in 2015 alone.

2.6. Loan books cover a wide range of sectors and segments (Figure 4), a reflection of 
the diversification of the Tanzanian economy. 

Figure 4. Sector Composition as of December 2015

2.7. The banking sector plays a dominant role in the financial system with banks 
having around a 71.3% market share as of the end of March 2016. Pension funds accounted 

for 26.5%, insurance companies for 1.9% and collective investment schemes for 0.5%. Four 

banks account for around half of system assets. These are: CRDB Bank, National Microfinance 

Bank, National Bank of Commerce and Standard Chartered Bank Tanzania. A total of 36 

commercial banks and 12 community banks operate in the country ensuring some level of 

competition. Concentration remains high, however, as smaller banks and community banks 

generally lack extensive branch networks and are unable to compete with larger banks, often 

leading to weaker financial profiles. 

2.8. Non-performing loans (NPLs), defined as 90 days past due, have remained high 
over the past few years, ranging between 6.5% and 9.3% of gross loans since 2011. Despite 

robust growth in the economy since then, NPLs remain elevated and stood at 8.4% of total 

loans as of March 2016. Weaknesses in certain economic sectors are to blame, including the 

inherently volatile agricultural sector which accounts for the highest NPLs. The agricultural 

sector is a top priority for development by the Government of Tanzania but problem loans are 

rife. This is due to the inherent volatility of the sector given its dependence on commodity 

prices and vulnerability to droughts. This, combined with a tendency for the commercial banks 

to extend loans with short-term maturities and high interest rates, results in a higher propensity 

to default in the agriculture sector compared to other sectors. In fact, the little funding that is 

currently offered to the agriculture sector is not considered as suitable given its high interest 

rates and short-term maturities and does not necessarily contribute to the development of the 

sector either as it does not provide the flexibility to accommodate the inherently seasonal and 

cyclical nature of agriculture. 

The Agriculture Sector 

2.9. Agriculture in Tanzania is an important sector of the economy as it accounts for 
26% of the country’s GDP and employs 67% of its population. The sector is also an 

important source of export revenues. Despite its significance to livelihoods and to the overall 

economy, the agriculture sector remains hampered by widespread underinvestment. As a result 

it continues to operate largely at subsistence levels and its potential to bring commercialization 

to scale remains for the most part unrealized. 



 

5 

2.10. A major problem facing the agricultural sector is the unavailability of finance 
(particularly medium to long-term) to support agricultural production, processing and 

marketing. As of December 2015, a mere 8% of commercial banks’ lending went to the sector 

with most of which went to large companies operating in Tanzania. As a result of this 

underinvestment, production in the agriculture sector has not increased significantly over the 

past decades. 

2.11. In Tanzania, there is huge potential to produce both food and non-food crops for 
the domestic and export markets if access to term (medium to long-term) finance is 

improved. The availability of such finance will enable farmers to reduce their exposure to the 

cyclicality and seasonality of agriculture, to make investments in crops with long gestations 

periods and to acquire farm machinery and inputs, irrigation equipment, storage and processing 

facilities thereby transforming the sector and increasing its contribution towards economic 

growth. Access to term finance is critical for the growth of the agriculture sector and the shift 

from subsistence to commercial agricultural production. 

2.12. The commercial banks in Tanzania are reluctant to expand their lending to the 
agriculture sector which they view as risky. This deprives the sector of the much-needed 

funds to boost production, processing and marketing. The commercial banks tend to fund 

themselves with short-term deposits limiting their incentive to extend term finance to a sector 

that they consider as risky although it is not necessarily more risky than other sectors, it is just 

that these banks, having found their niches, have not done enough to adequately structure their 

lending to the sector taking into account risk factors such as seasonal variations which can be 

addressed through the provision of medium to long-term lending. It is against this background, 

and for sustainable economic growth in the country that, the Government of Tanzania has 

decided to establish the TADB so as to address the observed bottlenecks and enhance access 

to credit in the agriculture sector. The TADB has been established as a national DFI with a key 

role of being a catalyst for delivery of credit facilities for the development of agriculture in 

Tanzania. However, the TADB alone cannot satisfy the significant demand for credit of the 

entire sector and this is why it aims to focus on particular actors as well as on a set of high 

potential value chains in which investments can produce results within a short timeframe. The 

TADB will also take a holistic approach and finance the entire value chain namely production, 

processing and marketing. 

2.13. It is worth noting that in 2005, the Government of Tanzania implemented the 
recommendations of the Financial Sector Assessment Programme (FSAP) of the IMF 

which was undertaken in 2003. It was recognized that lack of long-term financing was among 

the stumbling blocks in the growth of the economy. Among the activities that were earmarked 

for implementation was the establishment of development finance institutions to provide long-

term financing to key economic sectors including agriculture. This led to the establishment of 

a number of credit schemes while the Tanzania Investment Bank (TIB) was transformed into a 

development finance institution with an agricultural financing window albeit not sufficient to 

address the needs of the agriculture sector hence the establishment of the TADB. The failure 

of the commercial banks to meet the needs of the agriculture sector in Tanzania provides a 

strong justification for Government intervention particularly through a dedicated DFI whose 

mandate is to specifically serve the agriculture sector. 

3. PROJECT DESCRIPTION 

3.1. As previously stated, among the major problems facing the agriculture sector in 
Tanzania is the availability and cost of term finance to support agricultural production, 

processing and marketing. As of December 2015, credit to the agriculture sector accounted 

for only 8% of total lending by the commercial banks. Most of this lending was to large 

enterprises operating in the sector. In fact, despite rapid growth of the financial sector in 



 

6 

Tanzania, access to credit and other financial services is a serious constraint to many actors in 

the agriculture sector especially the smallholder farmers for whom funding from the banks is 

simply out of reach. This essentially underlines the rationale for public intervention as the 

financial system has not been able to adequately address gaps in the provision of finance to the 

agriculture sector in Tanzania. 

3.2. The Bank Group is to intervene to provide resources from the African 
Development Fund to the United Republic of Tanzania which will utilize the borrowed 

resources to extend a loan to the TADB which is a state-owned DFI established as part of 

the second pillar of the country’s Kilimo Kwanza Initiative of 2009. The TADB, whose 

design has been informed by an in-depth review of global experiences relating to successful 

national DFIs, is meant to play a critical role in alleviating the financing constraints that hamper 

the growth of Tanzania’s agriculture sector. 

3.3. The TADB was officially launched and started operations in 2015. It is structured 
to deliver medium and long-term funding through wholesale and direct lending as well as 

guarantees and risk-sharing instruments to address the financing gaps in the agriculture value 

chains. 

3.4. The TADB has been focusing on a set of high potential value chains within the 
national priorities. The fourteen value chains of focus fall under eight agriculture sub-sectors 

as follows: cereals (maize and rice), industrial commodities (sugarcane and cashew nuts), 

oilseeds (sunflower and sesame), horticulture (vegetables, fruits and spices), livestock (diary 

and beef), poultry, fisheries and forestry. Overtime, the TADB will support other value chains 

as more funds are made available to it including from the ADF. 

3.5. The TADB will predominantly target smallholder farmers who carry out essential 
agricultural-related economic activities within the value chains of focus (understanding 

that serving the smallholder farmers directly will be challenging, the TADB aims to reach 

them through their farmer organizations). These farmers will be targeted through funding 

as well as technical assistance which the TADB will implement by working closely with 

Business Development Services (BDS) providers across Tanzania. The ultimate objective in 

doing so is to enable these farmers to make the transition from subsistence to commercial 

farming in an effective and sustainable manner. That said, the TADB will also target other 

medium and large scale farmers as well as the agro-processors, among others. Furthermore, the 

TADB will finance infrastructure development for irrigation, storage/warehousing and 

transport. 

3.6. The pricing of TADB’s facilities will take into account its developmental mandate 
as well as the objective of maintaining sustainable operations. This national DFI will aim 

to extend funding with affordable interest rates for agriculture production, processing and value 

addition. As part of its mandate to develop agriculture, it will aim to maintain low interest rates 

for the smallholder farmers based on its cost of funds plus a sufficient margin to cover operating 

expenses and generate a profit to facilitate sustainability of operations. Given that smallholder 

farmers are potentially one of Tanzania’s most powerful sources of economic growth, the 

TADB will thus contribute to inclusive growth as well as sustained poverty alleviation. The 

provision of long-term funding in local currency to the smallholder farmers will also have a 

positive impact on affordability. Extending loan tenors will have a beneficial impact on the 

cash flows of the borrowers, thus allowing them to expand their borrowing capacity and 

businesses. For the larger clients, the TADB will extend financing on market confirming terms, 

nevertheless. This is important as sustainability is paramount and the viability of the products 

that the TADB provides will be crucial to its success.

3.7. The TADB is currently wholly-owned by the Government of Tanzania and is run 
by a board comprised mostly of independent non-executive directors appointed through 

a competitive process. The board has three committees namely the board business committee, 

the board human resource and administration committee and the board audit, risk and 

compliance committee. Each committee is assigned specific focus areas and specialized 

functions in the operations of the TADB. The managing director is in charge of the TADB’s 

day-to-day affairs supported by a senior management team. The TADB has begun operations 

with 45 staff and expects to continue recruiting staff based on the needs and expansion of 

business operations to reach a total of 150 by 2020. The TADB operates from its head office 

in Dar es Salaam and overtime expects to open a number of offices in relevant areas of the 

country for reaching out to potential customers. Finally, its structure is as follows: 

 

Figure 5. Organization Structure 

 

3.8. The TADB’s authorized share capital is Tanzania Shilling (TZS) 800 billion (USD 
367.16 million). In order to enable the TADB to start carrying out its functions, the 

Government of Tanzania has so far injected TZS 60 billion (USD 27.54 million) as its initial 

capital contribution. However, this limited funding base is hindering the TADB’s ability to 

fully achieve its objectives including extending medium to long-term loans to the agriculture 

sector especially the loans needed for infrastructure development. It is against this background 

that the URT is requesting a loan from the ADF in an amount of UA 67.27 million (USD 93.51 

million, TZS 204.38 billion) whose proceeds will be on-lent to the TADB thereby enabling it 

to expand its operations and outreach.

3.9. The borrowed funds are expected to be deployed by the TADB towards funding a 
technical assistance program (TA Program) and supporting complementary activities 

which are expected to have a positive impact on productivity in the agriculture sector in 

Tanzania: 

 Support in the form of medium and long-term funding for agricultural infrastructure 
development (e.g. warehousing facilities and irrigation schemes to provide reliable 

access to water to absorb shocks caused by climatic variability); 

 Support in the form of medium and long-term funding for access to agricultural inputs 
(financing access to quality seeds, fertilizers and pesticides); 

 Support in the form of medium and long-term funding to agro-processing industries; 

 Support in the form of medium and long-term funding for agro-mechanization (e.g. 
tractors, harvesters and irrigation equipment); and 

 Building resilience and capacity to absorb costs by having a portion of the funds 
invested in low risk/high return instruments in order to absorb the high transaction costs 

associated with financing smallholder agriculture at low interest rates. 

3.10. The TADB has been established to promote the transformation of the agriculture 
sector from subsistence to commercial farming by offering loans to the sector at 

affordable interest rates. Affordable interest rates have been identified to be a key driver to 

unlock the potentials of smallholder farmers. The agricultural sector in Tanzania has been 

characterized with low returns and therefore low interest rates for loans are needed to assist in 

enabling start up projects to take off. Lending at low interest rates to the smallholder farmers 

can nevertheless restrict the ability of the TADB to generate profits and can also result into 

operating losses which can deplete capital and endanger the long-term sustainability of the 

institution. To address this issue, the TADB intends to deploy the following measures in order 

to preserve capital and ensure funding sustainability: 

 Adequate pricing of loans to ensure that the overall yields remain positive: The 
TADB intends to recover all costs of financial intermediation (including administrative 

expenses, borrowing costs and provisions against expected losses) and to earn an 

appropriate return on capital. In its pricing policy, the TADB will charge a margin over 

the base rate plus fees and commissions to recover the administrative and operating 

costs incurred in generating, implementing and monitoring a loan as well as the cost of 

capital employed. While the smallholder farmers will be charged low interest rates, the 

TADB expects to compensate for this by charging the larger clients interest rates that 

are essentially market confirming. This cross-subsidization will enable the TADB to 

assist the smallholder farmers while generating positive returns to ensure sustainability. 

In addition, the TADB will diversify its portfolio by placing a small portion of its funds 

in government securities that offer risk free returns. Such diversification will lower the 

risk profile of the TADB’s portfolio while at the same time enhance its return; and 

 Moderating and controlling the issuance of new loans and advances: Issuance of 
new loans and advances will be subject to the availability of funding and compliance 

with existing capital adequacy regulations which require banks not to increase their risk 

weighted assets above the regulatory thresholds in relation to the size of core capital. 

In order to ensure compliance, the TADB’s Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO) 

will continually review its liquidity and capital adequacy and ascertain its ability to 

continue with the issuance of new loans. The TADB may temporarily withhold issuance 

of new loans and advances if liquidity and capital adequacy ratios are breached and if 

other circumstances are deemed necessary such as a deteriorating loan portfolio and 

high level of non-performing loans. 



 

9 

3.11. Furthermore, the TADB’s funding strategy has been developed in order to outline 
the potential sources of funding. While commercial banks mainly rely on short-term customer 

deposits as the key source of funding, the TADB’s funding will come from the main 

shareholder and from concessionary borrowings from international DFIs, at least in the first 

few years of operations. This will contribute to ensuring that the TADB’s funds are low-cost 

putting it in a position to extend affordable loans to its target beneficiaries particularly the 

smallholder farmers to whom funding must be affordable to pursue profitable agriculture 

activities to transform their lives into improved standards. 

Technical Assistance 

3.12. As agreed with the TADB and the Tanzanian authorities during the appraisal 
mission, a portion of the proposed funding of UA 1.0 million (equivalent to USD 1.39 

million) will be utilized to fund a TA Program to further enhance and strengthen the 

capacity of this institution. The Bank Group has vast experience in supporting national 

development finance institutions in Africa. Through this present project, the Bank Group will 

not only provide the United Republic of Tanzania with the necessary financial resources to 

further support the TADB, thereby enabling it to expand its operations and outreach, but will 

also contribute to building and enhancing the capacity of this national DFI through the proposed 

TA Program. The Bank Group’s solid expertise and knowledge of DFIs has fed into the design 

of the TA Program which is expected to contribute to ensuring that the TADB is in a position 

to intermediate the funds provided to it in an impactful and sustainable manner. The main 

components are provided below and are based on a preliminary assessment of the TADB. 

However, once the funds are disbursed, the TADB will be expected to implement the TA 

Program beginning with a thorough needs assessments to further fine-tune the list of areas that 

need to be enhanced and strengthened. That said, the below components will serve as a good 

guide for implementation: 

 Component 1: Process and System Improvements 

This will include support to the TADB in key areas such as asset and liability 

management, risk management, corporate and capital planning, credit underwriting, 

risk based pricing, product development and costing and the enhancement and/or 

development of relevant strategies, procedures, policies and guidelines (especially 

those that relate to internal control systems and audit, code of conduct, financial 

management and accounting and procurement); 

 Component 2: Information Technology (IT) 

This component will cover the IT needs of the TADB in terms of banking software and 

systems in order to enhance outputs and functionalities. It will also cover the TADB’s 

IT infrastructure and management information system (MIS) for portfolio management 

and monitoring including the tracking of the development outcomes of its lending 

activities; and 

 Component 3: Building staff capacity 

This component will entail training staff in key areas such as risk analysis, risk 

management, credit underwriting, asset and liability management, use of new IT/MIS 

and environmental and social risks management. Evidently, the needs assessment will 

provide a more comprehensive list of the needs of the staff of the TADB. Further, to 

ensure maximum impact for this component, the training that will be provided to the 

staff of the TADB will be done primarily on the premises of the TADB or on location 

in Dar es Salaam as to ensure that: i) most of the staff are trained and ii) that the 

resources of this component are not unnecessarily spent on travel. 

 



 

10 

3.13. The TA Program is designed to strengthen the capacity of the TADB. This is 
intended to contribute to building a sound banking business so that this national DFI is not only 

used as an intermediary to channel financing to the agriculture sector in Tanzania, but also to 

build institutional development of a DFI to enable sustainable lending and provide a strong 

demonstration effect. 

Gender Impact 

3.14. Tanzania’s constitution guarantees equality of men and women and supports 
women’s full participation in social, economic and political life. The Government of 

Tanzania has also taken steps to mainstream gender perspectives in sector policies, strategies 

and programs. In agriculture, even though the Kilimo Kwanza Initiative does not specifically 

address gender, pillar 8 of its implementation framework (Science, Technology and Human 

Resources for Kilimo Kwanza) calls for mainstreaming gender in Kilimo Kwanza and 

developing programs to strengthen the position of women in agriculture. 

3.15. Agriculture is a major source of livelihood for most rural populations in Tanzania. 
Women comprise a large proportion of the agricultural labor force yet women farmers are 

consistently found to be less productive than male farmers. There are several barriers that 

hinder their performance. These include limited access to finance as well as inadequate skills 

to run and manage operations and businesses. This project is therefore expected to contribute 

to narrowing the financing gap for women in the agriculture sector while also enhancing their 

skills and capacity. 

3.16. During the appraisal mission, the mission team emphasized the need for the TADB 
to continue targeting and supporting women as beneficiaries considering their critical 

role in the agriculture sector. More concretely, following discussions with the TADB, it has 

been agreed that the project will include the following key actions to support women in 

agriculture: 

 As the TADB scales up support to the agriculture sector in Tanzania through the 
mobilized ADF funds, at least 20% of these resources will be specifically dedicated 

by it towards supporting women in agriculture. This is in addition to the already 

existing access by women to funding from the TADB (i.e. the remaining 80% will still 

go to both men and women); 

 The TADB will put in place a mentoring program for women in agriculture to 
enhance their technical, farming and managerial skills. The mentoring would 

consist of linking women with the TADB’s larger and more experienced clients from 

whom they can benefit and learn. That said, for the mentoring to work, it is critical to 

put in place an effective incentivization scheme for the mentors including, but not 

limited to, small reductions in their cost of borrowing; and 

 At the institutional level, while the TADB has designated a staff member as a 
gender champion, this action is not supported by an institutional policy or 

strategy. During the appraisal mission, it was established that the TADB’s credit policy 

does not explicitly mention women. To address these gaps, the TADB will develop a 

gender policy that will guide how it addresses gender issues internally and externally 

with its clients. Furthermore, the TADB will review its credit policy to reflect its 

commitment to advancing the empowerment of women. The Bank Group will support 

the TADB to develop a Gender Policy which will need to be in place prior to the 

disbursement of the funds. 

 

 



 

11 

Social Issues 

3.17. The funds to be provided to the TADB are expected to contribute towards 
economic empowerment of small scale farmers, entrepreneurship and employment 

creation. These funds are expected to contribute to growth of small businesses, income 

generation, household savings and a surge in value addition activities. The TADB maintains a 

tiered pricing framework whereby it provides funding at low interest rates to the smallholder 

farmers while it charges more to the larger and more established corporate entities in the 

agriculture sector. This cross-subsidization enables the TADB to provide affordable funding to 

the smaller farmers while generating sufficient income to sustain its business. Financial literacy 

among rural farmers and especially women has been identified as a major challenge and the 

TADB is in the process of setting up a technical assistance fund which will focus on capacity 

development for the small farmers. 

Environment Impact 

3.18. The project has been classified as Category FI-B in line with the Bank Group’s 
assessment procedures. The TADB’s portfolio and the proposed investments to be supported 

with financing from the ADF are considered medium risk with limited adverse environmental 

or social impacts that are largely reversible and readily addressed through mitigation measures. 

3.19. At the request of the AfDB and with its guidance and input, the TADB has 
developed and approved an Environmental and Social (E&S) Policy and an 

Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS), which will provide the 

procedures and workflow that will be followed for each investment by the institution to 

manage all levels of environmental and social risks. The proposed investments will be 

screened, reviewed and evaluated against national laws and regulations, the Bank Group’s 

Exclusion List and Integrated Safeguard System (ISS) as well as other applicable performance 

standards or safeguard requirements (specifically those pertinent to the agriculture sector 

including land issues, water management, pollution and climate risks). 

Lessons Learned Reflected in Project Design 

3.20. The AfDB has learned numerous lessons from its work with national and regional 
DFIs from across Africa as well as in its experience providing technical assistance 

programs. These lessons, and the manner in which they have been taken into account in the 

current operation, are: 

Lesson How it will be addressed 

National DFIs across Africa face common 

challenges including: 

 Emphasis placed on loan approvals and 
disbursements over loan quality resulting in 

high non-performing loans 

 Weak administrative systems, procedures 
and reporting systems; and 

 Insufficient human resource capacity. 

The proposed technical assistance program is 

expected to contribute to achieving the 

following key objectives: 

 Enhanced credit underwriting processes 
and skills; 

 Improved IT and management information 
systems for portfolio reporting and 

monitoring; and 

 Skilled staff through relevant trainings. 

3.21. In addition to the above, during the appraisal mission, extensive discussions were 
held with the senior management of the TADB as well as with government officials on the 

need to ensure that the institution, which is newly established, is encouraged to operate 

based on internationally recognized good practice principles that are considered as key 

for success and long-term sustainability. These principles have been identified by the AfDB 

as well as sister institutions such as the World Bank and include: 



 

12 

 While the TADB is currently owned by the Government of Tanzania, it was 
favorably noted that the aim of the authorities, over the medium to long-term, is 

to attract reputable investors to be shareholders in the institution. This is important 

as the shareholding structures of DFIs are moving away from 100% state ownership 

towards mixed public-private capital structures. This will be expected to strengthen the 

governance of the TADB. It was also noted that the governance of the TADB has been 

designed with a board of directors that is predominately composed of independent 

directors selected based on a competitive process. Indeed, as per the TADB’s 

memorandum and articles of association (MEMARTS), the board is designed to consist 

of between 7 and 9 directors, the majority of whom meant to be non-executive and non-

government officials. As per the MEMARTS, the directors are also to be selected to be 

qualified and capable individuals with a high degree of skills, expertise, integrity and 

stature. This is key as it contributes to enhancing performance and minimizing political 

interference. The governance of the TADB was thoroughly discussed, including with 

senior government officials, and it was agreed to ensure independence of both the 

management and the board with their recruitment based on merit only; 

 The need to ensure that the TADB is operationally and financially sustainable with 
overall pricing that reflects costs and credit risk. While the smallholder farmers will 

be provided with funding that is concessional, the TADB will make up for this by 

charging its larger borrowers interest rates that will be market-conforming as well as 

funding itself with low cost liabilities which will help in absorbing the high transaction 

costs associated with serving the smallholder farmers; 

 The importance of putting in place strong administrative systems, procedures, 
policies and guidelines and this is what the TA Program will address. The TA 

Program will also address staff capacity and skills; 

 The importance of avoiding credit misallocation and politically motivated lending 
and to this end, it was agreed that the funding to be provided to the TADB will not 

be utilized for onward lending to ineligible persons. Advancing loans to them will 

lead to automatic acceleration of the loan and cancellation of undisbursed amounts4; 

 During the appraisal mission, it was noted that the TADB is subject to prudential 
regulation and supervision by the Bank of Tanzania under its guidelines for 

development finance institutions. This was also viewed positively as independent 

regulation and supervision by the financial sector regulator rather than a line ministry 

with conflicts of interest enforces disciplined management; and 

 In addition, it was agreed that the TADB should aim as much as possible to operate 
as a wholesale lending institution as international experience has shown that 

wholesale-only development finance institutions that provide funding through 

                                                 
4 Ineligible Persons means the following persons who are ineligible to access funding extended with the proceeds of 

the ADF loan: 

a) Politically Exposed Persons defined as: head of state or head of government and their deputies, if any; cabinet 
minister of central or local government; member of a legislature of central or local government; deputy minister 

or equivalent rank; ambassador or attaché or counsellor of an ambassador; military officer with a rank of general 

or above; chief executive officer of a state-owned company or a state-owned bank; head of a government agency; 

judge; and senior official of a political party represented in a central state or local government legislature; 

b) Civil servants with the position of director, or its equivalent, and above employed by central, state or local 
government; 

c) Directors and senior management of the TADB; and 

d) Any related parties of the persons falling under clauses a) through c) above. 



 

13 

eligible financial institutions5 perform better than those that engage in retail 

operations. A wholesale approach is particularly appropriate with respect to financing 

underfunded segments. Retail development finance institutions are also perceived by 

their retail borrowers as entities that do not need to be repaid as they are owned by 

governments. While the TADB has been established to focus principally on wholesale 

lending activities, it is currently carrying out retail lending although it is expected to 

move towards wholesale lending as more funding is provided to it. The TADB is 

committed to this and will ensure that the funding from the ADF is extended through 

eligible financial institutions. It is worth noting that while extending funding through 

wholesale lending, the TADB will work with financial institutions which will be 

incentivized to enter the agriculture sector or expand service to it by augmenting their 

capacity and by providing them with long-term funding combined with technical 

assistance to increase the attractiveness of the agriculture sector and/or make 

commercial bank credit feasible. Thus, rather than replacing markets, the TADB will 

enhance them by providing term financing to financial institutions for on-lending 

(providing maturities that are otherwise unavailable to the financial institutions) and 

technical assistance to strengthen the financial institutions’ capacity to serve the 

agriculture sector. Furthermore, by working with such financial institutions, the 

TADB’s capital will essentially be protected as the capital of the financial institutions 

will stand between the TADB and any credit losses6.  

3.22. It is worth highlighting that the TADB has been incorporated as a public limited 
company under the Companies Act no. 2 of 2002 and not through an act of parliament. 
This is key for avoiding political interference since the key reporting relationship will be with 

the shareholders and not with the national assembly and the presidency as is the case when the 

establishment of a company is through an Act of Parliament. Furthermore, as stated earlier, 

while the Government of Tanzania is currently the sole shareholder, their intention is to bring 

in additional equity investors overtime so that the shareholding structure of the TADB moves 

away from 100% state ownership towards a mixed public-private capital structure. If this is 

achieved, the governance of the institution will be further strengthened. 

4. IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS 

Procurement Arrangements 

4.1. All procurement of goods, works and services will be carried out in accordance 
with the Procurement Policy for Bank Group Funded Operations and Methodology for 

its Implementation, dated October 2015. The various activities under the TA Program of the 

equivalent of UA 1 million involve the procurement of both goods and consultancy services. 

In the case of consultancy services, the procurement will be carried out on the basis of the 

                                                 
5 The following are minimum eligibility criteria for the financial institutions: i) must be duly licensed and at least 

two years in operation, ii) owners and board of directors should be “fit and proper”, iii) must have qualified and 

experienced management, adequate organization and institutional capacity for its specific risk profile, iv) must be 

in “good standing” with its supervisory authority and remain in compliance at all times, v) must have well defined 

policies and written procedures for management of all types of financial risks, vi) x) must have adequate internal 

audits and controls for its specific risk profile and vii) must have adequate management information systems. 

6 While extending funding through financial institutions, the TADB will need to ensure that the end beneficiaries 

(especially the smallholder farmers) are able to gain access to funding that is affordable in addition to having long 

tenors. To this end, the TADB will explore various mechanisms including auctioning credit to the financial 

institutions especially those serving the smallholder farmers. In order to put competitive pressure on the spreads 

offered by the financial institutions to the final borrowers, the TADB’s interest rates will be determined by an 

auction process under which the financial institutions will compete on the basis of the spreads they propose to 

offer to their borrowers. This innovative approach will ensure that the affordability of the funds being extended 

by the TADB. 



 

14 

Quality and Cost Based Selection (QCBS) method. In particular, the TADB will be required to 

select and engage consultant(s) based on a transparent and competitive process, including well 

developed terms of reference, international advertising, short-listing and a robust evaluation 

process. An evaluation report prepared by the TADB will have to be accepted by the Bank 

Group within 14 calendar days, before recruiting the consultant(s). The procurement of goods, 

related to the IT upgrades component of the TA Program, will need to conform to established 

commercial practices acceptable to the Bank Group so that such procedures result in 

competitive market prices for the goods. The TADB will need to ensure adherence to 

appropriate procurement procedures which will be periodically reviewed for compliance. For 

the rest of the funding, the procurement of goods, works and services by the TADB’s target 

beneficiaries will need to conform to established commercial practices acceptable to the Bank 

Group so that such procedures result in competitive market prices for the goods, works and 

services and meet the needs of the TADB’s beneficiaries. The TADB will ensure adherence to 

appropriate procurement procedures and the Bank Group will periodically review the TADB’s 

compliance in ensuring that such procedures are followed by its target beneficiaries. 

Monitoring, Financial Management and Audit Arrangements 

4.2. The Bank Group conducted an assessment on the adequacy of the financial 
management systems of the TADB, the Executing Agency, based on the Bank’s 2014 

Financial Management Implementation Guidelines and concluded that the overall risk is 

Moderate. The TADB will be monitored, supervised and evaluated regularly by the Bank 

Group. It will prepare annual financial statements in accordance with International Financial 

Reporting Standards (IFRS). The financial statements will include in the notes to the accounts 

the disbursement of the proceeds of the ADF loan by the URT to the TADB and will be audited 

by the Controller and Auditor General (CAG) or a private audit firm appointed by the CAG in 

accordance with the United Republic of Tanzania statutory requirements by applying 

International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions which are acceptable by the Bank. 

Within six months after the end of each financial year, the TADB will be required to submit a 

copy of its audited financial statements together with the management letter on the weaknesses 

identified by the auditors and the TADB’s management responses and implementation plan of 

the auditor’s recommendations. Furthermore, the TADB is licensed and supervised by the 

central bank and required to meet prudential requirements as regards to capital adequacy, loan 

provisioning and recognition of loan losses as well as other relevant regulations. These will be 

regularly verified by the Bank Group. Relevant to this, the URT should ensure that the TADB 

at all times maintains in full force and effect an operating license from the central bank and all 

such other consents, licenses, approvals, authorizations and exemptions required under the laws 

of Tanzania for the TADB to carry out its business and perform its obligations under this 

present project.  

Sustainability 

4.3. The TADB’s viability is viewed positively for a number of reasons including its 
sound corporate governance and prudent lending strategy. Also, as an institution that is 

expected to focus principally on wholesale lending, this will contribute to preserving the quality 

of its assets and capital. Further, the TADB will be subject to limited liquidity risk as it funds 

itself through long-term funding and not through short-term deposits. In addition, the TADB 

will be subject to prudential regulation and supervision by the central bank, which will enforce 

requirements similar to those applied to commercial banks. Furthermore, the proposed 

technical assistance program will play a key role in strengthening the capacity and enhancing 

the performance of the institution. 

 

 



 

15 

4.4. The long-term sustainability and success of the TADB hinge on its ability to 
mobilize additional capital from the Government7 and other investors as well as low-cost 

debt liabilities from international DFIs. To fund itself, the TADB will also explore the 

possibility of issuing bonds in the local capital market after building a track record of operations 

and thoroughly assessing the market conditions to establish the depth of liquidity as these will 

influence the success rates and costs of the bonds. The importance of mobilizing low cost 

funding is fully recognized by the TADB as articulated in its funding strategy. This, combined 

with its determination to generate positive returns from its lending activities, should ensure that 

any advantage that may accrue to the TADB in being able to fund itself with low cost liabilities 

be accrued by it as a contribution to its equity. 

Risk Management 

4.5. Potential risks are rated as mostly Medium and are expected to be mitigated as 
outlined below: 

 

Potential Risk Rating Mitigation Measures 

High operational costs 

associated with reaching 

out to smallholder 

farmers. 

Medium The TADB will implement measures to minimize costs including reaching smallholder 

farmers through wholesale lending by working with eligible financial institutions and 

developing innovative products and services such as mobile banking. 

Impact of lending at low 

interest rates on financial 

sustainability. 

Medium The TADB is fully aware of the importance of sustainability and while the smallholder 

farmers will be supported with affordable loans, the institution will aim to balance its 

portfolio by also targeting larger clients to whom the funds will be priced based on market 

confirming terms. Additionally, the TADB will invest a portion of its funds in low 

risk/high return government securities to further support the cross subsidization of the 

smallholder farmers. Finally, the TADB expects to continue funding itself through the 

mobilization of low-cost funds. 

The TADB unable to 

effectively intermediate 

the funds extended to it. 

Medium The proceeds of the ADF loan will be made available to the TADB in two equal tranches 

to ensure that it is able to absorb the resources made available to it and effectively 

intermediate them. 

The TA Program is not 

implemented properly by 

the TADB. 

Low to 

Medium 

The proceeds of the ADF loan will be made available to the TADB in two tranches and 

the disbursement of the second tranche will be conditional on the TADB having 

successfully implemented two of the three components of the TA Program. The TADB is 

also strongly committed to ensuring that the TA Program is successfully implemented. 

Funds extended to 

ineligible persons. 

Low to 

Medium 

The TADB will be required to ensure that the funds are not on-lent to ineligible persons. 

Lending to such persons will result in the accelerated repayment of the ADF loan. 

Political capture of the 

TADB.  

Medium 

to High 

This risk is primarily managed with an innovative governance structure. While the TADB 

will be majority government-owned, its MEMARTS provides that the majority of 

directors should be non-executive and non-government officials chosen based on a 

competitive and transparent process. Cognizant that governance failures contributed to 

thwarting the effectiveness of existing DFIs across Africa, the Tanzanian authorities are 

fully committed to a robust governance structure for the TADB. In addition to providing 

comfort as regards the strategic direction of the TADB, the MEMARTS requires that the 

directors should be qualified and capable individuals with a high degree of skills, 

expertise, integrity and stature. The TADB will also be subject to regulation, licensing 

and supervision by the central bank, thus further strengthening the governance 

arrangements as well as due diligence as regards to its operational and financial capacity. 

Finally, the Bank Group will ensure continuous supervision of all key operational aspects 

to ensure good governance.  

                                                 
7 While the Government is committed to injecting additional equity into the TADB, it must scale up its efforts. 

The TADB’s MEMARTS provides that the initial paid-up capital of the institution is TZS 100 billion to be raised 

gradually to TZS 800 billion. The Government will need to significantly scale up its efforts to mobilize additional 

equity for the TADB to ensure that it complies with the MEMARTS. 



 

16 

Knowledge Building 

4.6. The present operation is expected to generate considerable knowledge and 
experience that will add value and build up lessons for the design and management of 

similar projects across Africa. The lessons learnt will be documented including those on 

supporting smallholder farmers especially women. Bank supervision missions, quarterly and 

annual progress reports, mid-term review, audit and completion reports will also provide an 

opportunity to capture knowledge on relevant aspects of this project. As a new institution, the 

TADB will benefit from working with the Bank Group to learn about its procedures and 

safeguards which it can incorporate to enhance itself. The Bank Group will share the lessons 

learnt from the experience of implementing this project in Tanzania. 

5. LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY 

5.1. The proceeds of the loan from the African Development Fund to be provided to 
the United Republic of Tanzania will be made available to the TADB by way of a loan in 

accordance with the Bank Group’s On-Lending Policy (ADB/BD/WP/90/36; 

ADF/BD/WP/90/38). The terms and conditions of the loan from the URT to the TADB will 

be in line with those of the loan from the ADF to the URT except for the loan currency which 

will be Tanzanian Shilling. This structure is essentially innovative as it enables the Bank Group 

to support a national development finance institution without being exposed to the risks that 

would be associated with direct lending to such an institution. Plus, it is deploying a debt 

instrument to a country whose credit rating is much better than the rating that would be 

applicable to a direct loan to the beneficiary institution. 

5.2. The legal instrument to be used for this project is a loan agreement between the 
United Republic of Tanzania and the African Development Fund. This loan agreement will 

enter into force subject to fulfilment by the United Republic of Tanzania of the provisions of 

section 12.01 of the General Conditions Applicable to the African Development Fund Loan 

Agreements and Guarantee Agreements. 

5.3. The ADF loan will be extended to the URT and its proceeds transferred by the 
URT to the TADB as a loan on the same terms and conditions (except for the loan 

currency). The URT will sign a loan agreement with the ADF while the URT and the TADB 

will sign an on-lending agreement. 

5.4. The proceeds of the ADF loan will be disbursed in two equal tranches upon 
fulfillment of agreed disbursement triggers. The obligation of the African Development Fund 

to make the disbursement of the first tranche will be conditional upon entry into force of the loan 

agreement and the submission by the URT and the TADB of evidence of the fulfillment of the 

following conditions, each in form and substance satisfactory to the African Development Fund: 

 The opening by the United Republic of Tanzania of a special United States Dollar 
denominated account at the central bank of Tanzania for the deposit of the proceeds of the 

ADF loan. The opening of the account will be evidenced by a letter from the central bank 

confirming that the said account has been opened and providing the account numbers; 

 The opening by the TADB of a special Tanzanian Shilling denominated account at the 
central bank of Tanzania for the deposit by the URT of the proceeds of its loan to the TADB 

(the loan from the URT to the TADB will be in local currency meaning that the URT will 

take on the foreign exchange risk to which the TADB will not be exposed). The opening of 

the account will be evidenced by a letter from the central bank confirming that the said 

account has been opened and providing the account numbers; 

 An on-lending agreement between the URT and the TADB, relating to the loan from 
the URT to the TADB whose amount is equal to the loan from the ADF to the URT, in 

form and substance acceptable to the ADF, has been duly executed by the parties thereto. 



 

17 

The execution of the on-lending agreement shall be supported by a legal opinion issued to 

the ADF by a legal counsel acceptable to the ADF confirming that the on-lending 

agreement between the TADB and the URT, has been duly authorized, ratified and 

executed on behalf of the URT and the TADB and constitutes legal, valid and binding 

obligation of such parties; and 

 The TADB has adopted a Gender Policy in form and substance acceptable to the 
African Development Fund. 

5.5. The obligation of the ADF to disburse the second tranche of the ADF loan will be 
conditional on the following conditions: 

 Submission by the TADB of evidence, in form and substance satisfactory to the AfDB 
Group, that it has successfully implemented components 1 and 2 of the TA Program (noting 

that component 3 involves training staff which is a continuous activity). By linking the 

disbursement of the second tranche to the implementation of the TA Program, the Bank 

Group will be in a position to exercise due diligence as regards to progress; and 

 Supervision by the Bank Group of the utilization of the first tranche of the ADF loan 
and satisfaction that the funds were effectively deployed including towards supporting 

women through funding and the proposed mentoring program. 

5.6. In addition, for the disbursement of the two tranches of the ADF loan, the United 
Republic of Tanzania will be required to ensure that the funds are passed on to the TADB 

within a maximum of 14 calendar days of the URT receiving the funds from the ADF. 
Any delays will result in calls for potential suspension or accelerated repayment of the ADF 

loan. Additional events that may call for potential suspension or accelerated repayment of the 

ADF loan will include the following: i) violation of signed agreements or regulations affecting 

the ability of the TADB to fulfill its mandate or that affect its financial sustainability, ii) the 

TADB’s license has been withdrawn, revoked, amended or suspended, or its renewal has been 

withheld, so as to materially and adversely affect the ability of the TADB to carry out its 

functions and iii) extension of funding to ineligible persons. 

5.7. Finally, this present project complies with all the applicable AfDB Group policies 
including the On-Lending Policy (ADB/BD/WP/90/36; ADF/BD/WP/90/38) referred to 

earlier in paragraph 5.1. 

6. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION 

6.1. The proposed loan from the ADF to the United Republic of Tanzania, to be utilized 
by the URT to support the TADB, will contribute to enabling this national DFI to scale 

up support to the agriculture sector in Tanzania. This institution is expected to play a key 

role in facilitating attainment of sustainable food self-sufficiency and food security in Tanzania 

and in promoting and supporting the transformation of agriculture from subsistence to 

commercial farming in order to effectively and sustainably contribute to inclusive economic 

growth and poverty reduction. 

6.2. The Government of Tanzania is fully committed to the success of the TADB and has 
demonstrated this through the capital that it has injected so far from its own budget and its 

current efforts to mobilize additional funding from new sources including the ADF. The failure 

of the commercial banks to meet the funding needs of the agriculture sector provides a strong 

justification for Government intervention through the proposed borrowing from the ADF. This 

outside funding will enable the Government of Tanzania to support the TADB while providing 

it with the fiscal space for more spending in sectors and projects critical to the country’s 

development (including infrastructure projects planned to facilitate trade and industrialization). 

6.3. In the light of the foregoing, Management recommends that, for the purposes stipulated 



 

18 

in this report, the Board of Directors of the African Development Fund approves the proposed 

ADF loan of UA 67.27 million (equivalent to USD 93.51 million) to the United Republic of 

Tanzania.
