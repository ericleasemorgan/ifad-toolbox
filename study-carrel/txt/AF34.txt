Executive Summary 

 

 

Project overview: The Project to Strengthen Resilience of Rural Communities to Food and 

Nutrition Insecurity in Niger (PRECIS) aims to sustainably improve the food and nutrition 

security of rural households and strengthen their resilience to climatic and environmental 

shocks. It will support small-scale producers by removing production and marketing constraints 

in the cereal, market gardening, poultry and small livestock production sub-sectors, through 

two technical components that will have the following effects: (i) diversify production, increase 

yields and the capacity to adapt to external shocks, particularly climatic shocks, as well as 

improve the nutrition security of rural producers (including women and young people); and (ii) 

enhance the value of agro-sylvo-pastoral production surpluses through increased marketing on 

semi-wholesale markets and the promotion of agricultural entrepreneurship with sustainable 

integration into the local, regional and national economy.  

The main achievements expected from PRECIS include: (i) increased income for some 210,000 

households, or approximately 1,470,000 persons; (ii) the building of 117 water harnessing 

structures; (iii) the creation/strengthening of 30,040 Rural Young Enterprises (RYEs), 

including at least 30% owned by women; (iv) direct support for 35,000 households in the form 

of nutrition education, benefiting 245,000 persons; (v) the opening of 660 literacy centres to 

build the capacity of 33,000 household members; (vi) the strengthening/consolidation of 2,080 

producer organisations/groups to improve their technical and management capacity; (vii) the 

creation/consolidation of approximately 45,060 direct jobs in rural areas; (viii) the training of 

at least 33,000 beneficiaries in the various themes related to climate change adaptation and the 

management and promotion of micro-enterprises; (ix) the construction of 9 semi-wholesale 

markets and 18 operational collection centres; (x) the setting up of 10 operational farmers' 

houses offering input and production equipment supply services to family farmers; (xi) the 

rehabilitation of 348 km of roads linking production areas to collection centres and semi-

wholesale markets; and (xii) enhancement, in the short and long term, of the resilience of 

communities in the target areas enabling them to cope with the effects of COVID-19 and other 

natural and health shocks in the future.  

The overall programme will be implemented over a six-year period for a total sum of UA 147.80 

million (Bank financing will cover a five-year period). The Bank's contribution to the project 

financing will amount to UA 25.859 million, provided in the form of a grant from the Transition 

Support Facility (TSF). More specifically, the Bank's financing will be earmarked for the "water 

harnessing" and "agricultural entrepreneurship" components and will be incorporated into the 

operational mechanism of the IFAD-funded Family Farming Development Programme 

(ProDAF), which will be strengthened.  

In the context of the response to post-COVID-19, the project plans to carry out a short- and 

medium-term emergency programme to help people affected by the disease who were obliged 

to deplete their stocks and savings. This operation will restore the productive base of farmers 

in the project area who have been severely hit by the pandemic.  

Needs assessment: The size and fertility of farmland in the project area is steadily declining 

due to lack of water, loss of vegetation cover, arid climate, erosion and increasing population 

pressure. Surface water resources are severely affected by recurrent and chronic droughts. 

Moreover, Niger is facing a situation of growing insecurity, characterized by terrorist attacks 

on the borders with Nigeria and Mali, aggravating the people’s vulnerability. The livelihood of 

the population concerned by the project consists mainly of small-scale agriculture and family 

livestock farming, which employ more than 85% of the workforce. Agriculture is the leading 



 

v 

 

sector in terms of economic activity in the region and in the country, accounting for the largest 

contribution to GDP, estimated at 43.4% in 2018. However, the region has huge, but 

inadequately exploited, resources in the agro-pastoral sector. The under-exploitation of these 

resources leaves the rural sector vulnerable to the vagaries of climate, which adversely impact 

agriculture by causing the degradation of natural resources. As a result, performance in terms 

of output and productivity is poor and food insecurity is a virtually permanent problem. With 

an estimated 200,000 hectares of land lost to desert encroachment annually, the environmental 

situation of the project is all the more precarious due to the magnitude of land degradation, poor 

preservation of biodiversity, and difficulties in ensuring the sustainable management of land 

and water resources. This project aims to sustainably improve the food and nutrition security 

of rural households in the targeted areas and to strengthen their resilience to climatic shocks 

and natural resource degradation. It will work towards the emergence of development poles in 

four regions of the country, which are home to 12.9 million inhabitants, representing 60.2% of 

the national population.  

Value added for the African Development Bank: For more than 20 years, the Bank has 

accumulated special experience in Niger in the area of water harnessing and natural resource 

protection. It has financed about a dozen studies and projects (PMET Tahoua, PADAZ Zinder, 

PADL Diffa, PVDT Dosso-Tillaberi, PMERSA-MTZ, PROMOVARE, PDIPC, P2RS, etc.) for 

specific regions of the country, and which have improved the living conditions of men and 

women in rural areas, while developing technical and organisational approaches tailored to 

local contexts. The Bank has become a privileged partner in this sector thanks to its success in 

water control and harnessing. On the strength of this experience and given the numerous 

challenges that Niger still faces (climatic, economic, security, etc.), the Bank must continue its 

efforts in the areas of water harnessing, women's empowerment and support for agricultural 

entrepreneurship. The Bank's operations will help reduce poverty, promote youth and women's 

employment, strengthen adaptation to climate change and increase the resilience of vulnerable 

segments of the population to food and nutrition insecurity. By co-financing PRECIS, the Bank, 

in full compliance with its strategic guidelines, will strengthen the partnerships already 

established with other TFPs and contribute significantly to the mobilization of financial 

resources for a wide-ranging programme. 

Knowledge building: PRECIS will contribute to the training and the consolidation of the 

know-how of producers. With regard to resilience to climate change, the project will develop 

and disseminate innovative technologies in agriculture and small-scale livestock farming, for 

both production and processing activities, while enhancing local know-how and skills in the 

Sahelian environment. In an inclusive manner, it will enable young people and women to 

develop technical and entrepreneurial capacities by settling on land with modern infrastructure 

and means of exploitation and will promote the development of para-agricultural activities 

through supported rural micro-enterprises. Furthermore, it will support the water harnessing at 

regional level and provide expertise in terms of irrigation techniques at the individual and local 

levels, coupled with the judicious use of climate information. The project will help to build 

women's leadership capacity and strengthen their economic empowerment, as well as contribute 

to the greater implementation of gender equality-promoting policies. The mechanisms for 

disseminating and capitalizing on the project's outcomes and best practices, and the process of 

generating endogenous value for the benefit of vulnerable groups through the development of 

value chains will also contribute to knowledge building.

The project will be coordinated by the staff of the National Representation and Technical 

Assistance Unit (CENRAT), which will benefit from skills transfer. Best practices in water 

resource management, irrigation, agricultural extension, database management, dissemination 

and use of climate information, youth entrepreneurship and environmental and social 

safeguards will be capitalized on and disseminated, using various communication mechanisms 

already set up under PRECIS (awareness-raising meetings, agricultural advisory services, 

farmer field schools, etc.).

NIGER 

 

PROJECT TO STRENGTHEN RESILIENCE OF RURAL COMMUNITIES TO FOOD 

AND NUTRITION INSECURITY IN NIGER (PRECIS) 

 

Management submits this report and recommendations concerning the proposed award of a TSF 

grant of UA 25.859 million to the Republic of Niger to finance the Project to Strengthen Resilience 

of Rural Communities to Food and Nutrition Insecurity in Niger (PRECIS). 

I  STRATEGIC THRUST AND RATIONALE  

1.1. Project Linkages with Country Strategy and Objectives  

1.1.1 Niger's 2018-2022 Country Strategy Paper (CSP) is based on two strategic pillars, with 

two main sub-pillars, namely: mobilisation and harnessing of water resources, and development 

of agro-pastoral value chains. These two areas are already being supported by the Bank and 

other TFPs, whose efforts have yielded encouraging outcomes that will be consolidated and 

amplified by PRECIS, as part of the consolidation of the "development poles" approach that is 

already in place and which aims to promote the transformation of production systems and the 

establishment of strong links between the various segments of the value chains within the main 

agro-pastoral sub-sectors. PRECIS is also in line with the foundations of the 3N (Nigeriens 

Nourish Nigeriens) Initiative, which aims to protect the people of Niger from hunger and 

malnutrition, in the long term, and to create conditions enabling them to participate fully in 

national production and improve their income. Furthermore, in 2018, the Government of Niger 

developed an "Integrated Programme for Resilience to Food and Nutrition Insecurity" (Pro-

resilience Programme 2019-2021), aimed at, inter alia: (i) increasing and diversifying agro-

sylvo-pastoral and fisheries production; (ii) ensuring the regular supply of agricultural and agri-

food products to rural and urban markets; and (iii) improving the people's resilience to food 

crises and natural disasters and/or climatic shocks. The project activities will also be in line 

with the Small-Scale Irrigation Strategy in Niger (SPIN), which is currently being implemented, 

as well as with the Five-Year Action Plan for the implementation of the National Gender Policy 

(NGP), whose vision for 2027 is to "build, with all stakeholders, a society, without 

discrimination, where men and women, girls and boys have equal opportunities to participate 

in its development and enjoy the benefits of its growth". Lastly, the project is consistent with 

Niger's nationally determined contribution (NDC), particularly in the context of climate 

adaptation and resilience in the agricultural sector, as well as the reduction of emissions related 

to land use patterns and land allocation.  

1.2. Rationale for Bank Intervention  

1.2.1 For more than 20 years, the Bank has accumulated special experience in Niger in the 

area of water harnessing and natural resource protection. Indeed, it has financed about a dozen 

studies and projects (PMET Tahoua, PADAZ Zinder, PADL Diffa, PVDT Dosso-Tillaberi, 

PMERSA-MTZ, PROMOVARE, PDIPC, P2RS, etc.) targeted at the regions, and which have 

improved the living conditions of men and women in rural areas, while developing technical 

and organisational approaches tailored to local contexts. The Bank has become a privileged 

partner in this sector thanks to its success in water control and harnessing.  

 

1.2.2 The portfolio review, conducted by the Bank in December 2019, revealed that the 

Bank's active portfolio in Niger comprises 15 operations worth a total of just over UA 

476,000,000, with national projects accounting for 49.21%, multinational projects for 48.08%, 



 

2 

 

and a private sector operation for 2.7%. The average timeframe for fulfilling the conditions 

precedent to first disbursement is longer than the institutional standard, but the projects 

approved in 2019 performed well in terms of the timeframes for signature (1 month) and 

effectiveness (2.8 months). The review also noted satisfactory progress in the performance of 

the agricultural project portfolio. In particular, the PMERSA-MTZ, which was closed in 

September 2019, yielded satisfactory results, reflected especially in the completion of 69 water 

harnessing works, the development of 2,343 ha of small irrigated areas (PPI) and the 

reclamation of 2,100 ha of degraded land, making it possible to: (i) harness more than 70 million 

cubic metres of water; (ii) increase production by more than 168,720 tonnes (irrigated/flood-

recession and rain-fed crops); (iii) create more than 41,805 jobs; and (iv) multiply the income 

of producers by 3.9 times compared with the baseline situation. On the strength of the 

experience it has acquired over the past two decades, and given the numerous challenges that 

Niger still faces (climatic, economic, security, etc.), the Bank must continue its efforts on water 

harnessing, women's empowerment and support for agricultural entrepreneurship. By co-

financing PRECIS, the Bank, in line with its strategic orientations, will strengthen the 

partnerships already established with other TFPs (such as the co-financing of the Kandadji dam) 

and contribute to the significant mobilisation of financial resources. This type of investment is 

likely to limit security risks by targeting the most vulnerable local communities.  

 

1.2.3 The objectives of PRECIS are in keeping with the Bank's High 5s, which aim to feed 

Africa by 2025 and improve the living conditions of people of the continent by developing 

value chains, building the capacities of stakeholders, creating jobs and generating income. The 

project is directly linked to the specific areas of the Bank's Long-Term Strategy (LTS 2013-

2022), dealing with agriculture and food security, as well as gender issues. Moreover, by 

involving producers in private initiative, the project is aligned with the Bank's Ten-Year 

Strategy (2013-2022) and particularly with the objective of inclusive growth. The project also 

dovetails with the guidelines of the Bank's Agricultural Sector Strategy (2016-2025), which 

give pre-eminence to the development of value chains and agricultural entrepreneurship. 

Furthermore, the project supports the Bank's Climate Change Action Plan (CCAP II 2016-

2020), especially Pillar I on climate adaptation and resilience in key sectors including 

agriculture, as well as Pillar II which aims to promote low-emission development. 

1.3. Aid Coordination  

1.3.1 In Niger, official development assistance is coordinated by the consultative and 

consultation bodies of the Economic and Social Development Plan (PDES). Thus, several sector 

coordination poles have been set up. The Bank co-chairs the PDES “Infrastructure” sector 

coordination pole with the Ministry of Equipment. It is a member of the "rural areas 

transformation" pole. The Bank's role has been strengthened following the opening of its 

Country Office in Niger. The TFPs are also involved in the National Technical Committee in 

charge of monitoring PDES implementation. The technical partners are engaged in a constant 

process of dialogue and mutual consultation with a view to ensuring the effective coordination 

of their respective operations in Niger.

1.3.2  The operations of the various partners in the broader rural sector (agriculture, livestock, 
fisheries, environment, etc.) are presented in Annex A4 of Volume 2 and may be summarised as 

follows: 

II  PROJECT DESCRIPTION 

2.1. Project Components  

2.1.1 The overall objective of PRECIS is to sustainably improve the food and nutrition 

security of rural households and strengthen their resilience to climate shocks and natural 

resource degradation. The specific development objectives of the project are to increase rural 

household incomes, improve livelihoods and lives, and the socio-economic integration of young 

people (men and women) into productive rural occupations. 

2.1.2 PRECIS covers a period of five years and is structured around three main components: 

Component A, which will focus on sustainable agricultural development, strengthening the 

resilience of rural households and short-term response to the effects of COVID-19; Component 

B, which will focus on promoting youth entrepreneurship and market access; and Component 

C, which will be dedicated to coordination, management, monitoring/evaluation and knowledge 

transfer. The following table presents the main activities planned by component and sub-

details in the cost table in Annex B 2.2). 

2.2. Technical Solutions Adopted and Alternatives Considered  

2.2.1 The technical solutions selected take into account: (i) lessons and experiences derived 

from the implementation of similar projects; (ii) socio-economic and environmental criteria; 

and (iii) best practices in the development and maintenance of structures, with emphasis on the 

quality of their implementation. The Bank's intervention focuses on specific areas where it has 

a comparative advantage and proven experience. This positioning will favour the 

implementation of operations and ensure greater efficiency of interventions. The technical 

solutions relating to infrastructure were adopted on the basis of standards that would ensure the 

sustainability of the investments, at acceptable costs, and ownership on the part of the

beneficiaries. The design of water harnessing structures (mini-dams and weirs) takes into 

account the experience gained over more than two decades at both technical and organisational 

levels. The roads will be rehabilitated with special focus on the treatment of the critical points, 

which will allow uninterrupted and smooth traffic all year round. The table below summarises 

the main alternatives that were considered and finally rejected. 

Table 2.2: Alternative Solutions Considered and Reasons for Rejection  

Alternative 

Solutions  
Brief Description Reasons for Rejection 

Bank interventions 
in all components 

and sub-

components of 

PRECIS. 

TSF resources for this 
programme are limited and are 

mobilized to partially finance the 

various project activities, with 

no specific targeting. 

Spreading the Bank's funding across multiple 

activities would limit its impact and make 
implementation more difficult. Focusing TSF 

financing on water harnessing and youth 

employment facilitates implementation while 

remaining consistent with CSP priorities. 

Development of 

large irrigated 

areas downstream 

of dams. 

Development of large irrigated 

areas downstream of new dams. 

This solution is ill-adapted to all regional 

configurations and entails significant capital 

requirements, which would limit the number of 

structures and hence the number of people affected. 

Light resurfacing 

of the roads to be 

rehabilitated. 

Repairing existing roads by 

lightly resurfacing the wearing 

course in place. 

The targeted areas will not be opened up on a 

sustainable basis due to numerous critical points 

and crossings that have not been repaired. The 

option of comprehensive rehabilitation, including 

all the critical areas, was therefore selected. 

2.3. Project Type  

PRECIS is an investment operation that is in line with a programmatic approach co-financed 

from various resources including those of TSF, OFID, GEF, GCF and IFAD. The Government 

of Niger has not yet fully committed itself to implementing projects and programmes through 

the sector-based approach, on account of several institutional constraints. The programme-

based co-financing approach is at this stage more advisable, since it guarantees the achievement 

of outcomes and ensures the effective and efficient use of the resources allocated to the project 

which will, in addition, capitalise on the Bank's achievements in Niger. 

2.4. Project Cost and Financing Arrangements 

2.4.1 The total project cost is estimated at UA 147.802 million (CFAF 119.450 billion), of 

which UA 34.620 million is in foreign exchange (CFAF 27.979 billion) and UA 113.181 

million in local currency (CFAF 91.470 billion). Customs duties and taxes have been accounted 

for and will be borne by the State which will take the necessary steps to ensure that this 

arrangement is adhered to. The foreign exchange portion constitutes 23.4% of the total cost and 

the local currency portion amounts to 76.6%. Contingencies have thus been estimated at UA 

14.647 million (CFAF 11.837 million). The project cost by component and by expenditure 

category is summarized in tables 2.3 and 2.4 below.

private agricultural bank (BAGRI), the Government and the beneficiaries. The ADF 

contribution to PRECIS will amount to UA 25.859 million (CFAF 20.898 billion), accounting 

for 17.63% of the total project cost as shown in Table 2.5 below.

2.4.3 Slightly more than two-thirds of the Bank's financing is allocated to the Agricultural 

Development and Resilience component, mainly for the extension and development of irrigated 

land. About 15.5% is devoted to the promotion of youth and women's entrepreneurship and 

9.4% to operating expenses. Physical contingences account for 3% and financial contingencies 

for 5.5%. 

For ADF financing, and considering the country's tight budgetary context, the Government will 

not be required to make any financial contribution, apart from granting exemptions. Given the 

specific character of this programme and the nature of the activities financed, the various TFPs 

have decided to finance the project on a parallel basis. 

2.5. Project Area and Beneficiaries  

2.5.1 In its entirety, PRECIS covers 186 municipalities located in the regions of Dosso, 

Tahoua, Maradi and Zinder (PRECIS-AfDB will not be involved in the Dosso region), and will 

directly affect nearly 210,000 households, or approximately 1,470,000 people. The population 

of the neighbouring areas should also benefit indirectly from the momentum created by the 

Economic Development Pole (PDE) approach. The agro-socio-economic environment of the 

resident rural inhabitants is characterised by a low rate of access to support and development 

infrastructure, especially roads, shops and other infrastructure for processing and for promoting 

rural entrepreneurship, required to stabilise young people, ease the chores of women and reduce 

their economic vulnerability in the regions concerned. 

2.5.2 PRECIS will target more specifically: (i) sedentary small farmers engaged in cereal 

production (maize, sorghum, millet), rice farming in the Dosso region, market gardening, 

poultry farming and small-scale stockbreeding; (ii) employed or unemployed young men and 

women (18 to 35 years old) who wish to set up their own micro and small enterprises in the 

various selected sub-sectors; (iii) women farmers or women wishing to carry out income-

generating activities; (iv) actors upstream and downstream of the production chain, engaged in 

related trades and in service provision; (v) professional organizations (grassroots groups, 

cooperatives, unions and federations); (vi) vulnerable farming households that are motivated 

and wish to enlarge and develop their farms; and (vii) persons with disabilities in rural areas 



 

8 

 

who participate or intend to participate in activities along the selected value chains. PRECIS 

aims ultimately to achieve gender parity by ensuring that women (youth and adults) make up 

50% of project beneficiaries and that at least 30% of Rural Young Enterprises (RYEs) set up 

and/or strengthened are women-owned. 

2.6. Participatory Approach to Project Identification, Design and Implementation 

2.6.1 The project is the result of a participatory and inclusive approach that involves all 

stakeholders: technical services, producers' organisations, women/youth groups, civil society, 

the private sector, TFPs and projects, etc. These broad consultations, which took place at all the 

formulation and evaluation stages, focused particularly on the criteria for choosing operation 

sites, the prospects for developing the value chains of profitable sub-sectors, the opportunities 

for promoting youth employment and entrepreneurship and their financing mechanisms, the 

lessons derived from previous similar projects, the shortcomings noted during the 

implementation of the projects, the main PRECIS intervention guidelines and strategies, the 

role of various actors in the new project context and the operating methods for ensuring proper 

implementation of the project, and the opinions and recommendations of key players.  

2.6.2 The project design was based on experience gained from carrying out or having carried 

out operations on the ground (PMERSA, ProDAF), and conducted in close collaboration with 

rural communities and local stakeholders. The activities identified are the result of ongoing 

consultations conducted during implementation and take into account the needs expressed by 

the population, civil society (including women), partner NGOs, producers and development 

partners. During project preparation, IFAD and the Bank carried out numerous field visits to 

potential intervention sites and to sites where projects have already been implemented. These 

visits offered an opportunity to have discussions with the communities concerned in order to 

better identify the difficulties facing them and to define the priority interventions to be carried 

out. The implementation mechanisms planned at the regional level will enable this inclusive 

approach to be continued during the implementation phase. 

2.7. Consideration of the Bank's Experience and Lessons in the Project Design 

For more than 20 years, the Bank has accumulated special experience in Niger in the area of 

water harnessing and natural resource protection. Indeed, it has financed about a dozen studies 

and projects (PMET Tahoua, PADAZ Zinder, PADL Diffa, PVDT Dosso-Tillaberi, PMERSA-

MTZ, PROMOVARE, PDIPC, P2RS, etc.) targeted at the regions, and which have improved 

the living conditions of men and women in rural areas, while developing technical and 

organisational approaches tailored to local contexts. In particular, the PMERSA-MTZ project, 

worth UA 30.36 million, was concluded in September 2019, and its completion report, 

produced in November 2019, showed satisfactory outcomes with a rating of 3 out of 4. The 

design of the current project will incorporate lessons from the implementation of Bank portfolio 

projects in Niger, particularly in the agricultural sector, as well as those of TFPs, including 

IFAD. Overall, the main generic lessons derived from the implementation of water harnessing 

projects in Niger may be summarised as follows:  

 

  



 

9 

 

 

Commitments  Arrangements Adopted for PRECIS 

Delays in the start-up of initial works: For 

irrigation infrastructure projects, there are 

often significant delays in the start-up of 
works due to the non-availability of final 

design studies (FDS) and bidding documents 

(BDs). 

- Majority of existing FDS and BDs. Use of existing FDS and 

BDs already produced by PRODAF, PMERSA and DGGR;  

- Launching of the maximum number of procurements during 
years 1 and 2, including for major works; 

- Recruitment of an additional water resource management 

expert for the "water harnessing" component. 

Delays and bottlenecks encountered in the 

procurement process: The lengthy timeframes 

for the appraisal of procurement files, 

involving various parties (PMU, Bank, Govt., 

etc.), are often the cause of delays and have an 

impact on compliance with the schedule. 

- Quality in the preparation of BDs; 

- Strengthening of qualified staff at CENRAT; 

- Implementation of the recent circular prohibiting double ex-

ante controls (Govt. and AfDB); 

- Close monitoring of the validation and signing processes 

(posting of dedicated staff); and 

- Conduct of ex-post reviews/audits. 

Overall weakness and failure of enterprises: 

Irrigation projects in Niger are hampered by 

the low technical, organisational and financial 
capacity of enterprises, which makes it 

difficult to carry out works on time and in 

accordance with the required standards. 

- Quality of specifications in BDs; 

- Choice of suitable allotments; 

- Stringency in the procurement process; need to verify the 
actual experience of the companies and the projects they have 

previously implemented; 

- Adoption of a system for the close monitoring of works, 

involving qualified technicians; and 

- Capacity-building activities (companies; oversight offices,  

 and technical services). 

Difficulties in assuming responsibility for 

management and maintenance: Beneficiaries 

often find it difficult to ensure the proper 

management and maintenance of the 

infrastructure provided, and to meet operating 

costs. 

- Involvement of the communes and beneficiaries at all stages, 

including requiring financial and/or physical contributions 

from beneficiaries; 

- Setting up and training of representative and empowered 

structures in charge of management; 

- Capacity building and support for management structures; 

- Introduction of a water pricing system; and 

- Use of solar energy whenever possible to limit operating 

costs. 

2.8. Key Performance Indicators 

The monitoring and evaluation mechanism of the TSF financing will be part of the overall 

framework of the PRECIS mechanism, which is itself based on the existing PRoDAF 

mechanism. This system has a consolidator at central level (CENRAT), and M&E managers at 



 

10 

 

regional level supported by assistants. The mechanism is supported by a computerised system, 

with on-line information at regional level that geo-localises all the interventions. It is possible 

to filter requests by funding source. The system is based on permanent internal monitoring and 

periodic internal and external evaluations. Information is regularly collected and analysed, 

notably on: (i) progress towards the expected outcomes as set out in the project's logical 

framework, with the possibility of isolating those of TSF funding, and the performance of the 

actors involved in the implementation of activities; (ii) the recording and assessment of the 

effective involvement of beneficiaries, disaggregated by gender, at various stages of 

implementation; (iii) the attention given to cross-cutting aspects, nutrition, gender, youth, 

climate change, and fragility/vulnerability; and (iv) the effects and impacts of the project on 

beneficiaries, disaggregated by gender, through various types of surveys. A baseline study will 

be carried out at the start of the PRECIS to establish the values of the quantitative and qualitative 

indicators by region. The main indicators monitored, relating to TSF financing, will concern 

the number of water harnessing structures built, the areas benefiting from irrigation (hectares), 

the number of kilometres of roads rehabilitated, the number of jobs and micro-enterprises 

created, with special focus on the situation of young people and women, the number of young 

people supported, production levels (tonnes) and crop yields (t/ha) in the project area. 

III.  PROJECT FEASIBILITY 

3.1. Economic and Financial Performance 

Table 3.1: Key Economic and Financial Data 

NPV (baseline scenario) USD 102 million  

IRR (baseline scenario) 17.3 % 

ERR (baseline scenario) 18.8 %` 

3.1.1 The economic and financial analysis of PRECIS was conducted from the standpoint 

of national interest and covers the entire programme in calculating the overall return on the 

investments to be made. The analysis is based on the following assumptions: (i) a 20-year 

lifespan for the project, (ii) an opportunity rate of 10% was used to reflect the opportunity cost 

of capital in Niger, (iii) the analysis was done in constant prices and the economic benefits were 

expressed in constant values, and (iv) the supplementary agricultural production of farmers 

(millet, sorghum, cowpea, onions, cabbages, etc.) was enhanced. Crop budgets as calculated in 

the financial analysis were transformed into economic budgets by taking into account the 

economic prices (obtained using the benchmark price method) of outputs and inputs, and by 

eliminating financial costs. The detailed assumptions of the financial and economic analysis, 

the operating model tables (the baseline situation and the situation with project) and the 

financial and economic flows are recorded in Annex B7 of Volume 2. The results of the 

financial and economic analysis show that PRECIS is financially and economically viable. 

3.1.2 Financial performance: The analysis of financial return was based on the results 

produced by ProDAF's updated Economic and Financial Analysis system. For the main 

products, the results obtained suggest a satisfactory financial return for all production models. 

For market gardening, the internal rate of return (IRR) of the production models is between 

11.9% and 36%. For rain-fed cereal production (millet, sorghum and cowpea), gross margins 

are established according to the combinations between CFAF 14,000/ha and CFAF 85,000/ha, 

for IRRs of between 12% and 33%. In the case of micro-enterprises in the animal sector, gross 

margins are estimated at CFAF 58,000 (family chicken farming), CFAF 205,000 (family guinea 



 

11 

 

fowl farming), CFAF 1,033,000 (goat farming), and CFAF 1,860,000 (poultry marketing). The 

financial analysis also shows that specific youth activities offer opportunities for wealth and 

employment creation in rural areas. The following financial margins were thus recorded for the 

main activities (in CFAF million): 2.9 for meat grilling, 1.3 to 4 for onion conservation, 3 for 

egg production, 2 for bourgou production from two hectares of land, etc. 

3.1.3 Economic performance: On the basis of the adopted assumptions, the project's 

overall economic rate of return (ERR) is 18.9% and the net present value (NPV) of the net 

economic cash flow generated by PRECIS will be USD 102 million, which is a satisfactory 

result. A sensitivity analysis was carried out to test the ERR variation on the assumption of: (i) 

a 10% reduction/increase in costs and a 10% reduction/increase in profits, (ii) a variation in the 

survival rate of Rural Micro-Enterprises (RMEs), and (iii) a reduction in the size of the areas 

developed for irrigated crops. The results show that the ERR is sensitive to an increase in profits 

linked to an improvement in selling prices. In all cases, the ERR remains above the 10% 

opportunity rate. The other economic impacts of the project also concern the upstream effects 

of additional income generation on service providers (NGOs, enterprises, suppliers, 

consultancy firms, etc.), and the downstream effects of additional income generation on 

producers, traders and those engaged in processing, who are women for the most part. For 

households, the benefits of the project will include improved nutrition for vulnerable groups 

(children, women of childbearing age and the elderly), reduced medical bills, reduced hardship 

for agricultural workers, especially women, reduced incidence of monetary and non-monetary 

poverty, enhanced livelihoods and strengthened resilience to food insecurity and the effects of 

climate change for those targeted by PRECIS. 

3.2. Environmental and Social Impact 

3.2.1 Environment: PRECIS is classified in environmental and social category 1, in 

accordance with Niger's environmental and social assessment regulations and the Bank's 

Integrated Safeguard System. The prepared Environmental and Social Management Framework 

(ESMF) and the Pest and Pesticides Management Plan (PPMP) were reviewed and approved 

by the Bank, prior to their publication by the Borrower on 15 May 2020, and then by the Bank 

on 27 May 2020 following the Borrower's authorization of 25 May 2020. The Bank has 

ascertained that public consultations were duly held by the Borrower and the minutes thereof 

are annexed to the safeguard instruments that were prepared. 

The expected positive impacts are: (i) water control and land restoration; (ii) the preservation 

of pools of great biological interest; (iii) improved soil productivity; and (iv) decreased water 

erosion and land degradation within and downstream of developed areas. However, the 

following major and moderate adverse risks and impacts are expected: (i) bacteriological and 

physio-chemical pollution due to the increased use of agricultural inputs (chemical fertilisers 

and pesticides), coupled with the misuse of phyto-sanitary products; (ii) over-exploitation of 

wood for the construction of dead hedges around plots following their development for 

irrigation purposes; and (iii) outbreaks of waterborne diseases and cases of poisoning, etc. To 

address these risks and adverse impacts, environmental safeguard instruments that have been 

developed: (i) specify the procedure for ensuring the environmental and social management of 

project activities, and (ii) outline the environmental surveillance and monitoring programme as 

well as the arrangements for implementing safeguard measures, including the preparation of 

ESIAs/ESMPs and the conduct of audits during project implementation. 

  



 

12 

 

3.2.2 Social: A Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) developed pursuant to Decree No. 

2019-027/PRN/MESU/DD of 11 January 2019 was reviewed and approved by the Bank and 

published on the same dates as the ESMF and PMP.3.2.6. In terms of benefits, the project will 

directly affect nearly 210,000 households, or approximately 1,470,000 people. However, the 

potential social risks and impacts, ranging from major and moderate, are: (i) encroachment on 

the landed property of certain households during the construction of water control infrastructure 

(dams), irrigation facilities, market infrastructure and rural roads, etc.; (ii) land conflicts due to 

irrigation facilities (irrigated areas, various reservoirs, etc.), which will lead to a rapid surge in 

the value of land; and (iii) conflicts between farmers and herdsmen. 

The budget for the implementation of safeguard instruments is estimated at CFAF 612,000,000. 

To that, should be added the sum of CFAF 100,000,000 for the compensation of project-

affected persons (PAPs) in anticipation of the construction of water harnessing infrastructure 

and irrigation development works.  

At the institutional level, the National Representation and Technical Assistance Unit 

(CENRAT), which serves as the Project Implementation Unit, has a social safeguard specialist, 

and the process to recruit an IFAD-financed environmental safeguard and climate change 

specialist is under way. As far as Regional Project Management Units (RPMUs) are concerned, 

the recruitment of four environmental and social safeguard experts is planned, two of whom 

will be financed by the AfDB and the other two by IFAD. 

3.2.3 Climate change and green growth: The project is classified in Category 2 according 

to the Bank's climate information system. The project is therefore vulnerable to the impacts of 

climate change as it is located in the Sahel, a region highly sensitive to climate change. Niger 

is a country that is extremely vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The ND-GAIN 

climate vulnerability index ranks Niger as the second most vulnerable country in the world to 

climate change after Somalia. Niger's climate has become increasingly arid, with a sharp decline 

in rainfall and an increase in temperatures in recent decades. A more intense variability of 

Niger's climate is projected by 2050, characterized by higher risks of aridity, according to the 

dry scenario (a sharp drop in rainfall and rising temperatures), or by excessive humidity, 

according to the wet scenario. With regard to climate risks, the models indicate a predominance 

of droughts, heat waves, an upsurge in extreme wet events and locust invasions. Project 

operations may therefore be severely affected by climate change. The main climate risks that 

may affect the project outcomes are droughts, floods, increasing temperatures and irregular 

rainfall. The project as a whole aims to reduce climate vulnerability and strengthen the 

resilience of small-scale farmers to water scarcity and droughts through the harnessing and 

control of water, the development of small irrigation areas with solar-powered dewatering 

systems, agricultural diversification, improving access to climate-resilient seeds for family 

farmers, supporting the production, dissemination and use of climate information and services, 

as well as promoting youth agricultural entrepreneurship and market access. The reclamation 

of degraded agricultural land, watershed management and erosion control will also help to 

foster the long-term resilience of farmers to flood risks and water scarcity and ensure the 

sustainability of food production systems in Niger. The project will also contribute to climate 

change forecasting by producing and disseminating meteorological information to 

prevent/anticipate climatic shocks.  

3.2.4 Gender: Niger ranks 157th out of 189 countries on the gender inequality index of the 

2016 Human Development Report. This poor ranking is due to the persistence of gender 

discrimination and inequality in Niger, which causes enormous economic and social losses for 

the country. The loss of income associated with gender inequality was estimated in 2015 by the 



 

13 

 

IMF at 32% of GDP. Female-headed households are more severely affected by food insecurity 

at 59.4%, compared with 38.2% of male-headed households.  

To address the shortcomings hindering gender equality, the initiatives undertaken during the 

implementation of the IFAD-funded PRoDAF programme will be continued and strengthened 

within the context of PRECIS. These include, in particular: (i) improving the resilience of the 

most vulnerable households through the establishment of women's granaries; (ii) improving 

food, nutrition and hygiene practices in households; (iii) supporting the development of income-

generating activities for women and young people in the agricultural, pastoral, poultry and craft 

sectors; (iv) ensuring information, education, communication and advocacy for a change in 

behaviour that should lead to equitable access to productive resources for women and young 

people; (v) building the entrepreneurial capacity of women and young people by means of 

functional literacy training, institutional and organisational development of women's groups, 

study tours and training in self-employment through women's centres; (vi) providing chores-

easing equipment (grinding mills, boreholes, processing units, improved stoves, etc.) for 

women in the villages covered by the project; (vii) recruiting local assistants to organise and 

rally women's and youth groups around the structures built; and (viii) developing a gender 

strategy specific to PRECIS, drawing on the experience gained from implementing ProDAF.  

The project has thus been classified in category 2 of the Bank's gender marker system. The 

budget allocated more specifically to gender promotion and women's economic empowerment 

activities is estimated at UA 6 million. 

IV.  IMPLEMENTATION  

4.1. Implementation Arrangements  

4.1.1 Implementation modalities: PRECIS will be under the technical supervision of the 

Ministry in charge of Agriculture. It will be coordinated by the National Representation and 

Technical Assistance Unit (CENRAT), whose fiduciary and technical capacities were assessed 

and deemed acceptable by the Bank. Two orders, respectively designating CENRAT as the 

management and coordination unit for TSF financing and the Senior National Technical 

Assistant in charge of Policy Dialogue as Project Coordinator, will be signed by the Minister 

of Agriculture and Livestock. The signing of these two orders will constitute a condition 

precedent to project implementation. The current Steering Committee of ProDAF will also 

serve as the Steering Committee of PRECIS. Establishment Order No. xxxxx will be revised to 

accommodate the actors that are not yet included, in order to ensure the consistency of the 

operations and facilitate work coordination. This committee shall meet twice a year, and as 

many times as necessary, to review project outcomes, validate financial statements, discuss 

programmes and approve related budgets. To ensure implementation of the project, the current 

ProDAF mechanism, operating in the regions of Maradi, Tahoua and Zinder, will be used after 

adjustment to the specific context of PRECIS (for more details, see the current ProDAF 

mechanism in Annex C1). The project’s management will thus benefit from the various existing 

mechanisms relating to coordination, financial management, procurement, monitoring and 

evaluation, communication, etc. (for more details, see the current ProDAF mechanism in Annex 

C1). An assessment of the various existing mechanisms indicates that it should be relatively 

easy to adapt the current systems to the addition of a new source of financing and also to the 

requirements of the Bank, especially its rules and procedures.

To support the implementation of AfDB financing, additional staff will be recruited, funded 

with TSF resources. The additional staff should include: (i) one (1) resource management (RM) 

expert embedded in CENRAT to coordinate the "water harnessing" component; he/she will also 

specifically ensure the monitoring of all AfDB financing activities, focused on structuring 

works; (ii) two (2) environmental protection and social safeguard experts, who will be added to 

the two other IFAD-supported experts; (iii) one (1) procurement expert within CENRAT, in 

charge of the preparation and close monitoring of procurement files for Bank-financed 

operations; (iv) one (1) senior accountant specifically in charge of processing TSF financing 

accounts, under the responsibility of the CENRAT Administrative and Financial Manager 

(AFM); (v) two (2) "Youth Entrepreneurship" assistants who will be under the responsibility of 

the RPMU component manager and will maintain close working relations with the National 

Technical Assistant of CENRAT; three (3) accounting assistants under the responsibility of the 

AFMs of the Regional Project Management Units (RPMUs) in Maradi, Tahoua and Zinder; ten 

(10) local development assistants (LDAs), including six for the Agricultural Council and four 

for monitoring and evaluation. Of these 10 LDAs, 9 will be assigned to RPMUs and only 1 to 

CENRAT to strengthen the monitoring and evaluation team. These LDAs will be equipped with 

motorbikes and will be added to the water harnessing assistants already in place. They will be 

distributed in each region, according to the areas of concentration of the work in progress. 

Special attention will be paid to gender parity in the staff recruitment, given that mixed teams 

will be more efficient. 

4.1.2 Procurement: All goods, works and consulting services financed with Bank resources 

will be procured in accordance with the Procurement Policy for Bank Group-Financed 

Operations ("AfDB Financing Policy"), October 2015 edition, and in accordance with the 

provisions set out in the Financing Agreement. Pursuant to this policy, the country system was 

assessed in 2019 using the critical indicators assessment method defined by the Bank. Based 

on the findings of the assessment, the overall level of risk associated with the use of the country 

system for Bank-financed operations was deemed "Substantial" and certain procurements will 

be done following the country's procurement system ("National System") enshrined by law 

(Law No. 2011/037 of 28 October 2011 on the general principles, control and regulation of 

public procurement and public service delegations), decree (Decree No. 2016-641/PRN/PM of 

1 December 2016 establishing the Public Procurement Code and Public Service Delegations) 

and various implementing instruments, based on national standard bidding documents 

(NSBDs). 

Using the national system for part of the project will improve efficiency thanks to better 

ownership of the procurement system to be used by the executing agency. However, the Bank 

reserves the right to request the Borrower to revert to the use of the Bank's system if: (a) Niger's 

legal procurement framework happens to change to a system that is unsatisfactory to the Bank; 

(b) the executing agency fails to comply with the arrangements in force; or (c) the appropriate 

risk mitigation measures included in the risk assessment action plan that was made at the time 

of the project appraisal are not adhered to. The procurement risk mitigation action plan is 

annexed to Volume 2. 

4.1.3 Financial Management: The National Representation and Technical Assistance Unit 

(CENRAT), based in Niamey and placed under the supervision of the Ministry of Agriculture 

and Livestock, will be responsible for the administrative, financial and accounting management 

of the project. The activities will be carried out by three Regional Project Management Units 

(RPMUs) based in Maradi, Tahoua, Zinder.  

  



 

15 

 

CENRAT and the RPMUs have financial management staff with extensive experience in the 

accounting and financial management of development projects, and who are also familiar with 

most of the tools required for proper recording of financial operations, and for monitoring the 

financial execution of activities and accountability. Regarding the needs of PRECIS, the 

financial management staff in place will be strengthened through the recruitment of a senior 

accountant for CENRAT and an accounting assistant for each RPMU. The staff will also be 

trained in the Bank's financial management and disbursement rules and procedures at the launch 

of the project and in the use of the software.  

 

The budgetary management of PRECIS will be based on the existing mechanism in CENRAT 

and the RPMUs. The Project will continue to produce an annual work plan and budget (AWPB) 

that will incorporate the resources of the Bank as well as those of the national counterpart. It 

will be validated by the Steering Committee and submitted to the Bank for its no-objection 

before 31 December of the current year. The TOM2PRO software will be reconfigured to 

support PRECIS by allowing the Budget execution and the production of quarterly financial 

monitoring reports based on the implementation of the work plan and the annual budget, 

annexed to the quarterly progress reports transmitted to the Bank within 45 days following the 

end of each quarter.  

 

The accounting system will be private in nature and will be in conformity with the standards of 

the revised SYSCOHADA and based on the TOM2PRO software. It will make it possible to 

perform the three types of accounting (general, budgetary and analytical) and to produce annual 

financial statements which will be audited. 

 

Internal oversight is based on the existing procedures manual, but the manual will be revised 

and submitted to the Bank for its no-objection. The internal audit will be conducted by the 

internal auditor who will be recruited with IFAD funding. The General Finance Inspectorate 

(IGF) could provide support to the internal auditor, covering part of the project's internal audit 

activities. The administrative, accounting and financial procedures manual will be subject to 

the Bank's no-objection. 

 

Financial reporting will be based on consolidated quarterly financial monitoring reports which 

will be transmitted to the Bank no later than forty-five (45) days after the end of the quarter. 

The assessment of CENRAT's capacities is provided in detail in the technical annexes, as well 

as the financial management risk, which was assessed to be substantial. 

4.1.4 Disbursements: Three (3) payment methods will be used for the financial 

implementation of the project namely: (i) reimbursement, (ii) the special account, and (iii) direct 

payment. The special account method will be used to finance minor operating expenses, short 

training courses and miscellaneous expenses. A special account will be opened for this purpose 

with a commercial bank acceptable to the Bank. The opening of this account will be a condition 

precedent to first disbursement. This special account will be used to receive an initial advance, 

whose amount will be determined on the basis of the provisional operating budget for six 

months of project activity. The special account will be replenished on the same basis, after the 

borrower has justified at least 50% of the amount of the previous advance. The direct payment 

method will be used for disbursement for contracts relating to the goods, services and works 

categories. Training in the Bank's disbursement rules and procedures will be provided at the 

launch of the project. 

  



 

16 

 

4.1.5 Audits: In accordance with the general conditions applicable to the financing 

agreements of the African Development Fund, the country will be required account for the use 

of the resources allocated to it. An independent and competent external audit firm will therefore 

verify once a year the accuracy of the annual consolidated financial statements prepared by the 

project management team and assess the functioning of the internal oversight system of the 

entire project. It will be recruited by CENRAT on the basis of terms of reference previously 

agreed on with the Bank and in accordance with Bank rules and procedures. The audit contract 

will be for a maximum duration of three fiscal years, and the auditor will be required to submit 

his/her report no later than six (6) months after the end of the fiscal year to which the audit 

relates. The audit fees will not be paid in full unless the report is approved by the Bank. The 

auditor shall not be allowed to render services in respect of a year unless the services of the 

previous year were satisfactorily performed. 

 

The country will also be required to carry out an environmental and social performance audit 

on a yearly basis. To that end, an independent consultant will to be recruited to carry out that 

environmental and social audit. 

4.2. Monitoring  

4.2.1 Monitoring mechanisms: The monitoring and evaluation mechanism of 

PRECIS/AfDB will be part of the overall framework of the PRECIS mechanism, itself backed 

up by that of ProDAF, which is already in place. A baseline situation will be established at the 

start of the project to set the quantitative and qualitative values of the indicators selected for the 

logical framework. The M&E system is based on a continuous internal monitoring of selected 

activities with emphasis on the effects and changes brought about by the project's achievements. 

This system will be participatory and will involve the beneficiaries and actors of the project in 

the collection of data and information feedback from the field (difficulties encountered, possible 

risks and delays, etc.). Thematic surveys and external evaluations will be conducted in order to 

better assess issues relating to food security, nutrition, job creation, gender mainstreaming and 

aspects associated with resilience. External monitoring tasks, involving relevant line ministries, 

will also be regularly organised by the Government, in addition to the two annual supervision 

missions organised by the Bank and the close monitoring carried out by the Bank’s Country 

Office in Niger (CONE). Several participatory workshops will also be organised to enable local 

actors to evaluate by themselves the operations implemented. A mid-term review and a final 

evaluation are planned, involving the Bank and the Government, in order to allow for possible 

readjustments and capitalisation of achievements, respectively, accompanied by an evaluation 

of the Bank's contribution to outcomes on the ground. The monitoring and evaluation 

framework will systematically include gender-disaggregated data to ensure greater readability 

of the outcomes on women and vulnerable groups. A baseline study will be carried out at the 

start of PRECIS to establish the values of quantitative and qualitative indicators by region. The 

system in place currently has a consolidator at the central level (CENRAT), and M&E officers 

at regional level supported by assistants. The mechanism is supported by a computerised system 

that provides on-line information at regional level and geo-localises all operations. It is possible 

to filter requests by funding source.

4.3. Governance 

The project falls within the framework of the Economic and Social Development Plan (PDES, 

2017-2021) which is founded on the strategy to ensure sustainable development and inclusive 

growth by 2035. Under this strategy, the country continues to work towards the consolidation 

of democratic institutions and the promotion of good governance. Niger has made significant 

strides in improving the overall governance framework in recent years and has finalized the 

establishment of all the institutions of the Republic, in accordance with the Constitution of 25 

November 2010. Niger is also in the process of implementing the National Justice and Human 

Rights Policy adopted in 2016, which led to the adoption in October 2017 of a bill on the 

organisation and jurisdiction of courts, aimed at improving public access to fair justice. With 

regard to combating corruption, the powers of the Supreme Authority to Combat Corruption 

and Related Offences (HALCIA) were strengthened in 2016 by law. According to Transparency 

International, Niger ranks 112th out of 180 countries. Niger has also been working on improving 

public finance governance for at least a decade. Accordingly, it adopted implementing 

instruments for the six WAEMU directives on public finance management; adopted a new 

customs code in line with community directives; delegated financial controls to the country's 

regional capitals; conducted the 2013 and 2014 public procurement audits; drafted and adopted 

a new public procurement code (in 2016); prepared implementing instruments and new BDs; 

and adopted and implemented a comprehensive public procurement capacity-building plan. 

Thus, the national procurement system is deemed to be largely compliant with international 

standards, even if certain provisions need to be strengthened, notably in order to (i) cap the 

proportion of direct agreement contracts at 15%; (ii) build the professional capacity of the actors 

involved in the procurement and contract execution process; and (iii) institute a policy to 

promote and strengthen the participation of national companies in competitive bidding. 

4.4. Sustainability  

4.4.1 Sustainability is a central concern for PRECIS. This is evident in the choice of 

transformative investments in socio-economic areas (Development Pole) that promote the 

transformation of production systems and the forging of strong links between various segments 

of the value chains of the main agro-pastoral sub-sectors. These transformative investments, 



 

18 

 

whose quality will be subject to ongoing control (works control and supervision and 

procurement audits), will be supplemented by technical and organisational capacity-building 

for beneficiaries. The emphasis placed on promoting youth entrepreneurship and women's 

empowerment will also be continued and scaled up beyond the project's financing period. 

4.4.2 The institutional structure of the project, the approach of outsourcing tasks to 

established institutions and the involvement of beneficiaries right from the planning to the 

operation stages (in the case of infrastructure) will guarantee the sustainability of PRECIS 

achievements after the project ends. Indeed, the PRECIS project is modelled on ProDAF, and 

stands to benefit from ProDAF staff who are already experienced in most of the implementation 

strategies, and also from ProDAF methods, tools and lessons, as well as from the availability 

of FDS on water harnessing structures; this will help to avoid the delays often experienced 

project commencement. Furthermore, this will help to ensure the rapid and timely deployment 

of all operations, thereby allowing sufficient time to support producers and to monitor the 

capitalisation and the strengthening of gains by the beneficiaries. Following the example of 

ProDAF and PMERSA, PRECIS will help to build the capacities of established entities with 

which it will collaborate during implementation (STC, STD, NGOs, RECA, CRA, POs, etc.). 

This will help to strengthen them and to provide them with the resources required to continue 

monitoring the activities entrusted to them after the end of the partnerships.  

4.4.3 Regarding the implementation strategy, the civil and social engineering duo will 

promote greater ownership by the beneficiaries and their empowerment. Thus, many of the 

project activities will contribute to its sustainability, especially in terms of securing land tenure, 

supporting the organisation of beneficiaries and introducing management tools to ensure better 

maintenance and coverage of recurrent infrastructure costs (water harnessing works, irrigation 

development works, markets, shops, farm-to-market roads, etc.), and strengthening of the 

organisation of producers. In addition, the activities included in the components relating to the 

promotion of rural entrepreneurship, processing and market access, will generate value-added 

and create wealth, thereby contributing to ownership of the project's achievements by the direct 

beneficiaries. With regard to the entrepreneurship component, the exit strategy will be based on 

the establishment of business development service (SDE) providers and building their capacity 

so that they can set up their own businesses. 

4.5. Risk Management  

The potential risks identified in PRECIS implementation and their mitigation measures are 

summarised in the table below: 

 

Risks Mitigation Measures 

Worsening of security conditions, 

particularly in localities of the 

northern part of Tahoua 

-Targeting of areas currently without security problems; 

-Political commitment of the authorities and support from regional 

actors and the international community; 

-An outsourcing approach that is reliant on local economic and civil 

society actors; and 

-Integration of pastoral water projects in the North. 

The sometimes protracted delays in 

procurement procedures, which 
undermine the capacity to absorb 

available funding; 

-Anticipation of procurement operations thanks to the existing 

agencies and the availability of BDs; 

-Decentralisation of part of the procurement process to the regions; 

and 

 



 

19 

 

-Recruitment of a procurement assistant to follow up the files at the 

Ministry. 

Unfavourable environmental and 

climatic conditions in the Sahel 

region, which could lead to 

decapitalisation of the most 

vulnerable groups during severe 

crises 

- Development and implementation of environmental and social 

safeguard instruments (ESMF, RPF, PPMP, ESIA/ESMP, RAP); 

-Planned water harnessing activities; and  

-Specific attention to vulnerable groups. 

Socio-cultural barriers that do not 

always favour the access of women 
and young people to factors of 

production 

-A proactive approach of the project and specific activities carried 

out in favour of women and young people; and 

-Addressing land tenure issues through an agreement with the Rural 

Code Secretariat and support for grassroots land commissions 

(COFOB and COFOCOM). 

Difficulties relating to ownership and 

management of the new areas by the 

communities 

- Training and structuring activities; 

- Organisation of exchange visits; and 

- Ongoing support of beneficiaries. 

Lack of interest among young people  

(18-24 years of age) 

- Conduct of communication, information and awareness-raising 

activities for young people; and 

- Continuous mentoring and support for young people and the most 

vulnerable groups. 

4.6. Knowledge-Building  

PRECIS activities that will lead to better knowledge management and development may be 

summarised as follows: (i) strengthening of local expertise in terms of resilience and the 

capacity of local communities to adapt to the recurrent effects of climate change, through 

irrigation development and better control and management of water resources; (ii) 

dissemination of new production and processing technologies: development of expertise in 

localised irrigation techniques at the individual level, promotion of appropriate crop sequencing 

techniques for the Sahel region, dissemination/extension of assisted natural regeneration 

(ANR), promotion of improved stoves made from local materials, etc.; (iii) setting up of 

demonstration units and dissemination of best practices: farmer field schools (FFS) and small 

livestock innovation demonstration units (DIPE) which will help to disseminate knowledge and 

improve productivity and yields, integrated soil fertility management (ISFM), sustainable land 

and water management (SLWM), and integrated predator and pest management (IPPM) which 

will enable the protection and preservation of resources and help to mitigate the vulnerability 

of soil resources; (iv) organisation of production and processing technology review workshops 

and exchange visits, as tools for interaction between researchers, support and extension agents 

and producers with a view to adapting technologies to the local context; (v) awareness-raising 

and dissemination of information, through various communication channels (community radio, 

media programmes, website, films, etc.), aimed at promoting the use of these technologies in 

water resource management; (vi) strengthening of women's leadership and economic 

empowerment, supported by a commitment to policy dialogue with the ministries concerned, 

with a view to greater implementation of policies that promote gender equality; and (vii) 

promotion of innovative activities to improve the employability of young people and women, 

and the development of rural micro and small enterprises, through targeted support and 

customized assistance.

Annex III:  Drivers of Fragility and Recommendations for Strengthening Resilience 

 

Introduction 

Niger is one of the least developed countries most at risk of institutional and societal collapse, due 

to the multiplicity of drivers of fragility it faces and the devastating synergy between them and 

the country's structural economic and social characteristics. Environmental factors produce 

recurrent exogenous shocks that create situations of vulnerability which for some communities 

have become chronic. Yet, the country is not lacking in levers of resilience, one of whose pillars 

is definitely the entrenchment of democracy. A promising strategy for keeping young people away 

from the sirens of migration and rebellion is the creation of jobs in medium and small-sized 

enterprises to absorb the influx of labour market entrants. 

 

The availability of arable land per capita is greater in the western part of the country than in other 

Sahelian countries, which is a major advantage in agriculture, especially if the irrigation potential 

is effectively and efficiently harnessed. A substantial increase in electricity supply, which is still 

well below the country's needs, would help ensure the economic viability of small-scale industries, 

particularly the processing of agricultural produce for which there is a local market, currently 

occupied by imports. 

 

Socioeconomic Context 

 

Niger is facing serious structural challenges and attention to security issues should not overshadow 

the major obstacles to development confronting the country, including: its landlocked position, 

poor infrastructure, fragile government institutions, inadequate health care and the world's highest 

population growth and total fertility rates, limited and declining arable land area, low annual 

rainfall, high levels of malnutrition, extremely low levels of education, high gender inequalities 

and a future threatened by the effects of climate change. It is essentially a rural country that is yet 

to begin its urban transition. Most of its social and economic indicators are weak. With a poverty 

rate of 48.9% and a per capita income of USD 420, Niger is one of the poorest countries in the 

world, and this poverty is more pronounced in rural areas where almost 80% of the population 

lives. Unemployment and underemployment, particularly among young graduates, are a 

permanent concern in Niger. In 2010, there were 277,363 unemployed graduates in Niger, mainly 

young people, of whom 52.5% were men and 47.5% women. The majority of unemployed or 

under-employed young people are a burden to household heads, particularly in the low-income 

quintiles where the average household size is larger. Larger households are also associated with 

lower educational attainment. About 60% of the unemployed are in households where the head 

has no education. In 2015, Niger ranked 188th out of 188 countries on the United Nations Human 

Development Index. 

 

At 3.9% per year, the country's population growth rate is one of the highest in the world, with an 

average of 7.6 children per woman, which represents a huge burden on service delivery and is 

likely to adversely impact the economic development of the country. Sixty percent (60%) of 

Niger's population lives on less than one US dollar a day. This problem is worsened by very high 

illiteracy rates resulting from low school enrolment. Official development assistance, which has 

increased since the 1990s, represents about 60% of the investment budget and 40% of the State 

budget. 

 

Niger's economy is highly dependent on the security situation, which affects tourism in the 

country. In the early 2000s, the tourism sector was booming, with high numbers of tourists visiting 

especially the north of the country (Agadez region). However, insecurity and instability have led 



   

IV 

 

 

to a decline in the number of tourists, adversely impacting jobs and livelihoods. Vast swathes of 

the country are conducive to the development of more intensive agro-pastoral activity. Agriculture 

and livestock farming are the two pillars of Niger's economy and employ 85% of the national 

workforce, with a contribution to GDP formation estimated at an average of more than 40% over 

the past decade. However, an unpredictable climate, coupled with soil depletion and erosion, is a 

constant threat to agricultural production. Frequent natural disasters and high population growth 

often lead to food crises in Niger. Food security therefore remains a major and recurrent challenge, 

and the frequent food crises greatly expose rural populations, especially women and children, to 

persistent food and nutrition vulnerability. In addition, the recent violent clashes between Boko 

Haram and the Nigerian army have caused the displacement of more than 115,000 people from 

Nigeria to Niger. Refugees are concentrated in Diffa, a food-insecure region currently 

experiencing a humanitarian crisis of the greatest magnitude. 

 

Niger is an exporter of natural resources, consisting mainly of uranium and oil. The country’s 

subsoil is also rich in gas, gold, iron, phosphates, coal, limestone, gypsum and cassiterite. Tapping 

these resources requires significant diversification of the economy with the development of a 

dynamic national and international private sector within a well-defined and favourable regulatory 

and institutional framework. Such a context should encourage the development of an environment 

that facilitates the integration of young people into the labour market and the creation of wealth 

with a view to strengthening overall stability. 

 

Environmental Context 

 

The Sahel is one of the most fragile ecologies in the world. Only 12% of Niger's land area receives 

enough rainfall to sustain agriculture, and it is projected that very little or nothing will subsist 

between now and 2100. Land in Niger is poor in nutrients, poorly managed, overgrazed and loses 

up to 100 tonnes of its arable soil component per hectare per year due to erosion. The amount of 

firewood used for cooking (estimated at two million tonnes per year) is double the natural 

replacement growth rate. Subsistence farmers and pastoralists in this landlocked country have 

weak links to domestic markets and even less access to imports, such as improved seed varieties 

and fertilizers. Moreover, they have no financial institutions to lend them money nor any 

protection against external shocks - and the animals that constitute their capital investment die 

when the rains are scarce. For several decades, cereal production has been declining by an average 

of 0.6 % per year. New drought-resistant varieties of millet, sorghum and cowpea are being 

adopted; however, it seems unlikely that yields will keep pace with population growth. 

 

Development Challenges in the Project Areas 

 

Niger regularly experiences community conflicts, the most traditional of which are those between 

nomadic transhumant herdsmen and sedentary farmers of various ethnicities. The war effort 

burden imposed on public finances by the security situation, the limitations of donor intervention 

in this area, and the economic consequences of the conflicts that sometimes lead to a halt in 

production (as is the case in the Diffa region) seriously undermine implementation of the country's 

development programmes. 

Despite the unfavourable conditions, with temperatures of up to 50 degrees Celsius in the shade, 

low and irregular rainfall as well as poor and erosion-prone soils, most people in Niger in general, 

and in the project areas in particular, depend on income from rain-fed agriculture. In a context of 



   

V 

 

 

increasing scarcity of this water resource, rainwater harvesting is of utmost importance. 

The development of small-scale irrigation is hampered by the fact that smallholder families do not 

have enough money to invest in the extension and improvement of irrigated areas. There is also a 

lack of know-how when it comes to creating an irrigation system. Moreover, farmers do not have 

access to inputs such as seeds, fertilisers and pesticides. 

 

With regard to education, young people, particularly girls, have limited access to schooling. In 

addition to the lack of school infrastructure in communes of the project area, the start of the school 

year depends on the length of the rainy season, as these children make up the bulk of the 

agricultural workforce. Human capital will not be improved unless the education of children is 

placed at the forefront of development projects. These projects have the potential to provide 

appropriate solutions to this problem, given that by developing agricultural potential, the projects 

will ensure that the agricultural sector operates all year round. 

 

Lessons from the Implementation of Previous Projects 

 

The appraisal of the implementation of some agricultural projects in Niger shows frequent 

protracted delays, with a direct impact on the expected outcomes of these projects, which, as a 

result, reduces the impact on the beneficiaries. It was noted that the delays partly stemmed from 

certain lapses in the procurement process, including laxity in the assessment of the financial 

capacity and workload of the contracting enterprises. 

 

The national counterpart component in project financing is very often an obstacle to compliance 

with the work schedule. This reality is even more pronounced in Category 1 fragile countries such 

as Niger. 

 

Recommendation for the Strengthening of Resilience 

 

When controlled upstream, run-off water is beneficial to local people who put it to multiple uses, 

but it is necessary to empower these people, particularly women and young people by adopting 

activities that could strengthen human capital, promote literacy and boost the local economy by 

promoting the marketing of agricultural, aquaculture and reforestation products.  

 

The recommendations below will help to address the abovementioned drivers of fragility 

identified and strengthen resilience at the community level: 

 

- Lay emphasis on improving the socio-economic environment by incorporating a 
range of income-generating activities such as technical assistance to farmers, 

support measures for local cooperatives, pest-control tools, the creation of product 

conservation units, the procurement of machinery for the production and 

processing of agricultural products, the development of infrastructure for the 

marketing of agricultural products (rural roads for transporting products to large 

commercial centres, construction of sheds to promote small local markets, etc.); 

- Systematically enhance livestock corridors to prevent conflicts between farmers 
and herdsmen; 



   

VI 

 

 

- Make every effort to address literacy which is a huge problem. The effort 
should be extended to the rehabilitation/construction of basic school infrastructure 

as part of support measures; 

- Pay special attention to women and young people. It is important to strengthen the 
different forms of assistance for women in project areas, where such assistance has 

the greatest potential to capitalise on the empowerment of this group, given the 

wide gender disparity in the country; 

- Include young people in the promotion of project outcomes, since they constitutue 
more than half of the population. Activities in that regard could be supplemented 

by providing unemployed youth aged 15 to 25 with training in a range of practical 

skills that will help them to earn an income and become productive members of the 

community; 

- Address the problem of national counterpart funding right from the project design 
stage by providing 100% financing, for instance; and 

- Define and streamline the communication lines within the various projects: 
Communication between members of the project management team, as well as 

between members of this team and the supervisory authority is weak and 

inefficient, which contributes to the multiplication of errors and other shortcomings 

in project implementation.  

 

However, the effective implementation of these measures requires a significant improvement in 

governance, including the acceleration of anti-corruption efforts, transparency in procurement, 

and streamlining of the management of public finances in general and project resources in 

particular.

  exemptions) of less than 10% of the total project cost. 

 

The purpose of this note is to present the rationale for waiving the Government of Niger's financial 

contribution to the Project to Strengthen Resilience of Rural Communities to Food and Nutrition 

Insecurity in Niger (PRECIS). For this programme whose objective is to sustainably improve the 

food and nutrition security of rural households and strengthen their resilience to climatic and 

environmental shocks, the Bank Group Eligible Expenditure Policy1 may apply. 

 

The note analyses the four main criteria in this regard, namely: 

  

• The country's commitment to implement its overall development agenda; 

• The priority that the country gives to the sector targeted by the Bank's assistance; 

• The country's fiscal situation and debt level; and 

• The cap on cost-sharing and the guidelines specified in the country financing 

parameters. 

 

1. Commitment of the country to implementing its comprehensive development 

agenda 

Following the drafting, in May 2017, of its Sustainable Development and Inclusive Growth Strategy 

(SDDCI, 2035) defining the country's 2035 vision, Niger adopted its second Economic and Social 

Development Plan for 2017-2021 (PDES, 2017-2021). PDES 2017-2021 is structured around five 

strategic pillars: (i) cultural renaissance; (ii) social development and demographic transition, 

particularly through demographic transition indicators; (iii) acceleration of economic growth; (iv) 

improvement of governance, peace and security; and (v) sustainable management of the 

environment. The specific outcomes expected from the PDES (2017-2021) are: reduction in the 

incidence of poverty from 45.1.8% in 2016 to 31.3% in 2021; achievement of real GDP growth 

averaging 7.3%; and a structural transformation of the economy with a greater contribution from 

the secondary sector, as well as increased enhancement of agricultural production in the rural areas 

and the revitalisation of the private sector. 

 

The implementation status of the PDES (2017-2021) for 2019 shows that out of the 120 indicators 

of the Results Measurement Framework (RMF), 53 reached and/or exceeded their 2018 target 

(44.17%), 29 did not reach their target but exceeded their 2017 value (24.17%), 6 remained stable 

(5%), 20 indicators remained below their 2017 value (16.67%), while 8 indicators had no data 

(6.66%) and 4 had no baseline (3.33%). 

 

2. Priority given by the country to the sector targeted by the Bank's aid 

The agricultural and rural sector is a national priority in Niger, as reflected in the pillars of the 

PDES (2017-2021) and the 3N (Nigeriens Nourish Nigeriens) Initiative. In particular, the 3N 

Initiative aims to "shelter the people of Niger, on a sustainable basis, from hunger and malnutrition 

and guarantee them conditions for full participation in national production and for the improvement 

of their incomes.” More specifically, it aims to "strengthen national capacities for food production 

and supply and resilience in the face of food crises and disasters" through five strategic pillars,

namely: (i) increasing and diversifying agro-sylvo-pastoral and fisheries production; (ii) supplying 

rural and urban markets with agricultural and agri-food products on a regular basis (iii) improving 

the resilience of vulnerable groups to climate change, crises and disasters; (iv) improving the 

nutrition status of the people of Niger ; and (v) creating a favourable environment for the 

implementation of the Initiative. 

 

Implementation of the 3N Initiative has achieved encouraging outcomes as evidenced by the 

implementation reports of the 2019 PDES and the Bank's agricultural sector projects, among others. 

However, the performance of the rural sector is still weak overall, with chronic food insecurity 

affecting around 30% of the population. As highlighted in the PRECIS evaluation report, the main 

challenges faced in rural sector development are diverse, and include: (i) financing difficulties 

(access to credit and limited public funding), the low capacity of actors and their organisations, and 

the poor coordination and harmonisation of the numerous activities; (ii) low and especially 

unevenly distributed rainfall, poor knowledge of water resources, poor water management, high 

cost of inputs and equipment, and persistent land tenure insecurity, as well as the isolation of 

production areas and difficulties in accessing regional markets.  

 

3. National fiscal situation and debt level 

 

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, efforts to consolidate public finances had also yielded 

encouraging results, notably with the reduction of the budget deficit from 5.7% of GDP in 2017 to 

3.2% of GDP in 2019. The country's financial situation, which nonetheless remained difficult due 

to the security environment, was further undermined by the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in a 

significant loss in tax revenue, which might raise the budget deficit to -4.6% of GDP in 2020 from 

an initial projection of -2.6% of GDP. This budget deficit, which is likely to worsen in the 

pessimistic scenario, may also be attributed to the sharp increase in public spending designed to 

cope with the consequences of the pandemic. Public debt should increase due to the impact of 

COVID-19. Indeed, according to the baseline scenario established by the World Bank, public debt 

is expected to rise from 42.2% of GDP in 2019 to 45.4% in 2020. The present value of external 

public and state-guaranteed debt exceeds the threshold with limited space for repayment despite 

strong donor support but is expected to decline next year. Niger's weak export base also limits its 

capacity to contract more external debt. 

 

4. Cap on cost-sharing and guidance specified in country funding parameters 

 

The Bank Group Eligible Expenditure Policy states in paragraph 5.1.1 that the Bank will use the 

Country Financing Parameters (CFPs) already developed for 38 countries by the World Bank to 

determine, among other things, the cap on cost-sharing. The financing parameters for the World 

Bank indicate that it can finance up to 100% of total project costs on a case-by-case basis. The 

World Bank has used this CFP facility to finance the full cost of some of its new projects in Niger 

in light of the current financial constraints and limited financial capacity of the Government 

resulting from the sharp rise in security and humanitarian expenditure. Other TFPs have also revised 

the cost-sharing model for their operations so that they can be financed 100% from external 

resources.

5. Conclusion 

Most current assessments indicate that the economic and financial situation in Niger is deteriorating 

following the outbreak of the Covid 19 pandemic, which aggravated the country's situation that had 

already been made extremely fragile by security problems. The 2019 review of the Bank's portfolio 

performance had already highlighted the constraint faced by the State in paying project 

implementation counterpart funding. Considering the above, it is recommended that the Bank 

should grant Niger a waiver of payment of the national counterpart funding for the Project to 

Strengthen Resilience of Rural Communities to Food and Nutrition Insecurity in Niger (PRECIS.
