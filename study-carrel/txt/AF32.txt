EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

Program Overview 

1.1 More than 160 million Africans (about one in four Africans) are food insecure and 

malnourished, making Africa the most food-insecure region in the world. More than 32 million African 

children under five are underweight, of which nearly 10 million are severely underweight, and 14.3 

million are wasted, with low weight for their height. Africa’s recent economic gains are at risk if this is 

allowed to continue.  Low agricultural productivity and value addition are at the heart of the 

malnutrition, employment and income challenges on the continent. The agricultural sector accounts for 

between 50 and 70% of employment in African countries, but produces only 25% of Africa’s Gross 

Domestic Product (GDP). 

1.2  Asia was in a similar position in the 1960s but 20th century scientific advances in agriculture 

developed by a number of International Agricultural Research Centers (IARCs) in Latin America and 

Asia were applied, leading to the Asian “green revolution”. These centers became the Consultative 

Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) and together with countries in Asia they 

catalyzed one of the greatest increases in food production and improved nutritional well-being such as 

the world has ever known. Today, the technologies exist to feed Africa, if widely deployed. They include 

high yielding crop varieties and livestock breeds, bio-fortified crops such as pro-vitamin A rich cassava, 

high iron and zinc rice, and high zinc sorghum, which if scaled up can help address the problems of 

malnutrition and stunting of African bodies and minds. Africa has more food production technologies 

available today than Asia had at the time of its green revolution. What is missing is taking these 

technologies to farmers at scale. Also missing has been a well-coordinated food production technology 

delivery platform to help address all of the related issues of extension (training), policy, market, 

institutional, R&D, and regulatory issues hindering the widespread use of technologies. 

1.3  The Bank seeks to focus the technically excellent but hitherto uncoordinated efforts of CGIAR 

and their work with National Agricultural Research and Extension Systems (NARES), in particular as 

represented by their continental umbrella, the Forum for Agricultural Research in Africa (FARA) and 

Sub-Regional Organizations (SROs). The result will be a Regional Technology Delivery Infrastructure 

(RTDI), with emphasis on agro-ecological zones and their priority commodities that will reach 40-50% 

of all African farmers with the most relevant food production technologies by 2025. The overall goal of 

TAAT is to radically improve agriculture as a business across Africa by deploying agricultural 

productivity-increasing technologies within eight Priority Intervention Areas (PIAs): i) Self-sufficiency 

in Rice Production, ii) Cassava Intensification, iii) Food and Nutrition Security in the Sahel, iv) 

Transforming African Savannahs into Breadbaskets, v) Revitalizing Tree Plantations, vi) Expanding 

Horticulture, vii) Increasing Africa’s Wheat Production, and viii) Achieving Self-sufficiency in Inland 

Fish Production. Within these PIAs, nine (9) agricultural commodities are prioritized. TAAT is designed 

as a Framework Program that allows partners (the World Bank, AGRA, BMGF, IFAD, etc.) to 

contribute resources and to expand country coverage over time. The Bank’s PY1 funding will be UA 

29 MILLION (US$ 40 MILLION) in grants to finance the centrally managed activities (for ADF-only 

countries while partner resources will initially target ADB countries). Similar amounts will be sought 

for PY2 and PY3. Further, the Bank is expected to provide close to US$350 million through its normal 

country lending programs, beyond the central activities, towards areas that will support development of 

agricultural value chains, market and infrastructure and access to finance, all of which will bolster the 

success of agricultural transformations at the country level. 

1.4 And while TAAT is a key platform for driving the Feed Africa strategy of the Bank, the 

resources needed to achieve the objectives of Feed Africa are huge and well beyond what could be 

achieved alone. So the Bank is developing strategic alliances and partnerships to help mobilize resources 

to achieve the objectives. TAAT is planned as a multi-donor financing platform to help take proven 

agricultural technologies to scale across Africa. The fundamental guiding principles of TAAT are: 

technology matters; scale matters; the policy and regulatory environment matters; and partnerships 

matter. 



 

iv 

1.5 A successful green revolution in Africa must be inclusive and based on a recognition that 

agricultural transformation and women’s empowerment are inextricably linked.  Addressing the gender 

disparities that persist in African agriculture presents a tremendous opportunity to unlock the potential 

of African agriculture. The agricultural sector in Africa is the largest employer of women; 62% of 

economically active women are working in the sector, while in countries such as Rwanda, Malawi and 

Burkina Faso, over 90% of economically active women are involved in agricultural activities. Yet 

depending on the country, the rural wage gap between men and women in Africa is estimated at between 

15-60%.  Research also indicates that women farmers are just as efficient as male farmers when granted 

equal access to inputs and skills.  TAATwill systematically incorporate consideration for gender 

equality and ensure women’s equal access to agricultural technologies..  For TAAT will prioritize the 

needs of women to level the playing field and increase agricultural productivity to achieve impact.  

1.6 TAAT is a strategic alliance with the goal of mobilizing $1 billion towards its goal of scaling 

up agricultural technologies. The Bank and the World Bank have been working actively together on 

conceptualizing TAAT for the past close to two years. The World Bank initially planned to put US$500 

million towards TAAT partnership in countries, an amount it announced would be increased to $700 

million during the multi donor discussion on the planned initiative during the World Food Prize events 

in Des Moines, Iowa in October 2017. The other members of the TAAT alliance will include the Bill 

and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation and the Alliance for a Green Revolution in 

Africa (AGRA), all of whom have committed significant resources. Indeed, the Bill and Melinda Gates 

Foundation has already approved its financing support to the TAAT central coordinating platform 

housed at IITA, which will be described below. 

1.7 Other institutions have been actively participating in TAAT's conceptualization, including the 

Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the International Fund for Agricultural 

Development, Agence Française de Development, DFID, USAID and other bilateral institutions and 

the private sector. Several of these institutions expect to collaborate on TAAT and also to co-finance 

national level interventions through parallel financing. It is worth noting that at the World Food Prize 

events in Iowa, which brought together the world's leading agriculture experts, TAAT was seen as 

potentially the "most significant effort to pull resources together to deliver technologies at scale across 

agroecological zones to farmers in Africa".  

1.8 TAAT aligns with the twin objectives of the Bank’s Ten Year Strategy (TYS), inclusive growth 

and transition to green growth, with agriculture as one of the three areas of special emphasis. It also 

resonates with four of the Bank’s five corporate priorities (Feed Africa, Industrialize Africa, Integrate 

Africa and Improve the quality of lives of Africans), encapsulated in the High 5s. In addition, TAAT is 

strongly anchored on the Feed Africa agenda, endorsed by African leaders at the High-Level Conference 

held in Dakar in October 2015, which itself was anchored on the African Union’s Malabo Declaration, 

as well as Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 1 and 2 of eradicating extreme poverty and ending 

hunger and malnutrition. Given the agro-ecological perspective of the PIAs, TAAT contributes to the 

Regional Integration Policy and strategy (2014-2023) and is aligned with the transition states strategy 

in applicable RMCs of the Bank. TAAT is also anchored around previous projects supported by the 

Bank, namely: i) the “Support to Agricultural Research for Development of Strategic Crops in Africa” 

(SARD-SC), which funded research on four of the six strategic crops of the African Union (Cassava, 

Maize, Rice and Wheat), following a value chain approach; ii) the project to deploy the New Rice for 

Africa (NERICA) in seven African countries – a project that won the U.S. Treasury award in 2014; iii) 

the project on the Promotion of Science and Technology for Agricultural Development in Africa 

(PSTAD) implemented in 34 RMCs; and iv) various research-for-development projects (in Cameroon, 

Tanzania, and other countries) that contributed some of the proven agricultural development 

technologies selected for deployment in TAAT. 

1.9 Knowledge gained from implementation of prior agricultural research operations and other 

regional projects, particularly on the need to build country capacity for project implementation and 

delivery, has been taken into consideration in the design of TAAT. Similarly, the knowledge generated 



 

v 

from TAAT will be used to design, manage, and implement similar Bank-financed projects in the future. 

Through M&E, knowledge related data will be collected throughout implementation. Data will be 

analyzed and the results used to improve project implementation in real time. 

1.10 All African countries are eligible to participate in TAAT based upon a commitment to enact 

policies that facilitate the uptake of food production technologies, strengthen National Agriculture 

Research and Extension Systems (NARES), and participate in activities agreed upon with the CGIAR 

consortiums and Sub-Regional Organizations (SROs) under TAAT. They will be supported through 

centrally managed technology deployment compacts or country programs in which the Bank 

collaborates with partners (e.g., WB, AGRA, BMGF, and IFAD) to incorporate TAAT components into 

agricultural value chain development programs. The TAAT program consists of four major components 

namely: i) the creation of an enabling environment for deployment and adoption of food production 

technology by famers, in particular vibrant seed systems or artificial insemination programs, technology 

release and registration policies that are regionally harmonized, and regional programs to combat pest 

and disease threats; ii) a Regional Technology Delivery Infrastructure (RTDI)—a consortium of CGIAR 

centers, NARES, and SROs. These form the TAAT platform, which is able to provide and deploy 

needed food production technologies and any additional adaptive research required; iii) deployment of 

appropriate food production technologies, through crop/livestock campaigns in RMCs; and iv) project 

management. 

1.11 Operationally, TAAT will function as follows: The Regional Technology Delivery 

Infrastructure (RTDI) made up of CGIAR centers and other technology providers, will develop a menu 

of proven food production technologies in nine priority commodities. These include seed systems or 

artificial insemination programs for best bet crop varieties/livestock breeds for large scale deployment; 

protocols for disease control on a regional basis; farmer education in improved crop/animal production 

methods; aquaculture, etc.  RMCs, as represented by NARES, will work with the CGIAR centers to 

prepare proposals, based on the menu of food production technologies, for outreach campaigns;  the 

proposals will be submitted to the decision-making body of the RTDI, the Clearinghouse (details in 

Appendix 1).  Once proposals are approved, funds will be released for execution but the Clearing house 

will continue to provide oversight during execution. TAAT is not a research program but takes food 

production technologies that exist—the result of decades of research efforts—to millions of farmers via 

crop/livestock outreach campaigns and the creation of an enabling environment working with the 

researchers themselves. 

1.12 The food production technologies to be deployed under TAAT have the features of Regional 

Public Goods (RPGs) namely: (i) non-rivalry, (ii) non-exclusivity, (iii) broad public interest and benefit, 

(iv) strong alignment with the Bank’s strategic orientation and continental and regional objectives; (v) 

catalytic and upstream role, and (vi) higher developmental impact through cooperation. Food production 

technologies being deployed will be available to all stakeholders in the target agro-ecological zones or 

commodity belts for free. No country will be excluded. Key related lessons learned will include the 

stronger working relationships between the CGIAR centers and NARES, and the experience in working 

across multiple countries with similar agro-ecological zones, among others. 

1.13 TAAT will allow donors to work together through a well-coordinated regional technology 

delivery platform, for appropriate technologies to be deployed to millions of farmers across Agro-

ecological zones. It will bring to bear the joint collective effort of international, regional and national 

agricultural systems to improve connections between research and extension and reform regulatory 

systems that impede speedy transfer of technologies across borders..  

1.14 By going to scale on the Priority Intervention Areas (PIAs), TAAT’s key benefits include (i) 

increased agricultural productivity and diversification, leading to improved food and nutrition security, 

(ii) job creation through expanded commercialization and industrialization, (iii) improved 

socioeconomic status of farmers including women and youth due to higher incomes, (iv) reduced 

vulnerabilities to market price fluctuations due to reliable supply leading to better organized markets, 



 

vi 

(v) improved soil, land and water management practices due to Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs), 

and (vi) increased resilience to climate variability and stress through the deployment of Climate Smart 

Agriculture (CSA) technologies and innovations. TAAT will make a significant contribution to Feed 

Africa’s key agricultural development objectives, which are 1) eliminating extreme poverty, 2) ending 

hunger and malnutrition, and 3) achieving food self-sufficiency and turning Africa into a net food 

exporter. 

1.15 Projections based upon overall project design and assumptions developed for the larger Feed 

Africa strategy, as well as World Bank and AGRA programs, suggest that TAAT, by scaling up food 

production technologies, will result in 120 million tons of additional raw food production per year, will 

assist about 40 million beneficiaries (11.7 million households), and lead to increased food production 

valued at $1.7 to $2.8 billion resulting from an $850 million investment by the end of the program.. 

Investments in TAAT will be greatly compounded by larger loans/grants awarded to RMCs through 

Feed Africa.  

1.16 Management hereby seeks Board approval for the first year resources (PY1) from the Regional 

Public Good (RPG) window and will return in subsequent years (PY2 and PY3) with further requests and 
also for specific country programs.

1. INTRODUCTION 

1.1 Africa’s Agricultural Sector is Underperforming 

1.1.1 The African continent has enormous potential for agricultural production. Yet more than 160 

million Africans are food insecure and malnourished. This is about one in four Africans, making Africa 

the most food-insecure region in the world. Every day over 100 million children in Africa go to bed 

hungry with devastating long-term consequences on their physical and mental development, hobbling 

their productivity as adults. Indeed, this has led to 58 million stunted African children—short in height 

for their age—representing an increase of 23% since 1990, despite worldwide declines of 37% over the 

same period. More than 32 million African children under five are underweight, of which nearly 10 

million are severely underweight, and 14.3 million are wasted, with low weight for their height. Simply 

put, more than a third of African children under five are either moderately or severely underweight. 

Africa’s recent economic gains are at risk if this is allowed to continue. 

1.1.2 Related to health and nutrition concerns, low agricultural productivity and value addition are 

very much at the heart of employment and income challenges on the continent. The agricultural sector 

accounts for between 50 and 70% of employment in African countries, but produces only 25%, of 

Africa’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Consequently, many people work in agriculture for their 

livelihoods and yet produce and earn very little for it. Furthermore, less than 30% of harvests are 

processed into value added products compared to 98% in developed countries. Only $40 of value is 

added to one ton of processed products in Africa compared to $180 in rich countries. These are missed 

opportunities to create wealth and employment, especially for women who predominate in the 

population of African farmers today (70–80% of African farmers are women). This places women and 

their families in precarious situations, exacerbating the health and nutrition challenges already 

described. To escape this negative feedback loop, increasing agricultural productivity and value addition 

is key. The interventions described here address productivity issues while other measures being rolled 

out within the Bank’s Feed Africa strategy work on improving value addition.   

1.1.3  Why is productivity so low in Africa? For a variety of reasons including poor soils and limited 

access by smallholder farmers to improved crop varieties and livestock breeds, fertilizer, soil 

correctives, and appropriate crop production packages. African staple crop yields have barely grown in 

the last 25 years, and remain the lowest of any region in the world. The productivity of five staple 

crops—rice, wheat, maize, potato, and cassava—is just over half of the international average. Annual 

growth of cereal yields was only 1.3% from 1990 to 2014, compared with 4.1% in Brazil during the 

same period. Strikingly, between 2001 and 2008, agricultural GDP in Africa grew at just 3.4% while 

overall GDP grew nearly twice as fast, at 6% annually.   

1.1.4  In sum, the underperformance of the African agriculture sector leads to low incomes and 

expensive and often poor quality food, which has a direct bearing on hunger, malnutrition, poverty, and 

human capital and which hinders economic opportunities in the farm and non-farm sectors alike.   

1.2 Asia’s Green Revolution was the result of Technological and Institutional  Innovations 

1.2.1 Asia’s experience illustrates how rapidly things can turn around with the right actions at a 

critical time. In the mid-1960s in Asia, rising populations, an underperforming agricultural sector, and 

consecutive droughts led to significant food shortages, widespread hunger, and malnutrition. However, 

through spectacular scientific advances in wheat and rice breeding and agronomy, the food crisis was 

rolled back and India became food secure within four years, by 1970; Pakistan, Thailand, the Philippines 

and Bangladesh followed soon after. The Asian agricultural phenomenon is estimated to have saved a 

billion lives and is now known as the ‘Green Revolution’. 

 



 

2 

1.2.2  The Asian experience was inspired by earlier successes in Latin America. The 20th century 

scientific advances in agriculture that were so successfully applied in Asia had been developed by the 

Mexican Agricultural Cooperation Program for wheat, established by the Rockefeller Foundation in 

Mexico City in the 1950s, and by the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) for rice, created by 

the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations in Los Banos, Philippines, in the 1960s. This was south-south 

learning at its best. 

1.2.3  And indeed this south-south learning was deliberately supported by global development 

partners at the time. The World Bank, from the late sixties to the early eighties, provided institutional 

innovations to deploy and adapt the wheat and rice agricultural technologies to millions of hectares of 

farmlands in Asia. The World Bank also facilitated the establishment of public institutions at global, 

regional and country levels combined with policy advice and support to Asian countries, to implement 

a far-sighted strategy of reaching resource-limited farmers with the best of modern agricultural 

technology. One of these is the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), a 

global network of agricultural R&D institutions, established in 1972. The CGIAR centers were set up 

to be international centers of excellence in agricultural innovation, where cutting edge crop and 

livestock technologies were developed by the world’s best scientists and tested and adapted to individual 

country conditions, in collaboration with the National Agricultural Research and Extensions Systems 

(NARES). NARES are made up of national agricultural research institutes, universities, public and 

private extension (training) agencies, farmer organizations, etc., representing the national voices and 

approaches to agricultural technology development and deployment. It is safe to say that the Asian 

Green Revolution would not have happened without heavy investments by the World Bank, the 

Rockefeller and Ford Foundations, and Asian governments in agricultural research and development, 

credit, input distribution, extension, and rural infrastructure. On average, Asian governments doubled 

their own spending on agriculture between 1972 and 1985. 

1.2.4  The Rockefeller and Ford Foundations expanded International Agricultural Research Centers 

(IARCs) to Africa in the late 1960s—with the first center being the International Institute for Tropical 

Agriculture (IITA), established in Ibadan, Nigeria in 1967 to tackle technological barriers to raising 

food production. In the 1980s, two other centers were established in Kenya: the International Livestock 

Research Institute (ILRI) and the International Center Agroforestry Research (ICRAF, presently 

referred to as “World Agroforestry Center”); as well as a fourth center, the Africa Rice Center in Cote 

d’Ivoire. Of the 15 centers, four are based on the African continent. Centers in Asia and Latin America 

also opened research stations in Africa in the 1980s, including the Wheat and Maize Research Center 

in Mexico (CIMMYT) and the Tropical Crops Center (CIAT), demonstrating the increasing interest of 

international donors to bring the research and the technology for a green revolution to Africa.  

1.3 Why technologies have not moved to scale before in Africa 

1.3.1  But Africa missed the first green revolution for several reasons. Technologies have not moved 

to scale before in Africa due to: i) weak agricultural extension systems, ii) poor linkages between 

research and extension, iii) long technology verification and release systems, iv) a focus on national 

boundaries instead of across agro-ecological zones, v) insufficient attention to private sector value 

chains, vi) poor market linkages, vii) weak policy and regulatory environments, and viii) the absence  

of a regionally coordinated effort to deliver technologies across similar Agro-ecological zones 

(technologies without borders). 

1.3.2  Africa’s internal borders pose a serious challenge to the spread of technology on the continent. 

New agricultural technologies spread slowly across Africa’s agro-ecological zones because they are 

partitioned into multiple countries with differing governments, languages, phytosanitary controls and 

seed-certification processes. At the same time, pests and diseases do not respect arbitrarily drawn 

political borders and easily spread across them. This creates a deadly mismatch between prevailing 

dangers and the ability to roll out technologies to stop them in their tracks. The Fall Armyworm is a 

good example of such a pest that travels quickly and wreaks destruction on entire crops in its path. The 



 

3 

Armyworm was spotted for the first time in northern Nigeria in 2016 and has already managed to spread 

to at least 40 African countries (see Appendix 3 for a description of the Fall Army Worm Problem and 

mitigation plan led by the Bank). Tragically this is a crisis with known scientific solutions in the US 

and Brazil to stop the pests in their path, but without mechanisms to rapidly deliver them to African 

fields. And this is but one example. 

1.3.3  Low public sector investment in agriculture, poor seed systems, weak public extension, and 

lack of a harmonized regional legal framework for registration of crop varieties, and animal breeders’ 

rights (intellectual property), have meant that even existing improved varieties and breeds do not get 

into the hands of most farmers within a country or across a region. The share of acreage planted using 

improved crop varieties is only 30% in Africa compared with more than 50% in Latin America and 

more than 80% in Asia. Improved livestock breeds are even less prevalent.  

1.3.4  Investment by governments in the agriculture sector has also been a key driver of Green 

Revolutions in other regions. Mindful of this, African governments came together in 2003 to agree on 

the Comprehensive African Agriculture Development Program (CAADP), which, among other things, 

called for African countries to spend 10% of their budgets on agriculture. Yet, to date, only a handful 

of countries have managed to meet this target, hindering the resources available to support the transfer 

of new agricultural technologies into and within Africa. 

1.4 Feed Africa: AfDB’s Initiative to Drive Africa’s Green Revolution 

Feed Africa is the Bank’s bold initiative to end hunger, malnutrition, extreme poverty, and food 

imports—currently estimated at US$35 billion and projected to rise to US$110 billion by 2025, if 

nothing is done. This is a massive challenge as well as a massive opportunity. Feed Africa takes a 

commodity value chain approach to developing agriculture in Africa. A guiding principle of the Feed 

Africa Initiative is treating agriculture as a business, rather than as a way of life, and ensuring the 

inclusivity of women and young people. The goal is to produce thriving small-, medium-, and large-

scale agribusinesses in every segment of commodity value chains on the continent. Therefore, for Feed 

Africa to succeed, it must do two things. First, it must significantly raise agricultural productivity. 

Second, it must move African production much higher on the value chain, with agribusinesses 

producing and selling processed goods, not simply basic commodities, while providing markets for 

African farmers. The TAAT initiative aims to achieve the first goal, while a number of other initiatives, 

notably the development of agropoles and well-functioning markets, focus on the second. TAAT is 

therefore the bedrock of Feed Africa.  

1.5 Technologies for African Agricultural Transformation (TAAT)  

1.5.1  Similar to Asia, enhancing Africa’s productivity requires significantly increased investment 

from African governments, businesses and development institutions to deploy  proven 21st century food 

production technologies to tens of millions of African farmers where they will have the most impact. 

These food production technologies already exist and include new high yield crop and livestock 

varieties,  micro-nutrient dense crops – for example, pro-vitamin A rich orange-fleshed sweet potato 

and high iron beans, drought tolerant maize varieties, integrated pest and disease management (IPDM), 

and simple storage and post-harvest technologies to reduce crop losses.   

1.5.2  The potential of these food production  technologies to provide food and nutrition security has 

been demonstrated and needs to be taken to scale.  For example, DroughtTEGO® is a trademark for a 

high yielding drought-tolerant maize variety developed by the Water Efficient Maize for Africa 

(WEMA) Project to mitigate against drought stress. Experts predict that with global changes Sub Sharan 

Africa will be disproportionately affected by drought and suffer a 30% decrease in yields.  Kenyan 

farmers who grew the WEMA varieties during the drought of 2016 obtained 3.6MT/Ha of maize 

compared to 1.5MT/Ha in fields of farmers who grew other commercial hybrids. In addition, it has been 

demonstrated that 125g of orange fleshed sweet potatoes (OFSP) can provide the daily provitamin A 



 

4 

needs of a preschooler. Vitamin A Deficiency (VAD) is a significant health concern in Africa 

contributing to high rates of blindness, disease and premature death in children and pregnant women.  

An estimated 43 million children under 5 years are Vitamin A deficient and  between 50,000 and 

125,000 of those vitamin A-deficient children go blind every year, half of them dying within 12 months 

of losing their sight.   

1.5.3  A major target of TAAT is the control of the Fall Army Worm  (FAW), a recent pest problem 

on the continent that currently puts at risk an estimated 13.5 million tons of maize valued at US$ 3 

billion in the 2017/2018 season.  This assessment is from research funded by the Department for 

International Development (DFID) at the Center for Agriculture and Biosciences Intenational (CABI) 

that assessed current and potential damage of the Fall Army Worm  (FAW).    Based on the 

aforementioned research findings, DFID requested the leadership of the African Development Bank to 

contain the serious problem of Fall Army Worm (FAW). Following, the Bank hosted a meeting of 

experts at the recent World Food Prize symposium in Des Moines, Iowa; in attendance were Center for 

Agriculture and Biosciences Intenational (CABI), USAID, the International Center for Improvement of 

Wheat and Maize (CIMMYT, the Spanish acronym), the International Center for Insect Physiology and 

Ecology (ICIPE), and the private sector.   The meeting recommended a regional approach,  awareness 

raising campaigns, scouting and early detection, 1Integrated Pest and Disease Management (IPDM), and 

search for resistance in preferred varieties.  TAAT will tackle Fall Army Worm (FAW) based on these 

recommendations working with CABI, ICIPIE, CIMMYT, National Agriculture Research and 

Extension Systems (NARES) of RMCs, regional and Sub-Regional Organizations, and R&D Centers.  

1.5.4  Simple storage and post-harvest technologies being to reduce crop losses and help farmers 

manage the increased harvest under TAAT include: hermetic grain storage (Purdue Improved Crops 

Storage system) that prevent pest and mycotoxins infection of stored grains.  Other post-harvest 

technologies include affordable and efficient grain drying, and low cost extruders for production of 

simple processed food by small and medium scale agribusinesses.    

1.5.5  Crop campaigns to reach farmers with agricultural technologies of inputs and extension have 

occurred in Africa with significant success in the past.  Over a four-year period, 2011-2015, Nigeria, 

working closely with Africa Rice, the rice CGIAR center in Africa, combined innovative (ICT-based) 

ways to deploy improved rice production technology of seeds and fertilizer, a value chain approach, and 

supportive public policies to reach 6 million rice farmers. Average yields in the country doubled from 

2MT/Ha to over 4MT/Ha and national paddy rice production rose by an additional 7 million MT. 

1.5.6  Similarly, in Malawi, delivery of subsidized seeds of improved maize varieties and fertilizer to 

millions of farmers in 2004 made the country self-sufficient in maize production and a net exporter of 

maize in a single season. Ethiopia’s national extension system also deployed new crop technologies to 

over 4.4 million smallholder farmers from 2010 to 2015 on nearly 2.2 million hectares of land. Since 

then, Ethiopia’s agriculture sector has enjoyed an average growth rate of over 7% per year, which has 

contributed in no small way to the double digit annual growth rate of the economy overall. 

1.5.7  The approach to scaling technologies has been based on national boundaries, instead of agro-

ecological zones across multiple countries. The releases of crop varieties often go through four years of 

testing in national contexts, which has to be replicated across countries within the same agro-ecological 

zone in which the same technology can make a difference. Thus, a technology that is good fit for a given 

agro-ecological zone of ten countries could take 40 years to reach farmers if deployment from country 

to country spreads one after the other. What is needed is a new approach that will cut back on these 

unnecessary regulatory bottlenecks and fast track the release of technologies across similar agro-

ecological zones in one go. This is what TAAT will do. This will help open up the regional seed industry 

and markets and lead to faster uptake of technologies. 

                                                           
1 1  Integrated Pest and Disease Management (IPDM) optiones  include resistant germplasm, pesticides, biopesticides, botanicals, pheromones, 

biocontrol via natural enemies, etc. 



 

5 

1.5.8. TAAT will engage  Regional Technology Delivery Infrastructure (RTDI) - of CGIAR centers 

and other technology providers to develop a menu of proven food production technologies working with 

National Agricultural Research and Extension Systems (NARES), Sub-Regional Organizations (SROs) 

and the Forum for Agricultural Research in Africa (FARA), the umbrella body of NARES in Africa. 

Based on the menu of proven food production technologies, RMCs, as represented by NARES, will 

work with the CGIAR centers to prepare proposals for food technology outreach campaigns across 

similar agro-ecological zones that cut across multiple countries to the decision making body of the 

RTDI, the Clearinghouse (see details in Appendix 1). There are eight Priority Intervention Areas (PIA) 

of TAAT that are agro-ecology based and cover 18 priority commodities (see Appendix 2).  But for this 

phase, nine food production technologies have been prioritized because of potential impact to increase 

food security, combat malnutrition, reduce food imports, and improve livelihoods.  They include: Water 

Efficient Maize for Africa (WEMA), high yielding rice varieties adapted to Africa (the NERICA 

varieties), high-yielding and high-starch cassava varieties, high yielding sorghum and millet for the 

Sahel, orange fleshed sweet potatoes, high iron beans, small livestock (goat and sheep), aquaculture, 

and new wheat varieties.  Control of pests and diseases, for example the Fall Army Worm (FAW), is a 

cross cutting intervention across all nine technologies.  

1.5.9  While TAAT is not a research program to develop new technologies—for the most part the 

needed technologies already exist and in some cases are already in use—but rather a crop and livestock 

outreach campaign to disseminate best-bet crop varieties/livestock breeds and practices to the farmers, 

it requires a close partnership with National Agricultural Research and Extension Systems (NARES) 

and International R&D Centers to provide solutions that tend to arise as research is deployed over a 

wide range of similar but diverse agro-ecologies with unique micro-ecosystems. 

1.6 TAAT will carry out positive gender discrimination in favor of women 

1.6.1 A successful green revolution must be inclusive and based on a recognition that Africa’s 

agricultural transformation and women’s empowerment are inextricably linked. Addressing the gender 

disparities that persist in African agriculture presents a tremendous opportunity to unlock the potential 

of African agriculture with the World Bank cautioning that “failure to recognise the different roles of 

men and women in agriculture is costly, resulting in misguided projects and programmes, forgone 

agricultural output and incomes, and food and nutrition insecurity”.  Indeed incorporating consideration 

for gender issues systematically in agricultural research, development, and extension systems will 

contribute significantly to meeting the food needs of Africa’s growing population and ensure that 

productivity gains in food systems translate to improved welfare of the poor. 

1.6.2 Women are important to Africa’s agriculture and agriculture is important to African women’s 

lives. The agricultural sector is the largest employer of African women, with 62% of economically 

active women working in the sector.  In countries such as Rwanda, Malawi and Burkina Faso, over 90% 

of economically active women are involved in agricultural activities.  Despite being heavily engaged in 

agriculture, African women earn less than men from the sector with the rural wage gap between men 

and women estimated at between 15-60%. In the case of Ivorian cocoa and Ethiopian coffee, for 

example, women provide 68% and 75% of the labour, respectively, but earn only earn 21% and 34% of 

the income generated. 

1.6.3 Research indicates that, when granted equal access to inputs and skills, women farmers are just 

as efficient as male farmers. Hence the privileging of male farmers, for example in Ivorian rice projects, 

is based on erroneous assumptions not supported by data. As such, gender responsiveness in agricultural 

research and development is not about ‘fixing the women farmers’, but rather addressing the 

institutional structures and technological impediments that hamper their productivity. Ultimately, the 

empowerment of women farmers requires institutional transformation, with research institutions 

becoming more gender responsive and paying close attention and genuinely responding to the needs of 

women farmers 



 

6 

1.6.4 In partnership with African Women in Agricultural Research and Development (AWARD), 

the Bank will systematically incorporate consideration for gender equality and ensure women’s equal 

access to agricultural technologies. In this regard, AWARD will support TAAT by: (i) Convening and 

coordinating a network of technical gender experts that would be available to members of the TAAT 

consortium to address issues of gender in the selected value chains which will maximize the impact of 

TAAT by providing consolidated gender expertise and opportunity for shared learning; (ii) Identifying 

and prequalifying bankable and scalable agricultural research and development innovations that address 

the gender gap in African agriculture and build relationships with private sector and other uptakers of 

gender responsive agricultural technologies.  Expected outcomes will be demonstrated change in in 

gender awareness, attitudes and/or behaviours of TAAT partners, a measurable increase in TAAT 

partner institutions with gender responsive agricultural innovation policies and strategies, and TAAT 

outputs that are gender responsive across value chains. 

1.7 Expected Impact of TAAT 

1.7.1. TAAT interventions are projected to raise productivity and increase food production over the 

next 8-10 years (Table 2). TAAT will add an estimated 120 million MT of food to Africa’s food 

production valued at US$1.71 to US$2.8 billion (Table 2).

1.7.2  TAAT will benefit, through improved food security and income, an estimated 11.7 million 

households (representing on average 40 million people) over ten years, reducing by as many as a third 

the total number of hungry people on the continent. The increased food production is also expected to 

have an effect on food prices, reducing the amount of food households spend on food, and further 

increasing access to more food. It is estimated that TAAT, including its Bank-financed Country 

programs, combined with the affiliated programs of the World Bank and AGRA, will contribute to 

lifting about 40 million people out of poverty. 

1.7.3  TAAT will help to create huge regional spill-over effects and Regional Public Goods (RPGs). 

Of particular importance are RPGs that target imminent “regional public threats” of destructive pests 

and diseases of crops/livestock that do not respect political borders and easily spread across them.  A 

good example is the recent invasion into Africa of the Fall Armyworm described above, which currently 

puts at risk an estimated 13.5 million tons of maize valued at US$ 3 billion in the 2017/2018 season.   

1.8 TAAT is a Regional Program Producing Regional Public Goods (RPGs) 

1.8.1  TAAT resources are targeted at facilitating effective functioning of the Regional Technology 

Delivery Infrastructure (RTDI), made up of International Agriculture Research Centers of the 

Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), National Agricultural Research 

and Extension Systems (NARES), African Agricultural Technology Foundation (AATF), Sub-Regional 

Organizations, all  non-governmental organizations, that will ensure that proven agricultural 

development technologies are rapidly deployed to RMCs. 



 

7 

1.8.2  TAAT aims at producing Regional Public Goods (RPGs), including: i) harmonized regional 

and Transnational border protocols for introduction and release of improved varieties/breed and other 

agricultural technologies, ii) Synchronization of seed system protocols, especially those that deal with 

liberalization of foundation seed production (to include private sector seed companies), iii) combatting 

“regional public threats” of destructive pests and diseases of crops/livestock that do not respect political 

borders and easily spread across them.   

1.8.3  The requested grant from the RPG window of ADF 14 will support CGIAR and low-income 

RMCs to drive delivery of food productions technologies into hands of at least 60% of all farmers after 

eight to ten years. Twenty two of these RMCs, namely: Benin, Burkina-Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Congo 

DRC, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, 

Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia have written to the Bank to 

express interest in participating. Six of them (Chad, Congo DRC, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Sierra Leone, 

and Sudan) are in fragile situations as defined by the eligibility for the Transition Support Facility (TSF) 

support under ADF-14. However, it should be noted that TAAT will produce Regional Public Goods 

(RPGs) of public interest; no RMC can be excluded from it or from their spillover benefits, given their 

public goods characteristics (see section 4.2 and Appendix 4). TAAT is therefore not exclusive to low-

income ADF RMCs. Non-ADF countries interested in TAAT such as Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia 

(ADB countries that have written to express interest in TAAT) are welcome to participate via  the ADB 

funding window of the Bank or other eligible partner funds (e.g., funds from BMGF and World Bank). 

Participation will simply depend on the ability of RMCs to meet requirements for technology 

deployment. For the 25 countries (22 ADF and 3 ADB) that have expressed interest in participating in 

TAAT, the country programs in the pipeline that are aligned to inserting a TAAT component are listed 

in Appendix 5. TAAT is therefore open to all RMCs, via their NARES, to make their best technologies 

accessible to farmers within countries working in close collaboration with regional and continental 

organizations. The new crop varieties and livestock breeds, cross-boundary crop and livestock diseases 

control (e.g., Fall Armyworm), crop management practices, knowledge and other products from the 

CGIAR’s research work are indeed RPGs made widely available to individuals and organizations 

working for sustainable agricultural development around the world. TAAT will be held to high 

standards of deployment and must meet clear key performance indicators or funding will be 

discontinued to erring institutions. 

1.9 TAAT will benefit from the lessons learned from previous Bank interventions  

1.9.1  The Bank’s earlier experience with the “Support to Agricultural Research for Development of 

Strategic Crops in Africa” (SARD-SC) program – which funded research on four of the six strategic 

crops of the African Union (Cassava, Maize, Rice and Wheat) – provides crucial lessons that TAAT 

will build upon.  They include: i) experience on how to work regionally with international centers of 

excellence (the CGIAR) to rapidly introduce and test technologies across a region for optimal yields 

and eventual deployment to farmers; ii) The SARD-SC program revealed the importance of going to 

scale to ramp up food production and reduce imports.  TheSARD-SC program led to a doubling of 

yields for wheat, rice, maize, cassava on experimental fields and in on-farm trials; if average wheat 

yields increases from 1.5 to 3MT/Ha and higher tons per hectare could be replicated across 9.8 million 

hectares grown in Africa, the continent could be on the path to self-sufficiency in wheat production; iii) 

SARD-SC also demonstrated the advantages of working across multiple countries with similar 

agriculture-ecological zones, simultaneously introducing, testing and releasing new crop varieties in 

several countries at the same time. Other lessons are have been learned from the development of the 

NERICA (New Rice for Africa) rice varieties by AfricaRice in the 1990s (Appendix 6). 

1.10 The Value-Added of TAAT 

1.10.1  The value-added of TAAT is that it can leverage crop and livestock technologies that have 

been developed and validated in one or a few countries across entire agro-ecological zones covering 

many countries. For example, maize yields can be doubled across East and Southern Africa via an 



 

8 

introduction, registration, and deployment of already available drought tolerant Water Efficient Maize 

for Africa (WEMA) varieties. And perhaps the best demonstration of the value added of TAAT is in 

tackling pests and diseases such as Fall Armyworm accross an entire region.   

1.10.2 TAAT will allow donors to work together through a well-coordinated regional technology 

delivery platform, for appropriate technologies to be deployed to millions of farmers across Agro-

ecological zones. It will bring to bear the joint collective effort of international, regional and national 

agricultural systems to improve connections between research and extension and reform regulatory 

systems that impede the speedy transfer of technologies across borders. 

2 PROGRAM DESCRIPTION 

2.1 Objectives of TAAT 

The development objective of TAAT is to "rapidly expand access of smallholder farmers, majority 

women, to high yielding agricultural technologies to improve their food production, assure food security 

and raise rural incomes, and deliver regional public goods by scaling up agricultural technologies across 

similar agro-ecological zones". Overall TAAT has three main objectives:  

i) Creating an enabling environment for technology adoption by famers via policies for 
deployment and adoption of food production technologies that are regionally 

harmonized, food and nutrition conscious, and environmentally sustainable; 

ii) Facilitate effective delivery of technologies to farmers by working with existing Regional 
Technology Delivery Infrastructure in a compact with RMCs, represented by NARES, 

private sector actors, and an independent technology Clearinghouse; 

iii) Raising agricultural production and productivity through the identification and 
deployment of appropriate technologies, including nutrient dense crop varieties, and 

vigorous crop outreach campaigns, extension, and market linkage campaigns, in RMCs. 

2.2 Strategy of TAAT 

2.2.1  Feed Africa takes a value chain approach to raising crop/livestock productivity in Africa. 

Figure 1 shows where TAAT will intervene in the commodity value chains. A commodity value chain 

is described as a series of goods and services required for a commodity to be produced and then to move 

from the place of its primary production to the ultimate end-user (Figure 1).

Figure 1: Positioning of TAAT within agricultural commodity value chains  

 

2.2.2  Agricultural growth that has occurred in Africa reveals that productivity enhancement and 

market access development are prevalent factors. Productivity unaccompanied by strong growth in 

markets leads to a glut from over-production, while markets without increased productivity gives rise 

to food imports due to insufficient supply. Feed Africa will work to reinforce these productivity aspects 

of the value chain and agriculture markets through its various initiatives such as TAAT, Agropoles, 

post-harvest losses and agro processing. The role of TAAT in particular is to improve outcomes at the 

beginning of this chain by increasing productivity, as well as resilience to weather and disease-related 

risks, providing a much more solid basis from which to build strong production systems and markets 

that make African agribusinesses successful. TAAT will work in concert with the other initiatives to 

foster the deployment of commercially viable technologies with improved access to input and output 

markets, and other enablers such as innovative finance and soft/hard infrastructure.  

2.2.3 It is important for TAAT to generate ‘quick wins’ to create credibility and attract both 

additional public and private sector financing. An initial set of priority agricultural commodities are: 

i) Water Efficient Maize for Africa (WEMA), 

ii) Import-quality rice for the west African lowlands, 

iii) Cassava for industrial use, 

iv) Small livestock (goats and sheep), 

v) Sorghum/millet for the Sahel, 

vi) Aquaculture 

vii) High yielding wheat varieties 

viii) Orange fleshed Vitamin A rich sweet potato varieties 

ix) High iron beans varieties for Africa 



 

10 

Management of pests and disease is a cross cutting theme across all the nine technologies 

2.2.4 Clear metrics of target productivity, production, beneficiaries, agro-ecologies, and countries have 

been pre-determined for these nine priority food production technologies (See Appendix 7) 

2.3 TAAT Activities 

2.3.1  The TAAT program consists of four major components namely: 

i) Component #1: Creation of an enabling environment for technology adoption by famers 
via a seed system, technology release and registration policies that are regionally 

harmonized 

ii) Component #2: A Regional Technology Delivery Infrastructure (RTDI)—or TAAT 
platform—that is able to provide and deploy needed food production technologies and any 
additional adaptive research required 

iii) Component #3: Deployment of appropriate food production technologies, through 
crop/livestock campaigns in RMCs 

iv) Component #4: Project Management. 

2.3.2  Harmonization of technology release and registration, and seed system, policies 

 across regions 

The approach to scaling technologies based on national boundaries needs to be replaced by an approach 

that involves agro-ecological zones that spread across multiple countries. Policies and protocols for 

release and registration of crop varieties and animal breeds needs to be streamlined so that 

varieties/breeds released in one country can be utilized in other countries of the same region, same with 

seed system protocols that can replicated across countries within the same agro-ecological zone. TAAT, 

working with Sub-Regional Organizations (SROs) and CGIAR center responsible for policy work, 

IFPRI (and its key partners such as the Africa Technology Policy Studies ATPS Network), will review 

national and regional policies on variety release, registration, and the seed system with an aim of 

harmonizing them to fast track the release of technologies across similar agro-ecological zones. This 

will help open up the regional seed industry and markets and lead to faster uptake of technologies. 

2.3.3. The Regional Technology Delivery Infrastructure (RTDI)—or TAAT platform 

RTDI is a consortium of CGIAR centers, FARA, Africa Agricultural Technology Foundation (AATF) and 

SROs working on regional approaches to deployment of new crop and livestock technologies, and 

combatting pest and disease threats through a fair and transparent method in prioritizing technologies 

and allocating resources. The RTDI will develop a menu of food production technologies and work with 

RMCs, as represented by NARES and the private sector, to develop a proposal to take these technologies 

to scale.  Figure 2 schematically describes the RTDI processes. The RTDI is made up of four units, 

namely: 

1. A Project Steering Committee (PSC): the highest decision-making body composed of 
representatives of participating RMCs, the private sector, CGIAR centers. The 

committee provides oversight to Regional Technology Delivery Infrastructure (RTDI).  

2. Clearinghouse: the body of the consortium that decides on which technologies should 
be used. The Clearinghouse will be independent of the Project Management Unit (PMU);  

3. Commodity Technology Delivery Compact (CTDC): is at the core of TAAT and it is 
an agreement among the entire ecosystem of actors needed to deliver improved 



 

11 

technologies at scale for a specific crop or livestock value chain, for each of the priority 

commodities. They will be hosted the CGIAR center or institution with the particular 

mandate for each specific crop; 

4. A Project Management Unit: oversees day-to-day implementation of project fiduciary 
and administrative activities;  

2.3.4  Identification and deployment of appropriate technologies, through crop/livestock 

campaigns in RMCs 

TAAT will engage CGIAR and other technology providers to develop a menu of proven food production 

technologies, namely: seed system or artificial insemination guidelines (technical manuals) for large 

scale deployment of improved varieties/breeds, disease control, improved crop/animal production 

methods, aquaculture, etc.  RMCs, as represented by NARES, will prepare a proposed food technology 

outreach campaign covering one or more of the menu items, with support from the respective CTDC 

for submission to the Clearinghouse of the RTDI. The proposals will clearly state the target 

beneficiaries, location, development impact, and timelines within the RMCs. The Clearinghouse will 

review the proposals according to a set of agreed criteria and recommendations for funding. Oversight 

will also be provided for implementation by the Clearing house. 

 

Figure 2: Process of origination, review, decision making, and funding in the Regional Technology 

Delivery Infrastructure 

2.4 Expected Output and Outcomes 

2.4.1 Expected Outputs 

TAAT interventions are projected to raise productivity of target commodity up to 100% over the next 

8-10 years (Table 2). Other outputs include reduction of Vitamin A deficiency in children under five 

and pregnant women by 30% and reduction in post-harvest losses by 50% in target locations of TAAT 

over the next 8-10 years. 



 

12 

2.4.2 Provision of Regional Public Goods (RPG)  

Regional public goods will be provided via a number of vehicles including: 

i) Harmonization of regional and transnational border protocols for introduction and 
release of improved varieties/breed and other agricultural technologies 

ii) Synchronization of seed system protocols, especially those that deal with production of 
foundation seeds (inclusion of private sector seed companies) 

iii) Disease control – monitoring and IPDM methods 

iv) Extensive adaptation trials of crop varieties across the region, including nutrient dense 
varieties 

2.4.3 Crop Outreach Campaigns to reach millions of African Farmers 

i) Toolkits for the different priority commodities provided to the RMCs 

ii) Feedback on performance of technologies via the RTDIs 

iii) A doubling of acreage under improved crops and breeds, from the current 30% to 60%, 
by 2025 

iv) Availability of cheap and nutritious food 

2.4.4 Expected Outcomes 

TAAT will benefit via increased food security and income, raising farmer’s household incomes by an 

average of US$600 per annum, reaching an estimated 11.7 million households, representing on average 

40 million people, over ten years, and reducing by as much as a third the total number of hungry people 

on the continent. TAAT will add an estimated 120 million MT of food to Africa’s food production 

valued at US$1.71 to US$2.8 billion (Table 2).  The increased food production will also have an effect 

on food prices, reducing the amount households spend on food, and further increasing access to more 

food, in a positive feedback loop. TAAT is expected to add 3.15 million direct farm jobs over eight 

years. 

2.5 Costs and Financing Arrangements  

2.5.1 Program Cost  

TAAT is divided into centrally managed activities, designed to produce regional public goods, and 

funded by grants from the Bank and partners, and country program activities to be financed through 

sovereign loans from the Bank and partners. The UA 29 million from the ADF XIV Regional Public 

Goods (RPGs) window will solely finance regional public goods described in the TAAT Program 

Framework Document. BMGF has already approved $1.14 million and AGRA is processing a $10 

million grant for centrally managed activities of TAAT. The country programs will be financed via 

AfDB sovereign loans to RMCs, as well as World Bank loans to RMCs to the tune of USD 700 million. 

The Bank’s financing of the central programs will be for nine priority commodities using 

resources from ADF XIV RPG window. This first set of commodities will be implemented over three 

(3) years (2018 to 2020). Only activities of the first nine commodities have been described in more 

detail in the present report, with the costing information below.  

 



 

13 

2.5.2  The total cost of first phase of TAAT is estimated at UA 40.00 million (USD 56.532 

million) net of taxes and based on 2016 prices comprising UA 15.27 million or 38% in local costs 

and UA 24.73 million or 62% in foreign costs. This cost is inclusive of physical and price 

contingencies estimated at average rates of 3% and 5%, respectively. The physical contingencies are 

estimated from 0% (emolument) to 5% (works) based on common practices. The price contingencies 

were estimated on the basis of actual and projected levels of local inflation rates of about 2% per annum 

and foreign inflation rates. 

2.5.3  The summary of the first phase of nine commodities costs by component and by category 

of expenditure are presented respectively in Tables 3-4.

2.6 Program financing arrangements  

2.6.1  Of the total first phase Project cost of UA 40 million (USD 56.532 million), Bank Financing 

will be UA 29 million or USD 40 million (72.5%)  (See Tables 5 and 6). This will finance 100% of 

Goods; 100% of services for the Commodity Technology Delivery Compact (CTDC); 100% funding 



 

14 

for Enable Youth in TAAT (ENABLE-TAAT) and 100% operating costs. Bill and Melinda Gates 

Foundation (BMGF) will provide UA 0.83 million ((USD 1.138 million) or 2.1 %) to assist the 

establishment of the Clearing house. The funding from BMGF will cover recruitment of key staff and 

other operating expenses. The Clearinghouse will play a major role in the TAAT implementation. The 

Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA) will provide UA 7.25 million (or USD 10 million) 

to finance 100% services (across Components 1, 2, and 3). The participating RMCs will contribute 

UA2.90 million (7.3%) in local currency, 100% in-kind, by provision of farm land for extension training 

facilities, demonstration activities, and other critical RPGs-promoting activities. Project beneficiaries 

include a variety of stakeholders: agripreneurs, farmer based organizations and cooperatives, 

commodity processors, private sector operators, registered SMEs, seeds producers, agro-input dealers, 

service providers, millers, aggregator and market operators, and young graduates.   

2.6.2  While table 5 below indicates the financing arrangements by local and foreign currency 

distribution, table 6 indicates financing by year. Grants’ allocations by source and expenditure 

categories is presented in Appendix 8a and by components in Appendix 8b

NB: Government contribution is 7.3% and in-kind (national staff salaries, part of the operating cost, rental value of the office space offered, laboratory 

infrastructure and experimental land and the loss in fiscal receipts due to tax and custom duty exemption of different project procurement). It is less than 

10% required because six (6) of the target 22 low-income RMCs are countries are in fragile situations and conflict-affected (see related Annex in Vol. II 
of the Report, Technical Annex)..

2.6.3 During the implementation period for each component, expenditures will be carried out 

according to the schedule in Table 7. The nine priority commodity value chain activities will be 

implemented during the first two years through a comprehensive deployment of new technologies in 

RMCs. Year 3 will be dedicated to the consolidation of the results through mainstreaming of the value 

chain development activities on a commercial basis

Framework at three levels: Impact, Outcome and Output. 

 The impact indicators relate to more food secure population and dealing with the 
prevalence of stunting among children under 5 years. 

 The outcome indicators are household income, agricultural productivity, job creation, 
tons of additional food commodity, household dietary diversity, value of additional foods 

produced, and number of beneficiaries. 

 The output indicators include: technology policies harmonized across regions/countries, 
weak systems strengthened, improved crop varieties and livestock breeds widely applied, 

technology adoption constraints removed, promotional activities with a focus on 

technologies for safe and nutritious foods, and communities with better access to inputs 

and output markets. Others are best-bet technologies scaled out, campaigns implemented, 

delivery platforms convened, agripreneurs supported, M&Es of platforms carried out, 

trans-national pests and diseases facilitated, technologies identified and deployed, menus 

of proven food production technologies developed, and wide-scale farm extension 

models implemented.  

 See the RBLF for complete list. 

3 FEASIBILITY OF TAAT 

3.1 Economic and Financial Performance 

3.1.1 It is anticipated that the Bank’s intervention will result in positive economic and financial 

impacts in RMCs from the nine priority technologies, especially given the public goods nature of the 

interventions. Economic and financial analyses were carried out using the economic surplus approach 

for the nine selected commodities. Improvements taken into account were streamlined and harmonized 

release of improved crop varieties and livestock breeds, strengthening of seed systems, use of improved 

varieties of crops across the applicable agro-ecological zones, design and implementation of appropriate 

campaigns for trans-national control of pest and diseases, good agricultural practices (GAPs), capacity 

building and outreach, policy support and advisory services, as well as demonstration and promotional 

activities. The benefits were measured based on increase in food supply as a result of improved access 

to proven technologies and other farm inputs. The annual flows of gross economic benefits from 



 

16 

increased crop and livestock productivity, production and value chains were estimated and aggregated. 

The aggregate benefits and costs (per commodity value chain) were then discounted to derive the 

estimated present value (in 2017 values) of total net benefits from the intervention. The benefits and 

costs were later aggregated across the nine priority commodities to calculate the aggregate financial and 

economic impacts.  

3.1.2 The consolidated Net Present Value (NPV) of the Financial Net Benefits was US$ 431.5 

million with an internal rate of return (FIRR) of 27%. Using World Prices (to correct for domestic 

distortions, taxes, and subsidies), the NPV of net economic benefits was calculated at US$ 280 million 

with an internal rate of return of 23%.  The result is quite robust and includes changes in productivity 

(crop and livestock), levels of adoption of proven agricultural technologies, and discount rates. For 

instance, a scenario of adoption by 10% of farmers, 10% productivity increase, and 10% discount rate 

across the nine priority commodities still gave an aggregate NPV of US$ 296 million with an internal 

rate of return of 18%. This supports the potential economic impact of the TAAT approach.  

3.2 Environmental and Social impacts and Gender 

3.2.1 TAAT has been classified as Category 2 operation, indicating that the program activities are 

expected to have limited adverse environmental and social impacts. An Environmental and Social 

Management Framework (ESMF) for the mitigation of adverse environment and social impacts of the 

program was posted on the Bank’s website on 4 July 2017. It provides the processes and methodologies 

to be implemented by the Clearinghouse/PMU to screen and manage potential environmental and social 

impacts and risks likely to result from the proposed agriculture technologies and demonstration 

activities. Because TAAT will be executed at RMCs, the ESMF draws on applicable national and 

regional regulatory frameworks as well as international good practice guiding environmental and social 

management.  

3.2.2  Women’s large overrepresentation in agricultural tasks in Africa, combined with the existence 

of a gender gap in agricultural productivity and the need to boost Africa’s agricultural output calls for 

increased attention to raising female agricultural productivity. The technologies it invests in must 

respond to the needs and priorities of women as well as men in order to level the playing field and 

increase agricultural productivity. Implementing partners must emphasize the deployment of gender-

responsive technologies. There is a strong case within TAAT for carrying out positive gender 

discrimination, since women form the majority of farmers as well as food processors in Africa. Studies 

have shown that women are as efficient as men, given access to same technologies. A World Bank 

publication (2008) clearly documents gender based differences in African agriculture and in terms of 

technology, land, extension, finance, time, mobility and education and training. 

3.2.3  TAAT will ensure the gender responsiveness of the technologies. Evidence shows that 

introducing new agricultural technologies can exacerbate already existing gender disparities and make 

life tougher for smallholder farmers, especially women and girls. However, with proper attention, 

agricultural technologies have the potential to bridge the gender gap and lead to inclusive, agriculture-

driven prosperity for all Africans. The African Women in Agricultural Research and Development 

(AWARD) will be one of the partners for the TAAT program to not only build the capacity of key Bank 

staff and TAAT implementers to be more gender responsive, it will help mitigate potential negative 

gender impacts while upscaling those technologies that bridge Africa’s gender gap in agriculture. The 

TAAT program recognizes that gender equality in agribusinesses is a priority. The mechanisms to 

ensure social inclusion and gender equality in this project include appropriate outreach strategy and 

gender sensitive training on good agricultural practises, as well as adequate provisions for both genders 

to access affordable and quality agricultural technologies and input and output markets. In addition, this 

project will prioritize the adoption of gender friendly technologies and support policies in the target 

countries.

4 IMPLEMENTATION 

4.1 Implementation Arrangements 

4.1.1 Structure and Activities of the RTDI (TAAT Platform) 

The structure of the Regional Technology Delivery Infrastructure (RTDI) consists of the Project 

Steering Committee (PSC), the Clearing House, the Commodity Technology Delivery Compact 

(CTDC), and the Project Management Unit (PMU).  These component are described in more details 

below. 

4.1.2  Project Steering Committee (PSC) 

The Project Steering Committee is the highest decision-making body composed of representatives of 

AfDB, African Ministers of Agriculture of participating RMCs, the various CG Centers, the Private 

sector, NARES and regional farmer organizations. The committee provides oversight functions to 

Regional Technology Delivery Infrastructure (RTDI).  All annual work programs will be cleared by the 

PSC prior to funding.  Membership of the Program Steering Committee (PSC) will be approved by the 

Bank.  

4.1.3 Clearinghouse 

The Clearinghouse is the main decision making body of the RDTI when it comes to selecting which 

technologies to disseminate and scale up. It will be substantially autonomous; its work plan and budget 

will be approved by the Program Steering Committee (PSC). The objective of the Clearinghouse is to 

decide which proven agricultural technologies proposed by each Crop/Livestock compact group can be 

rolled out and taken to scale. The activities of the Clearinghouse are indicated in Appendix 1. 

The activities of the Clearinghouse include:  

i) Evaluating requests from the compacts for technologies to be rolled out and scaled up. 
This will be akin to a peer review mechanism of the proposed technologies; 

ii) Validating the design and plan with stakeholders for a buy-in and commitment; 

iii) Identifying the optimal mix of partners that will accompany the implementation, 
backstopping and monitoring of the proposed plan;  

iv) In collaboration with the RMCs, conduct monitoring and assessment of milestones and 
Performance Indicators;  

v) In collaboration with the Bank, advising Governments and private actors on investment 
opportunities and financing mechanisms for going to scale. 

4.1.3.1. Although the Clearinghouse will be based at the IITA sub-station in Cotonou it will be fully 

independent of the IITA management. It is not a part of the PMU and will operate as an independent 

unit with its own competitively recruited Director, supported by technical and support staff.  The key 

skills assets required in the Clearinghouse include: i) technology transfer specialist; ii) an outreach 

expert; iii) a communication expert;  iv) a gender development specialist, and v) M&E Specialist in 

addition to other general services staff.  

4.1.4 Crop/Livestock Technology Delivery Compacts 

At the heart of TAAT’s technology deployment effort is the Crop/Livestock Technology Delivery 

Compact (CTDC).  CTDC is an agreement between the CGIAR center with mandate for the commodity 



 

18 

value chain, NARES, the RMCs and the entire ecosystem of value chain actors—from input supplier, 

processors, aggregators, equipment manufacturers, extension agencies, etc.  The CTDC drives the 

implementation of TAAT activities for each of the nine priority commodities. RMCs who indicate 

interest in accessing and deploying at scale technologies for the commodity in question, can become a 

part of the compact. Request from the CTDCs for deployment of a list of technologies and resources 

required will be submitted to the RTDI, specifically the Program Steering Committee (PSC), who will 

work in tandem with the clearing house to review and approve the appropriate technologies. Figure 4 

shows the structure of the Commodity Technology Delivery Compacts (CTDC). 

4.1.5  The structure of the Regional Technology Delivery Infrastructure (RTDI) can be observed in 

figure 4 and 5. 

The activities of the RTDI or TAAT platform include: 

i) Identification and selection of best-bet technologies for uptake by RMCs involved in 
crop/livestock compacts; the RMCs will be front and center of the compacts to ensure 

ownership and sustainability with attention to specific value chains); 

ii) Improvement of seed systems. Specific tasks are: evaluation of existing seed systems 
to identify strengths and weaknesses, identification of policy and capacity development 

needs to address the weaknesses and take advantage of the strengths, implementation of 

the identified policy and capacity development needs to strengthen the seed systems; 

iii) Harmonization of regional variety release systems to ensure regional spillover effects 
of technologies. Specific tasks are: identification of constraints to variety release and 

access to improved varieties of crops in Africa and why varieties suitable for specific 

agro-ecologies cannot be applied to the wider ecological reach because of country 

boundaries, identification of policy and capacity-building options to address this issue, 

implementation of the identified policy and capacity building options on the ground, 

monitoring the effects); 

iv) Facilitation of trans-national control of pest and diseases.  Specific tasks are: 
awareness raising that pest and diseases do not respect political boundaries with clear 

examples, design and development of appropriate campaigns for trans-national control 

of pest and diseases, implementation of the agreed on campaigns for trans-national 

control of pest and diseases; 

v) Support RMCs with policy audits and reviews to remove constraints to technology 
adoption and use; 

vi) Engage the Sub-Regional Organizations (SROs) on harmonization of agricultural 
technology release and synchronization of foundation seed protocols, disease control, 

monitoring and Integrated Pest Disease Management (IPDM) methods2, and adaptation 

trials of crop varieties across the region, including nutrient rich varieties; 

vii) Design and execute a comprehensive communication strategy to effectively 
communicate the goals, activities, and benefits of the Agricultural Transformation 

Agenda; 

 

                                                           
2  Integrated Pest and Disease Management (IPDM) is combining different methods of pest and disease control ranging from varietal resistance and 

tolerance, chemical control (pesticides, fungicides, bactericides, etc.), biocontrol (using natural enemies of the pests), cultural practices (crop rotation, 
mixed cropping, planting dates,, etc.), and  



 

19 

viii) Fiduciary responsibility for the centralized activities of TAAT.

20 

4.1.6  Two of such Compacts, CIPRISSA (for Rice) and TASI (for the African Savannahs) have 

already been set up by the Bank to coordinate activities for scaling up technologies to achieve self-

sufficiency in rice production and for transformation of the African Savannah into bread baskets. The 

CTDC will also engage Development Finance Institutions (DFIs) and Development Partners, namely 

the World Bank, JICA, IFAD, BMGF, Rockefeller Foundation, African Agriculture Fund (AAF), 

Agriculture Fast-Track Fund, Fund for African Private Sector Assistance (FAPA), Making Finance 

Work for Africa Partnership (MFW4A), Africa Climate Change Fund, Clim-Dev Fund, and Climate 

Investment Funds (CIF), and many others to secure co-financing for TAAT.   

4.1.6.1 The activities of the CTDC include: 

i) Convene a Crop/Livestock technology delivery platform of all major actors for each 
of nine priority commodities (e.g., rice, wheat, aquaculture, water efficient maize for 

Africa, cassava, sorghum/millet, livestock, orange fleshed sweet potato, and high iron 

beans).  Specific tasks are to consult, discuss, and prepare an agreement (the compact) of 

technologies, activities, and focus of the platform. The compact will discuss and agree 

on the technologies to be delivered, packaging, targets and timeline to cost-effectively 

deliver the technologies in a timely fashion; 

ii) Agree with NARES and Extension agencies on approaches to deploy technologies 
Specific tasks are to meet with key stakeholders (NARES, Extension agencies, NGOs, 

private sector, etc.) in RMCs to discuss best approaches to deploy technologies; prioritize 

the approaches in terms of effectiveness; deploy the preferred approaches with the 

country’s agencies leading; monitor progress, learn lessons and make immediate use of 

the lessons in improving delivery; 

iii) Define the target areas.  Specific tasks are to consult with the RMCs about which 
geographic areas to focus on during the different phases of technology deployment; 

discuss and agree with the RMCs on material and human resources required to cover the 

target area and how to sources these; implement the technology; 

iv) Mobilize all actors across the value chain. Specific tasks are to identify and register all 
the key actors across each target commodity’s value chain; call a meeting of the different 

actors across each target commodity value chain to ascertain constraints and how best to 

solve these; assign roles on technology delivery to different actors across the value chain; 

ensure that different actors across the value chain perform the assigned functions; 

monitor, learn lessons and make immediate use of the lessons in improving technology 

delivery; 

v) Design and implement wide-scale farmer extension models and innovative models to 
organize and aggregate farmers; 

vi) Work with FARA and others to build capacity in the NARES and public sector for 
program design, execution, and monitoring, and in the private sector for value chain 

organization and governance; 

vii) Support the development of a young class of ‘agripreneurs’, through demonstration, 
training and financing in coordination with ENABLE youth; 

viii) Promote climate-smart practices among farmers through funding and demonstration 
of the value of sustainable agriculture approaches;  

ix) Set targets and KPIs; monitor the achievement of the KPIs; distil lessons for 
improvements in future; .  Specific tasks are to discuss and identify key target areas; 



 

21 

formulate the targets that are achievable; mobilize those needed to achieve the targets; 

identify appropriate key performance indicators (KPIs) for different targets set 

x) M&E of the platform, using the outcome to improve the performance of the platform. 
Specific tasks are to design appropriate M&E data collection and analysis for the 

platform; discuss and ensure the leadership of RMCs in the M&E; implement the M&E. 

4.1.7. Project Management Unit (PMU) 

The Project Management Unit will: i) oversee day-to-day implementation of project fiduciary and 

administrative activities; ii) organize the transfer of project resources to the institutions leading the 

commodity value chains; iii) coordinate the compilation and review of reports from value chains and 

enablers for submission to the Bank; and iv) elaborate/implement administrative and financial 

management guidelines/template to be used across. 

4.1.8  The decision to pursue TAAT through a consortium of CGIAR Centers, the National 

Agricultural Research Systems (NARES), and their Umbrella body, FARA, donors, and development 

centers was decided at the High Level Conference on Feed Africa held in Dakar, Senegal, October 21-

23, 2015. At that meeting, the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), being the oldest 

CGIAR center in Africa and the center with the most geographical spread – 20 sub-stations across the 

continent, was selected to coordinate the TAAT platform or the Regional Technology Delivery 

Infrastructure (RTDI).  IITA is therefore the Executing Agency (EA). IITA will set up a small Program 

Management Unit (PMU), headed by a competitively recruited Project Coordinator, to undertake 

fiduciary functions (procurement, disbursement, financial administration, reporting, audits, etc.). 

Specific MoUs and implementation agreements will be signed with each of the lead institutions of the 

target commodities and the other key Implementing Agencies (IAs). 

4.1.9  The day-to-day management of the CTDCs is left to the various Lead Centers. Each Lead 

Center, or expert CGIAR center, shall prepare an annual work plan and budget that will be submitted 

for the review and approval by the Clearinghouse based on clearly defined deliverables. African 

Agriculture Technology Foundation (AATF), IITA, and CIMMYT will lead the Water Efficient Maize 

Production; AfricaRice and IWMI shall lead the activities within the Rice Self-sufficiency; IITA leads 

Cassava Intensification; ICRISAT lead in Sahel Food Security; ILRI will lead on livestock; World Fish 

will lead on fish initiative; ICARDA and CIMMYT are responsible for Wheat Self-sufficiency. 

4.1.10  Policy support: International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) will support the various 

institutions on policy issues that enhance successful program implementation and the attainment of the 

expected widespread and transformational impact. IFPRI will also work with other institutions that 

contribute to agricultural development policy work, including ‘The African Seed Access Index 

(TASAI)’, and African Technology Policy Study Network Program (ATPS). It will undertake its 

activities in consultation with each IA, reporting to clearinghouse. 

4.1.11. Capacity development: Forum for Agricultural Research in Africa (FARA) shall undertake 

capacity building at all levels within partner institutions and within the Priority Intervention Areas 

(PIAs) and their value chains. They shall also sign a MoU with Regional Technology Delivery 

Infrastructure (RTDI), with indications of their expected role and terms of delivery as well as expected 

budget for the various activities. FARA will ensure that the thematic content of capacity development 

activities and modules are designed and administered in consultation with appropriate and qualified 

entities, including relevant and participating CGIAR Centers. FARA will also undertake its activities in 

consultation with each program initiative team and report to the Clearinghouse. An Activity Plan for 

each initiative will provide detailed work plans. 

 



 

22 

4.1.12  The National Agricultural Research and Extension Services (NARES) will be the primary 

delivery agent for the deployment of the selected technologies, in close consultation with the 

Government Ministries of Agriculture to ensure country buy-in. This will be supported by private sector 

entities and relevant donor/partner programs in the respective countries. These delivery channels include 

the AGRA supported input dealer network, the World Bank supported West African Agricultural 

Productivity Program (WAAPP) and similar programs in other regions. Support from CGIAR Centers 

Value Chain Leaders will be transactional, value for money and demonstrable benefits, supporting 

national institutions to roll out validated and branded technologies. 

4.1.13  Mechanisms for timely startup include the early appointment of the Head of the Clearinghouse 

and Program Coordination team, and execution of implementing MoUs between IITA (the EA) and the 

implementing partners. This team will oversee the project inception workshop to elucidate all the plans 

for a smooth program take-off.  

4.1.14  In the target RMCs, numerous donors are supporting overall agricultural development. Donor 

coordination occurs in different ways including through Thematic Working Groups, Sector Wide 

Approaches (SWAps), and Integrated Sector Approaches. For TAAT, the key donors that have indicated 

commitment so far include AfDB, World Bank, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Rockefeller 

Foundation, and AGRA. These donors have been coordinating efforts through joint design workshops 

aimed at steering the development of TAAT for success and the achievement of the intended impact on 

the ground, and at ensuring that ongoing experiences are taken into account, and not duplicated (e.g., 

World Bank’s WAAPP, EAAPP, and APSA; AGRA’s work on input dealership; and BMGF’s work on 

technology development; etc.). Several of such meetings were attended by representatives of other 

prospective donors such as USAID. This coordination is also critical for effective monitoring of the 

program, and will continue during program implementation.   

4.1.15 Specific roles of each CGIAR center can be found in Table 8. 

4.2 Regional Public Goods (RPG) and Access to RPG Window of ADF 14:  

4.2.1  TAAT meets all features (Stages I and II) of RPGs, namely: (i) non-rival benefits (i.e., one 

country’s consumption does not subtract from the amount available to other countries), (ii) non-

excludable (no country in the region can be excluded from benefiting, except at a prohibitive cost), (iii) 

broad public interest and benefit (as demonstrated by letters of expression of interest from 22 low-

income ADF RMCs and three ADB RMCs and involvement of numerous NARES, FARA, SROs, and 

RECs in the formulation of TAAT); (iv) regional dimension or multi-country involvement (22 low-

income RMCs are targeted; Three ADB countries have expressed interest; TAAT adopts a regional, 

agro-ecological and commodity belt focus; TAAT will renew the drive to transform Agriculture in 

Africa by scaling up regional cooperation in combatting crop and livestock diseases, and accelerating 

delivery and development impact); (v) strong alignment with the Bank’s strategic orientation and 

continental and regional objectives (TAAT is aligned with the Bank’s Ten-Year Strategy and four of 

the five high priority goals - the “High 5s”- namely; Feed Africa, Industrialize Africa, Integrate Africa, 

and Improve the quality of life for the people of Africa; TAAT is one of the flagship initiatives identified 

in the Bank’s recently approved Feed Africa: Strategy for agriculture transformation in Africa: 2016–

2025); (vi) catalytic and upstream role (TAAT’s interventions will remove bottlenecks and 

disincentives that have forestalled uptake of agricultural technologies in Africa and upstream segments 

of commodity value chains, making it catalytic and upstream; Given that the commodities of focus in 

TAAT are strategic to the Bank’s RMCs, as underscored by CAADP, TAAT will clearly play a catalytic 

role to engender strong support for these commodities, and (vii) higher developmental impact in 

cooperating (given that crop and livestock diseases travel freely across national boundaries, making it 

impossible for individual countries to achieve anything better than in cooperation). The different 

products from the CGIAR’s research work (earlier indicated) are indeed RPGs made widely available 

to individuals and organizations working for sustainable agricultural development in the world. It is for 

these reasons of public interest, non-rivalry in partaking in the benefits from TAAT, multi-country 



 

23 

involvement, and non-excludability that TAAT was selected among programs seeking support under 

the RPGs window as part of the 2017 RO prioritization exercise of the ADF-14 (see 2017 Regional 

Operations Prioritization and Selection Report, Ref. MJ/ADC/07/17/02 dated 28 July, 2017). Details 

are presented in Appendix 4.

4.3 Cost-sharing exemption 

4.3.1  The centrally managed activities planned to be funded with RPG resources in Phase I of TAAT 

do not have revenue generating capacity.  They are designed to target 22 low-income RMCs and set the 

stage for upcoming phases, which will require cost-sharing by participating countries, and country 

programs (funded through loans), both of which will benefit and deepen the application of science and 

technology to sustainable agricultural development in Africa. In addition, given TAAT’s regional, agro-

ecological and commodity belt focus, six of the targeted 22 low-income RMCs (Chad, Congo DRC, 

Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Sierra Leone, and Sudan) are loan ineligible and in fragile states. TAAT therefore 

meets the eligibility for cost-sharing exemption and qualifies for financing through grant resources 

outside the PBA allocation (i.e. exclusively from the RO envelope). In line with this policy, OpsCom 

has cleared the cost-sharing exemption for the initial phase of the program, and recommends that cost-

sharing should be explored in subsequent phases after the project is launched. Management considers 

that TAAT meets the eligibility for cost-sharing exemption and therefore seeks Board approval for 

financing of TAAT through grant resources outside the PBA allocation. Details on TAAT’s eligibility 

for the grant funding and cost-sharing exemption are presented in Appendix 9.  

4.4 Linking centrally managed programs to country programs 

4.4.1 TAAT has two planks: the centrally managed operations and the subsequent country programs. 

The benefits that the former will deliver are catalytic and upstream to the main country investment 

programs which will further be financed by the Bank and its partners (the WB, IFAD, AGRA, BMGF, 

etc.). Without TAAT and the support of the Bank, investments by the World Bank and development 

partners may not achieve as great a development impact. A good example is in the control of regional 

pest and disease threats to increased productivity. 

4.5 Private Sector Participation 

4.5.1 TAAT is developing a unique approach to working with the private sector via the Commodity 

Technology Delivery Compacts.  Over 40 private sector organizations ready to partner with TAAT were 

identified during the course of project development. These businesses operate in the areas of input 

manufacture and distribution, commercial seed and propagule production, bio-fertilizers, irrigation 

equipment and supplies, greenhouse construction and food processing. TAAT will create business 

opportunities for the private sector by building seed systems in the rural areas, including agro-dealer 

networks, thereby expanding demand for seeds and services (crop insurance). The Commodity 

Technology Delivery Compact will ensure that the private sector is at the table as opportunities are 

being discussed. 

4.6 Procurement Arrangements 

4.6.1 Procurement of goods, works and the acquisition of consulting services financed by the Bank 

for the program, will be carried out in accordance with the “Procurement Policy and Methodology for 

Bank Group Funded Operations” (BPM), dated October 2015 and following the provisions stated in the 

Financing Agreement. Donor partners (WB, AGRA, BMGF, etc.) may use their own procurement rules 

over the resources which they contribute and implement in a parallel arrangement. The Bank 

procurement rules will apply to Bank financed activities. Specifically, procurement and financial 

management would be carried out as described in Appendix 10 and Appendix 11.   

4.7 Monitoring and Evaluation Arrangements 

4.7.1 As part of the M&E System to be carried out by the Commodity Technology Delivery Compact 

(CTDC), advanced monitoring tools aligned with the Bank's Agricultural Transformation Agenda 

indicators will be used to ensure day-to-day effective performance measurement. This includes but is 

not limited to options available at IITA and across its CGIAR Centers including participatory field-level 



 

25 

assessments, remote sensing, GIS, Big Data operations that compile and analyze program and national 

statistics, and advanced statistical diagnoses. Monitoring functions will be accompanied by detailed 

training in the use of these tools; as such, reporting will stem from participatory monitoring methods 

and structured data collection instruments. The functions of Knowledge Management are central to the 

M&E Framework and will be designed as a continuous, dynamic, action-reflection-action process. An 

independent external review will be carried out for TAAT at the end of year 2 (2019). 

4.7.2  An inception report will be prepared by the implementing partners, including baseline status, 

detailed work plans and budgets, as well as communication and technology deployment plans. All 

implementing partners will provide quarterly updates and regular situation reports; a mid-term progress 

report by each IA; a midterm progress report by the Clearinghouse; annual audit reports by independent 

external auditors; regular supervision reports would be carried out jointly by AFDB Country Offices 

and the Clearinghouse for national level interventions. All reports would be shared among the partners 

in the TAAT Framework. 

4.8 Sustainability 

4.8.1 The sustainability of TAAT will be achieved through: i) stronger links between research and 

extension; ii) stronger linkages of farmers to markets; iii) focus on agricultural value chains to ensure 

that the demand and supply sides are integrated; iv) supportive policy and regulatory environments; and 

v) expected higher commitment of governments to agriculture in the focal countries.  

4.9 Potential Risks and Mitigation Measures 

4.9.1 Potential risks and measures to mitigate are shown in Table 9. 

Table 9:  Risks and Mitigation 

Potential Risks Mitigation Measures 

Lack of enabling environment (policy, market, etc.). Provide fact-based & targeted advocacy. 

Weak value chain linkages especially to off-takers and processors Build capacity of outgrowers around established commercial 

companies and processors 

Lack of commitments of stakeholders in implementation  Active engagement of all stakeholders, with clear roles 

Lack of commitment & logistical support to enable training  Sensitization & identification of strategic training partners. 

Policy inconsistency (on part of governments) & long process in 

changing policies. 

Dialogue using fact-based rationale for losses due to policies 

status quo 

Lack of commitment by the youth involved in technology promotion 

and demonstration. 

Proper orientation on mindset change through participatory 

approaches and incubation centers. 

Lack of cooperation by government agencies Dialogue for buy-in. 

Weak NARES capacity and resource base Be focused on important specific interventions. Capacity of 

NARES strengthened. 

Retaining earlier promising technologies that become obsolete along 

the way 

The Clearinghouse will institute a mechanism for identifying 

and decommissioning obsolete technologies

I 

Appendix 1: The TAAT Clearinghouse (C-House) 

The purpose. Low productivity of African agriculture is a consequence of, among others, a lack of access to yield 

enhancing technologies or the resources to acquire them at scale. Successful crop/livestock campaigns to close yield 

gaps in several African countries (e.g., Liberia, Malawi, Nigeria, Kenya) are characterized by key elements, including: 

major political decision to reach millions of farmers with inputs, best fertilizer recommendations and best available 

seeds, development of agro-dealer networks and input supply chains. Other are market and infrastructure development, 

easy access by farmers to finance - often with no collateral based on risk guarantee schemes, crop insurance, smart 

policies and incentives, and media coverage of positive results, and mitigation of climate change. All these factors 

must feature in any plan to reach millions of farmers in a successful and sustainable way and the C-House ensures the 

success of TAAT campaigns given the above factors for success. 

The Clearinghouse is the main vehicle driving implementation. It should be substantially autonomous and its work 

plan and budget approved by the Program Steering Committee (PSC). The Clearinghouse, in association with each CG 

Center and the State institutions will manage the platform systems (earlier successfully applied under the SARD-SC 

project) described in an Annex in Vol. II of the Report. 

Objective. The objective of the C-House is to take proven agricultural technologies to scale in a commercially 

sustainable fashion through the establishment of a mechanism to facilitate partnerships and provide access to expertise 

required to design, implement, and monitor progress of crop, livestock, and aquaculture campaigns. 

Activities. The activities of the C-House include: i) Conduct an assessment/mapping exercise of target value chain and 

the surrounding ecosystem, and make technological and non-technological offer to address at scale the constraints; ii) 

Propose a multi-stakeholders agricultural technology deployment plan on how to go sustainably to scale; iii) In 

collaboration with the Bank advise the Governments and private actors on investment opportunities and financing 

mechanisms for going to scale; iv) Identify the optimal mix of partners - from CG and non-CG system, that will 

accompany the implementation backstopping and monitoring of the proposed plan; v) Validate the design and plan 

with stakeholders for a buy-in and commitment; vi) In collaboration with the RMCs implement the plan and monitor 

milestones and Performance Indicators; vii) Working with FARA and others, build capacity in the public sector for 

program design, execution, and monitoring, and in the private sectors for value chain organization and governance; 

and viii) Design and execution of a comprehensive communication strategy to effectively communicate the goals, 

activities, and benefits of the Agricultural Transformation Agenda. 

Structure. The structure of the C-House is organized along principal objectives of: i) Partner engagement; ii) Program 

design and monitoring; iii) Capacity building; iv) Communication; and v) Gender and youth employment as cross-

cutting issues. The C-House shall be independent of the IITA management and have its own advisory board. It cannot 

be located within the TAAT PMU but rather operate as an independent unit. The Clearinghouse will be based at the 

IITA sub-station in Cotonou with a Head supported by technical and support staff. 

Key skills required.  The key skills assets required in the C-House include: i) head of partner engagement; ii) 

technology transfer specialist; iii) an outreach expert; iv) a communication expert;  v) a gender development specialist, 

and vi) M&E Specialist in addition to other general services staff.(see Detailed Cost Tables). 

Infrastructure. The C-House will take advantage of existing infrastructure at IITA and will be located on one of IITA’s 

campuses in Cotonou, similar to the Business Incubation Platform (BIP) an entity for commercialization of research 

findings at IITA. 

Agricultural transformation incubation platform. As an agricultural transformation incubation platform, the C-

House aims at facilitating partnerships, program design/implementation to help reach millions of farmers with 

appropriate agricultural technologies, and reducing transaction costs.

Appendix 3: Combating the Fall Army Worm  

 

  

Combating the Fall Army Worm 

The Fall Armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda, is a moth that is indigenous to the 

Americas. It is one of the most damaging crop pests in the Americas, feeding on over 80 

different crops, including maize, rice, sorghum and sugarcane.  The Armyworm was reported 

for the first time in Africa in 2016, discovered in Nigeria, and has already managed to spread 

to at least 40 African countries.  Without appropriate action, Fall Armyworm (FAW) could 

cause 21-53% maize yield losses in just 12 African countries. The value of these losses is 

estimated at between US$2.48 billion and US$6.187billion.  FAW should be expected to spread 

throughout suitable habitats in mainland sub-Saharan Africa within the next few cropping 

seasons. Northern Africa and Madagascar are also at risk.  

Meetings of technical experts from within and outside the African continent have been 

convened by USAID, FAO, and the Centre for Maize and Wheat Improvement (CIMMYT, its 

Spanish acronym) to draw up a plan to control FAW.  The Department for International 

Development (DFID) of the UK also approached the African Development Bank (AfDB) to 

take the lead in the control of FAW.  AfDB hosted a side event on FAW at the World Food 

Prize Foundation’s Borlaug symposium in Des Moines, Iowa, to provide global awareness and 

invite other donors to participate in what may be the largest emergency response to a crop in 

Africa.  Participants from of USAID, CABI, ICIPE, CIMMYT, the Private sector (Monsanto 

and Dow Agro) attended the meeting.   

The consensus of the meeting was a regional approach that emphasizes Integrated Pest and 

Disease Management (IPDM) is required to contain FAW.  Immediate recommendations 

include (i) awareness raising campaigns on FAW symptoms, early detection and control, 

including beneficial agronomic practices; (ii) national preparation and communication of a list 

of recommended, regulated pesticides and biopesticides and their appropriate application 

methods. Work should also start immediately to (i) assess preferred crop varieties for resistance 

or tolerance to FAW; (ii) introduce classical biological control agents from the Americas. A 

conducive policy environment should promote lower risk control options through short term 

subsidies and rapid assessment and registration of biopesticides and biological control 

products.  Digital methods of scouting, turning millions of farmers with cell phones into scouts 

who can report back on incidence, was also recommended.  TAAT will tackle the regional 

threat of FAW along the recommended interventions via a regional effort involved RMCs, 

represented by NARES, IITA, CIMMYT, ICIPE, CABI, and Sub-Regional Organizations.

Appendix 4: Check-list of criteria for financing RPGS 

Project Name MULTINATIONAL – TECHNOLOGIES FOR AFRICAN 

AGRICULTURAL TRANSFORMATION (TAAT) 

Department AHAI 

Countries involved Overall, TAAT will be implemented in three phases in 22 low-income RMCs 

(Benin, Burkina-Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Congo DRC, Ethiopia, Gambia, 

Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, 

Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia) of 

the Bank that have written to express interest in participating. Six of these 

(Chad, Congo DRC, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Sierra Leone, and Sudan) are 

fragile and conflict-affected states. However, it should be noted that TAAT 

will produce Regional Public Goods (RPGs) of public interest; no one can be 

excluded from it and also from the spillover benefits, given their public goods 

characteristics (see below). Phase 1 of TAAT will focus on nine agricultural 

commodities: Cassava, Maize, Rice, Wheat, Sorghum/Millet, Small 

livestock (goats and sheep), Aquaculture, orange fleshed sweet potato, and 

high iron beans.   

Regions involved Central, West, East, Southern and others given the public goods 

characteristics of the proven agricultural technologies dissemination planned 

in TAAT (see below).  

CRITERION  SHORT EVALUATION (BULLET-POINTS) 

Stage I: 

Non-rivalry: Public goods are 

those whose benefits can be 

enjoyed by one party without (or 

hardly) reducing the availability 

of these benefits to others. The 

project will demonstrate that the 

object of assistance within the 

project is something whose 

benefits will be consumed by 

more than one party and that a 

provider cannot keep non 

contributors from consuming the 

benefit of that good. Some 

examples can be terms of trade, 

cross-boundary diseases (animal 

and human), shared water 

resources, cross-border roads. 

TAAT has a spectrum of benefits that all the target beneficiaries along the 

value chains of the target commodities can enjoy simultaneously. These are: 

(i) agricultural innovations such as gender-sensitive proven technologies 

(that reduce the workload and hardship, especially for women), (ii) climate 

proof crop germplasm, (iii) control of Fall Army Worms, (iv) food security, 

(v) import substitution for the Phase I target commodities (cassava, maize, 

rice, wheat, sorghum/millet, small livestock, and aquaculture) due to 

increased domestic production, (v) savings in foreign exchange (due to 

reduced food importation), (vi) new employment opportunities and increase 

in rural income of farmers and entrepreneurs, (vii) improvements in the 

national economy, (vii) capacity building, (viii) congenial policies and 

institutional frameworks (for profitable and sustainable value chains 

development), and (ix) integration of production with markets. Based on the 

principle of comparative advantage, TAAT will result in increases in 

production, processing and marketing of agricultural commodities that will 

simultaneously benefit all the target beneficiaries with substantial spillovers 

to others given the public goods nature of the planned deployment of 

technologies envisaged. This will be enhanced by innovative partnership 

among the national and international institutions, advanced research 

institutions, Forum for Agricultural Research in Africa (FARA), and the 

Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA), among numerous other 

partners as designed in TAAT. 

Besides, there is an important differential among RMCs in terms of 

knowledge and know-how related to the commodities targeted in Phase 1I. 

As a result, TAAT will aim at using complementarities across the countries 

to cause trans-boundaries and trans-national spillover effects on the 

development of the target value chains and achieve sizeable regional critical 

masses in terms of human and physical capacities. 



 

V 

Non-excludability: It is difficult 

or prohibitively expensive to 

exclude others 

(Countries / communities/ 

regions) from enjoying/ 

consuming the generated benefits. 

The project will demonstrate that 

there is 

no way that non-participating 

countries/ communities can be 

stopped from enjoying the 

generated benefits because of the 

nature of the object of the 

project’s assistance. 

Under the TAAT, the proven technologies dissemination activities of the 

implementing CGIAR institutions and partners (e.g., AGRA, FARA, AATF, 

icipe, AWARD, etc.) were designed to directly benefit individual farmers 

and consumers, agricultural commodity processors, farmers’ groups 

including youth and women, policy makers, private sector operators, 

marketers/traders, transporters, small-scale agricultural machinery 

manufacturers, and institutions (NARES, CGIAR, NGOs) from low income 

Bank’s RMCs are the project direct beneficiaries. However, it should be 

noted that TAAT will produce Regional Public Goods (RPGs) (proven 

agricultural technologies) of public interest; no one can be excluded from 

these. The proven new crop varieties, control of Fall Armyworm, crop 

management practices, knowledge and other products from the CGIAR’s 

research work and similar institutions are “international public goods” 

(IPGs), made widely available to individuals and organizations working on 

sustainable agricultural development world-wide. By design, the CGIAR 

centres, which have a long experience working in networking with NARES, 

will work in partnership with the NARES and advanced institutions (e.g., 

AGRA, FARA, icipe, TASAI, AWARD, etc.) in all aspects of project 

implementation, with the RMCs being front and centre. Besides, TAAT will 

support thematic networks, conferences and large outreach media to ensure 

easy and unrestricted project information flow among RMCs. 

Of Public Interest: The good is of 

broad 

public interest and benefit. 

Typically, a public/ governmental 

entity in each participating country 

is typically responsible for the 

regulatory/policy context for the 

good to be produced and takes part 

in its production. 

The project will demonstrate that 

there is either an inter-

governmental coordinating body 

in place or an existing REC to 

regulate and oversee the function 

and coordination of the object of 

support in a proposed project. As 

such, the project will demonstrate 

to what extent the 

intergovernmental body and/or 

REC has taken steps to ensure the 

maintenance of the object of 

support and to what level of 

success. 

Twenty two (22) low-income RMCs (Benin, Burkina-Faso, Cameroon, 

Chad, Congo DRC, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, 

Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, 

Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia) of the Bank that have written to the 

Bank, through either their Ministry of Finance or Ministry of Agriculture, 

expressing interest to participate in TAAT. Six of these (Chad, Congo DRC, 

Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Sierra Leone, and Sudan) are fragile and conflict-

affected states. Although the executing agency and the lead implementing 

agencies for TAAT are mostly the CGIAR centers (AfricaRice, ICARDA, 

IFPRI, ILRI, IITA, WorldFish, IWMI, ICRISAT, etc.), the implementation 

on ground will be spearheaded by relevant NARES, AGRA, FARA, 

Universities, AWARD, and policy making institutions across the target low-

income countries, among others. At the regional level, the Regional 

Coordinator will interface with the relevant Regional Economic 

Communities (RECs) and ensure that regional integration elements are 

strong. The partnership between the NARES (including Universities), 

AGRA, FARA, and the CGIAR centers is fundamentally predicated on the 

three strategic objectives of the reformed CGIAR. These strategic objectives 

are: (i) Food for people (aims at creating and accelerating sustainable 

increases in the productivity and production of healthy food by and for the 

poor), (ii) Environment for people (aims at conserving, enhancing, and 

sustainably using natural resources and biodiversity to improve the 

livelihoods of the poor in response to climate change and other factors), and 

(iii) Policies for People (aims at promoting policy and institutional change 

that will stimulate agricultural growth and equity to benefit the poor, 

especially rural women and other disadvantaged groups). These strategic 

objectives perfectly coincide with the key aims and aspirations of the Bank’s 

RMCs, as encapsulated in their different development agenda. 

  



 

VI 

Stage II 

Multi-country involvement: The 

public good involves two or more 

countries and can only be 

effectively produced if every 

country involved participates and 

supports its production. 

The project will demonstrate that 

there are at least two countries 

involved with regards to the object 

of support (5%) and that the object 

of support in the Bank’s 

investment is something that is 

either of a global and/or regional 

development importance and this 

should be demonstrated through a 

regionally/globally validated 

document (for example the 

“Convergence Plan of 

COMEFAC” outlining the work in 

the Congo Basin, a UN document 

agreeing on steps to reduce 

climate change, SADC gender 

action plan, the ECOWAS 

memorandum on Food Crisis, etc.) 

confirming this importance (10%). 

TAAT is one of the flagship programs that arose out of the Pan-Africa Feed 

Africa Conference held in Dakar in October, 2015. Overall, it will be 

implemented in three phases in 22 low-income RMCs (Benin, Burkina-Faso, 

Cameroon, Chad, Congo DRC, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, 

Kenya, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra 

Leone, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia) of the Bank that have written 

to express interest in participating. Six of these (Chad, Congo DRC, Guinea-

Bissau, Mali, Sierra Leone, and Sudan) are fragile and conflict-affected 

states. However, it should be noted that TAAT will produce Regional Public 

Goods (RPGs) of public interest; no one can be excluded from it. Phase I will 

focus on nine (9) agricultural commodities: Cassava, Maize, Rice, Wheat, 

Sorghum/Millet, Small livestock, Aquaculture, orange fleshed sweet 

potato, and high iron beans. 

Through a value chain approach, TAAT is focused on contributing to poverty 

reduction and enhanced food security through proven technologies 

deployment for the commodities mentioned above. Most of these are among 

the strategic commodities retained by African Heads of State through 

NEPAD/CAADP intensive, widespread, and interactive consultations. This 

also fed into the consultations of the Global Forum on Agricultural Research 

(GFAR) through the Global Conference on Agricultural Research for 

Development (GCARDs) that greatly shaped the Consortium Research 

Programs (CRPs) of the reformed CGIAR. 

Strategic Alignment: The RPG is 

strongly aligned with the Bank’s 

strategic orientations and also to 

continental and regional 

objectives (i.e., RPGs identified as 

priority operations under NEPAD 

or REC regional integration 

plans). Harmonization and 

partnership will be encouraged by 

giving preference to co-financing 

arrangements that promote donor 

coordination and leverage the 

Bank’s own resources by 

mobilizing additional funds, 

including from sister institutions 

or the private sector. 

The project will demonstrate that 

the RPG is closely aligned with the 

continental and regional 

development agenda as well as the 

Bank Group’s own strategy, 

especially with regard to 

selectivity and sector focus, and 

harmonization and partnership. 

TAAT is one of the flagship initiatives identified in the Bank’s recently 

approved Feed Africa: Strategy for agriculture transformation in Africa: 

2016–2025. Through it, the Bank is contributing to the reformed CGIAR by 

supporting CRPs on: (i) maize, (ii) rice-based systems (GRiSP), (iii) roots 

and tubers, (iv) wheat, and (v) institutions and markets (includes value chain 

analysis), among others. 

 

TAAT aligns with CAADP’s pillar 3 (Promoting Agricultural Research and 

Technology Dissemination and Adoption) and pillar 4 (Increasing Food 

Production and Security). It also aligns with the ‘new’ CGIAR’s research 

result-oriented vision to reduce poverty and hunger through high quality 

international agricultural research, partnership and leadership. 

While coordinating with the CGIAR centers, the Bank is engaging with other 

donors for co-financing of the TAAT program. One of such co-financing 

meeting was held in Abidjan, on 1 Dec., 2016, at the instance of the Bill & 

Melinda Gates Foundation. USAID, AGRA, and IITA participated. The Dec. 

1, 2016 partners meeting and earlier ones (e.g., during the Forum of African 

CEOs, in Geneva in March 2017) involved the World Bank, the International 

Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the Rockefeller Foundation, and 

the Japan International Cooperation Agency, among others, resulted in 

currently available co-financing fund of US$ 700 million, US$ 230 million, 

and US$ 1.13 million from the World Bank, AGRA, and BMGF, 

respectively.  



 

VII 

Catalytic and Upstream Role: 

Bank financing targets the initial 

stages of the processes for 

generating the public good and the 

Bank’s support should aim at 

correcting disincentives that 

prevent the RPG from emerging or 

progressing toward the stage of 

production, such as lack of 

coordination, aversion to risk, 

free-rider problem. 

The project will demonstrate that 

the  Bank is supporting an initial 

investment to an object and that by 

doing so opens the way for further 

investments by partners/ RMCs in 

the regional or national context for 

specific development impact (to 

be specifically demonstrated). 

Under this criterion, the project 

will also demonstrate that without 

the Bank’s intervention, there is a 

risk of certain beneficiaries free-

riding and not being held 

accountable. The project will 

demonstrate that the Bank’s 

intervention will add value to 

strengthen coordination in the 

region generally and/or through 

the intergovernmental body or 

REC involved (if any). 

Given that the commodities of focus in TAAT are strategic to the Bank’s 

RMCs, as underscored by CAADP, the Bank has clearly been playing a 

catalytic role to engender strong support for the program. For instance, the 

Bank is coordinating with the CGIAR-supported centers, FARA, AGRA and 

other implementing partners to engage other donors for co-financing TAAT 

and bring about the required transformational and widespread impact. As 

indicated above, some of the donors (World Bank, BMGF, and AGRA) have 

positively responded. With the support of the Bank, the borrower, the CGIAR 

centers, is also involved in contacting donors for Co-financing.  

 

The sustainability of TAAT project is hinged on eleven factors: (i) Broad 

spectrum of the NARES involved; (ii) Implementation through existing local 

institutions/organizations; (iii) Linkage with relevant ongoing initiatives; (iv) 

Adoption of science-based value-chain approach; (v) Capacity building of all 

stakeholders along the value chain; (vi) Deployment of proven agricultural 

development technologies; (vii) New knowledge and technologies from 

CGIAR centers and partner technology-providing institutions are 

International Public Goods; (viii) Government support; ix) Well though-out 

partnerships; x) Robust private sector involvement; and xi) Appropriate and 

clear exit strategy. The value chain approach adopted by the program creates 

the necessary incentives for all the players from production, through 

processing and value addition, to market development to be profitably 

engaged. Supported by cross-cutting topics such as policy support services, 

capacity development and outreach, youth entrepreneurs, and the 

clearinghouse services that are tacitly part of TAAT, these are critically 

important to ensure sustainability of the outcome of the program, 

sustainability and continuity after the program ends, and ensuring that the 

program activities are adapted to fit local conditions. 

Higher Developmental Impact in 

Cooperating: The development 

impact to be achieved through 

countries’ cooperation is 

demonstrably superior to what 

each country could have achieved 

individually. 

The project will go on to 

demonstrate that the development 

impact (to be specified by the team 

e.g. poverty reduction, gender 

equity, human development, etc.) 

will be increased only if the object 

of support is addressed within a 

regional context with the 

participation of at least two 

countries (as opposed to national 

projects). 

In Africa, public investments in dissemination, deployment, and promotion 

of proven agricultural development technologies and innovations are so 

limited that no one country by itself can meet investment needed for such 

endeavors whose outcome could lead to widespread and transformational 

impact aimed at under the TAAT program. By creating regional networks of 

NARES, involving the RECs, and building functional collaboration with 

CGIAR centers, FARA, and AGRA, to mention a few, TAAT will generate 

a global output that surpasses the summation of individual countries’ efforts.  

 

For any given commodity, regional critical mass of human and material 

resources needed for the deployment of proven agricultural technologies and 

innovations will be mobilized to tackle county specific, cross border, and 

trans-national issues. The Clearinghouse, working closely with both the 

Regional Coordinators and the RECs will ensure that this happens and also 

bring about regional integration for a wider scale impact.

Appendix 6: Deployment of the New Rice for Africa 

The development of the NERICA (New Rice for Africa) rice varieties by AfricaRice in the 1990s is 

lauded as one of the most significant advances in crop improvement in Africa. Every year, Africa 

imports one third of the world’s rice, nearly 10 million MT; West Africa alone accounts for more than 

half of rice imports, 5.2 million tons. By 2020 an extra 17 million tons of milled rice will be required if 

domestic production continues to lag behind the ever-increasing demand.  In 2003 the Bank approved 

a 5-year $34 million project to finance NERICA rice deployment in seven West African countries: 

Nigeria, Mali, Sierra Leone, Benin, Ghana, Guinea and the Gambia.  

By the end of the project, NERICA rice farmers in each of the participating countries achieved 

significantly higher yields compared to their traditional rice varieties. Average yield in project areas 

was 2.80 MT/ha, with some farmers achieving up to 4.7 MT/ha; up from 1 MT/ha average yields on 

farmers’ fields before the project. At the closing of the project, a survey suggested that over half a 

million hectares of NERICA rice varieties were grown in the seven target countries alone.  NERICA 

won the U.S. Treasury’s annual Development Impact Honors (DIH) in 2014 as one of the six high-

impact and noteworthy projects that won out of a pool of 29 strong submissions. The DIH ceremony 

publicly recognizes outstanding projects undertaken by the multilateral development banks and 

showcases these effective success stories.

Appendix 7: Description of seven of the nine priority technologies of TAAT 

 

 

Water Efficient Maize for Africa (WEMA) 

Frequent droughts are a major element of climate change and persistent challenge to sub-Saharan 

African (SSA) agriculture, making farming risky for millions of smallholder farmers who rely on rain 

fed crop production such as maize, a major staple food crop for over 300 million people in SSA. The 

impact of drought resulting from climate change is threatening food security in most parts of Africa.  

Various approaches have been identified to mitigate the impact of climate change including developing 

crops—for example maize—with enhanced adaptation to drought-stress and pest-outbreak. The 

adoption at scale using value-chain approach of such climate-smart crops by smallholder farmers can 

stabilize yields in the midst of climate change; and encourage the use of best agronomic practices, thus 

contributing to the urgent need to transform SSA agriculture from subsistence to agri-business. 

TAAT will focus on one of the four different climate-smart technologies developed through the Water 

Efficient Maize for Africa (WEMA) partnership led by AATF in collaboration with other public and 

private sector organizations including CIMMYT, Monsanto Company, and the National Agricultural 

Research Systems of Kenya, Mozambique, South Africa, Tanzania, and Uganda.  

Results from on-farm demonstrations showed that some of the conventional climate-smart technologies 

are increasing farm productivity by up to 75%. An average yield of 4 tons per hectare has been reported 

from these on-farm demonstrations, with an impressive adoption rate of 26% within only three years of 

deployment. The projected future adoption rate was estimated at 89% with about 65% of adopters being 

new farmers. This will help Kenya produce 74,000 tons per year, enough to reduce maize import by 

15% annually. 

Further investments of USD 25 million will be catalyzed through TAAT to take the conventional 

DroughtTEGO™ hybrid technology to scale across six countries (Malawi, Nigeria, Rwanda, Ethiopia, 

Tanzania, & Zambia) in SSA. It is estimated these technologies will benefit 6.2 million people from 

availability of 4,130 metric tons of certified seed targeted to be produced and sold within five years 

based on the experience described above.

Self-Sufficiency in Rice Production 

Rice consumption in sub-Saharan Africa was approximately 26 million metric tons (MT) in 2014, with 

imports providing 13 MT, equivalent to about one-third of what is traded on the world market. African 

rice consumption is projected to reach 34.9 million tons by 2025, of which 12.6 million tons must be 

imported at a cost of about US$5.5 billion annually. African demand is growing as a result of African 

population growth, increased per capita consumption, and a shifting preference toward ‘premium’ rice 

linked to increased urbanization. The African rice sector has the potential to become an engine for 

economic growth across the continent. However, self-sufficiency in rice by 2025 requires the 

production of nearly 13 million additional tons or premium rice per year. This will improve the 

livelihood of at least 3 million producers and lead to economic gains of about US$5.5 billion per year 

among African countries. 

African rice self-sufficiency can be accomplished through holistic mechanisms including but not 

limited to widespread distribution and commercial adoption of high-yielding, climate-resilient rice 

varieties; and the expansion of the SMART-Valleys approach. Also, the following technologies offer 

the potential for significant impact:  

i) Information tools. Mapping tools are available to identify areas suitable to rice expansion and 
intensification including both flood and drought monitoring; 

ii) Improved varieties;  

iii) Accompanying technologies and innovations.  

AfricaRice leads this Intervention in close partnership with IWMI. AfricaRice is part of the Global Rice 

Science Partnership that includes experience from Asia and Latin America. AfricaRice and other 

partners operate Innovation Platforms (IPs), including membership of youth and women, which can be 

out-scaled to national and regional levels. It is critical for TAAT to engage with the Bank and the private 

sector to accelerate the mechanization of rice production and processing.  Partnering initiatives may 

include The Green Innovation Center, Grow Africa, WAAPP, and JICA-funded activities. Private 

sector participation is envisaged in quality rice seed production, marketing, and mechanization, 

fortification, packaging and branding. New higher value added products already include rice pasta and 

baby porridge. 



 

XII 

 

 

Cassava for Industrial Use 

 

Cassava grows very well in the Humid and Sub-Humid Zones, and also in dry semi-arid areas; it is the 

second most important source of calories in Africa after maize.  An average increase of 7.93MT/Ha (or 

70% increase) is required to fill the food demand gap for cassava by 2025. Many manufacturing 

industries are seeking to increase local content, thereby, creating a growing industrial demand for 

cassava.  However, yields are low, average of 10MT/Ha due to the predominance of local varieties, 

diseases, pests, insufficient use of appropriate fertilizers and insufficient markets for cassava-based 

industrial products. Working with the private sector, TAAT will adopt a market-led approach to deliver 

technologies that will improve both the productivity and use of cassava in the food and industrial sectors.  

Priority technologies to advance cassava revolution include:  

i) Rapid large-scale multiplication of improved disease-resistant varieties using efficient propagation 
techniques such as mini-cuttings, tissue culture combined with Semi Autotrophic Hydroponics, and 

community-based clean planting material production and distribution systems; 

ii) Improved fertilizer blends adjusted to local weather and soil conditions. Proven weed management 
and protocols for Integrated Soil Nutrient Management will be transferred to farmers, input and 

service supplier groups through training and technical backstopping;  

iii) Technologies for mechanization, such as planters, harvesters, stem cutters, loaders, peeling, drying, 
milling, etc. will be introduced to increase production efficiency, reduce production costs and 

provide opportunities for the engagement of an innovative new generation of farmers;  

iv) Value addition and processing innovations will be introduced to private sector entities comprised 
of at least 120 processor groups and 300 local entrepreneurs/processing site owners to process 

cassava into various products such as (a) high-quality cassava flour (HQCF) for wheat replacement 

in baked and confectionary products, for brewing and ethanol production, (b) chips and peels for 

formulating animal feed, (c) glucose syrup for use as a thickener, sweetener, candy and other 

products, and (d) starch for use in the pharmaceutical, food, textile, paper and packaging industries. 

The expected impact includes cassava yields rising from 10.5 to 16 t/ha on nearly 2 million ha in the 

humid and sub-humid zones. In addition, production costs are expected to be reduced by about 25%.

Self-Sufficiency in Wheat Production 

Wheat is grown on approximately 10 million hectares in Africa, producing around 24 million tons. 

Owing to its even stronger demand, wheat is an imported commodity in all African countries. Africa is 

the world’s largest wheat importer at more than 40 million tons in 2014, at a cost of approximately 

costing about US$15 billion, and representing a third of the continent’s total food import bill. Wheat 

demand is expected to increase by an additional 8.7 million tons per year by 2025, which means that 

without intervention wheat deficits will run to nearly 49 million tons per year. If nothing is done to stem 

this trend, 80% of all wheat consumed in Africa will be imported. A comprehensive management 

program designed by ICARDA, CIMMYT and its partners assists farmers to invest an additional $190 

per hectare in improved seed and soil and water management increases average yields by as much as 

4.4 tons per hectare. 

Through the use of improved varieties and management practices, average wheat yields could increase 

to 4 to 6 tons per hectare across 9.8 million hectares. This would be through improved seed delivery 

systems and agronomic packages; a more effective extension system, and improved policy support. 

Overall production would double over five years and over 1.7 million farmers could move into 

commercial wheat farming. 

A two-pronged approach for unleashing a wheat revolution in Africa would be carried out by first, 

bridging yield gaps in traditional growing areas of North Africa and African highlands through better 

varieties and soil and water management; and second by taking wheat "packages" to a new frontier in 

cool winter-irrigated environments, particularly in the Sahel.  

Numerous technologies are ready for the assembly of innovative wheat production packages that 

include:  

i) Popularization of ICARDA and CIMMYT’s heat tolerant, disease and pest-resistant varieties.  

ii) Practical and cost effective solutions such as raised-beds, supplementary irrigation, zero-tillage 

systems and the establishment of sustainable seed delivery systems.  

iii) Mechanization based on local, low-cost manufactured machines (North Africa is an example). 

 

NARES are critical partners in wheat expansion. Nigeria is particularly important to serve as a hub in 

bringing technology and skills to semi-arid wheat producers throughout West Africa.

Aquaculture 

The aquaculture component of TAAT will support the development of the sector in order to promote 

economic diversification, food and nutritional security and sustainable employment generation, all of 

which are central priorities of Africa Governments. The development goal is to produce a domestic 

aquaculture sector which serves as viable and inclusive business opportunity through enhanced 

production and productivity to improve the livelihoods of beneficiaries along the aquaculture value 

chain. The aquaculture sector in Africa needs to build the capacity to delivery high quality disease-free 

fingerlings, improve access and availability of cost effective feeds and seek alternative value-adding 

opportunities post-farm gate to enhance value chain profitability. 

The initial focus will be on Tilapia. The global Tilapia industry was valued at USD9.8B in 2015, with 

Tilapia estimated to be the second most farmed fish in the world. It is estimated that improvements 

from the WorldFish’s breeding program, which commenced in 2001, contributes to approximately 50% 

of those improved Tilapia.   As such, the TAAT aquaculture component will focus on three inter-related 

priority technologies, likely in Tilapia-based systems, to achieve this outcome:   

1. Improving the utilization and delivery high quality disease free fingerlings (seed) for small-

scale entrepreneurs to improve productivity and profitability. Breeding program have 

demonstrated a 6-10% productivity gain between generation, which when managed 

appropriately through ongoing breeding programs, hatcheries (which provide an alternative 

enterprise for small-scale producers) and grow out facilities deliver significant productivity 

gain at the production level. Importantly, disease management for the high quality fingerlings 

is critical.  

2. Feed inputs into aquaculture production systems can be between 60-80% of overall costs. A 

key to support the growth of the sector is improving access and availability of innovative, 

affordable and alternative feeds for small-scale entrepreneurs. The development of feed 

alternatives also opens opportunities for entrepreneurial enterprises as feed supplies.   

3. Seeking value adding options and food product development of fish-based products is a 

mechanism to improve overall value chain performance and provide entrepreneurial options 

and further employment. Importantly understanding market dynamics and consumer food 

preferences, and how these are changing are critical to the sustainable success of further value 

adding.  

Key beneficiaries will be through the value chain, from input supplies (seed and feed), producers, 

postharvest handlers and value adders, and importantly consumers with improved access and 

availability to high-quality nutritious fish.  

A current value chain analysis, supported by WorldFish, to be completed by December 2017, will 

provide additional insights to the impact of the priority technologies.

Sorghum/millet for the Sahel 

Africa's Semi-arid Zone occupies 5.5 million km2 and supports a population of 239 million. Poverty is 

widespread with 53% falling below the poverty line of $1.25 per day.  The natural vegetation across 

the Sahel and Sudanese Savanna is shrubby grassland.  These lands are generally flat with over 16% 

converted to agriculture, but highly subject to severe drought, affecting both crops and livestock. 

Irrigated farming along major rivers is particularly important. Water harvesting and other climate-smart 

technologies have important application throughout this zone.  Non-cultivated lands are often subject 

to over-grazing making integrated crop-livestock operations especially important.  This zone is 

extremely fragile and subject to desertification and catastrophe, but at the same time its people are 

extremely resilient and prepared for innovative, labor intensive solutions in land management. The two 

agricultural value chains ready for scaling up in this zone are sorghum and millet.  

Sorghum and millet production.  Sorghum cultivation is extremely important in the Sahel owing to its 

greater drought tolerance than maize, occupying 15.8 million ha. Yields are low (0.8 ton per ha) owing 

to low planting density, widespread plant parasitism by striga, low adoption of fertilizers, even 

waterlogging following episodic heavy rains resulting in current annual production of 13.2 million tons 

per year.  IFPRI projects the demand for sorghum across all of SSA to increase by 9.1 million MT by 

2025. A comprehensive management program designed by ICRISAT that assists farmers to invest an 

additional $151 per ha in improved seed, water harvesting and Integrated Soil Fertility Management 

will increase average yields to 1.8 tons per ha and steadily reduce the infestation of striga, resulting in 

even greater mid-term gains.  Livestock are critical to these farming systems and crop residues carry 

livestock through the long dry season, improved feed and health systems are needed from ILRI. 

Millet farming is equally important to human welfare in the Sahel as it is the most important cereal 

grown in the drier portion of the Semi-arid zone, occupying 15.5 million ha of rotationally grazed lands.  

Yields remain low (0.7 ton per ha) owing to poor water management and weak adoption of ISFM, 

resulting in current annual production of 10.2 million tons per year.  A comprehensive management 

program designed by ICRISAT and IWMI that assists farmers to invest an additional $151 per ha in 

water harvesting, wind erosion control and Integrated Soil Fertility Management will increase average 

yields to 1.6 tons per ha.

Small Ruminant Technologies 

Small ruminants are particularly important in the dry regions of West Africa, the Horn of Africa, East 

and Southern Africa because of their ability to thrive in drier pastoral and agro-pastoral environments. 

With a growing demand for animal source foods, including small ruminant meat there is huge 

opportunity commercialize small ruminant production while creating employment for other value chain 

actors, especially young people. In these drier areas staple crops may provide food, but livestock like 

small ruminants provide income. Transforming small ruminant value chains requires introduction of 

improved genetics, health and feed technologies as well as the right enabling environment. Proven 

technologies for improved small ruminant production include: 

i) Thermostable vaccine for Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR). PPR is one of the most important 

transboundary diseases in small ruminants and can results in morbidity of up to 100% and 

mortality of 60-80%. Vaccines are available but need cold storage. The vaccine can be made 

thermostable so that it can be delivered without a cold chain. Mortality can be reduced by almost 

100% with an overall increase in productivity of at least 30%. The Laboratoire Central Vétérinaire 

in Mali has recently produced about 300,000 doses of thermostable vaccine with the potential to 

scale up. 

ii) Improved feeding by better use of crop residues through variety substitution and incorporation of 

nutrient value of crop residues in crop improvement programs. There are existing varieties of 

cereals (e.g. sorghum, millets, maize) and legumes (e.g. ground nut, cow pea) that can increase 

animal productivity by 20-30%.  

iii) Introduction of drought-tolerant forages. Forages, such as herbaceous and/or tree legumes and 

grasses, can dramatically enhance livestock as well as crop productivity, while at the same time 

enhancing the system’s resilience and reducing its environmental footprint. For example the 

introduction of new varieties of Brachiaria in Kenya, Rwanda and Mali have led to increases in 

productivity of 30-50%. 

iv) Improved small ruminant genetics though community breeding schemes. Community-based 

breeding schemes can be used effectively to identify superior males for breeding within 

communities without the need for large scale investment in national breeding programs.   

v) Business models for fattening enterprises and feed processers. Fattening of small ruminants can 

be highly profitable, especially when targeting high value markets (e.g. Easter, Eid). Packages 

are available that can be modified to different contexts to support these fattening enterprises. 

vi) Index-based livestock Insurance (IBLI). IBLI has been developed in Northern Kenya and Ethiopia 

to increase the resilience of pastoral communities against drought, including a Sharia-compliant 

version.  Studies show significant welfare benefits—insured households are 36% less likely to 

anticipate relying on distress sales of livestock and 25% less likely to foresee reducing meals to 

cope with drought.

Appendix 9: Eligibility to grant funding and cost-sharing exemption 

Criteria Response in relation to TAAT 

5.1  The paper proposes that projects must meet all the stage 

I criteria. This is based on the justification that the project 

has demonstrated that it addresses an issue or a product 

which is a core activity for regional development and 

integration, and which provides an environment for 

complementary investments while at the same time will 

be demonstrating the free riding issue. Stage II criteria 
will, in turn, help to prioritize the pipeline of the ROs in 

that the higher the score, the higher it would be on the 

priority list and vice versa. 

TAAT meets all the Stage I criteria (Non-rivalry, Non-

excludability, and Of Public Interest) for financing 

RPGs. How TAAT meets all these stage I criteria has been 

elaborated in Appendix 12. As also elaborated in Appendix 

12, TAAT also meets all the Stage II criteria (Multi-

country involvement, Strategic Alignment, Catalytic 

and Upstream Role, and Higher Developmental Impact 

in Cooperating). 

5.2  While developing the ROs pipeline on a two-year basis, 

consideration will be given to regional and sectoral 

distribution of the RO investments and balance will be 

sought where possible. In the specific case of the RPGs, 

experience to date (August 2008) has shown that there is 

a high demand for such operations which fall within the 

priority areas of the Bank’s vision and strategic directive. 

Grant resources for RPGs will remain limited. 

Prioritization of grant based RPG projects in the ROs 

pipeline will also be done on the basis of their readiness. 

The TAAT operation clearly falls within the priority areas 

of the Bank’s vision and strategic directive. This has been 

well elaborated in paragraphs 1.4 and 1.5 of the TAAT 

Program Framework document, among others. 

5.3  Cost sharing exemption will be proposed only for those 

projects which demonstrate the best ranked eligibility to 

RPGs, as defined by the stage I and stage II criteria, 

including to Regional Economic Communities (RECs). 

Moreover, a specific component within a project may 

also be eligible for grant financing if that component can 

clearly demonstrate RPG eligibility. However, in the 

case of the latter, a component within a project may not 

be eligible for cost-sharing exemption if the 

implementation of that specific component falls in a loan 

eligible country, and/or is embedded as having revenue 

generating capacity. Financing in this case would be 

through the RO cost-sharing formula. 

The activities planned to be funded with RPG resources in 

TAAT do not have revenue generating capacity. Besides, 

many of the 22 low-income RMCs targeted in TAAT’s 

regional, agro-ecological and commodity belt focus are 

loan ineligible. Six (6) of them are fragile and conflict-

affected states. This provides another strong reason for 

cost-sharing exemption in this initial phase of TAAT. 

5.4  Remaining projects, even though qualified as Regional 

Public Goods would need to be financed according to the 

general principles laid out in the Regional Operations 

Framework, i.e. through cost sharing agreements with the 

recipient countries. 

Not applicable for TAAT, at least the centrally managed 

activities. 

5.5  Lower ranked operations to RECs or for which cost 

sharing agreements cannot be found would need to be 

taken out of the RO pipeline or postponed to the next 

ADF cycle. 

Noted. 

Grant resources outside the PBA allocation (i.e. exclusively 

from the RO envelope) will be considered for those projects 

which demonstrate superior developmental impact- with 

respect to economic and social advancement through amongst 

others, the following: employment generation, trade promotion, 

security improvement, gender equality and climate change and 

adaptation. 

The list of such projects will be determined by the ranking 

stemming from the rating assessed during the previous stage 

and endorsement by the Operations Committee. 

The TAAT program will promote deployment and use of 

gender sensitive proven agricultural development 

technologies. It will promote agricultural innovations that 

reduce workload and hardship for women, increase their 

productivity and income. Program activities such as: (i) 

harmonizing/streamlining technology release and seed 

system policies across countries and regions (for spillover 

effects), (ii) capacity-developing weak seed systems, (iii) 

ensuring that improved crop varieties and livestock breeds 

for specific agro-ecological zones are widely applied/used, 

(iv) identifying and removing constraints to agricultural 

technology adoption through policy audits, (v) 

identification and selection of best-bet technologies for 



 

XX 

uptake by RMCs, (vi) design & develop campaigns for 

trans-national control of pests and diseases (and related 

awareness raising that pest and diseases do not respect 

political boundaries), (vii) deployment of appropriate 

technologies through crop/livestock campaign in RMCs, 

and (ix) design and implement wide-scale farmer extension 

and innovative models to organize farmers will trigger 

greater efficiency and additional production, processing 

and marketing of the target commodities. At full program 

development, the estimated additional tons of food will be 

realized, with its multiplier effects.  

Providing climate-proof varieties of the target crop 

commodities and improved breeds for small livestock and 

aquaculture to millions of farmers in program in the target 

low-income RMCs and beyond will provide them and 

consumers with food and other benefits. Congenial policies 

and institutional frameworks for profitable and sustainable 

value chains development of the strategic commodities as 

well as enhanced national and regional capacity in 

agricultural policy and institutional development work are 

expected. 

Rural populations in the target low-income RMCs are the 

primary beneficiaries of TAAT, expected to directly or 

indirectly benefit individuals (e.g. male farmers, female 

farmers, professionals, etc.), groups (e.g. farmers’ groups, 

women, smallholder farm families, the youth, the private 

sector, policy makers, marketers/traders, transporters, and 

fabricators and small-scale agricultural machinery 

manufacturers, etc.), and institutions (e.g. NARES, 

CGIAR, FARA, AGRA, RECs, other players in 

agricultural development) in RMCs. The other 

beneficiaries are inhabitants in the target low-income 

RMCs, consumers of target commodities, scientists and 

agricultural extension workers involved in the project, 

and all participants in the target commodities. Other 

group beneficiaries include the RMCs through 

improvements in the national economy as a result of 

increased local production of target value chains. The 

program will thus contribute to enhanced food security in 

the target Bank’s low-income RMCs. It will contribute to 

build innovative partnership with CGIAR, FARA, AGRA, 

NARES, RECs, and other relevant key players to expand 

and accelerate the pace and efficiency of delivering 

improved innovations to reach millions of direct 

beneficiaries (farmers, women/private sector processors, 

policy makers, NARES, NGOs, marketers, traders, 

commission agents, fabricators and small-scale 

agricultural machinery manufacturers, transporters, and the 

private sector) across the value chains. 

 

Successful implementation of the project will positively 

affect all participants in the target value chains and will 

result in a sustained increase in the production of the 



 

XXI 

selected commodities. Given that many new enterprises 

will spring up along the value chain of the target 

commodities, this program is expected to create several 

new employment opportunities. This implies that the 

project will improve rural incomes while simultaneously 

promoting food security. For the farm households who will 

directly benefit from the intervention, about 50% extra 

income is estimated. Additional benefits will come from 

improved access to high yielding varieties (average yield 

increases of 20-50%) and improved agronomic, post-

harvest, and processing practices. Numerous other benefits 

are contained in the Results-Based Logical Framework.

Appendix 10: Bank Procurement Policy and Methodology (BPM) and Financial Management 

Bank Procurement Policy and Methodology (BPM) 

Bank standard PMPs for contracts that are either: (i) above the thresholds indicated in Annex B5, Para. 

B.5.3;2, or (ii) in case Borrower Procurement System (BPS) is not relied upon for a specific transaction 

or group of transactions; and (iii) in case BPM have been found to be the best fit-for-purpose for a 

specific transaction or group of transactions, and using (a) the relevant Bank Standard Solicitation 

Documents (SSDs), (b) relevant Borrower Standard Solicitation Documents (SSDs), or (c) relevant 

Third Party Standard or Model Solicitation Documents (M/SSDs) that have been assessed as fit-for-

purpose. The use of the Bank’s Procurement Methods and Procedures (BPM) is justifiable considering 

that the participating institutions will be responsible for implementing components of the program rather 

than the countries within which they are located, the different procurement policies of the participating 

institutions which have not been assessed by the Bank, the substantial country risks due to the 

multinational nature of the intervention that involves countries with different jurisdictions and the highly 

prohibitive procurement practice risks identified. Going forward, the BPS might be progressively used 

after the Action Plan to address and remedy the identified risks has been implemented in a manner 

acceptable to the ADF. All contracts will be carried out using the Bank Procurement Methodology 

(BPM) in line with the Bank’s October 2015 edition of the Bank’s Procurement Policy framework, 

utilizing available Bank’s Standard Solicitation Documents (SSDs). 

Procurement Risks and Capacity Assessment (PRCA): The assessment of procurement risks at the 

Country, Sector, and Program levels and of procurement capacity at the Executing Agency (EA), were 

undertaken for the program and the findings have informed the decisions on the procurement regimes 

(BPS, Bank or Third party) being used for specific transactions or groups of similar transactions under 

the program. The appropriate risk mitigation measures have been included in the procurement PRCA 

action plan proposed in Annex B5, Para. A summary of planned procurements are presented in 

Appendix 8 for the Bank-financed activities. Overall responsibility for financial management including 

reporting and auditing, remains with IITA through the PMU and the Clearinghouse. 

Financial Management 

The Bank’s assessment of the executing agency was limited to a review of the capacity of IITA to handle 

the financial management requirements of the project. The assessment concluded that the overall risk 

rating is Substantial due to the fact that the TAAT Project is largely decentralized to a number of 

participating countries; involves a number of partners and beneficiaries who may have limited fiduciary 

capacity, and funds will flow directly to Priority Intervention Area (PIA) accounts and reach 

participating partners and other beneficiaries. The assessment recommended the following mitigation 

measures: (i) recruitment of qualified financial management staff at IITA and at any national level 

institution that would need fortifying in financial management; (ii) recruitment of an independent 

external auditor for the audit of the project annual financial statements; (iii) recruitment of an internal 

auditor to facilitate fiduciary risk reduction and improve overall control; (iv) implementation of a 

financial information management system capable of consolidating the dispersed disbursements; (v) 

preparation and adoption of an administrative and financial procedures manual as part of the Project 

Implementation Manual; (vi) opening of special accounts at Executing Agency and Project 

Implementation Unit (PIU) level to ensure ready availability of funds when  needed; (vii) technical audit 

for component 1 related to production, productivity and competitiveness. 

The PMU (at IITA) and all Lead Centers shall operate robust accounting software that is IFRS compliant 

and capable of generating the required financial reports including consolidated financial statements. In 

terms of reporting, quarterly interim unaudited financial reports must be produced separately by the 

PMU and each Lead Center and transmitted to Bank within 45 days after the end of a reporting quarter.  

 



 

XXIII 

Disbursement and funds flow arrangements: The Program will have access to all four disbursement 

methods (direct payment, special account/revolving fund, reimbursement and reimbursement 

guarantee) as in the Bank’s Disbursement Handbook. IITA as the EA for the program will open a USD 

denominated Special Account as well as a Naira denominated account in a commercial bank acceptable 

to the Bank, to receive proceeds of the Grant. Similarly, the 6 CGIAR Centers and 4 Enablers will each 

open a sub-level USD denominated segregated Special Account as well as segregated local currency 

accounts in commercial banks in their localities that are acceptable to the Bank, to receive project related 

transfers from the EA (IITA). All project related disbursements will follow the requirements of the 

Bank’s Disbursement Handbook. 

External audit: An independent external auditor shall be hired by IITA, on terms of reference acceptable 

to the Bank, to carry out the audit of the entire program. The main independent external audit firm shall 

audit the PMU accounts and the consolidated financial statements that include the results of the PIU’s 

level operations that will also, individually, be audited locally by local affiliates of the main independent 

auditor, or by local partner firms selected by the independent auditor for the purpose, in the absence of 

a local affiliate. All audits of the program shall comply with the Bank’s requirements and terms of 

reference, as well as any other relevant accounting and reporting standards (like IFRS) as might have 

been agreed among the implementing entities. The EA shall transmit to the Bank the audited financial 

reports covering (i) EA program operations; (ii) the consolidated financial report; (iii) a copy of the 

audited financial statements from each of the PIUs; and (iii) a copy of the Management letter in respect 

of each set of financial statements submitted. The audit reports and applicable management letters shall 

be submitted to the Bank no later than six months after the end of each financial year audited.
