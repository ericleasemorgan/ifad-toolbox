Project Executive Summary 

Project Overview: the Value Chains, Agricultural and Rural Entrepreneurship Support Project 

(PACVEAR) will be implemented in three regions, namely Bafata, Oio and Gabu, in northern and eastern 

Guinea-Bissau. The project’s objective is to improve the rice and market gardening subsector production 

environment, and promote enterprises in all targeted subsector value chain links to create sustainable jobs 

and increase rural income. 

The project will be implemented over five years (November 2019 to December 2024). The total project 

cost, exclusive of taxes and customs duties, is UA 10.62 million (XOF 8.607 billion) financed through a 

UA 5.46 million Transition Support Facility  (TSF) grant (51%), a UA 3.04 million TSF loan (29%) and 

a UA 1.06 million African Development Fund (ADF) loan (10%). 

The project will directly benefit 4 400 households and farmers in the project area, i.e. 35 000 people, at 

least 13 000 of them women. The expected project outcomes are: (i) an additional annual production of 

4 000 tonnes of rice and 2 000 tonnes of market garden produce; (ii) creation and/or strengthening of 600 

agricultural and rural enterprises to create 2 000 sustainable jobs, 30% of them for women and 40% for 

youths; and (iii) increase in average rural income to XOF 250 000 per household. 

Needs Assessment: Irrigated areas (18%) are still too small to reduce the shortfall in rice production, 

estimated at 80 000 tonnes per year. The project will increase irrigated areas by developing additional 

660 hectares of land, half of which will be equipped for full irrigation water control with the availability 

of detailed designs and bidding documents for 720 hectares. In addition, the main sources of fragility in 

the country include political instability, extreme poverty and high youth unemployment, as well as lack 

of opportunities for youth socio-professional integration. Consequently, it is necessary to design an 

agricultural and rural enterprises development programme targeting youths and women that would 

contribute to addressing this unemployment challenge. 

Value Added for the African Development Bank: Through its previous operations, the Bank has helped 

to increase developed areas and to acquire specific expertise in key domains (irrigation, seed production 

and control, solar energy, processing, etc.). With PACVEAR, the Bank will help to consolidate the gains 

of previous operations and promote rural entrepreneurship, with a view to boosting growth and the 

professionalisation of the agricultural sector. By supporting the development of agricultural 

infrastructure, the Bank will create factors conducive to the development of agricultural and rural 

enterprises in all targeted subsector value chain links, thus creating employment particularly for youths 

and women (production, processing and marketing). 

Knowledge Management: The project will generate knowledge that will be used to create numerous 

jobs through the upgrading of incubation centres to train and support youths willing to embark on 

agribusiness activities. The project will also support the Food and Nutrition Security Information System 

(SISSAN) in collecting and processing data for use in developing relevant sector policies. In addition, 

PACVEAR’s specific contribution to structuring the seed subsector through the introduction of 

technologies for African agricultural transformation (TAAT) will help to generate knowledge that will be 

used to consolidate production methods, thus increasing production. The setting up of demonstration units 

and the dissemination of best practice, as well as the introduction of solar energy in drainage and 

agricultural product processing and conservation systems will further enhance knowledge, particularly on 

new technologies in these areas.

VALUE CHAINS, AGRICULTURAL AND RURAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP 

SUPPORT PROJECT (PACVEAR) 

Management hereby submits the following report and recommendation concerning a proposal to award a 

UA 5.46 million TSF grant and extend a UA 3.04 million TSF loan and a UA 1.06 million ADF loan 

to the Republic of Guinea-Bissau to finance the Value Chains, Agricultural and Rural Entrepreneurship 

Support Project (PACVEAR). 

I. Strategic Thrust and Rationale 

1.1  Project Linkages with Country Strategy and Objectives 

1.1.1  PACVEAR is fully consistent with Guinea-Bissau’s strategic orientations, particularly the Terra 

Ranka Strategic and Operational Plan (2015-2020), which hinges on four main engines of economic 

growth, including agriculture and agro-industry. It also plugs into Sub-programme 1 of the second 

generation of the National Agricultural Investment Programme (PNIA) “Promotion of Crop Production 

Sub-sectors”, adopted in December 2017, which focuses on the development of food crops (including 

rice) and market gardening through better control of water and increased access to factors of production. 

It aligns with the orientations of the Letter of Agricultural Development Policy (LADP) and its action 

plan, which aim to guarantee food security, increase and diversify agricultural exports and improve the 

living conditions of rural dwellers. It also embraces the orientations of the National Food Security 

Programme (PNSA) and the Rice Farming Development Programme (PDR - 2016). PACVEAR is 

consistent with the “Develop Infrastructure to Promote Inclusive Growth” pillar of CSP 2015-2019 

through the development of agricultural infrastructure and opportunities in agriculture (especially for the 

youth and women).  

1.1.2  Guinea-Bissau is characterised by fragility, further aggravated by overall institutional weakness 

and a non-inclusive development model without economic alternatives. Sector constraints include the 

isolation of production areas, the obsolescence of production systems, inadequate access to inputs and 

weak agricultural product processing capacity. The main challenge is to strengthen institutional, economic 

and social resilience, while building the capacity of actors, reducing gender disparities and supporting the 

country's structural transformation through the construction of key infrastructure to ensure inclusive and 

green growth. Agricultural transformation through the development of value chains, the promotion of 

youth entrepreneurship, the mainstreaming of the gender dimension and greater involvement of non-State 

actors (including the private sector) will contribute to building resilience and reducing fragility in the 

country. 

1.1.3  In spite of Guinea-Bissau’s agricultural potential, the State’s withdrawal from the agricultural 

sector and the political crises of the last few decades have impeded genuine agricultural development in 

the country. This lack of interest in the agricultural sector has led to a serious structural weakening of 

production systems (agricultural and livestock). This is compounded by vagaries of the weather and 

climate change, which pose a serious threat with consequences on the management of ecosystems and 

other renewable agricultural and natural resources, all of which can impede the country’s social cohesion, 

stability and sustainable development. This combination of structural and cyclical crises has far-reaching 

consequences on the entire agricultural, silvicultural and pastoral sector, food and nutritional security, and 

the livelihoods of most of Guinea-Bissau’s population who depend on agriculture (in the broadest sense). 

1.1.4  According to the agriculture sector study conducted in 2014 (Portuguese Cooperation Trust 

Fund), it is essential to optimise the use of farmland, create added value for products, and enable 

households to generate sufficient income to purchase certain commodities. Rice is the staple foodstuff 

(eaten by 90% of Guinea-Bissau’s households) and food deficit is made up annually by rice imports of 

about 80 000 tonnes. The promotion of market gardening, stockbreeding and related services will not only 

help to diversify the sources of food, but also improve the income of rural communities, particularly 

women and youths in the targeted regions in the northern and eastern parts of the country. Garden crop 

production currently meets only 60% to 70% of demand. The main constraints on growth subsectors (rice 

and market gardening) are the remoteness of production areas, the degradation of production systems, 

insufficient access to inputs (particularly quality seeds) and markets, weak processing capacity, the lack 

of information and economic opportunity exploration networks to promote the employability of rural 



 

2 

youths, and the inadequate private sector integration into the value chains of growth subsectors and related 

activities to act as an engine and a lever for private enterprises. 

1.2 Rationale for Bank Involvement 

1.2.1 PACVEAR is in line with two of the Bank’s High 5s, namely “Feed Africa” and “Improve the 

quality of life for the people of Africa”. The project will contribute to attaining these two priorities by 

developing rice and market garden value chains, building the capacity of actors, creating jobs and 

improving income. The project is aligned with the Bank’s Long-term Strategy (LTS 2013-2022) and its 

two overarching objectives: inclusive growth and transition to a green economy. 

1.2.2  PACVEAR is aligned with the Bank's Long-Term Strategy (SLT 2013-2022) and its two major 

objectives of inclusive growth and transition to green growth. The project is built on the three areas of 

special emphasis of the LTS: fragile States, agriculture and food security, and gender. It is consistent with 

the orientation of the Bank’s new Strategy for Agricultural Transformation in Africa (2016-2025), which 

puts special emphasis on the development of value chains and agricultural entrepreneurship. In addition, 

it will contribute to achieving the objectives of the Enable Youth and Jobs for Youth in Africa flagship 

initiatives, by promoting capacity building and the creation of opportunities for youths. Furthermore, the 

project is in keeping with the Bank’s Technologies for African Agricultural Transformation (TAAT) 

programme, which focuses on the adoption of new production and processing technologies in agricultural 

value chains. 

1.2.3  PACVEAR concords with the Bank’s Gender Strategy (2014-2018) “Investing in Gender 

Equality for Africa’s Transformation”, more specifically Pillar II, “Economic Empowerment”. It also 

follows the recommendations of the gender profile prepared by the Bank and UNWomen in 2015, on the 

need to integrate women into value chains. Specifically, it plugs into climate-change adaptation initiatives 

by promoting renewable energy, water-saving technologies and resilient methods. 

1.2.4  Agriculture remains one of the country’s most important strategic sectors and the only sector 

that can benefit the largest number of people, combat food and nutrition insecurity and provide jobs for 

young people and women. The continuous support provided by the Bank to the sector is justified by: (i) 

the highly satisfactory performance of similar Bank-funded operations, notably the Agricultural and Rural 

Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project (PRESAR) (completed in 2012) and the Rice Value Chain 

Development Project (PDCV-Riz) (launched in 2017); (ii) unmet needs in terms of irrigation 

infrastructure and support as well as the development of value chains and agricultural entrepreneurship; 

and (iii) the strong mobilisation and involvement of the Government, local and regional actors and 

beneficiaries. The activities proposed by the project, namely the development of irrigation schemes 

(particularly full control of irrigation water), the integration of value chains and agricultural 

entrepreneurship will help to promote the employment of young people and women in rural areas, 

strengthen adaptation to climate change and increase the resilience of segments of the population that are 

vulnerable to food and nutrition insecurity. 

1.3  Aid Coordination 

1.3.1  Since the April 2012 crisis, the technical and financial partner (TFP) consultation framework 

that was operating through multi-sector thematic groups has been put on hold. However, it should be noted 

that, in general, aid coordination and monitoring mechanisms have always suffered from the structural 

weaknesses of public administration. In this regard, before the coup d’état of 2012, the Bank approved a 

technical assistance project (PECA II) to build coordination capacity. The project included the convening 

of donor round tables in Brussels in March 2015 as well as capacity-building activities organised by the 

Ministry of Economy and Finance. 

1.3.2  Based on the “Letter of Agricultural Development Policy”, several bilateral and multilateral 

partners provided significant support for rural development, food and nutrition security in Guinea-Bissau, 

including: (i) IFAD (Economic Development Project for the Southern Regions - PADES and design of a 

new project for the diversification of family farming in the eastern and northern regions); (ii) BOAD 

(Food Security Support Project - PASA and Project to Promote Rice Cultivation by Youths - PPRFJ); (iii) 

ECOWAS (support for the preparation of the National Agricultural Investment Programme - PNIA); and 

(iv) WAEMU (feasibility study on the Irrigated Rice Cultivation Intensification Support Project - PAIRI 

and the Crop and Grain Storage Warehouse Construction Programme). It is worth noting that ECOWAS, 



 

3 

WAEMU and CILSS set up the Global Alliance for Resilience Initiative – Sahel and West Africa (AGIR) 

whose objective is to achieve “zero hunger” in 20 years. From an institutional standpoint, the activities of 

partners are coordinated by the Ministry of Economy and Finance. For agriculture in particular, the 

partners reached a consensus on the sector strategy, notably PNIA, during the partners’ round table 

convened in Brussels in March 2015. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) plays 

a major role in policy support and coordination of activities. 

The project will establish synergies with projects being implemented and those being designed. More 

broadly, the involvement of the various partners in the rural sector (agriculture, livestock production, 

fisheries and environment) is presented in Annex A4 of Volume 2 and summarised below:

II. Project Description 

2.1. Project Objectives and Components 

PACVEAR’s overall objective is to contribute to enhancing the competitiveness of subsector value chains 

(rice and market gardening) to boost inclusive and sustainable growth in the agricultural sector. Its specific 

objective is to improve the rice and market gardening subsector production environment, and promote 

enterprises in all targeted subsector value chain links, with a view to creating sustainable jobs and 

increasing rural income. PACVEAR, which will be implemented over a five-year period (November 2019 

to October 2024), comprises three main components: (i) Improve the Competitiveness of Agricultural 

Value Chains (rice and market gardening); (ii) Promote Agricultural and Rural Entrepreneurship; and (iii) 

Project Coordination and Management. The table below presents a summary of the activities selected. A 

detailed description of the activities is provided in Annex C3 of Volume 2.

2.2 Technical Solutions Adopted and Alternatives Explored 

2.2.1  The technical solutions adopted for PACVEAR are based on field data and lessons drawn from 

similar projects, discussions with beneficiaries, the specific characteristics of each site to be developed, 

the water resources to be mobilised as well as the ease of managing facilities and equipment. Therefore, 

the proposed works take into account not only rice cultivation, but also horticulture which is already being 

carried out in the lowlands with full irrigation water control, particularly during the dry season. Three 

options were considered: (1) lowlands with full irrigation water control will be developed into small plots 

that are easy to manage, maintain and improve; (2) market gardening areas will be systematically equipped 

with a mini submersible solar-powered borehole pump, a storage tank, a drip irrigation system1 and a 

protective grid fence and hedges; and (3) the mechanisation of tillage operations by providing support to 

agricultural mechanisation service providers (tractors and accessories) in project impact areas will 

contribute to improving tillage operations and creating new employment opportunities for youths. 

Table 2.2: Alternatives Explored and Reasons for Their Rejection 
Alternative Rejected Brief Description Reason for Rejection 

Develop just one large area 

with full irrigation water 

control where the project 

would be concentrated  

 

Construction of a large pumping station, covered 

water transportation canals with large civil 

engineering structures for water collection, 

carriage and distribution.  

This alternative does not ensure the availability 

of labour, in terms of quantity or quality, for the 

development of the facilities and the investments 

required. It is quite likely that the area will not be 

fully used. In addition, it will be quite difficult to 

manage and maintain the area. 

Develop market gardening 

areas with indurated wells 

without any dewatering 

mechanism  

Construction of one or more wells 5 metres to 10 

metres deep (one well per hectare) where 

irrigation water is collected manually and then 

stored in small basins and carried to the parcels 

by the farmers using watering cans or buckets.  

The manual collection of water from indurated 

wells and irrigation with watering cans makes the 

task, which is carried out mainly by women, very 

tedious and takes up an enormous amount of 

work time and water. This problem will be 

compounded in the medium term once 

groundwater dries up, obliging farmers to fetch 

water from a greater depth (20 metres to 30 

metres). 

Develop animal-drawn 

cultivation in the intermediary 

phase instead of motorising 

soil cultivation activities.  

Animal-drawn cultivation practised in the 

project regions is suited for light soils with 

limited humidity, to ensure high productivity. Its 

effectiveness largely depends on the physical 

conditions of the area to be cultivated.  

Large arable land in the region, the short period 

available for soil preparation and the short rainy 

season are factors militating against animal-

drawn cultivation.  

 

2.3 Project Type 

2.3.1 PACVEAR is an investment operation financed with ADF and TSF resources. The Government of 

Guinea-Bissau has not yet started implementing projects and programmes using the sector-based approach, 

given a number of institutional constraints and the fragility context. For now, the project approach is the most 

appropriate to ensure the achievement of outcomes and the effective/efficient use of the resources allocated to 

the project, which will also consolidate the gains achieved with PRESAR and PDCV-Riz. 

2.4. Project Cost and Financing Arrangements 

2.4.1. The project cost, exclusive of taxes and custom duties, is estimated at UA 10.62 million, (XOF 8.607 

billion). The foreign exchange portion represents 36% of the total cost, exclusive of taxes, or UA 3.85 million. 

Custom duty and taxes will be covered by the State, which shall to take the necessary measures to implement 

this provision. A 4% provision for physical contingencies and a 3% provision for price escalation have been 

included in the project cost. The summary of the project cost by component and expenditure category, as well 

as the expenditure schedule are presented in Tables 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5 below. 

 

 

 

                                                 
1  Overall, market gardening areas in Guinea-Bissau are irrigated manually (98% using watering cans). Consequently, drip irrigation will be 

introduced gradually over time. In this regard, basin irrigation (water is pumped from the well into a reinforced concrete storage tank and then 
conveyed gravitationally through buried pipes to supply small 2 metre to 3 metre brickwork basins) will first be used in market gardening areas. 

Each small basin will supply irrigation water to ten 250 m2 plots, or 0.25 hectares. Once women farmers are able to control the cost of managing, 

operating and maintaining their market gardening areas, a drip irrigation system will be established to replace the small basins.

2.4.2 The project will be financed with a UA 5.46 million TSF grant (51% of the project cost), a UA 

3.04 million TSF loan (29% of the project cost) and a UA 1.06 million ADF loan (10% of the project 

cost). Considering the country’s fragile context, the Government’s financial contribution is estimated at 

UA 0.20 million (2% of the project cost). It will cover detailed design and BDs for sites already developed, 

the allocation of premises for the PMU (head office at Bissau and field office in Bafata), the procurement 

of subsidised fertilisers (INPA), support for the preparation of the seed subsector diagnosis and the 

implementation of the seed subsector action plan, support for the establishment of the framework for the

monitoring of TFP operations, and dissemination of data through the Food and Nutrition Security 

Information System (SISSAN). The contribution of beneficiaries will be limited to the computation of 

their participation in easy-to-undertake ongoing development and maintenance works, estimated at UA 

0.86 million (8% of the project cost). The breakdown of project cost by source of financing is given in

2.5 Project Target Area and Beneficiaries 

2.5.1  PACVEAR will cover three regions in northern and eastern Guinea-Bissau, namely Bafata, Oio 

and Gabu, out of the country’s nine regions. It will cover 57% of the national territory and accounting for 

43% of the country’s total population2. The project impact area was selected based on several criteria: (i) 

the need to consolidate the gains of other Bank operations implemented in Bafata and Oio, and to extend 

them to Gabu - a region with a huge irrigation potential; (ii) geographic concentration of operations and, 

hence, sustainability and better visibility of actions; (iii) absolute poverty rates prevailing in the area, 

namely 83% in Gabu, 75% in Bafata and 73% in Oio; (iv) food and nutrition insecurity (above 15.6%); 

(v) high youth unemployment (30% in 2010); (vi) small area of irrigated land (18% of the agricultural 

potential); (vii) lack and obsolescence of facilities, difficulty in accessing factors of production (certified 

seeds, quality inputs, ploughing and post-harvest equipment, etc.); (viii) eagerness of youths and women 

to farm the land to be developed; and (ix) existence of local private initiatives that provide a real breeding 

ground for local small- and medium-size enterprises capable of enhancing the growth of value chains3.  

2.5.2 The infrastructure sites were selected based on the needs expressed at the grassroots level and a 

multi-criteria analysis combining: (i) the existence of local and sector operational dynamics; (ii) the 

absence of latent land conflicts; (iii) the commitment of FOs and local communities to ensure the 

management of the facilities to be developed; and (iv) the optimisation of the outcomes of similar projects 

(PRESAR/AfDB, PAIRI/WAEMU, PPRFJ/BOAD, etc.) to improve data quality at project entry. Thirteen 

(13) lowland rice cultivation sites have been selected under PACVEAR (the detailed list of sites is 

presented in Annex C3 of Volume 2)4.  

2.5.3 Specifically, PACVEAR will benefit many rural producers who would have easier access to 

facilities, inputs and equipment, and probably sell their produce more easily and at reduced cost. Project 

activities will focus on two highly vulnerable target groups in rural areas - women and youths. The project 

will directly benefit 4 400 households/farmers, or 35 000 people, at least 13 000 of them women. It will 

indirectly benefit all households in the three regions concerned through the outcomes of its activities and 

transformational investments. From the institutional viewpoint, the project will involve some 110 FOs, 

unions, EIGs and management committees. The implementation of project activities will create 2 800 

                                                 
2  Projection derived from the results of the 2009 GPHS based on a population growth rate of 2.2%. 
3  There is a need to build on the innovative initiatives implemented by NGOs and associations operating in the project area, such as ADPP, 

APRODEL, COAJOQ and ADIC-Nafaia, to promote value chains and create jobs. 
4  Detailed design and BDs (PAIRI 2018) for 12 of the 13 lowlands selected are available. This would help to rapidly commence works during the 

first year after the review of BDs.

decent jobs (for men, women and youths)5. 

2.6  Participatory Approach for Project Identification, Design and Implementation 

2.6.1  The project design was based on a participatory and inclusive approach involving all 

stakeholders, namely technical services, producer organisations, women’s/youth groups, civil society, 

private sector, development partners, beneficiary populations, projects, etc. These broad-based 

consultations were carried out through numerous meetings held during project identification, preparation 

and appraisal. This helped to make sound technical and operational choices that could contribute to 

ensuring the sustainability of project outcomes. During several visits to potential project sites and the sites 

of previous projects, discussions were held with the communities concerned and the representatives of 

producers to better identify the difficulties they faced, prioritise the activities to be implemented and select 

the relevant sites. That process helped to win the support of various stakeholders and led to a broad 

consensus on project design and implementation arrangements. 

2.6.2 This entire participatory process revealed great interest for the project, which builds on the 

achievements of PRESAR, PDCV-Riz and other past and ongoing projects. Producers reaffirmed the need 

to fully exploit the project area’s considerable potential and opportunities to mainstream pilot activities in 

the livestock sector particularly in Gabu district. Women expressed their interest for market gardening, 

processing and marketing of farm products, with the modernisation of production and processing tools 

and improved access to markets. Youths showed their enthusiasm in promoting agricultural and rural 

entrepreneurship through training, incubation and post-incubation support for private individual or 

collective initiatives in all value chain links. The development of a good communication strategy for 
PACVEAR and the maintenance of the participatory approach during its implementation are guarantees 
that local actors will take ownership of the project during the implementation phase. 

2.6.3 The consultations and working sessions held with technical services such as the General 

Directorate of Agriculture, the General Directorate of Livestock, the National Institute of Agricultural 

Research (INPA), Directorate of Seed Control and Certification, and NGOs (ADPP, APRODEL, ADIC-

Nafaia and COAJOQ) on the implementation of some project activities will help to ensure the 

methodological ownership of the project by partners and to conclude partnership agreements upon project 

start-up. 

2.6.4 Sites were selected for the development of irrigation schemes through field visits, consultations 

with technical services, farmer organisations, women’s and youth associations, beneficiaries and the 

analysis of the relevance of studies and projects such as the Irrigated Rice Cultivation Intensification 

Support Project – PAIRI (WAEMU, 2018) and the Project to Promote Rice Cultivation by Youths – 

PPRFJ (BOAD, 2015). The outcomes of these consultations are reflected in this appraisal report. 

However, adjustments may be made during project start-up. 

 

2.7. Bank Group Experience and Lessons Reflected in Project Design 

2.7.1 The Bank’s active portfolio in Guinea-Bissau as at May 2019 comprised ten (10) operations for 

a total net commitment of UA 73.47 million, of which eight (8) national public sector projects (UA 45.52 

million) and two (2) regional operations (UA 27.95 million). There is no ongoing project under the Bank’s 

private sector window. There is no problematic project (PP) or potentially problematic project (PPP). The 

distribution of the national project portfolio by sector is as follows: energy (74.7%); governance (13.7%) 

and agriculture (11.6%). The portfolio’s age has dropped considerably, from 6.2 years in 2014 to 2.6 years 

in 2017, due mainly to the closure of old projects (Education III and Health II). There are three ongoing 

operations in the agricultural sector, namely the Rice Value Chain Development Project – PDCV-Riz (UA 

4.19 million), the Study on the Revival of the Cotton-Textile Sector (UA 0.35 million) and the Emergency 

Assistance for Fall Armyworm Control (UA 0.73 million). 

2.7.2 The Agricultural and Rural Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project (PRESAR) financed by the 

Bank to the tune of UA 5.8 million, which was completed in 2012, rehabilitated/developed 3 800 hectares 

                                                 
5  The Employment Impact Assessment of the Job Saving Plan (PES) conducted by AfDB in 2018 showed that agricultural sector investments have 

a significant multiplier effect on employment (every UA 1 million invested creates at least 282 direct and indirect jobs). This sector has the most 

significant impact on the poorest quintile and helps to increase the number of people in the middle class.

of lowlands and mangroves, and provided support for the development of 460 hectares of market 

gardening areas. The project completion report prepared in February 2014 rated the project performance 

as satisfactory (score of 3.12 on 4), despite its implementation in a difficult socio-political context. In 

addition, the PDCV-Riz initiated in 2017 envisaged the development of 470 hectares of lowlands and 

mangroves, and 19 hectares of women’s market gardening areas equipped with solar-powered pumps and 

the construction of access roads, markets, input stores, product storage and conservation areas. Thus, the 

two projects funded by the Bank have significantly increased the land area available for cultivation (about 

5 000 hectares), improved agricultural production (rice and market garden products), increased income, 

and opened up and integrated production areas into the market economy. Lessons from these experiences 

are that the implementation of an inclusive participatory approach to infrastructure development, together 

with a mechanism for supporting grassroots actors, offer genuine opportunities for improving food 

security and farmers’ income. PACVEAR will also focus on rural entrepreneurship, which is an 

innovative approach adopted to boost agricultural sector growth and professionalisation. 

2.7.3  The project is also based on the conclusions of the mid-term review of the Bank’s Country 

Strategy and Programme in Guinea-Bissau for the period 2015–2019 conducted by IDEV in September 

2018, which recommends that the Bank should improve the quality of its portfolio, supervise operations 

more effectively, build the capacity of government technical services, select local operators/implementing 

partners based on objective criteria, better mainstream gender particularly by involving community 

leaders in raising awareness on gender equity and equality in agricultural development and, lastly, make 

project outcomes and impacts more sustainable. 

These recommendations have been taken into account by: (i) improving the quality of project design 

through the involvement of the PDCV-Riz project team designated by the PACVEAR 

coordination/management unit, formulating and analysing the relevance of available engineering studies 

on irrigation schemes; (ii) setting up an internal monitoring committee to supervise the project (twice a 

year); (iii) planning government technical service capacity-building activities; (iv) involving sector 

leaders in the selection of beneficiary sites and infrastructure management; (v) building the technical 

capacity of management committee members in infrastructure maintenance with the participation of 

SMEs; (vi) assessing implementing partners and developing new selection criteria; (vii) establishing an 

effective results-based project monitoring and evaluation mechanism, and building the project team’s 

capacity in monitoring and evaluation; and (viii) mainstreaming the gender dimension in all project 

components by improving production capacity, rice and market garden product conservation, building the 

capacity of women and youths, improving product processing and marketing capacity, and raising 

awareness for behaviour change. 

2.7.4  Final design and BDs for sites for the development of irrigation schemes (with total or partial 

irrigation water control) are available (12 out of 13 lowlands covering about 560 hectares, or 85% of the 

area to be developed). These studies were analysed during project preparation/appraisal missions and used 

as a basis for estimating investments in the irrigation schemes envisaged under the project. Once the loan 

agreement is signed, the PDCV-Riz team will start adapting the BDs to Bank standard BDs and launch 

bid invitations for works, thus helping to comply with timeframes. Standard plans for storage warehouses 

and vaccination yards are also available. 

2.7.5  To select local partners responsible for coordinating and organising producers around value 

chains and supporting young economic project promoters, PACVEAR solicited the services of 

experienced local NGOs that have a satisfactory working relationship with the Bank or other partners. 

Agreements and protocols specifying their roles and expected outcomes will be concluded with these 

entities. 

The NGOs concerned are APRODEL (Bafata), ADPP (Oio), ADIC-Nafaia (Gabu) and COAJOQ 

(Cacheu). APRODEL and ADPP are currently involved in PDCV-Riz and will be maintained. ADIC-

Nafaia satisfactorily implemented many activities on behalf of several partners, including FAO, the 

European Union and the World Bank. It is currently supervising the beneficiaries of 500 hectares of 

lowlands in Gabu Region. COAJOQ, which is based in Canchungo Division in Cacheu Region, is 

involved in implementing the European Union-funded Integrated Project to Revitalise the Private Sector 

in Cacheu Region. It is currently collaborating with 37 local producer associations with 1 850 members, 



 

10 

50% of them women practising market gardening. It also participates in the training of youths in 

agricultural mechanisation within an associative and sustainable context. 

2.8 Key Performance Indicators 

2.8.1  A gender-specific baseline situation will be established to examine the context, the level of 

indicators to be informed and other relevant parameters before project start-up. This will help to regularly 

assess the progress made, particularly in terms of outcomes and impact. Special emphasis will be laid on 

targeting those parameters that can be monitored and collected internally, and others specifically related 

to women and youths (women- and youth-disaggregated data). It will be necessary to analyse youth 

employment, salt flats and climate change issues in the current project area. 

The monitoring/evaluation specialist will monitor and evaluate project activities and results-based logical 

framework indicators internally, in close collaboration with technical experts (infrastructure engineer, 

employment promotion specialist and value chain expert) and project partners, including support NGOs. 

2.8.2  The key performance indicators that will be monitored based on the baseline scenario include: 

(i) surface area of lowlands developed with partial irrigation water control for rice; (ii) rice-growing areas 

developed with full irrigation water control; (iii) market gardening areas developed; (iv) number of short-

cycle livestock units promoted by gender; (v) infrastructure developed and operated (number of markets 

commissioned, kilometres of feeder roads developed, stores for storage of produce built, etc.); (vi) level 

of additional production (tonnes) and crop yields (t/ha); (vii) number of farmers (including women) per 

type of facility; (viii) number of demonstration units (DUs); (ix) number of structured producer 

organisations and facility management committees established; (x) growth level of farmers’ income, 

including those of women and youths; (xi) number of jobs created for youths and women through 

entrepreneurial initiatives and number of young entrepreneurs trained, incubated and installed; (xii) 

number of producers, processors and traders trained and organised; (xiii) level of involvement of women 

in decision-making bodies and their rate of access to post-development land; (xiv) number of processing 

units established and allocated (including for women); and (xv) number of nutrition activities supported, 

number of school canteens supported and level of impact on food and nutrition security. 

2.8.3  All indicators selected for the project will be aligned on those selected for PNIA II and will help 

to enhance the performance of the agricultural sector in Guinea-Bissau. The Bank’s various supervision 

missions and periodic progress reports will reflect the level of achievement of the indicators. 

 

III Project Feasibility 

3.1 Financial and Economic Performance 

Table 3.1: Key Financial and Economic Data  

NPV (8%) XOF 20 944 million 

EIRR (baseline scenario) 16.9% 

 

3.1.1 The project financial and economic analysis was carried out based on the cost/benefit of 

additional cash flows from the two priority sector crop (rice and market gardening) and livestock (small 

ruminants, broilers and pigs) entrepreneurial production models. The detailed assumptions of the financial 

and economic analysis, the tables of farming models (the baseline and “with project” situations) and the 

financial and economic flows are presented in Annex B7 of Volume 2. The results of the financial and 

economic analysis show that PACVEAR is financially and economically profitable. 

3.1.2 Financial performance: the additional income from various farming models adopted are as 

follows: (i) farms benefiting from the development of 364 ha of lowlands with partial irrigation water 

control (rainy season rice cultivation) with an income of  XOF 0.237 million/ha; (ii) farms benefiting from 

the development of 296 ha of lowlands with full irrigation water control (double-cropping of rice and 

market garden products) with an estimated income of XOF 1.680 million/ha; (iii) 60 ha of market 

gardening areas for women (rainy season and off-season crops) with an income of XOF 5.867 million/ha; 

(iv) pig farms (introduction of 1 genitor boar for 3 sows for 30 beneficiaries) with an income of XOF 8.22 

million/beneficiary in peak year; (v) poultry farms (broiler chickens) with an average income of XOF 0.38 



 

11 

million/beneficiary; (vi) small ruminant farms (2 genitors and 8 female) ) with  an average income of XOF 

2.98 million/beneficiary. The additional income generated by the project will contribute to increasing 

overall value added, hence its contribution to agricultural GDP. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) 

is estimated at 14.8% for an NPV, at the opportunity cost of capital 8%, of XOF 20.11 billion, which 

reflects a significant result. 

3.1.3 Economic performance:  the basic economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is 16.9% for a NPV, 

at the opportunity cost of capital 8%, of XOF 20.944 billion, and the cost/benefit ratio (CBR) is 2.1. This 

amount is significant, especially as some of the benefits could not be taken into account in calculations 

owing to lack of data for assessing them, notably the improvement of living conditions and food and 

nutrition security thanks to increased income, food availability, the impacts of watershed and 

environmental protection actions, capacity building for other types of economic activities carried out by 

beneficiaries and multiplier effects on sector players (suppliers of inputs, equipment, services, etc.).  

Sensitivity tests were conducted taking into account a possible increase in costs (+10%), a decrease in 

agricultural production in case farmers do not adopt the proposed farming techniques (-10%) and a 

reduction in benefits (-10%) caused by plant and animal species, coupled with an increase in investment 

costs (+10%).  The respective IRRs for sensitivity tests are 15.0%; 14.8% and 13.1%. Other sensitivity 

tests were conducted taking into account assumptions of flow variability resulting from endogenous 

variables, and are presented in Annex B7 of Volume 2. 

3.1.4 The other project economic impacts can be summarised as follows: (i) the upstream effects of 

additional income on service providers (contractors, suppliers, NGOs, consulting firms); (ii) the 

downstream effects of additional income generation on producers, traders and processors who are mostly 

women and youths; (iii) a decrease in foreign exchange costs in the trade balance, thanks to the significant 

reduction in rice importation; and (iv) the impact on wealth creation in the country owing to an increase 

in GDP resulting from the generation of additional value added. Project benefits for households will 

improve the nutrition of vulnerable groups (children, women of childbearing age and the elderly), ease 

the hardship of the tasks of agricultural workers, especially women, reduce the impact of monetary and 

non-monetary poverty, and strengthen the livelihoods and the resilience of PACVEAR target groups to 

food insecurity and the effects of climate change, among others. 

3.2. Environmental and Social Impact 

3.2.1  Environment: PACVEAR is classified under Environmental Category 2 according to the 

Bank’s Environmental Safeguards Policy. It underwent a strategic environmental and social assessment 

(SESA) and has an environmental and social management master plan (ESMP)6. The Competent 

Environmental Assessment Authority (Autoridad de Avaliação Ambiental Competente - AAAC) of 

Guinea-Bissau has also classified the project under Environmental Category B, which is equivalent to 

Environmental Category 2 of the Bank's safeguards, in accordance with Law No. 10/2010 of 24 September 

2010 relating to environmental assessment.  

3.2.2 PACVEAR’s infrastructure will not generate significant environmental and social impacts.  

However, there will be a few negative impacts during the lowland development and infrastructure 

construction phase. These will include sound emanations, increase in dust in the air, earthworks, risk of 

STI/HIV/AIDS transmission during the construction phase, and the outbreak of malaria and waterborne 

diseases during the operations phase. These impacts will be relatively moderate and limited to receiving 

environments with low ecological sensitivity. The dispersal of the facilities across the three regions in the 

northern and eastern part of the country will also reduce their impacts, which will be limited in time and 

mitigated by appropriate measures. The project impact area does not contain protected areas or gazetted 

forests7.  

                                                 
6  Engineering and environmental studies on irrigation scheme development sites are available. However, the sites for support facilities (water points, 

rural roads, storage warehouses, etc.) are not known at this stage. If necessary, they will be the subject of environmental impact assessments to be 

carried out by a private service provider at project start-up and submitted to the Bank. Against this backdrop, it was decided that a strategic 

environmental and social assessment (SESA) should be conducted and an environment and social management master plan (ESMP) prepared. 
7  Guinea-Bissau has no gazetted forest. The relics of primary forests are gradually being replaced by mono-specific cashew nut plantations, which 

considerably reduce biodiversity in these three regions. 

   



 

12 

3.2.3  Project facilities will not entail any displacement of people or restriction of their access to 

property or livelihoods. Deeds of transfer and operation will be issued to farmers’ organisations (FOs) 

that will act as representatives of beneficiaries. This will lead to secure land tenure for the sites to be 

developed. Consultation frameworks comprising traditional authorities, landowners, support/assistance 

organisations and beneficiary organisations will be established for the issuance of an operation permit in 

the form of a deed of gift to beneficiaries (at least 30% to women and 20% to youths) by land right holders. 

To ensure the sustainable operation of the facilities built, sensitisation and information meetings will be 

held, followed by a landowner and land right owner identification phase that will lead to the signing of a 

deed/declaration of gift by village landowners, endorsed by the village chief, the mayor of the municipality 

or even the governor of the region concerned. Most of the facilities to be built by the project will be a 

concrete response to priority development problems (lack of irrigation water, lack of infrastructure to 

support agricultural value chains, construction of access roads, access to markets, etc.). 

3.2.4  Impact mitigation measures to be implemented before, during and after construction works as 

well as the improvement activities envisaged (protection of facilities, fruit tree planting, etc.) will 

strengthen project environmental compliance. Project environmental management activities will be 

coordinated by PACVEAR’s environmental expert who, under a framework agreement, will be backed 

by the Competent Environmental Assessment Authority (AAAC) for better management of the 

environmental aspects of the project. The project will also use the services of environmental focal points 

(EFPs) in the Regional Directorates of Forestry and Wildlife to conduct environmental monitoring during 

the implementation phase. These workers will undergo training in environmental and social assessment, 

and will receive the support and permanent assistance of the AAAC in carrying out the various activities. 

3.2.5  The budget allocated for environmental monitoring and evaluation is UA 162 000. This amount 

will cover the development of specific ESIAs and ESMPs for some sites (provisions) by an external 

consulting firm, the implementation of the mitigation measures contained in them, campaigns to raise 

beneficiary awareness and institutional support to the AAAC.  The ESMP summary is presented in Annex 

B8 of Volume 2. The environmental and social management framework and its summary were approved 

by the Safeguards and Compliance Department (SNSC), and posted on the Bank's website on 13 June 

2019. 

3.2.6  Climate change: a climate change risk assessment was conducted for the project using the 

Climate Safeguards System (CSS). The project is classified under Climatic Category 2 and may be 

vulnerable to climate risks. Practical risk management and adaptation options will be incorporated into 

project design and implementation plans. 

3.2.7  There is no known history of severe drought in the project area. In the course of the rainy season, 

rice farms may sometimes become flooded in places during periods of normal rainfall. This phenomenon 

is primarily the result of sand silting in the natural canals that serve as outlets to the production sites. To 

address the impacts of climate change, the project will adopt measures prescribed by the National Action 

Programme for Adaptation to Climate Change (PANA) following participatory assessments of the 

country’s vulnerability and adaptation to climate change, based on the agricultural sector diagnoses. The 

project will fully align its activities with PANA’s strategic orientations by developing lowlands and 

horticulture, supporting school canteens and establishing school gardens with a view to strengthening the 

food and nutrition security of the beneficiaries. The project will use a holistic approach that is designed 

to eliminate constraints at all levels of rice and horticultural value chains. Specifically in horticulture 

areas, PACVEAR will introduce solar technology and the plot water-saving system to control water and 

reduce water extraction.  

3.2.8  For better management of occasional flooding in rice fields, the natural canals of the target sites 

will be drained and resized to allow for the evacuation of any excess flow in the rice-growing lowlands 

concerned. To prevent silting in rice fields, which is the primary cause of flooding in the lowlands, bunds 

consolidated with soil-fixing plants will be built opposite slopes with strong runoff. The project will also 

make it easier for producers to acquire certified seeds by putting in place a programme, in conjunction 

with the National Institute of Agricultural Research (INPA) and seed multiplier organisations. It will also 

introduce the rational use of fertiliser to improve yields and, hence, agricultural productivity. The related 

agricultural infrastructure will be set up and designed with additional measures for adapting to climate 

change, to make them more resilient.  



 

13 

3.2.9 Gender: the Value Chains, Agricultural and Rural Entrepreneurship Support Project (PACVEAR) 

takes into account all the components of the gender dimension through the following activities: 

- Improvement of rice and market garden produce production and conservation 
capacity: the project will facilitate women’s access to land by allocating 30% of the rice 

fields developed and 90% of market gardening areas to women. The risk of limited access 

to land by women and youths has been taken into account as this concern will be an integral 

part of the intervention criteria, and the land issue will be systematically clarified before 

any operation (prior authorisation, land negotiation by the competent authorities, etc.).  

- Capacity building: the skills of women and youths will be developed through training in 
the use of improved seeds and rice farming, market gardening and cereal farming 

techniques.  

- Improvement of product processing and marketing capacity: the project will provide 
women’s groups with equipment for rice processing and husking (rice parboiling) and 

processing into by-products. This will lighten their workload and improve the quality of 

rice produced.  

- Awareness-raising for behaviour change: awareness and communication campaigns 
will be organised to improve the nutritional status of under-five children and pregnant 

women. The selection of themes will vary according to the needs of each project area: for 

instance, nutrition and health (family planning and reproductive health, HIV/AIDS, etc.), 

education (education of the girl child), conflict management, gender and gender-based 

violence, etc. 

Gender categorisation: PACVEAR is classified under Gender Category 2 according to the “Gender 

Marker System”. The gender analysis and action plan for implementing gender promotion and women's 

empowerment activities are presented in Annex B10 of Volume 2. 

Gender promotion activities concern: rice-growing areas (30%), market gardening areas for women 

(90%), processing equipment, drying units, promotion of women-headed small- and medium-size 

enterprises (at least 30%), promotion of gender equity and equality within farmers' organisations through 

workshops, training of members of women and mixed farmers’ organisations in farming techniques, 

leadership and gender, experience-sharing trips and equitable access to socio-economic infrastructure 

(feeder roads, storage warehouses, etc.). The budget allocated for the gender dimension is estimated at 

UA 2.786 million, i.e. approximately 27% of the total budget (cf. Annex B10, Volume 2). 

3.2.10  Nutrition: horticultural production on approximately 60 hectares of land will contribute to 

improving the nutrition of beneficiary households and have a positive impact on the health of the most 

vulnerable segments of the population, namely children and women of childbearing age. The project will 

develop initiatives to improve the hygiene and nutritional quality of food consumed by the people, 

especially women and children. It will also collaborate with RESAN for the pilot development of six 

school canteens and six school gardens. Additional peak year production of horticultural and animal 

products will contribute to making people’s food and nutrition better. Activities aimed at informing, 

raising awareness and educating on nutrition, hygiene and the prevention of the resurgence of waterborne 

diseases will also contribute to improving people’s health and nutrition. To enhance market access for 

processed products, PACVEAR will sensitise and support processing units/SMEs in upgrading 

parcelling/packaging and labelling according to standards. The budget allocated for nutrition support 

measures is UA 123 000. 

3.2.11  Social issues: the envisaged infrastructure and support for rice farming and market gardening 

will help to reduce the problems of low productivity and product conservation, and to better structure 

value chains for the benefit of beneficiaries. The project will pay particular attention to women and youths 

who are very active in rural areas, but often lack adequate training and resources. The development of 

market gardening areas primarily for women will enhance their empowerment and promote a more 

balanced diet in households. Specific support will also target women and young people in the development 

of rural entrepreneurship. In addition, training in organisational development and the structuring of FOs 

and producer unions will improve their roles in local governance and decision-making bodies, as well as 

the monitoring of the outcomes of activities promoted within such organisations.  



 

14 

The rehabilitation of feeder roads, the construction of markets and storage warehouses, and the setting up 

of small processing units will help to reduce post-harvest losses, increasing the availability of food 

products and household income. Improving access to socio-economic infrastructure will contribute to 

easing daily tasks and allow beneficiaries to engage in income-generating activities such as market 

gardening, seed production, poultry and pig farming, as well as agricultural product processing and 

marketing, including small-scale breeding.  

The jobs that will be created through the promotion of rural entrepreneurship among young people and women 

(close to 2 000 people targeted) and the establishment of many enterprises by this population segment will 

contribute to developing a business culture among people proposing projects aimed at increasing income in 

the project area, and fostering the creation of growth poles that can reduce youth urban migration, including 

attempts to immigrate.  

3.2.12  Involuntary resettlement: PACVEAR’s activities will not lead to any people displacement or 

restriction of access to property or means of livelihood. 

IV. Project Implementation 

4.1. Implementation Arrangements 

4.1.1  PACVEAR will be under the supervisory authority of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural 

Development (MADR). It will be attached to the General Directorate of Agriculture. Project piloting and 

supervision activities will be carried out by the PDCV-Riz steering committee set up by Decree No. 

1/2018 of 4 January 2018, which will be amended by ministry decision, at project start-up to take its 

specificities into account. The committee will meet once a year in ordinary session. The chairmanship 

will be ensured by the Minister MADR or his representative and the secretariat by the coordinator of the 

PMU. Also, a technical committee for monitoring the project will be set up. It will meet every three 

months to monitor project implementation, quarterly review of the activity report, as well as the technical 

program and the quarterly budget, and identify opportunities and constraints to improve project outcomes.  

4.1.2  PACVEAR will be coordinated by the PDCV-Riz Management Unit whose mandate will end in 

December 2020. This team satisfactorily implemented PDCV-Riz projects and, previously, PRESAR. It 

was also involved in PACVEAR preparation and appraisal. The PMU will be headed by the Coordinator, 

supported by the following sTSFf: an administrative and financial officer, a procurement specialist, a rural 

engineer, and an agronomist specialised in value chains, agricultural and rural entrepreneurship, and 

support sTSFf (drivers, secretaries, messengers, etc.). The team will be maintained and consolidated with 

the competitive recruitment of an environmental monitoring/evaluation specialist, a rural infrastructure 

specialist (technical assistance), a procurement specialist and an accountant. Apart from the fiduciary team 

(the Coordinator, the administrative and financial officer, the procurement specialist, the accountant, etc.) 

that will operate from project head office in Bissau, all other experts will be based at the field office in 

Bafata. 

4.1.3 The project intervention strategy will be based primarily on subcontracting. Under the 

agreements signed with the project, the national technical services (and their decentralised entities) will 

be strongly involved as project owner, works controller and supervisor, as well as executing agency, 

service provider or project manager. Private service providers (contractors, suppliers, consulting firms, 

individual consultants, etc.) will be recruited on a competitive basis and linked to the project by contracts. 

4.1.4  Applicable procurement policy and framework: the procurement of goods (including non-

consultancy services), works and consultancy services financed by the Bank under the project will be 

done in accordance with the Procurement Framework for Bank Group-funded Operations approved in 

October 2015, as well as the provisions set forth in the Financing Agreement. Specifically, procurement 

will be done in accordance with Bank Procurement Methods and Procedures (BPMPs), using relevant 

standard bidding documents (SBDs) for goods and works contracts as well as consultancy services for 

which BPMPs are considered most appropriate. An analysis of Guinea-Bissau’s procurement system as 

presented in Technical Annex B5 of this report showed that the procurement risk is substantial. As a result, 

the Bank’s Procurement Methods and Procedures will be used for PACVEAR’s implementation. A 

capacity building action plan will be discussed with the Guinea-Bissau authorities to enable the use, in 



 

15 

the short term, of the national procurement system following the conduct of reforms identified as 

necessary. 

4.1.5 Procurement risk and capacity assessment (PRCA): to take project specificities into account, 

the Bank assessed: (i) country, sector and project risks; and (ii) the executing agency’s capacity. The 

outcomes of these assessments revealed a substantial procurement risk level, and guided the decision to 

use BPMPs for all project activities. Appropriate risk mitigation measures have been included in the 

PERCA Action Plan presented in Annex B5, volume 2.  

4.1.6 Procurement arrangements: PACVEAR’s management will be under the responsibility of the 

PDCV-Riz actual management team. This institutional arrangement is the result of the desire to build on 

the achievements of the key sTSFf of this ongoing Bank-funded project. It is worth pointing out that the 

team had already implemented other Bank projects, including PRESAR. Support from a procurement 

expert was deemed necessary in view of the workload that will have to be added to the procurement 

activities of PDCV-Riz. The current team will be strengthened with the competitive recruitment of an 

environmental monitoring/evaluation specialist, a rural infrastructure specialist (technical assistance), a 

procurement specialist and an accountant. All experts will sign a performance contract that will be subject 

to an annual performance review. 

4.1.7  Financial management: the project implementation team will be responsible for the 

administrative, financial and accounting management of PACVEAR. The team will monitor and supervise 

project implementation, and should have sufficient technical, human and material resources to set up an 

efficient internal control system and an acceptable financial management system, particularly through 

proper and exhaustive recording of all transactions carried out during the project cycle, the safekeeping 

of financial information and assets, and information on and audit of the resources provided.  

The assessment of the PDCV-Riz implementation unit’s capacity revealed that it has the minimum 

capability and tools for proper recording of funds and accountability. However, given the unit’s duty to 

manage many projects simultaneously, it shall be strengthened with additional human resources, 

particularly an accountant experienced in managing development projects implemented using a private 

accrual accounting system. The accountant shall be recruited through open call for applications based on 

Bank rules and procedures. The recruitment will be monitored by the Bank's Fiduciary Services and 

Inspection Department (SNFI), which shall validate both the integrity of the process and the accountant's 

qualifications. 

The project administrative, accounting and financial procedures manual has already exist in PDCV-Riz. 

This document should be reviewed to take into account the multi-project management dimension of the 

executing agency and submitted to the Bank for approval. The manual will take PACVEAR’s components 

and categories into account. It will also include the general, budgetary and analytical accounting plans, 

the accounting principles and methods, as well as all applicable posting details.  

An integrated accounting and financial management software is also available. It should be reconfigured 

to make it multi-project, multi-user, multi-currency and multi-donor, thereby enabling the production of 

general, analytical and budgetary data required for financial and accounting monitoring, i.e. for producing 

financial statements by expenditure component, category and activity; and by source of financing for 

resources. At the minimum, the software should have the following modules: (i) general accounting; (ii) 

budget management; (iii) contract management; (iv) tangible assets management; (v) financial 

monitoring, etc. It will also be configured to have the three (3) levels of registration, validation and 

approval. At the end of the year, the software should help to obtain summary annual financial statements 

comprising a table of resource applications for the year, together with a balance sheet, a statement of 

special account reconciliation, and notes to the financial statements, among others. It will also allow for 

the monitoring of budget execution. 

Accounts will be kept based on the private accrual accounting system and using an integrated software 

adapted to development project management. The accounting plan will be drawn up based on the 

accounting standards of the revised Uniform Act of the Organization for the Harmonisation of African 

Business Law (OHADA) in force in Guinea-Bissau.   

Lastly, the project will produce an annual work programme and budget (AWPB) that will take into account 

all funding from all partners, as well as quarterly financial management reports based on the 



 

16 

implementation of the annual work programme and budget, and appended to the quarterly progress reports 

submitted to the Bank, in which a clear analysis must be made between budget forecasts and executions 

for the quarter. Any gaps should be analysed and explained.  

4.1.8  Disbursements: the Bank’s resources will be disbursed according to its rules of procedure, 

notably the disbursement manual. Disbursements will be made through the following three methods 

presented in detail in the project Appraisal Report (Annex B4 Volume 2): (i) the special account method; 

(ii) the direct payment method; and (iii) the reimbursement method. 

4.1.9 Auditing: the internal audit function as well as the PACVEAR internal control system will be 

assessed once or twice yearly by the General Inspectorate of Finance (IGF), depending on project risk 

assessment. An agreement will be prepared for that purpose and submitted for the Bank's no-objection 

opinion. An institutional support in the form of IT software and hardware will also be provided to the 

IGF. The external audit of project accounts will be conducted by an independent audit firm acceptable to 

the Bank and based on terms of reference agreed beforehand with the Bank. The recruitment of the 

external auditor will be in accordance with the Bank’s rules and procedures for the use of consultants. The 

auditor will be required to submit his/her report within six months following the close of the financial 

year audited. 

 

4.2. Monitoring 

4.2.1  Monitoring mechanisms: the project’s monitoring and evaluation system will be designed in 

relation to the expected impacts, outcomes and outputs contained in the project logical framework. The 

system will be participatory and will provide regular relevant information on performance and impact 

indicators as well as on the implementation of activities scheduled. A baseline situation will be 

established, based on the identified and selected sites many of which have already been studied. The 

monitoring and evaluation framework will systematically include gender-disaggregated data. 

Furthermore, targeted surveys will be conducted to better understand issues relating to income, food 

security, nutrition, job creation, gender mainstreaming, vulnerability and resilience. The information 

collected will be fed into the computerised monitoring and evaluation system to capture the actual values 

of project activities and inputs, and gauge project outcomes and impacts. In turn, these will be recorded 

in periodic progress reports highlighting the project implementation status and the achievement of 

outcomes.  

The Bank and MADR will supervise project implementation through a reinforced internal monitoring 

technical committee. Given the country’s weak capacity and fragility, the Bank, as part of its new 

development and business delivery model, will closely monitor all activities, especially by fielding 

periodic supervision missions (twice yearly).

4.3. Governance 

4.3.1  Guinea-Bissau’s political, economic and social governance indicators remain mixed, in spite of 

the progress made in recent years. As regards political governance, it is necessary to find lasting solutions 

to possible conflicts and establish mechanisms for ensuring justice. Guinea-Bissau’s governance and anti-

corruption performance is low, due generally to frequent political and institutional crises. In 2018, the 

country was ranked 42nd out of 54 countries in the Mo Ibrahim Index of African Governance (and 
particularly the 42th in the rule of law sub-indicator), which is a slight improvement over the last three 

years. In the area of economic governance, particularly in public financial management, the country’s 
performance has deteriorated because of the crisis and the capacity to mobilise domestic resources remains 

weak, as noted in the Bank’s analysis on the governance of projects approved in 2015 and in the 2016 
Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) scores.  

4.3.2  As part of PACVEAR’s implementation, and in an effort to mitigate the risks inherent in the 

weaknesses and instability of the administration and improve project quality-at-entry, it was decided to 

maintain the PMU of the ongoing PDCV-Riz since the unit is already conversant with Bank procedures, 

and to build on existing implementation studies. Moreover, although progress has been made in aligning 

the public procurement system with WAEMU directives, the bureaucracy characterising the procurement 

system is still one of the main challenges in implementing development programmes. Regarding 

procurement, operational arrangements were adopted to address the weaknesses noted. 

4.3.3  With regard to professional organisation in Guinea-Bissau, much remains to be done to promote 

effective rural stakeholder representative institutions. Producers are organised within professional 

agricultural organisations, including the National Association of Farmers of Guinea Bissau (ANAG) and 

the National Consultation Framework of the Farmers’ and Agricultural Producers’ Organization of 

Guinea-Bissau (QNCOCPA/GB). In addition, due to lack of resources, the activities of these organisations 

have had limited impact on their members, particularly in producer management and training. Many local, 

cultural, youth and women's associations are also present, and a large number of producer groups have 

been set up, with some of them already well organised. They are indispensable relays for support to small 

producers and the professionalisation of farmers. Nevertheless, the development of these associations is 

facing various constraints, including: (i) legislation that is ill-adapted to the current conditions of 

producing, processing and marketing products; (ii) difficulties in obtaining legal recognition; (iii) lack of 

training of managers in management and facilitation; (iv) lack of access to technical and market 

information; and (v) poor knowledge of legislation, particularly as regards the taxation system. 

PACVEAR is intended to better structure and organise producers and value chains stakeholders by 

strengthening and empowering community entities that represent the target beneficiaries. 

4.4. Sustainability 

4.4.1  The sustainability of project investments relates mostly to the capacity of the beneficiaries to 

ensure infrastructure maintenance and management regularly and over time. Irrigation, pastoral and 

support infrastructure management committees will be set up prior to the start of the construction of each 

facility, and are expected to facilitate community mobilisation and participation. Management committee 

members will receive organisational, technical and facility management support to enable them to 

supervise the work of contractors, in collaboration with the project team and the works control firm. The 

involvement of these committees in close works monitoring and acceptance will enhance their ownership 

of infrastructure built, thus resulting in greater sustainability. The project will also organise exchange 

visits to other facilities by management committee members.  

4.4.2  The project will build the capacity of young local artisans in routine infrastructure and equipment 

maintenance (cleaning of canals, maintenance of pumps, cleaning of irrigation basins, etc.) and provide 

them with kits for these operations. These local artisans could operate as maintenance service providers 

and will be easy to mobilise in case of breakdown.  

Beneficiaries, particularly producer groups, farmers' organisations and management committees, will also 

be structured, in collaboration with technical partners. The managerial, accounting and logistical capacity 

of these entities will be built to enable them to continue to provide services over time. Project-driven 

development of local expertise will promote long-lasting technical capacity, thus guaranteeing 

infrastructure sustainability.

4.5. Risk Management 

The potential risks and proposed mitigation measures are presented in the table below. 

Risks Risk Level Mitigating Measures 

Political instability, due to a difficult 

economic situation  

High Contribution to improving socio-economic and 

environmental resilience for greater stability.  

Climatic instability, with direct effects on 

agricultural, livestock production and 

development 

Low Storage and water control facilities, resistant seeds; 

Use of short-cycle and high-yielding species. 

Difficulties in mobilising the counterpart 

contribution 

Low The counterpart contribution is limited, not exceeding 2% 

of project cost. 

Weak capacity of the technical services 

involved 

High Capacity building of the technical services involved in 

project implementation. 

Low project ownership by stakeholders and 

beneficiaries 
Low 

Involvement and participation of beneficiaries in all 

capacity building stages (producers, MADR). 

Outbreak of plant diseases 
Moderate 

Training of producers in plant disease management and 

ecologically appropriate use of pesticides. 

Low capacity of implementation partners 

and contractors, resulting in poor 

performance and delays in project 

implementation 

Moderate 

Careful selection of implementation partners and 

contractors. 

Close control of partners and works contractors by the PIU 

and consulting firms, the technical monitoring committee, 

the beneficiary management committee and the PMU. 

4.6. Knowledge Building 

PACVEAR will contribute to the development and consolidation of producer expertise.  Adopting an 

inclusive approach, it will enable young people and women to develop technical and entrepreneurial 

capacity by settling on land with modern farming infrastructure and resources. The project will also help 

to generate knowledge that will be used to create many jobs by upgrading incubation centres that could 

train and support young people wishing to engage in agribusiness. Moreover, it will support the Food and 

Nutrition Security Information System (SISSAN) in collecting and processing data that will be used to 

formulate sound sector policies. Furthermore, the project’s specific contribution to structuring the seed 

sector with the introduction of Technologies for African Agricultural Transformation (TAAT) will 

generate knowledge that will enhance production techniques, thus increasing production. The 

establishment of demonstration units, the dissemination of best practice, the introduction of solar 

technology into dewatering and processing systems, and the preservation of agricultural products will 

further strengthen the sector. 

PACVEAR will support MADR in preparing strategic and sector discussion themes through external 

service providers. The themes  include: (i) agricultural sector institutional study; (ii) diagnostic of the 

performance of youth incubation centres (ADPP and COAJOQ) and support for their evolution into pilot 

incubation centres; (iii) youth agricultural and rural entrepreneurship promotion strategy: potentials and 

constraints; (iv) support for updating legislation and veterinary regulations; and (v) support for the 

collection, processing and dissemination of data on the Food and Nutrition Security Information System 

(SISSAN).  

As regards communication and visibility of project actions, there will be: (i) awareness-raising and 

information dissemination through various communication channels (community radios, media 

programmes, website, films, etc.); and (ii) promotion of innovative youth and women's employability 

actions and activities to build the resilience of vulnerable groups to food and nutrition insecurity.
