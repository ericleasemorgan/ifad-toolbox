PROJECT SUMMARY 

1. Project Overview: The overall goal of the Agricultural Value Chain Development Project (AVCDP) 

is to contribute to the attainment of Sudan’s National Agriculture Investment Plan (SNAIP) goals in 

achieving a comprehensive national socio-economic development driven by a dynamic agricultural 

sector. The specific objective of the project is to improve household incomes, food security, and climate 

resilience through infrastructure development, market access and trade facilitation as well as enhancing 

production and productivity. The project will be implemented in three states, namely, North Kordofan, 

West Kordofan, and Khartoum and will focus on four commodity value chains: Groundnuts, Sesame, 

Potato, and Gum Arabic. The project cost is estimated at UA 32.74 million, of which AfDB is financing 

UA 29.64 million or 90.5% and the Government of Sudan will contribute UA 3.10 million or 9.5%. 

The project is expected to start in July/August 2018 with a duration of five years. 

 

2. The proposed project will directly benefit farmers in at least 236,457 households (50% females) in 

13 localities in the Kordofan Region of the country. Additionally potato farmers of over 50,000 hectares 

of land currently under potato cultivation in Khartoum State and surroundings will directly benefit from 

the project. The target beneficiaries also include the 200 Gum Arabic Producers Associations (GAPAs) 

in West and North Kordofan States with emphasis on women and youth. The indirect beneficiaries of 

the project include over two million residents in the target localities in the country. With the expected 

increased production and productivity associated with the project and the value chain approach, more 

areas and population outside the target states will benefit from the project. Additionally, processors, 

marketers, agro-dealers in and around the target states will benefit from this project 

 

3. Needs Assessment: The AVCDP was identified as part of SNAIP and is addressing three out its 

seven Investment Program Areas (IPAs), namely: Increasing Agricultural Production and Productivity 

through Development and Modernization of Agricultural Systems and Improved Agricultural Inputs; 

Development of Agricultural Value Chains and Markets Access; and Development of Agricultural 

Support Services and Establishment of Information Network. In achieving the objectives of SNAIP, 

the Government commissioned a comprehensive study on the establishment of a modern Commodity 

Exchange in the country and requested the Bank to assist the development of key market-access 

infrastructures, which are the focus of this project. Therefore, the project is a direct response to GoS’ 

desire to revive the agriculture sector as the key driver for economic growth by promoting the value-

chain development approach.   

 

4. Bank’s Added Value: The Bank’s intervention through AVCDP is merited by the project’s 

consistency with the principles of key Bank Group policies and strategies. These include the Bank’s 

Ten Year Strategy (2013-22) particularly in its operational focus areas (private sector development) 

and areas of special emphasis (agriculture and food security); the Bank’s High 5s, the Bank’s Feed 

Africa Strategy (2016-2025) and its flagship programs such as TAAT and ENABLE Youth; the Bank’s 

Gender Strategy (2014-18) for the promotion of gender equality; and the Bank’s Strategy for 

“Addressing Fragility and Building Resilience in Africa (2014-2019). 

 

5. Knowledge Management: Given its innovative nature of supporting the establishment of a modern 

electronic commodity exchange and piloting the Farm Consolidation concept, the Sudan AVCDP will 

generate considerable knowledge that will add value to the overall design and management of 

agricultural value-chain development operations across the continent. The Bank will share this 

knowledge with other development partners and stakeholders engaged in similar operations

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE MANAGEMENT TO THE BOARDS OF 

DIRECTORS ON PROPOSED GRANTS FOR THE AGRCULTURAL VALUE CHAIN 

DEVELOPMENT PROJECT  
 

Management submits the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed Transition Support 

Facility (TSF-Pillar 1) grant of UA 24.95 million and an ADF (PBA) grant of UA 4.00 million to finance 

the Agricultural Value Chain Development Project in Sudan. 

I – STRATEGIC THRUST & RATIONALE 
 

1.1.  Project Linkages with Country Strategy and Objectives  

 

1.1.1 The AVCDP is well in line with Government of Sudan (GoS)’s long term development goals 

which are expressed in its Twenty Five Year National Strategy (2007-2031). Among the objectives and 

goals of the strategy related to agriculture sector, include developing natural resources and optimizing 

their use, realizing balanced agricultural and rural growth, food security, increased job opportunities, 

and revival of agriculture sector through infrastructure development and financing. The Project is also 

in line with the country’s second Five-Year Strategic Plan (2012-16), which aims to diversify the 

economy away from oil to agriculture and other sectors. 

 

1.1.2 The project is also consistent with the Economic Reform Program (ERP) 2015-2019. The ERP is 

the country’s most recent national planning framework and seeks to achieve robust, sustainable and 

inclusive economic growth supportive of employment creation through expansion of the production 

base of the economy, the optimum utilization of resources and its direction towards priorities and 

strengthening the role of the private sector. Its pillars include: (i) Macroeconomic Stability, (ii) Public 

Finance Management, (iii) Value Chain Development in the Productive Sectors, and (iv) Human Capital 

Development. The proposed AVCDP directly contributes to Pillar III of the ERP. The project is also 

aligned with Sudan’s National Agriculture Investment Plan (SNAIP, 2016-2020), which maps the 

investments needed to achieve the Sudan Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program 

(CAADP) target of six percent annual growth in Agriculture GDP.  
 

1.2.  Rationale for Bank’s Involvement 
 

1.2.1 Sudan has long been regarded as having the potential to be one of the major surplus food producers 

in the world. About 63 percent of its land area of 1.886 million km² is classified as agricultural land. 

Before 1960s, the agriculture sector provided the bulk of the export products of the country and 

accounted for the bulk of the foreign exchange earnings. However, the sector’s contribution to the GDP 

had been in decline until the secession of South Sudan in 2011. In the 2000s, the agricultural sector was 

essentially catering only to the domestic market. Following the secession of South Sudan and loss of oil 

revenue, the government has undertaken a number of important initiatives to diversify the economy 

away from oil and revive the agriculture sector. In 2013, Sudan became the 12th member state in the 

Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) region to sign the CAADP Compact. In 

doing so, the government had adopted agriculture as the key driver for economic growth within the 

framework of the CAADP, and subsequently developed the Sudan National Agricultural Investment 

Plan. The plan is a five-year investment blueprint that maps investments and activities needed to achieve 

6% annual growth for the agricultural sector by 2020. The plan is to also help Sudan achieve the 10% 

percent of total expenditure on agriculture in compliance with the Maputo Declaration.  
 

1.2.2 The Agricultural Value Chain Development Project was identified as part of SNAIP and is 

addressing three out its seven Investment Program Areas, namely: Increasing Agricultural Production 

and Productivity through Development and Modernization of Agricultural Systems and Improved 

Agricultural Inputs; Development of Agricultural Value Chains and Markets Access; and Development 

of Agricultural Support Services and Establishment of Information Network. Given the importance of 

AVCDP in achieving the objectives of SNAIP, the Government and Bank agreed to formulate the 

operation as a program and designate the current intervention as the first Project, which will focus on 



 

2 

 

edible oil seeds (Groundnuts, and Sesame), Potato and Gum Arabic value chains. The proposed project 

is also included in the pipeline program of the Bank’s current Country Brief (2017-2019) for Sudan and 

directly contributes to its second Pillar: Agricultural Value Chains for Inclusive Growth. 
 

1.2.3 The Bank’s intervention through ACDVP is also merited by the project’s consistency with the 

principles of key regional and national initiatives as well as Bank Group policies and strategies. These 

include the CAADP Compact; Bank’s Ten Year Strategy (2013-22) particularly in its operational focus 

areas (private sector development) and areas of special emphasis (agriculture and food security); the 

Bank’s High 5s, the Bank’s Feed Africa Strategy (2016-2025) and its flagship programs such as TAAT 

and ENABLE Youth; Jobs for Youth in Africa (2016-2025); the Bank’s Gender Strategy (2014-18) for 

the promotion of gender equality; Bank’s Strategy for “Addressing Fragility and Building Resilience in 

Africa (2014-2019); and with the Bank’s Private Sector-led-Economic Diversification and Development 

in Sudan flagship publication, which identified Agriculture as one of the sectors for economic 

diversification. 
 

1.3. Donor Coordination 
 

1.3.1 Generally, donor assistance to Sudan is coordinated by three ministries, namely, (i) Ministry of 

International Cooperation - Grants from bilateral and multilateral partners, (ii) Ministry of Finance 

and Economic Planning - multilateral financial institutions (AfDB, World Bank and IMF and others), 

and (iii) Ministry of Humanitarian Aid Commission that deals with the humanitarian assistance. The 

USAID and EU are the largest donors in Sudan, which are mainly funding on-going and post-conflict 

humanitarian interventions in the form of food aid and disaster assistance in Darfur, Blue Nile and 

South Kordofan. Concerning development aid, the AfDB’s growing technical assistance and targeted 

operations have enabled it to emerge as a preferred partner and first port of call for Sudan. Other 

leading development partners in Sudan are the EU, WB, IFAD, DFID and IsDB, which are also 

playing active roles in the country’s development. The bilateral support from China and Gulf 

countries (Qatar and Saudi Arabia) and Arab Funds also constitute a significant support, which is 

mainly in the form of grants and FDIs. Arab states have also pledged USD 10 billion towards food 

security in the region with a focus on Sudan, while Qatar has a USD 188 million development 

program in Darfur.  
 

1.3.2 Besides its role to finance important development interventions, the Bank also hosts key policy 

dialogue meetings such as the PRSP Working Group (WG), which is co-chaired by State Minister of 

Finance and AfDB through the guidance and support of COSD. The Bank continues to provide 

leadership in the PRSP process, which has rallied donors’ support for poverty, and poverty related 

issues. The PRSP WG eventually culminated in the establishment of the Development Partners Group 

(DPG). One of its main objectives is to contribute to strengthening coherence among Development 

Partners (DPs) in Sudan by consulting and sharing information on program and project interventions.

1.3.3 Development partners’ interventions are coordinated based on their comparative advantages. 

While the Arab Funds and IsDB focus on large infrastructure investments (especially dams), IFAD 

focuses on small scale agricultural operations with focus on traditional rain-fed agriculture and rural 

development, whereas AfDB focuses on value chain development and productivity increase. During 

the preparation and appraisal missions, consultations were made with all relevant DPs including FAO, 

IFAD, JICA, IsDB, WB, USAID, UNDP and EU to explore potential for co-financing and to ensure 

that the Agriculture Value Chain Development in Sudan is implemented in a harmonized and aligned 

manner with other DPs.   

II – PROJECT DESCRIPTION 

2.1.  Project Objectives and Components  

2.1.1 The overall goal of the AVCDP project is to contribute to the attainment of SNAIP goals in 

achieving a comprehensive national socio-economic development driven by a dynamic agricultural 

sector. The specific objective of the AVCDP is to improve household incomes, food security, and 

climate resilience through infrastructure development, market access and trade facilitation as well as 

enhancing production and productivity.  

 

2.1.2 The design of the project components and main activities are mainly informed by the outcome of 

a needs assessment study on the establishment of a modern Commodity Exchange or Borsa (as known 

in Sudan) in North Kodofan. The study was conducted to assess the current agricultural marketing eco-

system in the state and identify key challenges and gaps for establishing a modern commodity exchange. 

Infrastructure development for rural access roads, postharvest handling and storage, and processing 

facilities are some of the key gaps identified by the study. These infrastructures are the focus of this 

project. The project components are described in Table 2.1 below, with details provided in Annex C1 

(Technical Annexes).

multiplication center in Khartoum State, the main area of potato 

production in Sudan. The center is expected to produce locally 

the 10,000 tons of certified potato seed currently imported to 

Sudan. This will be done through the implementation of the 

following activities: 

 Land development for potato seed production  

 Establishment of small irrigation system for plots 

 Establishment of cold storage facilities.  

 Procurement of farm machinery and lab equipment  

 Certification labs and seed packaging facilities  

 Administration facilities and equipment 

 Procurement of foundation seeds 

 Feeder Road (7km) 
 

Sub - Component 2: Farm consolidation for improved 

production and productivity – This sub-component deals with 

piloting the process of joining small plots of land together 

through a participatory approach to form larger areas that are 

more viable production units with better access to 

mechanization, improved agricultural inputs, and financing.

Component Description 

 

20,000 feddans (8,400 ha) in seven locations ranging from 2000 

(840 ha) to 4000 feddans (1,680 ha) in North and West 

Kordofan States are already identified for this pilot activity.  

As Sudan is a country with a long tradition in the use of 

agricultural cooperatives, the project will build upon past and 

on-going similar initiatives and lessons learnt. This sub-

component will have following key areas of focus: 

 

 Sensitization, awareness raising and training of farmers 
on the farm consolidation concept. 

 Mobilizing and grouping farmers in the target area into 
cooperatives for better access to modern agricultural 

inputs and financing. 

 Establishment of a Risk Guarantee Fund (RGF), its 
guidelines, organizational structure, and 

implementation. 

 Farm Consolidation financing agreement to be signed 
among participating Financial Institutions (FI), private 

sector (agricultural inputs service providers), and 

farmer cooperatives. 

2 Infrastructure 

Development for Market 

Access and Trade 

Facilitation 

21.2  

(64.8)   

This component addresses the development of key market-

access infrastructures for the proposed Commodity Exchange. 
These include the need to establish a modern Borsa building in 

El Obeid, North Kodofan with a network of access roads and 

warehousing receipt facilities across North and West Kordofan 

States. Activities under this component will be implemented 

under two main categories: (i) Civil Works for 

upgrading/construction of main Borsa building, rural markets, 

feeder roads and one bridge (ii) Consultancy services for design 

review, pre-construction services, construction supervision, and 

technical audits to ensure works carried out meet the 

requirements of the design specifications. The Component has 

two sub-components: 

 

Sub-component 1: construction/rehabilitation of rural market 

access roads and bridge: This sub-component addresses 

upgrading priority rural access roads to all weather gravel 

standards for a total of 266 km and construction of one bridge.  

 

Sub-component 2: upgrading and equipping main and rural 

markets with warehousing receiving system and services:  

Under this sub-component, the construction/rehabilitation of 

the following key infrastructure will be undertaken:  

 El Obeid Main Borsa Building and warehousing 
facilities;  

 12 regional/rural warehousing facilities in 12 localities 

in North and West Kordofan States. Details of these 
facilities and their capacities are described in Annex 

C1 of the Technical Annexes. These warehouses will 

be used for storing not only the sesame and 

groundnuts, but also Gum Arabic, Hibiscus, and 

Sorghum.

2.2. Technical Solutions Retained and Other Alternatives Explored  
 

2.2.1 The technical solutions retained are based on criteria that will ensure project success and sustainability. 

Three technical alternatives were considered and rejected for their weaknesses in generating the expected 

impact on a sustainable basis (Table 2.2). 

 

Table 2.2: Alternatives Considered and Reasons for Rejection 

 

No Alternative Name Brief Description Reasons for Rejection 

1.  Project to directly 
finance farmer 

cooperatives under 

the Farm 

Consolidation 

scheme  

 

Beneficiaries are supported 

with grants to defray the cost 

of accessing full 

mechanization and improved 

agricultural inputs for better 

production and productivity.  

The option has often not worked 

effectively as it creates a culture of 

dependency and entitlement, which does 

not foster sustainable agricultural growth. 

Therefore, project resources are used only 

as a guarantee fund to leverage financing 

from agricultural lending banks 

2.  Bituminous surface 
treatment for feeder 

roads 

Flexible road with 

bituminous surfacing using 

chip seals. 

The surface treatment was not selected 

because of less traffic and high cost which 

make the investment not economically  

viable 

3.  To ensure equitable 
distribution, consider 

project to cover more 

disadvantaged states 

in the country 

In this scenario, project sites 

would be identified in more 

regions of the country where 

target crops have production 

advantage 

The coordination and supervision of the 

intervention would be cumbersome, and 

the spread of resources to too many 

intervention sites would result in less 

impactful project outcomes.

2.3.  Project Type  

 

2.3.1 The Agriculture Value Chains Development Project (AVCDP) is an investment project financed 

by ADF XIV (TSF/PBA) Grants and project activities are in line with TSF Guidelines3 

 

2.4 Project Cost and Financing Arrangements  

2.4.1 Total project costs to be incurred during the five-year implementation period, including price 

and physical contingencies, but excluding duties and taxes, are estimated at UA 32.74 million (US$ 47.5 

million). The project will be financed by the Government of the Republic of Sudan, African 

Development Fund (ADF) and FAPA. The ADF and FAPA will provide UA 28.95 million (US$ 42 

million) and UA 0.69 million (US$ 1.0 million) respectively on grant terms. The Government will 

finance selected project activities, including design of infrastructure; and parts of training, consultancies, 

and recurrent costs to the tune of UA 3.1 million (USD 4.5) million. In conformity with the principle 

that no taxes or duties would be financed out of the proceeds of the ADF and FAPA financing, any 

future changes in the rates and/or structures of taxes and duties would apply to the project. A summary 

of project cost estimates by components, expenditure categories, and schedule are presented in Tables 

2.3, 2.4 and 2.5 below, while details are provided in the Technical Annexes B2 Volume II of the 

appraisal report.

2.4.2 Project Financing Arrangement: ADF grant will finance the production and productivity 

enhancement component, agricultural infrastructure development component, production and 

productivity component and of market development and trade facilitation, and part of project 

management activities. The Government will mainly finance capacity building activities, design of 

works and allowances for the support staff. The Government of Republic of Sudan will also finance 

some recurrent costs of the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) in terms of staff salaries, office spaces 

and operating costs.  The breakdown of financing for the project is presented in the Table 2.6.

2.4.3 Counterpart Funds: The Government of the Republic of Sudan counterpart contribution to the 

project will be 9.5% of the total project cost (equivalent to UA 3.145 million); in addition to VAT 

contribution on all works, goods and services. 

 

Risk Guarantee Fund (RGF): The project will dedicate up to $ 2.0 million to act as a risk guarantee 

fund, which will provide backstopping support to financial institutions that will provide financing to the 

project’s Farm Consolidation scheme. The RGF is expected to be hosted and managed within the 

ENABLE Youth Sudan Project’s Risk Sharing Facility currently being established. Under this RGF 

framework, the Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs) are expected to finance full mechanization 

(from land preparation to harvesting) services to 20,000 feddans allocated under this pilot activity 



 

8 

 

through a financing agreement to be signed with private sector (agricultural inputs service providers) 

and farmer cooperatives. The total cost for providing full mechanization services for 20,000 feddans is 

estimated at USD 4 million ($200/feddan) as confirmed by the major agricultural inputs service 

providers in Sudan. Therefore, a USD 2 million for the RGF is considered adequate for giving 

backstopping support to financial institutions who will finance the Farm Consolidation scheme. 

 

2.4.4 Discussions were held with major agricultural inputs service providers and agricultural lending 

Banks and they all indicated their enthusiasm and willingness to participate in the project.  As a next 

step, Terms of Reference will be developed for a consultant to structure RGF, its guidelines, 

organizational structure, and implementation including the development of a manual, policies and 

procedures to facilitate the Flow and Processing of Claims (Receipt, Recording, Screening, Evaluation 

and Determination) with a view of determining eligibility and settlement. 

 

2.5.  Project Target Area and Population 

2.5.1 The project will be implemented in three states, namely, North Kordofan, West Kordofan, and 

Khartoum and it will focus on four commodity value chains: Groundnuts, Sesame, Potato, and Gum 

Arabic. In North and West Kordofan States, the target beneficiaries are the small farmers of groundnuts, 

sesame, and Gum Arabic value chains for which AVCDP will develop critical infrastructures for market 

development and trade facilitation, while also enhancing production and productivity. For potato value 

chain, the project will address one of the major constraints - the high cost of imported potato seed. 

Currently, farmers in Khartoum State spend about a third of the total production cost on acquiring 

certified seed. Moreover, the imported seed typically arrives late in the planting season due to congestion 

at Port Sudan resulting in late planting that causes substantial losses in yield. The project will establish 

a potato seed-multiplication center in the northern Khartoum State, which is the main area of potato 

production in Sudan. The center is expected to produce locally 10,000 tons of certified potato seed 

currently imported to Sudan at cost of about USD 4.3 million. 

 

2.5.2 The project will directly benefit farmers in 158, 756 households (50% females) in seven localities 

in North Kordofan (Sheikan, El Rahad, Um Rawaba, Brieka, Um Dumm, Um Sumeima, Um Kiredim), 

77,701 households six localities in West Kordofan (Gibaish, Al udaya, Alikry, Lagawa, Khammas, and 

Nyama). Additionally potato farmers of over 50,000 hectares of land currently under potato cultivation 

in Sudan will directly benefit from the project. The target beneficiaries also include the 200 GAPAs in 

West and North Kordofan States with emphasis on women and youth. The indirect beneficiaries of the 

project include over two million residents in the 13 target localities in North and West Kordofan States. 

With the expected increased production and productivity associated with the project and the value chain 

approach, more areas and population outside the target states will benefit from the project. Additionally, 

processors, marketers, agro-dealers in and around the target states will benefit from this project. 

 

2.5.3 The selection of states was made based on their (i) potential and high comparative advantage in 

the production of these value chains; (ii) the existence of well-established markets that serve the majority 

of states in Sudan, neighboring countries as well as international markets; and (iii) the importance of 

these crops for the livelihoods and resilience of the smallholder farmers, rural women and youth in the 

area.   

 

2.6. Participatory Process for Project Identification, Design and Implementation  

 

2.6.1 The request for this project came from the Government of Sudan and project components and 

activities were identified as part of a broad consultation undertaken during the identification, 

preparation, and appraisal missions. Extensive consultations were conducted with senior government 

officials of the Ministry of Finance & Economic Planning, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forests, 

Ministry of Industry, State Ministries of Agriculture for Khartoum, North Kordofan and West Kordofan 

States, Forests National Corporation, and financial institutions engaged in agricultural lending. The 



 

9 

 

Bank missions also consulted with technical staff of line ministries and other stakeholders including 

international development partners (USAID, World Bank, IFAD, UNDP, FAO, JICA, IsDB, and 

UNOPS), the private sector (CTC Group, DAL group, Mahgoub Sons Group, agricultural lending 

banks), business associations and NGOs. The participatory process will continue throughout project 

implementation to ensure ownership and sustainability.  

 

2.6.2 These various consultative processes offered an opportunity to discuss with stakeholders of the 

targeted value chains about their constraints, prospects and expectations of the project. The outcomes 

of these consultations can be summarized as follows: (i) the need to advance smallholder farmers’ access 

to improved agricultural inputs for better crop production and productivity; (ii) increased crop 

production and productivity should be complemented with enhanced post-harvest storage, processing 

and market access; and (iii) the need to strengthen value addition and market linkages of small farmers.  

 

2.7. Bank Group Experience and Lessons Reflected in Project Design  

2.7.1 The Bank has currently 10 operations in Sudan valued at UA 171 million. The sectoral composition 

includes Social 39%, Agriculture 30%, Water and sanitation 18% and Multisector, 13%. Three 

operations (totalling UA 51.0 million) are in the areas of Agriculture (DRSLP II, DRSLP III, and 

ENABLE Youth) with no pending issues in satisfying conditions precedent to first disbursements. 

According to the last CPPR conducted in June 2017, the Bank’s overall portfolio performance is 

assessed as satisfactory with an overall rating of 3. There are currently no Problematic Projects (PP), no 

Potentially Problematic Projects (PPP) and no effectiveness delays in the entire portfolio. However, 

some projects such as PFM and DRSLP projects have been affected by PD 02/2015 and currently 

flagged as slow disbursing operations mainly due to difficulties in getting funds transferred as a result 

of US sanctions imposed on the country since 1997. The sanctions were recently lifted and projects have 

started to receive funds in March 2018, which is considered very promising to enhance the portfolio 

performance in the coming three months. 

 

2.7.2 The Formulation of this project drew lessons learnt from these ongoing agriculture projects and 

other similar Bank operations on the continent such as Agricultural Value Chain Development projects 

in Uganda, Angola, Gambia, and Cameron. The design of the project also draws lessons from ongoing 

similar interventions in the country by other development partners (IFAD, WB) in the project area 

including Western Sudan Resources Management Project (WSRMP), Revitalizing the Sudan Gum 

Arabic Production and Marketing Project (RSGAMP), and Seeds Development Project (SDP). The 

lessons learned from these interventions are described in Annex B1 (Technical Annexes). The main 

lessons applied to the project are described in Table 2.7 
 

Table 2.7: Lessons learned and reflected in project design 

No Lessons Learnt  Actions incorporated in the Project design 

1.  Weak M&E system at project level 
which often results in poor assessment 

of implementation progress 

A robust results-oriented M&E system with adequate 

financial allocation has been included in the project 

design. The M&E system will be developed in PY1.  

2.  Inadequate consultation with 
stakeholders in some project designs 

and preparations compromised 

sustainability and ownership 

Components and activities under this project were 

designed and prepared with full participation of all 

stakeholders including government, target beneficiaries, 

private sector, agricultural lending banks, and 

development partners. 

3.  Challenges in transferring project funds 
to Sudan due to US sanctions has 

resulted in implementation and 

disbursement delays of some projects  

 

The sanctions were recently lifted but intermediate 

Banks are still reluctant to transfer money to Sudan The. 

Therefore project AWPB and PP will take into account 

and anticipate these potential delays    

4.  Interventions intended for increased 
crop production and productivity should

5.  The project management staff should 
have inadequate skills and training 

essential for effective conduct of their 

responsibilities. 

Recruitment of PIU personnel on performance based 

contracts. Continuous training of PIU staff by the Bank 

project management clinics will also ensure 

strengthened capacity. 

 

2.8. Project Performance Indicators  

2.8.1 The project’s key performance indicators to be measured throughout its life span are presented in 

the Results Based Logical Framework. The M&E expert of the PIU will carry out internal project 

monitoring and evaluation in collaboration with the other PIU staff to monitor performance of the 

project. The main indicators defined for monitoring the project outcomes and outputs include (i) average 

crop yield (kg/feddan) in project area; (ii) volume (tons) of certified potato seed produced locally and 

available to farmers; (iii) proportion of target farmers with access to  real-time market information; and 

(v) average earning from a feddan. Regular implementation progress will be measured through Quarterly 

Progress Reports, bi-annual Bank supervision missions, and annual technical and financial audits. These 

reports will systematically render an account of the achievement level of indicators, which will be 

regularly presented to decision and policy makers to guide project mid-term review and to facilitate 

project management after completion. 

III – PROJECT FEASIBILITY 

 

3.1.  Economic and Financial Performance  

3.1.1 The main economic benefits of the project are an increase in production and productivity of 

groundnuts, sesame, gum arabic and irish potatoes, enhanced access to markets and ultimately an 

increase in beneficiary incomes and strengthening of food security and climate resilience. Other project 

benefits include jobs generated by business developed, improved balance trade of agricultural products 

as the country will export more groundnuts and sesame and its products. At farm level, the project will 

directly reach out to at least  236,457  farm households4 cultivating groundnut, sesame farmers, and gum 

arabic as well as  50,000 irish potato  farmers. Groundnuts, sesame and Gum Arabic will be exported, 

while the entire additional potatoes produced by the project will be consumed locally. 

 
3.1.2 Main assumptions: The main assumption underpinning the economic and financial analysis is an 

anticipated increase in area under production of groundnuts, sesame, gum arabic and irish potatoes by 

20,000 feddans. As a result of increased farm mechanisation, improved seeds and fertilizer use, and 

capacity building), the project is expected to increase productivity of groundnuts and sesame from the 

current 210 and 57.7 kg/feddan to 450 and 200 kg/feddan respectively. With domestic generation of 

potato seeds, a total amount of USD 4.3 million per annum will be saved from importation. Post-harvest 

losses for groundnuts and sesame will be reduced from 20% to 10%. On-farm consumption of 

groundnuts and sesame accounts for 25% the net total production. The remaining 75% is sold directly 

to middlemen or processed by farmers and then sold to traders or consumers. Ninety eight (98%) of gum 

Arabic produced at household level is sold to middlemen.  

 

3.1.3 The production costs including processing costs are derived from the results of the similar projects 

implemented in the country and computed field data from Sudan. Prevailing 2018 market prices are used 

for input and output valuation. Infrastructure operating and maintenace costs are estimated at 7% of 

investment costs. Groundnuts, sesame, gum arabic and irish potatoes are treated in the analysis, as a 

                                                 
4 On average, each household has a total of 5 to 6 members. 



 

11 

 

traded and import substitute goods. All project costs and prices are estimated on the basis of constant 

market prices for a life span of 25 years. The average market prices of processed crops and their by-

products (seed cakes) are used to value groundnuts and sesame. On-farm consumption is valued at farm-

gate prices. 

 

3.1.4 For the economic analysis, (i) groundnuts, sesame, potatoes and gum arabic are adjusted to reflect 

their economic values. (ii) All agricultural inputs, such as fertilizers, agro-chemicals and farm tools, are 

imported without any import duty or withholding tax. Furthermore, no government interventions in 

terms of input subsidies or import restrictions are recorded. Therefore, the market prices are used as the 

shadow prices for tradable goods used in domestic rice and maize production.  

The FIRR is 28% with a NPV of US$ 20.3 million at a capital opportunity cost of 15%. The EIRR is 

26% for a NPV of USD 19.4 2 million at a capital opportunity cost of 15%. The summary result is 

tabulated below: 

 

FIRR, NPV (base case) 28%, NPV (15%): US$ 20.3 million 

EIRR, NPV (base case) 26%, NPV (15%): US$ 19.4 million 

 

3.1.5 The economic rate of return (EIRR) and the internal rate of return (FIRR) are sensitive to changes 

in prices and costs. A 10% increase in the prices of agricultural products generates an EIRR of 16% and 

a FIRR of 18%. Similarly, a 10% increase in production costs decreases the EIRR and the FIRR to 15% 

and 14% respectively. More details of financial and economic analysis is presented in Annex B7 of the 

technical annexes 

 

3.2.  Environmental, Social and Climate Change Impacts  

 

3.2.1 Environmental Issues: The proposed project is expected to result in a number of minimum 

localized environmental impacts including: (i) biodiversity loss through vegetation clearing and 

destruction of natural habitats during construction works; (ii) soil compaction and some destabilization 

of the geological balance during excavations; (iii) increased use of agricultural chemicals leading to 

pollution as a result of increased agricultural activities; (iv) increased environmental damage through 

excavations and creation of burrow pits to get construction materials; and, (v) dust pollution during 

construction works and transportation of construction materials. Mitigation measures to address these 

impacts have been proposed in the Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP). The 

preparation and implementation of site-specific environmental impact assessments (EIAs) will be 

carried out by the individual contractors under the supervision of the Executing Agency, in consultation 

with resident engineers and environmental authorities in Sudan. The Bank as the financing entity will 

ensure compliance with its environmental and climate change safeguards. Because of the limited and 

localized environmental impacts, the project has been classified as Category 2 in the Bank’s 

environmental and social safeguard systems. 

 

3.2.2 Gender Issues: Access to information, marketing and finance is a challenge faced by both male 

and female farmers in North and West Kordofan. However, consultations indicated that female farmers 

are significantly more affected due to domestic duties and reduced access to collateral. The majority of 

female farmers involved in groundnut and sesame value chains are functioning in informality and with 

low productivity. There have been successful initiatives by the Government and Development Partners 

to organize women groups to access finance, with some promising results. In sesame and groundnut 

Producer Associations, women represent approximately 30% of participants, with some Producer 

associations consisting of only women. The project will endeavour to support women in, and women-

only, cooperatives to formalize and professionalize through targeted training. In terms of markets, 

women are found mainly trading horticultural products and constitute 50-60% of traders in markets 

targeted in this project. Consultations with them indicated their need for infrastructure that protects them 



 

12 

 

from the sun, improved transport to reduce their costs, and better representation in management of 

market structures.   

 

3.2.3 The Comprehensive National Policy for Women (2002-2027), which the Ministry of Agriculture 

was involved in developing, recognizes women as an important human resource in the achievement of 

comprehensive country development and seeks to enable them economically to achieve gender equality. 

The Government of Sudan has also developed “The Policy Document of the National Rural Women & 

Empowerment Project”. This project will align itself to the policy frameworks to put in measures that 

aid equitable access and equity in the distribution of resources to women farmers. 

 

3.2.4 It is expected that this project will reap significant results for women in the target region. There 

are three targeted interventions to manage the gender gap between men and women: (a) the project PIU 

will be trained on Results Based Management and Gender in order to ensure that project objectives are 

defined from the start in a gender-disaggregated manner; (b) a Gender Action Plan will be developed 

by the PIU to create an institutional framework and mechanisms to achieve the advancement of women 

farmers/traders; and (c) a Targeted training for women-led cooperatives, and women in cooperatives, 

on leadership, business management, and negotiation. Whilst the Ministry of Agriculture is highly aware 

of issues faced by men and women in agriculture wholly, the PIU will be capacitated with a Gender 

Officer who is also involved in community mobilization to ensure targeting, monitoring and reporting 

in a systematic way. 

 

3.2.5 Social and economic importance: The project will have several social and economic benefits 

among them: (i) improved agricultural production due to improved and structured market outlets and 

enhanced market access; (ii) reduced post-harvest losses because of improved storage and warehousing 

facilities; (iii) enhanced employment opportunities in the Borsa, warehousing and storage facilities; (iv) 

improved incomes at households and community levels; (v) improved living standards; (vi) improved 

national income through exports; (vii) improved industrialisation through processing and value addition; 

and, (viii) minimised out-migration hence reducing rural-urban migration. Improvement in the market 

infrastructure development and improvement of the rural market access roads in the two states of North 

Kordofan and West Kordofan is a great opportunity for the youth to enhance their participation in trade, 

agricultural production and increased incomes through improvements in transportation. 

 

3.2.6 Involuntary Resettlement: There will be no involuntary resettlement of the population from the 

project sites. The agricultural farms are already existing farming areas. The project will only support 

reorganization of the farming system through farmer grouping and farm amalgamation to make the farm 

units more viable and larger production units. The targeted areas for market construction comprise 

existing market centers and government lands that have over the years been set aside for market 

expansion and development. 

 

3.2.7 Climate change and green growth:  In terms of climate change and green growth, the project 

will contribute to climate change resilience through constructing and rehabilitating rural access roads to 

all weather standards and through increased marketing of the agricultural produce by improving the 

marketing segment of the value chain. The project will also enhance climate change resilience through 

improved storage and warehousing facilities which will minimize post-harvest losses and farmers’ 

desperation to sell their crops at throw-away prices due to lack of storage facilities, especially at harvest 

time. By improving infrastructure through improvement of market and rural access roads, the project 

will also reduce transportation costs hence improving the farmers’ incomes and consequently reducing 

poverty and as such enhancing resilience of the poor farmers as well as their adaptation to climate 

change. The project supports the Government of Sudan in achieving its obligations in the Nationally 

Determined Contributions. Using the Climate Safeguard Systems, the project was screened and 

classified as Category 2.

IV – IMPLEMENTATION 

 

4.1. Implementation Arrangements 

4.1.1  The Ministry of Agriculture and Forests (MoAF) is the implementing agency of the project. The 

Project will have a Steering Committee (SC) chaired by the Undersecretary of the MoAF  with Director 

Generals of ministries of agriculture of North and West Kordofan as deputy co-chairs. The SC will also 

include members from ministries of Finance & Economic Planning, Industry, Trade, Physical Planning 

and Public Utilities in North and West Kordofan States, Producer Associations, and Agriculture 

Financing Banks.  

 

4.1.2 The MoAF will establish a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) with key staff including project 

coordinator, civil engineer, value chain specialist, procurement officer, M&E officer, gender/social 

development expert, Financial Management specialist and an assistant accountant.  For closer 

implementation, monitoring and follow up of project activities, the PIU will be located in Kordofan 

Region (El-Obeid, North Kordofan), where the Project Coordinator and all project technical officers 

will be based. To build capacity of the staff of the executing agency, the assistant accountant can be 

seconded from the Chamber of Accounts, if such expertise is not available in the MoAF. In addition, a 

Gum Arabic focal person will be seconded from the Forests National Corporation (FNC) to be part of 

the PIU to coordinate activities under Gum Arabic component of the project. Furthermore, two state 

focal officers will be seconded; one from Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry to coordinate the 

activities under the seed multiplication center and one from West Kordofan State Ministry of Agriculture 

to coordinate activities in the state. The Executing Agency, through Ministry of Finance & Economic 

Planning will nominate a focal point before negotiations to facilitate the processing and project start-up 

until the process of competitive recruitment of the PIU is finalized.  

 

4.1.3 Procurement Arrangements: Procurement of goods (including non-consulting services), works 

and the acquisition of consulting services, financed by the Bank for the project, will be carried out in 

accordance with the “Procurement Policy for Bank Group Funded Operations”, dated October 2015, as 

amended from time to time,  and following the provisions stated in the Financing Agreement. 

Specifically, Procurement would be carried out following Bank Procurement Policy and Methodology 

(BPM) using the relevant Bank Standard or Model Solicitation Documents SDs and in exceptional 

circumstances the Borrower’s Procurement System (BPS), for any category of procurement.  

 

4.1.4 The various items under different expenditure categories and related procurement arrangements 

for each contract to be financed by the Grant together with the respective procurement methods or 

consultant selection methods, estimated costs, prior-review requirements, and time frame as agreed 

between the Recipient and the Bank are detailed in the Procurement Plan under Annex B5 of the 

Technical Annexes. To ensure timely project launching and start-up, Advance Contracting will be used 

for the recruitment of key PIU staff before project approval. 

 

4.1.5 Procurement Risks and Capacity Development: The assessment of procurement risks at the 

Country, Sector and Project level and procurement capacity of the Executing Agency (EA), were 

undertaken for the project and the output have informed the decisions on the procurement regimes to be 

used for specific transactions or groups of similar transactions under the project. The appropriate risk 

mitigation measures have been proposed to reduce any fiduciary risk in project implementation (Section 

5.2.4 of the Technical Annexes). 

 

Financial Management (FM): The Bank carried out a FM assessment to determine the adequacy, 

strength and weakness of the financial management systems. The FM assessment concluded that the 

overall risk is “Substantial”.  Mitigation measures in the risk analysis table include (i) Recruiting a 

Financial Management Specialist (ii) Acquisition of suitable accounting software for the project (iii) 



 

14 

 

training on Bank Financial Management requirements and International Accounting Standards (iv) 

Development of the Project Administration and Financial manual.  They will enhance the Project ability 

to (1) use the funds for the intended purposes in an efficient and economical way, (2) prepare accurate, 

reliable and timely periodic financial reports, and (3) safeguard the entities’ assets. 

 

4.1.6 The Executing Agency of the project is the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MoAF). The 

overall accountability of the project will be the Project Steering Committee chaired by the 

Undersecretary of MoAF through the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) under the Project Coordinator. 

MoAF has experience in managing Bank financed projects, and the ongoing project Enable Youth Sudan 

is complying with the Bank requirements including maintenance of special account.  The financial 

transactions of the project will be initiated, processed, recorded and reported in accordance with the 

country’s Financial and Accounting Act (2007), and the Financial and Accounting Regulations (2011) 

which incorporates Generally Accepted International Accounting Standards. The project Financial 

Management Specialist (FMS), recruited competitively with qualification and experience acceptable to 

the Bank, will undertake the day-to-day financial management function. MoAF will assign an Assistant 

Project accountant to strengthen internal control and capacity building for the Ministry. 

 

4.1.7 The Project will prepare quarterly reports and submit them to the Bank within 45 days after the 

end of each quarter. The Internal controls of the Ministry including the internal audit of the project will 

apply to this project. This will include the inclusion of the project in the internal audit program and 

conducting audit at least twice per annum based on risk basis. 

 

4.1.8 Audit: An independent auditor will audit the project annual financial statements in line with the 

General Conditions of the Grant Agreement. The National Audit Chamber (NAC) or Private Audit Firm 

appointed with the involvement the NAC in accordance to the terms of reference for Bank financed 

Projects should audit the Project. The submission of audited project financial statements, along with the 

management letter, to the Bank is within six (6) months after the end of each fiscal year. The cost of the 

auditing the project is part of the eligible expenditure of the Project to cater for audit fees of the private 

audit firm. If the audit is conducted by NAC, no audit fees is payable, but on exceptional circumstances,  

re-emburseable expenses like per diem for staff and transportation can be paid if NAC is facing financial  

constraints. 

 

4.1.9 Disbursement Arrangement: The direct payment and special account/revolving fund methods 

used by the Bank to disburse funds will apply to the Project to pay eligible Project activities. The other 

two methods also described in the Disbursement Handbook maybe used when necessary with prior 

approval from the Bank. The funds from the Transition Support Facility (TSF) are disbursable and 

payable in only US dollars and Euros. The project contracts and disbursement applications should be 

denominated and made payable in EUR or USD. In the transition period (post lifting of sanctions) where 

there are difficulties still encountered in remitting USD to or involving Sudan,  MoAF should  take steps 

to persuade contractors to sign contracts and take payments in only Euros. The ADF Fund will apply 

the direct payment method to disburse ADF resources. 

 

4.1.10 The Bank will issue a Disbursement Letter stipulating key disbursement procedures and 

requirements. With regard to the special Account (revolving fund method), the Recipient will be 

required to open two (2) special accounts. The first will be an account denominated in foreign currency 

(preferably in EUR) and the second a local (operating) account at bank (s) acceptable to TSF. Funds 

paid directly into the foreign currency special account by the Bank are draw able by the Project, as and 

when required, into the operating account to cover local costs expenses including local contractors.  The 

Project implementation Unit will centrally manage the Project funds 

 



 

15 

 

4.2.  Monitoring  

4.2.1  The project will put in place an adequate computerized Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) system 

based on a results-based framework with an emphasis on outcomes and impacts, as well as the regular 

monitoring of inputs and outputs covering the four main project components. Effort will be made to 

ensure gender-disaggregated data at every level and where applicable. The project will make use of 

national data sets (e.g. Central Bureau of Statistics, Household surveys, Annual reports, Bureau of 

Statistics, Project reports, etc.) whenever possible. In order to stimulate stakeholder participation in 

M&E, the project will employ participatory approaches such as beneficiary assessments and use of focus 

groups. The Bank office in Sudan will closely monitor day-to-day implementation of the project. The 

Bank will field supervision missions twice a year. The PIU will submit quarterly progress reports 

according to the format and procedures of the Bank. The Mid-Term Review will be undertaken in PY3. 

Project Completion Report will be prepared during PY5. Below is a summary of provisional project 

implementation schedule.

4.3. Governance  

4.3.1 Recent international assessments show that Sudan has improved its accountability and 

transparency ratings and indicators of Governance including corruption control, rule of law, 

regulatory quality and Government effectiveness. However, the Bank is in the process of undertaking 

a comprehensive PFM assessment, which will provide more clarity on the Government efficient use 

of public resource. The design of the project has catered for a comprehensive governance structure to 

manage the implementation, monitoring and fiduciary aspects of the project. To ensure conformity 

with the Bank’s procurement procedures, an initial procurement plan is prepared and this will be 

updated regularly during project implementation.  

 

4.3.2  The main governance issues for the project are related to contracting and bidding processes 

mainly due to lack of adequate familiarization with the Bank’s procurement rules and procedures. To 

mitigate the problem, the project will: (i) ensure the use of standard bidding documents and 

procedures of the Bank; (ii) provide financial management manual to guide project staff; (iii) promote 

regular submission of progress reports; and (iv) recruit qualified and experienced National Project 

gram Coordinator, Procurement Specialist and Financial Management  Specialist for the PIU. The 

Bank will also ensure that PIU is trained on Bank requirements and guidelines during the project 

start-up. To ensure regular and quality reporting on implementation progress, the project provides for 

the appointment of a monitoring and evaluation officer in the PIU. Supervision missions and audits, 

with close follow up by COSD, will monitor adherence to the Bank standards and procedures to 

ensure value for money is achieved.

4.4.  Sustainability  

4.4.1 The Government of Sudan attaches great significance to the proposed AVCDP as it is the 

foundation of the first modern Commodity Exchange in the country soon to be established in North 

Kordofan State and later be rolled out to other states. The operation is a multi-purpose one expected to 

provide an enabling environment for private sector development and agricultural value chains, 

improving food security and contributing to the diversification of the agricultural economy as well as 

employment generation. The Government has already commissioned a comprehensive study on the 

establishment of a modern commodity exchange in North Kordofan State and requested the Bank to 

assist the development of key market-access infrastructures for the proposed commodity exchange. The 

project’s sustainability is ensured by the very strong will and determination at both state and national 

levels for this project. A high-level committee headed by the North Kordofan State Governor is in place 

for the realization of the Borsa project.  
 

4.4.2 In Sudan, the rural feeder roads are under the responsibility of the State ministries of physical 

planning and public utilities. Funds for maintenance planning and management is set aside in the 

national/state budget annually and private sector contractors for the execution of maintenance works. 

The main Borsa building and the 13 market warehousing receipt facilities in North and West Kordofan 

will be managed by the existing state Crop Market Administrations (CMA). The facilities are expected 

to sustain themselves with revenues generated from various fees (storage, grading, marketing, market 

data subscription, membership, etc.) charged on the users.  Availability of commodity prices for the 

smallholder farmers in real time will enable them to produce for the market at a profitable price, which 

will in turn help them build a sustainable business relationship with traders, processors and exporters. 

In addition, the public-private partnerships established through the project provides the basis for 

continuous cooperation among the relevant players, connecting non-financial and financial services, and 

leveraging the private sector in the delivery of business services. 
 

4.4.3 Another key factor of the sustainability of AVCDP is the establishment of the Risk Guarantee 

Fund for the Farm Consolidation Scheme to incentivize the lenders’ participation in the scheme. The 

State Authorities in North Kordofan underscored its commitment to contribute to the current Fund and 

to periodically top-up to ensure sustainable access to finance for the farmers even after the operation 

closes. The Project will also provide adequate resources to train all the technical staff from the 

participating ministries, at all levels, who will support the farmers’ cooperatives as well as the private 

sector involved in the project 
 

4.5 Risk Management 

4.5.1 A Potential risk to the successful execution of the project could stem from a macroeconomic 

instability negatively affecting productivity and project benefits especially the impacts of economic 

sanctions and high inflation rates. Improved diversification of GDP resulting from the project 

intervention and the Government’s strong commitment on economic diversification through revival of 

agriculture sector remaining government priority will mitigate this risk.  Other potential risks include 

Climate Change impacts that could hinder project benefits. This risk will be mitigated by ensuring that 

project infrastructures are constructed/upgraded to all weather standard. Weak capacity of the PIU team 

might undermine effective conduct of their responsibilities of the project. To ensure smooth project 

implementation, the project has broadly defined the skills and qualifications of key members of the PIU 

team, who will be recruited on a competitive basis, following the Bank’s rules and procedures. The 

project has similarly identified focal points in each of the beneficiary states for facilitating technical 

coordination. Continuous training of PIU personnel by the Bank project management clinics will also 

ensure strengthened capacity. 
 

4.6  Knowledge Building  

4.6.1 Given its innovative nature of supporting the establishment of a modern electronic commodity 

exchange and piloting the Farm Consolidation concept, the Sudan AVCDP will generate considerable 



 

17 

 

knowledge that will add value to the overall design and management of agricultural value-chain 

development operations across the continent. Progress reports, audit reports, mid-term review reports, 

and completion reports as well as other information routinely collected, as part of monitoring and 

evaluation framework will be used to document the lessons learnt. PIU will collect, collate, and analyse 

project outputs, outcomes and impact data, including standardized M&E reports. The Bank will share 

this knowledge with other development partners and stakeholders engaged in similar operations.

Project Summary 

Project 

Overview 

Project Name: Support Project for Establishing an Agribusiness Bank (PACBA) 
Geographical Context: Nationwide 

Implementation Timeframe: March 2019 - March 2021 

Project Cost: UA 7.625 million  

Project 

Objectives 

The project goal is to help increase the growth rate of the agricultural sector and improve its productivity in 

order to reduce poverty and strengthen the resilience of Burkina Faso's rural environment. The specific 

objectives of the project are to: (i) improve access to agricultural financing by establishing an agribusiness 

bank known as Banque Agricole du Faso (Agricultural Bank of Burkina Faso) (BADF); (ii) support the 

country's economic transformation by creating an agro-industrial value chain that provides local 

employment; and (iii) help improve the attractiveness of the agricultural sector for bank financing by 

promoting the establishment of an ecosystem that mitigates risks in the agricultural sector, in particular 

agricultural insurance and warrantage. 

Given the importance of the agricultural sector, the structural transformation of Burkina Faso's economy 

will be based on the development of this sector with respect to production and processing, hence the need 

to address the high marginalisation of this sector as regards financing (only 3.5% of bank loans in 2017). 

Accordingly, in addition to establishing this bank, which receives support from the project, the authorities 

intend, in the medium term, to strengthen the agricultural financing mechanism through the Shared Risk 

Facility, following the example of countries such as Nigeria, Togo, Ghana, etc. 

Needs 

Assessment 

Agriculture is the mainstay of Burkina Faso’s economy. However, its contribution to the creation of national 

wealth remains below its potential. While it employs more than 80% of the working population, it 

contributes only slightly more than 30% to the gross domestic product. The sector continues to face 

constraints on its full contribution to the national economy, particularly production, difficulties in accessing 

financing, and transportation of agricultural products to markets. The proportion of financing devoted to the 

sector accounts for barely 3.5% of bank financing, despite the existence of thirteen (13) banks and four (4) 

financial institutions. 

 

In addition, the unavailability of agricultural insurance, which would even out farmers' income and thereby 

encourage them to repay their loans to financial institutions, is a handicap to agricultural financing. 

Project 

Beneficiaries 

The main beneficiaries are farmers and economic operators engaged in processing activities in the 

agricultural sector. The banking sector, in particular BADF, will witness an improvement in its loans to the 

sector following establishment of the agricultural insurance mechanism. 

Outcomes and 

Impact 

The project will help to create enabling conditions for more sustained and inclusive growth through better 

financing of the agricultural sector, which is a pillar of Burkina Faso's economy. It will improve farmers' 

access to credit and promote the financial inclusion of the farming population. Similarly, the project will 

help to reduce the proportion of non-resilient households.  

Value Added 

for the Bank 

The Bank’s value added resides in the fact that by improving access to agricultural financing and ecosystem 

security through agricultural insurance and warrantage, it will increase and consolidate the impact of projects 

by the Bank and other donors in the sector. Similarly, everyone will benefit from agricultural insurance and 

use of the warrantage mechanism. Agrihub projects supported by some donors will also be open to another 

financing window with BADF.  

Knowledge 

Building 

PACBA implementation will help to build several types of knowledge, particularly: (i) best practice in 

agribusiness investment financing; (iii) the creation of agribusiness project databases to promote the 

emergence of agricultural processing units; and (iv) studies to be conducted on agricultural insurance and 

warrantage. The practices will be disseminated within the administration and to non-State actors through 

the documents produced, procedures manuals, and training sessions that will be organised under the project.

Risks and Mitigation Measures 

(i) Rising socio-political tensions 

Government commitment to continue negotiations to ensure 

that socio-economic and political demands are coherently 

and reasonably taken into account.  

(ii) Increased security risk 

The Government has redoubled its efforts to provide strong 

and sustainable responses, and has resolutely embraced a 

regional counterterrorism framework (G5 Sahel) to address 

the various threats. 

(iii) BADF’s weak human and institutional capacity to 

properly manage the bank 

BADF's management has extensive experience in banking 

and, particularly, in agricultural financing. In addition, the 

technical assistance contract with CNCA of Senegal will 

provide support to BADF in various areas, particularly in 

information systems management and risk management 

systems and procedures. 

(iv) Governance: Strong Government participation in the 

bank’s capital following the Central Bank's request to pull out 

shareholders deemed financially weak.

and additional shares owned by organisations considered 

weak by the Central Bank; the Central Bank has requested the 

organisations to pull out of BADF capital. FBDES is 

requested to gradually transfer the shares, as well as the 

Government’s participation, to stakeholders in line with its 

area of activity as soon as possible. In addition, the entry of a 

technical and financial partner is also being considered.

continued and strong sensitisation of farmer organisations on 

the need for the bank's sustainability. BADF will give priority 

to organised farmers' networks that will help collect customer 

information and, if necessary, collect unpaid debts.

Given the strong ownership by farmer organisations, BADF 

will rely on farmer sectors to attract farmer customers. The

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION BY MANAGEMENT OF THE AFRICAN 

DEVELOPMENT FUND TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS CONCERNING THE 

SUPPORT PROJECT FOR ESTABLISHING AN AGRIBUSINESS BANK (PACBA) IN 

BURKINA FASO 

Management hereby submits this report and its recommendation concerning a proposal to grant an 

African Development Fund (ADF) loan of UA 7.5 million to Burkina Faso to finance the Support 

Project for Establishing an Agribusiness Bank (PACBA). This is an institutional support project that 

will be implemented over the 2018-2020 period to cover Government’s participation in the capital of 

the new bank and establish an agricultural insurance system and a warrantage mechanism in Burkina 

Faso. Therefore, this project will not only strengthen access to agricultural financing but also improve 

the business environment of the agricultural sector and diversify agricultural financing mechanisms. 

 STRATEGIC THRUST AND RATIONALE 

1.1. Project Linkages with Country Strategy and Objectives 

1.1.1 The National Economic and Social Development Plan (PNDES) is the national 

reference framework for interventions by the Government and its partners over the 2016-2020 

period for the structural economic and social transformation of Burkina Faso to achieve strong, 

sustainable, resilient, and inclusive growth that will create decent jobs for all and improve social 

well-being (TA A1). PNDES comprises three strategic pillars: (i) Pillar 1: reform institutions and 

modernize the administration, (ii) Pillar 2: develop human capital, and (iii) Pillar 3: boost growth-

oriented sectors for the economy and jobs. PACBA is aligned on Pillar 3, which aims to boost growth-

oriented sectors for the economy, particularly by developing an agricultural, silvicultural, pastoral, 

wildlife and fisheries sector that is productive and resilient. 

1.1.2.  The Bank's intervention strategy in Burkina Faso over the 2017-2021 period is based 

on the country's development framework (i.e. the PNDES), with particular emphasis on the 

structural transformation of the economy. Consequently, the CSP is structured around two 

pillars: (i) promote access to electricity, and (ii) develop the agricultural sector for inclusive 

growth. Under the second pillar, the Bank will focus on the following actions: (a) support reforms in 

the agricultural sector; (b) develop value chains and water management, relying mainly on support 

for the emergence of growth hubs such as Bagré Hub and cotton processing; (c) promote youth 

employment with particular emphasis on the development of agro-business and professional skills; 

(d) access to financing for the sector with institutional and financial support from an agricultural bank 

being established; and (e) construction of access infrastructure to improve the marketing of 

agricultural products and intra-regional trade. In this regard, PACBA is fully aligned on the Bank's 

strategy, particularly with points (i) to (iv) indicated above. 

1.1.3. In addition, by broadening access to economic opportunities for the people, 

particularly farmers, PACBA is aligned on the Bank's Ten-Year Strategy (2013-2022) with 

respect to the objective of inclusive growth. 

1.1.4. PACBA is also consistent with the Strategy for Agricultural Transformation in Africa 

("Feed Africa"), which aims to "transform African agriculture into a competitive and inclusive agro-

industrial sector that can create wealth". 

1.1.5. The project also falls within the Bank's Second Climate Change Action Plan, 

particularly under its pillar relating to intensified financing for adaptation. 

1.1.6  Finally, PACBA falls within the Bank's Financial Sector Development Strategy, which 

aims to "help increase access to financing, deepen African financial institutions and markets in RMCs 



2 

 

and at regional level, and support financial stability", as well as its Gender Strategy (2014-2018) in 

its focus on women’s economic empowerment.  

1.2. Context of the Bank’s Intervention 

1.2.1 With regard to the economic and social context, activity is picking up vigorously after 

a period of economic sluggishness in 2014 and 2015. Burkina Faso's economic growth remains 

strong despite a fragile security context (TA A4-Note on Fragility). Economic growth is estimated 

at 7% in 2018 after 6.7% in 2017 and 5.9% in 2016. The impact of transformative investments under 

the National Economic and Social Development Plan (PNDES 2016-2020), particularly in increasing 

energy supply, has contributed to this economic dynamism. In addition, the performance of the 

extractive industries through increased gold production has provided additional support for economic 

activity. 

1.2.2. In 2018, the Government concluded a three-year programme supported by the IMF’s 

Extended Credit Facility, which seeks to ensure stability of the macroeconomic framework and 

reduce the fiscal deficit to 5% in 2018 and to a maximum of 3% of GDP in 2019, in line with the 

WAEMU convergence criterion.  

1.2.3. As regards execution of the State budget, the Government intends to continue its efforts 

towards controlling current expenditure, consolidating revenue mobilisation reforms, and 

implementing the PNDES. The measures to be taken in 2018 to increase revenue consist in further 

computerisation of tax services (online procedure, digitalisation, etc.), as well as further consolidation 

of business segmentation and reforms to modernise customs administration. 

1.2.4. At the social level, Burkina Faso falls within the category of countries with low human 

development. The latest poverty survey in Burkina Faso (the Permanent Multisector Survey - EMC) 

estimated the poverty rate at 40.1% in 2014 compared to 46.7% in 2009, which corresponds to a 6.6% 

decline. Despite this progress, the prevalence of poverty in rural areas (41%) is higher than that at 

national level and in urban areas (14%).  

1.3. Rationale for Bank Intervention 

1.3.1. Unlocking access to financing for Burkina Faso's key economic sector (TA A3): The 

agricultural sector’s contribution to national wealth creation remains below its potential. While it 

employs more than 80% of the working population, agriculture contributes only slightly more than 

30% to the gross domestic product. The sector continues to face constraints that hamper it from 

contributing fully to the national economy. These constraints include difficulties regarding 

production, accessing financing and transporting agricultural products to markets. Admittedly, the 

financing of the cotton sector is a success story, thanks mainly to the quality of supervision of the 

sector and the smoothing mechanism put in place (TA C4). However, access to agricultural financing 

remains a real handicap, aggravated by the privatisation of BACB, which has created an institutional 

vacuum in agricultural financing. The proportion of financing devoted to the sector accounts for 

barely 3.5% of bank financing, despite the existence of thirteen (13) banks and four (4) financial 

institutions. There are many reasons for the banks' little interest in agricultural financing. One of the 

main reasons is the high risk inherent in such financing but, above all, the lack of control over the 

value chain: the vast majority of operators in the sector can neither offer adequate guarantees nor 

control the storage and marketing schedule for their products.  

1.3.2. Securing the risk environment to ensure BADF viability and promote the attractiveness 

of agricultural financing for commercial banks. The farms face considerable risks (climate, 

markets, health risks, locust invasions, etc.), which can even lead to total production loss. It should 

be noted that the unavailability of agricultural insurance neither allows farmers to even out their 



3 

 

income nor encourages them to repay their debts to financial institutions. Consequently, it is 

necessary to set up an insurance system. Furthermore, the limited diversification of mechanisms to 

promote agricultural financing remains a handicap, hence the need to develop warrantage. In this 

regard, the Ministry of Agriculture in September 2017 prepared a national strategy to guide 

warrantage interventions with the support of the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA). 

It is now necessary to move from strategy to action. Finally, it should also be noted that banks 

operating in Burkina Faso lack expertise in providing support and advisory services on agricultural 

sector financing. To help it get started and avoid all these pitfalls, BADF has decided to use the 

technical assistance of Caisse Nationale de Crédit Agricole (National Agricultural Credit Fund) 

(CNCA) of Senegal, an institution with more than thirty years' experience in financing Senegalese 

agricultural development.  

1.3.3. Continue and intensify financing actions for agricultural and agrifood SMEs and SMIs 

initiated in sub-projects supported through lines of credit granted by AfDB to Coris Bank (December 

2016) and Fidelis Finance (June 2014). These financial institutions provide significant support for 

agricultural financing, which is neglected by commercial banks. The support will continue and be 

reinforced with BADF, whose medium- and long-term credit forecasts for the agricultural sector is 

estimated at XOF 4.1 billion in 2019 to XOF 14.54 billion in 2024, with an annual growth rate of 

28%. Furthermore, this operation will help to achieve three of the High 5s1 identified by Senior 

Management, namely: "Feed Africa", "Industrialise Africa" and "Improve the quality of life for 

people in Africa", through the financing of agro-industrial projects that will contribute to promoting 

food security and improving living conditions in rural areas.  

1.3.4. Reinforce and consolidate the Bank's involvement in Burkina Faso’s agricultural 

sector: PACBA will reinforce and consolidate the impact of many other existing projects: Support 

Project for Bagré Growth Pole, Participatory Forest Management Project, Cashew Nut Development 

Support Project in Comoé Basin for REDD (PADA-REDD+), Preparation of PPG PGFC/REDD++ 

FIP, Resilience Building Programme (P2RS) and PPF for Youth and Women’s Integration in Agro-

Sylvo-Pastoral Sectors. PACBA falls within the Lending Programme of CSP 2017-2021 and is a 

Pillar II flagship operation.  

1.3.5. Replicating Existing Success Models in West Africa 

1.3.5.1 Banque Nationale de Développement Agricole du Mali (National Agricultural Development 

Bank of Mali) (BNDA) (TA C7), initially based on a fully agricultural banking model, has gradually 

diversified its portfolio to strengthen its viability. At the end of 2017, it had 54% of its portfolio in 

agricultural value chains, and 46% outside the agricultural sector. It is in its 38th year of existence and 

has remained profitable over the past twelve (12) years.  Originally, BNDA was completely State-

owned. After demonstrating its ability to be viable, it attracted several shareholders, including the 

French Development Agency (20% of the capital) and the German Development Finance Agency 

(DEG) (21% of the capital). BADF will be built on this semi-agricultural banking model, with 40% 

of its exposure outside the agricultural sector. This will allow it to mobilise deposits from other sectors 

and mitigate the effects of any crisis in the agricultural sector. In addition, gradual government 

withdrawal from its capital is being considered to make way for financial partners with expertise in 

agricultural financing. 

1.3.5.2. Caisse Nationale du Crédit Agricole du Sénégal (National Agricultural Credit Fund of 

Senegal) (CNCAS) (TA C7), drawing on the lessons learned over the years, has finally found a model 

that guarantees its viability. CNCAS intervention is accompanied by a series of measures to secure 

the agricultural financing ecosystem in Senegal, in particular: (i) agricultural insurance, of which the 

                                                 
1  The five strategic priorities ("High 5s") identified by Senior Management are: "Light up and power Africa", "Feed Africa", "Integrate Africa", 

"Industrialise Africa" and "Improve the quality of life for people in Africa". 



4 

 

Senegalese Government finances 50% of the premiums, enables it to increase the resilience of its 

borrowers, thereby curbing their default rate; (ii) Government’s subsidising of agricultural credit rates 

to allow a greater number of farmers to have access to credit, thereby promoting diversification of 

CNCAS portfolio; and (iii) guarantees to be granted by the Government in financing major 

agricultural projects will allow CNCAS to have sufficient margins under its prudential ratios to 

increase its financing volumes. With PACBA, the Bank intends to support the establishment of a 

secure ecosystem similar to that of CNCAS in Senegal to strengthen BADF’s viability. To that end, 

a technical assistance contract has been concluded between CNCAS and BADF. CNCAS will assist 

BADF in starting up its activity, particularly the information systems, risk systems, and commercial 

strategy. 

1.3.6. Recent Cases of Bank Support for Agricultural Financing 

1.3.6.1 In December 2016, the Board approved a UA 67 million ADF loan for a 40-year period, 

including a 10-year grace period, to the Government of Tanzania to be on-lent to the Agricultural 

Bank of Tanzania. Tanzania Agricultural Development Bank was officially launched and began its 

operations in 2015. It is structured to provide medium- and long-term financing, in the form of loans, 

guarantees and risk-sharing instruments, to fill the financing gaps in agricultural value chains in 

Tanzania. The support for the Tanzania Agricultural Development Bank has not yet been disbursed. 

1.3.6.2. In December 2014, the Board approved a total financial plan of USD 500 million for the 

Federal Republic of Nigeria for the establishment of the Development Bank of Nigeria. The financial 

plan included: (i) an ADF loan of USD 50 million for 30 years, including a five-year grace period; 

(ii) a USD 400 million loan for 20 years, including a five-year grace period, from the Bank's regular 

resources; and (iii) a direct Bank equity participation of up to USD 50 million in the capital of the 

Development Bank of Nigeria Plc (DBN), with a redemption obligation for DBN after 10 years. The 

purchase of the Bank's stake by DBN is guaranteed by the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The Nigerian 

Development Bank has not yet published its first financial performance for preliminary lessons to be 

learned with respect to financial sustainability. 

 

1.4 Aid Coordination 

1.4.1 The Bank plays a key role in coordinating TFP assistance. After chairing the TFP troika from 

2013 to 2014, it was lead partner of the Sector Dialogue Framework for Infrastructure from 2014 to 

2015, and for Water and Sanitation from June 2015 to October 2016, and finally, the Bank was the 

coordinator of TFPs operating in the youth and vocational training sector from 2014 to 2016. 

1.4.2 With respect to overall intervention volume, the Bank is the third-largest development aid 

TFP, after the European Union and the World Bank. The Bank is also Burkina Faso's main partner in 

the infrastructure sector (Annex 3 and TA A6). 

1.4.3. As regards the financial sector, the Bank is Burkina Faso's leading TFP, especially with the 

different lines of credit granted to the country's banks. As for the agricultural sector, the Bank is 

within the TFP average (those between 10% and 50% of the sector's financing). PACBA’s leverage 

effect on the entire agricultural sector will contribute to better complementarity with the actions of 

other TFPs in the sector.  



5 

 

1.4.4 Concerning warrantage, KFW intends to work with the Government for proper 

implementation of the mechanism, thereby creating good complementarity with support provided by 

PACBA in this area. 

1.4.5 Other TFPs are involved, at different levels, in the project’s activity areas (TA A5). 

1.4.5.1 USAID, in partnership with Coris Bank International, held a training seminar on "Financing 

Agricultural Value Chains" on 3-4 December 2016. To narrow the financing gap in the sector, the 

Trade Hub, a USAID programme which, after analysing the financing rate in West Africa by most 

banks to agrifood and agro-industrial sector stakeholders, took the initiative in 2015 to embark on 

expanding its network of banking institutions to facilitate access to credit for small processors and 

exporters. USAID underscored the importance of the Trade Hub Project and for the United States to 

share its experience in credit guarantees for agricultural financing. 

1.4.5.2 Through "Développement International Desjardins (DID)", Canada initiated the Project for 

Professionalisation of Agricultural Credit Methodologies (PMCA). Several MFI networks, supported 

by DID, operate in rural areas and are required to serve this relatively complex market. DID's Project 

for Professionalisation of Agricultural Credit Methodologies (PMCA) essentially aims to support a 

number of the MFIs as follows: (i) promote access to credit for small farmers; (ii) mitigate credit risks 

associated with the sector; and (iii) increase the profitability of MFIs operating in rural areas. 

1.4.5.3 Other TFPs, particularly Proparco and IsDB, have also intervened through lines of credit to 

Société Générale Burkina Faso and Coris Bank International to support private sector development, 

particularly SMEs and SMIs, as well as promote Islamic financing. 

 PROJECT DESCRIPTION 

2.1 Project Objectives and Components 

2.1.1 The project goal is to help increase the growth rate of the agricultural sector and improve its 

productivity in order to reduce poverty and strengthen the resilience of Burkina Faso’s rural 

environment. The specific project objectives are to: (i) improve access to agricultural financing; (ii) 

support the country's economic transformation through the emergence of an agro-industrial value 

chain that provides local employment; and (iii) help improve the attractiveness of the agricultural 

sector for bank financing by promoting the establishment of an ecosystem that mitigates risks in the 

agricultural sector, particularly agricultural insurance and warrantage. 

2.1.2. The project is structured around two components: (i) support for improving access to 

agricultural financing through Government participation in the capital of the newly established 

Banque Agricole du Faso (Agricultural Bank of Burkina Faso) (BADF); and (ii) support for security 

of the agricultural financing ecosystem by establishing an agricultural insurance system and a 

warrantage mechanism. 

2.1.3 Component 1: Support for Improving Access to Agricultural Financing 

2.1.3.1. Through this component, the project will, in view of the high expectations of the population, 

particularly in the agricultural sector, as well as the significant financing needs of agriculture and its 

transformation, enable the Government to play its role as a driving force by acquiring a stake in 

BADF's capital. Considered as a priority in the Bank's 2017-2021 Strategy for Burkina Faso, the 

establishment of this bank will contribute to efforts towards responding to the scarcity of bank 

financing dedicated to the agricultural sector and lay the foundations for effective implementation of 

agricultural value chains. Thus, the Bank will provide financial support to the Government, 

amounting to XOF 5 billion, for the acquisition of a stake in BADF’s capital. It should be noted that 



6 

 

BADF was approved by the Minister in charge of Finance by decree N° 

183/MINEFID/DGTCP/DAMOF on 16 April 2018 after favourable opinion of the WAMU Banking 

Commission on 14 March 2018 and is currently working towards its operationalisation. The Bank’s 

support will be through the reinboursment method (please refer to section 4.1.4.1). 

2.1.3.2  An analysis of the financial sector (TA A2) shows strong expansion of the banking system 

in Burkina Faso, with bank loans increasing by 20% in 2017 and by more than 6% per year on average 

over the 2012-2017 period. The feasibility study on the Banque Agricole du Faso Project2 shows that 

although it is a competitive sector, the prospects for developing the credit market confirm the 

existence of a niche for the establishment of a new bank dedicated to agricultural financing. Since 

ECOBANK's takeover of Banque Agricole et Commerciale du Burkina (Agricultural and 

Commercial Bank of Burkina Faso) (BACB)3 in 2008, there is no longer any credit institution 

specialised in agricultural financing in Burkina Faso. This accounts for the small proportion of bank 

financing to the primary sector, the importance of which can no longer be underestimated. 

Nevertheless, as a precautionary measure, BADF intends to capture only 1% of deposits and loans at 

start-up, and gradually increase its market share to 3% in the fifth year. BADF will provide 60% of 

its assistance to the agricultural sector (particularly agro-industries), with the remaining 40% going 

to the trade and industry sectors. Accordingly, the establishment of BADF will help to increase the 

share of agricultural financing from 3.5% of bank loans in 2017 to 5% in 2020 and 7% in 2022 (or 

EUR 685 million). The establishment of BADF will create 114 new direct jobs4 in 2023 and more 

than 3,000 indirect jobs5 through recruitment in the agricultural companies that will be financed. To 

contribute to gender mainstreaming in agricultural financing, BADF intends to earmark at least 20% 

of its agricultural financing for women farmers, and subsequently increase it by 15% per year. The 

project will help to increase the country's number of bank account holders, which is expected to rise 

from 26% in 2016 to 40% in 2020.6  

2.1.3.3  Once the banking licence has been obtained, BADF will launch its operationaliSation: (i) a 

headquarters has been identified and rehabilitation works are in progress. The towns selected for 

the first two branches outside Ouagadougou are Dédougou and Bobo-Dioulasso; (ii) SOPRA 

Amplitude banking solution has been selected for BADF's IT systems following a competitive 

bidding process; (iii) connections to GIM UEMOA, STAR-UEMOA and SWIFT payment 

platforms are in progress; (iv) staff recruitment, which began with IT staff, will continue with the 

hiring of commercial and credit officers for the headquarters and Dédougou and Bobo-Dioulasso 

branches; and (v) communication is being organised with the creation of a website, the search for a 

logo, and the recruitment of a communication agency to define the bank’s communication strategy.  

2.1.3.4  Detailed Analysis of Banque Agricole du Faso (BADF) (TA C3) 

2.1.3.4.1   Objectives 

2.1.3.4.1.1 The BADF's corporate goal will be to provide its target customers in rural and urban areas 

with a wide range of financial services (credit, savings, insurance, money transfers, etc.) tailored to 

their needs. The target customers will include rural stakeholders (farmers, stock-breeders, fishermen, 

craftsmen, suppliers of agricultural inputs and equipment, agricultural product traders, processors, 

transporters, etc.) and those in other sectors of the national economy.

2.1.3.4.1.2  The specific objectives are to: (i) promote the development of the agricultural sector 

and offer a range of community-based financial services to the rural and urban population 

throughout Burkina Faso; (ii) contribute to the creation of added value in the agricultural sector 

through the financing of value chains; (iii) promote local investment, development and wealth 

creation among the population; (iv) increase the number of bank account holders in Burkina Faso, 

through gradual geographic coverage of the national territory, with the opening of branches in the 

headquarters of urban and rural municipalities that have enormous potential; and (v) become a 

benchmark in rural financing on the banking market in Burkina Faso and WAEMU.  

2.1.3.4.2  Promoters, Shareholders and Management 

2.1.3.4.2.1.  Shareholders: The high government stake in the BADF’s capital is due to: (i) the 

strong government commitment to the establishment of BADF; and (ii) the Central Bank's initial 

remarks on the financial soundness of the benchmark shareholders, particularly farmers’ 

organisations and associations whose financial structure was considered weak by the Central Bank. 

In order not to delay the establishment of BADF, the shares of these shareholders were taken over by 

FBDES pending their reorganisation in accordance with banking regulations. However, given the 

importance of farmer organisations in BADF's business model, they will continue to sit on the Board 

of Directors. 

Structure of BADF’s Share Capital 

 

2.1.3.4.2.2.  Management Team: The majority of the management team will be members of the 

technical committee responsible for managing BADF implementation. The committee has already 

directed the market survey conducted by ACS, and is preparing the application for a banking licence. 

The committee, headed by the Chief of Staff of the Prime Minister and current Chair of the BADF 

Board of Directors, previously a senior executive at BCEAO, is composed mainly of former BACB 

senior executives and representatives of the agricultural community through farmer organisations. 

The General Manager was the last General Manager of BACB7, which he managed for more than 6 

years. In particular, he led the merger and integration of BACB into ECOBANK. He has more than 

thirty years of banking experience. Before joining BACB's General Management, he had held several 

key management positions in the Credit and Commitments Department and the Administrative and 

Financial Department, and was the Deputy General Manager. His long experience in the banking 

sector, particularly in agricultural financing, will be essential to assisting BADF to cope with 

difficulties inherent in a new bank. 

2.1.3.4.3  Governance: BADF is governed by a Board of Directors, whose role is to define 

strategic guidelines for the bank and ensure their implementation. The Board comprises 10 members,

with 4 Government representatives or 5 if the CARFO representative is included. The other 5 

members are as follows: 2 representatives of the farmers' unions (UNPCB and UNPSB), the 

representative of smallholders, the representative of WATAM, and the representative of the rural 

population. It should be noted that three of the four Government representatives, including the Chair 

of the Board of Directors, have no voting rights. However, the Government and its departments retain 

decision-making power with an absolute majority of voting rights. The farmers and the rural 

population are represented by an observer with no voting rights. The Board of Directors does not 

currently have any independent experts in the banking sector, although independent directors will be 

co-opted as time goes on. Similarly, the diversification of shareholders, with the envisaged entry of a 

leading technical and financial partner, could help to remedy the situation. The Board of Directors 

has three standing committees: (i) the Audit Committee comprises at least 3 directors and is in charge 

of the monitoring and control strategy; (ii) the Credit Committee is composed of at least 5 directors 

and has decision-making powers over any commitment exceeding XOF 50 million; and (iii) the 

Selection and Remuneration Committee comprises 3 directors who direct BADF's remuneration and 

selection policy.  

2.1.3.4.4. Strategy: BADF's model consists in mobilising financial resources and then directing 

them mainly towards financing agricultural value chains in Burkina Faso. The end objective is to 

promote the development of the agricultural sector, as well as achieve more inclusive growth by 

unlocking access to financial services and financing for rural people who form the majority of Burkina 

Faso’s population. To fully implement this strategy, BADF intends to mobilise various sources of 

financing, namely: (i) development finance institutions (DFIs) on which BADF intends to rely to raise 

long-term resources at concessional rates for its activity. Since these resources are not included in the 

basic business plan, this leaves BADF some room for manoeuvre as regards its resources; and (ii) 

customer savings, developed and captured for transformation purposes, constitute BADF's total 

resources, excluding equity, over the entire projection period.  

2.1.3.4.5  Financial Analysis 

Capital: The XOF 14.277 billion capitalisation level at start-up is adequate. This provides a risk 

coverage ratio of 48% in the first year, 31% in the second year, and an average of 20% in the 

subsequent three years. BADF's capitalisation level is significantly higher than that required by the 

Central Bank (8%). It is also higher than the national average (9.3% in 2016) and the WAEMU zone 

average (11.3% in 2016). Finally, it is higher than that of CNCAS, whose average over the past three 

years was 16%.  

Assets: BADF expects to attain a credit portfolio of XOF 26 billion at the end of the first year, i.e. 

1% of the total volume of credit at national level. Over the subsequent four years, it expects to post 

an average annual growth of 40%, resulting in a 0.5% increase in the market share to reach 3% of the 

credit market at the end of the fifth year. This volume of credit represents on average 40% of the 

estimated agricultural financing needs in Burkina Faso. The estimate of gain in market share seems 

conservative, given the limited proportion of agricultural sector financing in the existing bank and 

the strong involvement of the farming community in setting up BADF. BADF expects to maintain a 

high quality portfolio with only 1% of loans in default at the end of the first year, and then a 1% 

increase per year subsequently before stabilising at 4% in the fourth and fifth years (compared to a 

national average of 8.8% in 2016). In the long term, it will be essential to secure BADF's environment 

to enable it to maintain such a rate.  

Profitability: BADF expects to post a Net Banking Income (NBI) of XOF 1.4 billion in the first year 

and an average annual growth rate of 60% subsequently, to reach XOF 8.3 billion by 2022. The 

cost/income ratio is expected to improve steadily from 112% in the first year to 39% in 2022, 

reflecting a low delinquency rate, with provisioning charges remaining under control at 16% of NBI 

over the period. As a result, after a first-year deficit of XOF 419 million, BADF is expected to become 



9 

 

profitable in the second year with a net income of XOF 564 million. The net income should then 

increase steadily to XOF 3.1 billion in 2022.  

Liquidity: BADF’s liquidity seems to be comfortable over the entire projection period. The short-

term liquidity ratio8 averaged 150% compared to 100% required by the Central Bank, reflecting the 

preponderance of savings over demand deposits. Over the projection period, term deposits and other 

savings will account for 54% of deposits (46% for demand resources). The long-term structural 

liquidity ratio9 is comfortable over the first two years, at 180% and 132% respectively, compared to 

100% required. It will gradually decline to 106% in 2022, reflecting deposits and savings mostly at 

less than one year. 

2.1.3.4.6. Supervision. Like all WAEMU banks, BADF will be subject to the supervision and control 

of the Banking Commission. In this regard, it is required to comply with prudential and governance 

regulations, as well as all other aspects of WAEMU banking regulations. For all intents and purposes, 

it should be stressed that the regulations are consistent with Basel international norms and standards, 

with a transition phase from Basel 2 to Basel 3 currently underway. 

2.1.3.5  Expected Outcomes of this Component: The expected outcomes include: (i) an increase in 

the share of bank credit to the agricultural sector from 3.5% in 2017 to 5% in 2020; and (ii) an increase 

in the processing rate of agricultural products from 16% in 2016 to 25% in 2020. 

2.1.4 Component 2: Support for Security of the Agricultural Financing Ecosystem (TA C1) 

2.1.4.1 Context  

2.1.4.1.1.  As regards the establishment of BADF, the authorities of Burkina Faso have undertaken to 

establish and operationalise a system to secure the agricultural financing environment. The objective 

is to enable the new bank to operate in a secure environment that allows it to absorb any shocks related 

to climatic hazards and changes in the prices of agricultural products and/or inputs. In addition, given 

the high level of financing needs for agricultural value chains as expressed in PNDES 2016-2020, the 

Government of Burkina Faso hopes to reinforce the attractiveness of the agricultural sector for private 

commercial banks through these mechanisms. 

2.1.4.1.2.  In this connection and through an ADF loan of XOF 888 750 000, PACBA will support 

the operationaliSation of: (i) the agricultural insurance mechanism being designed between Société 

Nationale d'Assurance et de Réassurance du Faso (Faso National Insurance and Reinsurance 

Company (SONAR) and its technical partner, Mutuelle Agricole Marocaine d'Assurance (Moroccan 

Agricultural Insurance Company) (MAMDA); and (ii) warrantage and third-party holding 

arrangements to ensure decent price levels for farmers, even during periods of falling prices. 

2.1.4.4.1.3 A complementary mechanism for securing the agricultural environment is being 

considered, and will be financed by the Government or other donors. The mechanism is the 

Agricultural Credit Security Fund, with funds for natural disasters and interest rate subsidies. 

2.1.4.2 Need for an Agricultural Insurance Mechanism 

2.1.4.2.1. A secure ecosystem is essential to ensure the viability of agricultural banks. An insurance 

mechanism guaranteeing farmers' income in the event of a drop in prices and/or a poor harvest is 

crucial to ensure a minimum income for farmers, enable them to honour their debt repayments and 

thus be able to borrow again to prepare for the new season. In addition, a secure environment will 

                                                 
8  Ratio of outstanding amounts of high-quality liquid assets (cash and quasi-cash) to expected net cash outflows over the next 30 days. This emanates 

from Basel III and is applied in WAEMU zone as from 1 January 2018. 
9  The ratio of stable financing available (equity, long-term debt) to stable financing due.

allow BADF to diversify into several crops, thus avoiding the effects of concentration. In Burkina 

Faso, the examples of the former banks CNCA-B and BACB illustrate this very well. Such a system 

is essential to help BADF maintain a high quality portfolio. In the basic business plan, BADF intends 

to maintain a portfolio with only 1% of loans in arrears at the end of the first year and then 1% increase 

per year subsequently before stabilising at 4% in the fourth and fifth years. The BADF portfolio 

objective in terms of quality is significant when compared to the national average delinquency rate 

of 8.8% over the past three years and the average rate in WAEMU zone at 14.4%. Therefore, an 

agricultural insurance system that can strengthen borrowers' resilience is essential to enable BADF 

to achieve its portfolio quality objectives. 

2.1.4.2.2. Caisse Nationale de Crédit Agricole du Burkina Faso (Burkina Faso National 

Agricultural Credit Fund) (CNCA-B) went through some difficulties in 2002. Those difficulties were 

due to the fall in world commodity prices to below producer prices. Since farmers' income did not 

allow them to meet their loan charges, CNCA was directly affected by the shock due to the lack of a 

safety net. The crisis was exacerbated by the poor organisation of the sectors. Thus, to diversify 

activities and limite risks, the CNCA-B changed its name for Banque Agricole et Commerciale du 

Burkina (Burkina Faso National Agricultural and Commercial Bank) (BACB). 

2.1.4.2.3. Having drawn lessons from CNCA-B, BACB, has focused its exposure on organised 

sectors to facilitate credit collection and limit delinquencies. The cotton sector, which is better 

structured, has benefited the most from BACB financing. In 2007, higher input prices combined with 

poor rainfall affected cotton harvest volumes. Consequently BACB, which had focused on the cotton 

sector, experienced difficulties that led to its acquisition by ECOBANK Group in 2008, although it 

was profitable. 

2.1.4.2.4. In addition, it is necessary to have a secure environment to prevent the agricultural 

bank from being "forced" to move away from its primary role and core business. Better still, by 

securing the agricultural financing environment, the sector will be able to attract commercial banks 

seeking better diversification. The need for such an environment is demonstrated by the success of 

BNDA in Mali and CNCAS in Senegal (TA C7). 

2.1.4.2.5. Finally, it is imperative to reduce the charge of capital of the new agricultural bank to 

enable it to deploy its resources efficiently. The licence granted to the new bank is a generalist bank 

licence that does not take the special nature of the agricultural sector into account. Borrowers in the 

sector have income that are difficult to predict, volatile and very often seasonal. This carries a higher 

risk level, resulting in a much higher charge of capital for agricultural banks. The establishment of an 

insurance fund is crucial to reduce the charge of capital of the new agricultural bank and enable it to 

deploy its resources as effectively as possible and remain competitive with commercial banks. 

Without such a mechanism, the agricultural bank will be constrained in its ability to lend and will 

most often be limited to short-term loans with a requirement for collateral that is difficult for 

agricultural customers to obtain.  

2.1.4.4.3  Agricultural Insurance (TA C1 / C1.1) 

2.1.4.4.3.1 Description: The agricultural insurance mechanism will start with a three-year pilot 

phase in three regions covering 35% of Burkina Faso's agricultural population (Boucle du Mouhoun, 

Centre-West, and East). The pilot phase will involve three crops whose production account for about 

86% of Burkina Faso's annual food consumption (white and red sorghum, rice and maize). As regards 

the production volume, the pilot phase will cover 1,639,800 tonnes, or 36% of annual national 

production volumes. The mechanism will have two specific parameters to trigger compensation - 

performance coupled with climate data (local weather records). This will increase the mechanism’s 

reliability. Triggering compensation that closely reflects the reality of claims is vital to ensure 

credibility of the system.  No mechanism that combines meteorological data and yields has so far 



11 

 

been established in Burkina Faso. Planet Guarantee, in collaboration with Alliance, has launched two 

insurance products since 2011: (i) one for maize based solely on rainfall; and (ii) the other for cotton 

based solely on yield. Unlike the Planet Guarantee system, the mechanism under this project will be 

based on meteorological data collected locally (through mini weather stations) by the National 

Meteorology Agency (ANM). The installation of an adequate number of mini weather stations in the 

pilot phase areas will help to enhance the reliability of the data collected. The mechanism will 

compensate for any errors made by the current weather stations and take into account all types of 

disasters affecting agricultural production, particularly insects.      

2.1.4.3.2  Implementation Arrangements and Actors: This component of the project will be 

implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture. The main actors and their respective roles in the project 

implementation include the Ministry of Agriculture and Water Management (MAAH), Mutuelle 

Marocaine d’Assurances Agricoles (Moroccan Agricultural Insurance Company) (MAMDA), 

Société Nationale d’Assurance et de Réassurance (National Insurance and Reinsurance Company) 

(SONAR-IARD), and the National Meteorological Agency (ANM). The activities supported under 

the project are as follows: (i) definition of insurance indices and products, and preparation of 

insurance policies; and (ii) procurement and operation of automatic weather stations that meet the 

standards of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). 

2.1.4.3.2  Status: To date, an inter-ministerial technical committee has been set up (end of 2017) 

for the definition of indices and insurance products, and the development of insurance policies. This 

technical committee has since worked with the technical partner MAMDA, the National Agency for 

Meteorology and Société Nationale d’Assurance et de Réassurance (National Insurance and 

Reinsurance Company) (SONAR). The AfDB support expected at this level relates to the financing 

of the work of the committee set up for this purpose. This includes the financing of the continuity of 

the different wokshops already started by the Committee since its set up end of 2017.

2.1.4.4.   Warrantage and Third-Party Holding Mechanism (AT C1 / C1.2) 

2.1.4.4.1  Description: 

Warrantage (or storage credit) is a loan 

granted to a producer/farmer and 

guaranteed by his/her product harvest. 

The main purpose is to allow the 

farmer/producer to sell his crop when 

price conditions are most favourable. 

Three actors are involved in this 

mechanism: (1) the third party holder 

who offers storage services; it receives, 

stores and manages conservation of the 

agricultural produce under the 

warrantage throughout the transaction; 

(2) in exchange for his produce, the 

farmer receives from the third party 

holder a certificate which shows storage of his/her produce; (3) the bank, in exchange for the 

certificate held by the farmer, makes available to the latter a loan for an amount equivalent to the 

value of the produce stored by the third party holder.  The operation is closed when the farmer sells 

his produce and repays to the bank the amount borrowed.  

2.1.4.4.2  Objective: Create favourable conditions for the successful development of community 

warrantage and third party holder activities. This mechanism allows farmers to access bank loans 

based on the value of their harvest.  

2.1.4.4.3.  Implementation Arrangements and Actors: The project will be implemented 

through the Ministry of Agriculture; the implementation team is still to be set up. The implementation 

will be conducted with the assistance of the German Cooperation Agency through KFW, which has 

shown interest in providing technical support to the Government of Burkina Faso, particularly in the 

area of professional storage credit. The proposed project activities under warrantage are as follows: 

- Identify, prepare and ensure validation of the draft regulatory texts; 

- Submit the draft texts for adoption; 

- Disseminate the adopted regulatory texts; 

- Create a network of all existing warrantage storage facilities; 

- Disseminate storage and agricultural product standards; 

- Build the capacity of warehouse inspection and control mechanisms; and 

- Establish warrantage cooperatives. 

2.1.5.  Project Cost 

The table below provides cost estimates of the various project components. Component 1 has only 

one operation, namely financing of Government's participation in BADF's share capital, for a total

2.2 Technical Solutions Adopted and Alternatives Explored  

2.2.1 During dialogue with various stakeholders (Government, BADF, farmers’ organisations, 

etc.), several options were presented regarding activities to be supported to improve the agricultural 

financing environment in light of the multiple constraints and challenges. With regard to the project 

implementation arrangements, although the institutional setup was not a problem since it was 

determined by decree for all Burkina Faso projects, there were several possibilities for the 

establishment and management of an implementation unit. The decisions taken were based on the 

need to focus the project on its ambitions in line with the financial package and synergies with other 

Bank projects in the sector, as well as the interventions of other TFPs.

Establish a project

and fully dedicated to the task 

The decree establishing the institutional set-up for projects in 

Burkina Faso determines the de facto financial and technical 

supervisory authority and, in the case of PACBA, it is the 

Ministry of Economy, Finance and Development (MEFD) 

and the Ministry of Agriculture and Water Management 

(MAAH), respectively. MAAH has qualified technical and 

human resources to carry out agricultural insurance and 

warrantage activities. Furthermore, any additional support in 

this regard would be provided as part of the counterpart 

contribution. 

Consider all 

components 

required to improve 

the agricultural 

financing 

environment 

In this respect, the Government 

provides for several actions, in 

particular agricultural 

insurance, warrantage, the 

establishment of a subsidy 

fund and an agricultural 

security fund 

Despite their relevance, the establishment of a subsidy fund 

and an agricultural security fund were not retained, mainly 

because of limited reflection on the tools and their 

complexity, as well as their high financial costs. In addition, 

as regards relevance, urgency, maturity and cost, agricultural 

insurance and warrantage tools are more appropriate for 

support through PACBA. 

2.3 Project Type 

PACBA is an institutional support project financed from ADF resources by a loan intended to: (i) pay 

the Government's participation in the capital of the new BADF amounting to XOF 5 billion; and (ii) 

finance, for an amount not exceeding XOF 888 750 000, the establishment of agricultural insurance 

and warrantage to improve the agricultural financing environment by reducing credit risks inherent 

in this sector in a country like Burkina Faso. 

2.4 Project Costs and Financing Arrangements  

The total project cost, excluding taxes and customs duties, is estimated at UA 7.626 million (about 

XOF 5.988 billion), all in local currency. The cost does not take into account any physical 

contingencies and/or price escalation, which will be borne by the Government of Burkina Faso. The 

ADF contribution to the project financing is UA 7.5 million and covers the financing of Government's 

participation in the capital of BADF (UA 6.368 million) and the cost of establishing an agricultural 

insurance and warrantage mechanism (UA 1.131 million). The tables below provide more details on 

the overall project cost by component, expenditure category and source of financing. The detailed 

cost table is presented in the Technical Annex.

2.5 Project Area and Beneficiaries  

PACBA covers the entire territory of Burkina Faso. Consequently, under BADF, not only will its 

products, particularly loans, be open to all agricultural activities in the country, but it will gradually 

open branches nationwide. Agricultural insurance product will start with a pilot phase for three 

regions, while warrantage will cover the entire national territory. By improving agricultural 

production through productivity and processing, as well as the creation of agricultural value chains 

through increased access to agricultural financing, PACBA will benefit all people in Burkina Faso, 

particularly those living in rural and agricultural areas, young people and women, economic 

operators, and particularly agricultural organisations and leaders (TA C5). In addition, by improving 

the business environment for agricultural financing through agricultural insurance and warrantage, 

PACBA will benefit BADF and the entire banking system. Finally, Government’s participation in 

BADF capital will help to complete its financing and bring the capital up to the minimum level 

required by WAEMU banking regulations. 

2.6 Participatory Approach to Project Identification, Design and Implementation  

At project preparation and appraisal, the main stakeholders were consulted, including farmers’ 

organisations, the association of banks and financial institutions, as well as microfinance and 

insurance institutions, and BCEAO. The same applies to the BADF Design and Establishment 

Committee, set up since July 2016 and chaired by the Prime Minister, BADF Management, the 

consulting firm that prepared the BADF accreditation documents, BADF’s technical partner (Crédit 

Agricole du Sénégal) and the Burkina Fund for Economic and Social Development. At Government 

level, meetings were held with the Ministry of Economy, Finance and Development (MINEFID) and 

the Ministry of Agriculture and Water Management (MAAH). Based on these consultations, the 

project challenges and content were determined and PACBA designed.  

2.7 Bank Group Experience and Lessons Reflected in Project Design 

2.7.1 As at 28 February 2018, the total portfolio volume in Burkina Faso was UA 440.09 million, 

for 17 active projects. The overall disbursement rate was estimated at 50% at that date, for an average 

age of 2.8 years. The sector breakdown of the active portfolio comprises transport (52%), agriculture 

(16.1%), energy (14%), water and sanitation (7.7%), private sector (7.9%), and multi-sector projects 

(2.3%). As regards performance, the Bank's portfolio in Burkina Faso is deemed highly satisfactory 

with an overall score of 3.04 on a scale of 1 to 4, and does not contain any problematic projects. Two 

operations are ongoing in the financial sector: (i) a line of credit for UA 2 million granted in 2014 to 

Fidelis Finance, which was used to finance SMEs operating in various sectors, including agrifood; 

and (ii) a line of credit for UA 32 million approved in 2016 and granted to Coris Bank International 

to finance SMEs operating mainly in the agricultural processing sector. Since these operations are 

still active, there are no completion reports for the sector yet. The project design team also drew 

lessons from the Bank's recent experience in establishing the Tanzania Agricultural Bank and the 

Nigerian Multisector Development Bank. 

2.7.2. Overall, the Bank's portfolio in the agricultural sector in Burkina Faso is significant with 4 

operations and 1 PPF amounting to UA 58.88 million. This represents about 15% of the total project 

portfolio (Annex 2). Ongoing operations include: (i) the Bagré Growth Pole Support Project; (ii) the 

Project to Build Resilience to Food and Nutritional Insecurity; (iii) the Classified Forests Participatory 

Management Project (PGFC) and the Comoé Basin Cashew Nut Development Support Project. 

2.8 Key Performance Indicators 

2.8.1 The key performance indicators identified for measuring expected outcomes upon project 

completion are included in the results-based logical framework. The indicators are essentially:    



17 

 

 Project Impact: The annual growth rate of the agricultural sector is expected to 
increase from 5.9% in 2016 to 6.5% in 2016.  

 Project Outcomes: (i) The proportion of bank credit to the agricultural sector is 
expected to increase from 3.5% in 2017 to 5% in 2020; (ii) the processing rate of 

agricultural products is expected to increase from 16% in 2016 to 25% in 2020; and 

(iii) the proportion of non-resilient households active in the agro-sylvo-pastoral, 

wildlife and fisheries sub-sectors is expected to fall from 49% in 2010 to 25% in 2020. 

 Component 1 Outputs: (i) The Government pays its share in BADF's capital, allowing 
for the capital to be closed and for compliance with the prudential standards of 

WAEMU Banking Commission; (ii) BADF is established and operational, and targets 

XOF 34 billion loans to the agricultural sector in 2020; (iii) gender equity in BADF's 

operations with 20% of total loans granted to women in 2020; this figure is expected 

to increase substantially when BADF launches its special product for women. 

 Component 2 Output: (i) the agricultural insurance mechanism is established in 2020; 
and (ii) warrantage is operational in 2020. 

2.8.2 Progress towards achievement of outcomes will be measured at regular intervals, through a 

variety of activities, including regular Bank supervision missions, and quarterly progress reports and 

audits. Objectively verifiable evidence of progress to the highest targets will be obtained from the 

reports of the quarterly portfolio monitoring meetings organised by COBF with the Bank's project 

implementation units in Burkina Faso. 

 PROJECT FEASIBILITY  

3.1 Economic and Financial Performance   

3.1.1  As an institutional support project, PACBA does not generate direct income to be used in 

determining the financial return. However, through the direct and indirect effects of improving access 

to agricultural financing and the degree of processing agricultural products, PACBA would achieve 

economic and social performance. 

3.1.2  Furthermore, with regard to BADF (TA C3) itself, the analysis, based on the documents sent 

to the Central Bank for the 5-year business plan, shows a profitable banking model from the second 

fiscal year, driven by: (i) sustained growth in Net Banking Income (NBI), +60% on average per year 

to XOF 8 billion at the end of the fifth year; the NBI is driven by the portfolio volume whose average 

annual growth of 40% helps to give the bank 3% of the credit market share at the end of the fifth year, 

(ii) optimised operating expenses with a steadily decreasing operating ratio before stabilisation at 

39% from the fourth year onwards; and (iii) a portfolio maintained at a very high quality, with an 

average default rate of 4% as from the fourth year of operation.  

3.2 Environmental and Social Impact 

3.2.1 Environmental Impact (TA B7) 

3.2.1.1 By nature, PACBA is a financial sector project. The sub-projects to be financed by BADF 
will be projects with medium, minimal and/or no negative social or environmental impacts (agrifood, 

services, and soft services). Consequently, it has been classified under Category 4 (2) by the teams in 

charge of verifying the environmental and social compliance of Bank projects (SNSC). BADF is in 

the start-up phase and has not yet started its operations. However, as recommended by SNSC, the 

project will establish an Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS) in close 



18 

 

collaboration with SNSC teams. BADF will submit the final ESMS to the Bank for opinion and 

approval. 

3.2.2 Impact on Climate Change 

3.2.2.1 Since the project is in the financial sector, it is not in itself vulnerable to climate change, 
neither is it eligible for categorisation by the Bank's Climate Protection System. The sub-projects are 

in the agricultural sector, which is highly exposed to climatic hazards – droughts and floods caused 

by heavy rains and successive rainy days. Local measurements of these climatic hazards will 

contribute to measuring them more appropriately and providing proportional insurance. There are 

risks that other hazards that affect agricultural production may not be taken into account. Such is the 

case with capricious and staggered rainy seasons, their abrupt end not allowing for full maturation of 

crops (shorter duration of the rainy season). 

3.2.3 Social Impact 

3.2.3.1 The social impact of PACBA has many dimensions. First, by increasing agricultural 
productivity and production, it will increase the income of farmers, many of whom are young people 

and women, as well as enhance food security. Better still, not only will income increase but it will 

also be stabilised through agricultural insurance. Similarly, the number of jobs created is expected to 

increase and, thanks to the securing of agricultural income, the jobs will steadily become less 

precarious. These are key factors for settling the rural population, and thereby avoiding massive rural 

exodus due mainly to poverty, droughts or sudden floods. Finally, PACBA opens new windows of 

investment opportunities for the private sector.  

3.2.4 Gender (TA A5) 

3.2.4.1 Burkina Faso ranked 146th under the Gender Equality Index in the 2016 Human 

Development Report, out of 188 countries surveyed. This is due to inequalities based on social 

perceptions and practices that restrict women's rights and reduce their access to economic and social 

opportunities in comparison to men (financial inclusion or political involvement). Women make up 

55% of the agricultural labour force, but only 40% of them own land. Consequently, access to 

property likely to be mortgaged as collateral with the banking system is a discriminatory factor against 

women's access to credit, as well as lack of knowledge of the procedures for obtaining credit. As a 

result, women have less access to credit than men (8% compared to 15% for men). 

3.2.4.2. The PACBA project is classified in Category 3 of the Bank's gender categorisation system. 

Specifically the project will: (i) improve women's access to financing, as well as financial and non-

financial services; (ii) increase women farmers' productivity and income; and (iii) facilitate women's 

financial inclusion by supporting access to credit and financial education programmes for women. 

During the start-up period of the bank's activities, it is expected that 20% of the loans will be allocated 

to women. This figure is expected to double rapidly as BADF intends to introduce a specific product 

for women. In this regard, BADF plans to apply for a line of credit from potential donors. Under the 

project, efforts would be made to collaborate with AFAWA to provide strategic advice and services 

to BADF for better access for women.  

3.2.5 Involuntary Settlement 

3.2.5.1. The PACBA project will not lead to involuntary population displacements. However, the 

ESMS will allow for environmental and social screening of sub-projects that will subsequently be 

financed by AfDB to determine whether they will eventually lead to involuntary population 

displacements requiring the preparation of a resettlement action plan in line with AfDB's integrated 

safeguards system. 



19 

 

 IMPLEMENTATION 

4.1 Implementation Arrangements  

4.1.1 Institutional Arrangements (TA B3)   

4.1.1.1  The institutional framework is based on Decree No. 2018-0092/PRES/PM/MINEFID of 15 

February 2018 defining general regulations governing development projects and programmes 

implemented in Burkina Faso. 

4.1.1.2  Financial supervision of the project will be provided by the Ministry of Economy, Finance 

and Development (MINEFID) through the General Directorate of the Treasury and Public 

Accounting (DGTCP). Its role is to mobilise financial resources required for project implementation. 

Technical supervision will be provided by the Ministry of Agriculture and Water Management 

(MAAH) through the General Directorate for Promotion of the Rural Economy (DGPER), which will 

be in charge of the project management. Therefore, it will ensure its effective implementation. The 

project is linked to the "Agricultural Economy" budget programme, one of the operational 

objectives of which is to improve access to financing. 

4.1.1.3  The Budget Programme Officer will be the Project Coordinator. He/she will ensure 

permanent monitoring of project implementation, particularly the expected outcomes. 

4.1.1.4  The Review Committee will steer the project. It will contribute to project implementation by 

adopting and approving key documents. In this capacity, it will be the project’s decision-making 

body. 

4.1.2. Applicable Procurement Policy and Framework (TA B4) 

4.1.2.1  All goods and consultancy services financed by the Bank's resources will be procured in 

accordance with the Procurement Framework for operations financed by the Bank Group approved 

in October 2015. In accordance with the framework and following various evaluations conducted, it 

was agreed that all goods and consultancy services will be procured in accordance with the Bank's 

procurement system using the Standard Bidding Documents (SBD) provided for that purpose and 

based on the Bank's Procurement Methods and Procedures (PMP) specified in the Procurement Plan. 

More specifically, procurements will be made as follows: 

(i) All goods required for the project and to be procured using the PMP will be in 

accordance with the provisions of Article 8.5 of the Bank Group Procurement Policy 

document; and 

(ii)  All consultancy services required for the project and to be procured using the PMP 

will be in accordance with the provisions of Article 8.6 of the Bank Group 

Procurement Policy document. 

4.1.2.2  Procurement Risks and Capacity Assessment (PRCA): To take into account the specific 

aspects of the project, the Bank has assessed: (i) the risks at national, sector and project level; and (ii) 

the capacity of the executing agency. The results of the assessments showed that the procurement risk 

was "moderate" and helped to determine the appropriate risk mitigation measures included in the 

PRCA action plan indicated in para. B.5.9 of Annex B5.    

4.1.3. Financial Management Arrangements 

4.1.3.1  PACBA financial management will be provided by the General Directorate for Promotion 

of the Rural Economy (DGPER) of the Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Fisheries Resources, 



20 

 

which has been appointed the Project Executing Agency. The project will be managed by a DGPER 

Project Implementation Unit that will be established and its capacity strengthened in terms of project 

management and compliance with Bank rules and procedures. The DGPER Director General will be 

responsible for the overall project financial management, and will be assisted in this regard by the 

DGPER Administrative and Financial Director. The fiduciary risk following the assessment is 

deemed substantial (See the Technical Annex for more details).   

4.1.3.2. The project will prepare and submit quarterly reports (financial and technical) to the Bank 

within 45 days following the end of each quarter. The Internal Accounts Inspectorate of the 

supervisory Ministry should include the financial operations of the project in its annual audit 

programme as part of its role as the project internal auditor.   

4.1.4  Disbursement Arrangements   

4.1.4.1   Throughout the component 1, the Bank’s support will be through the reinboursment method. 

Sice obtaintion the approval of the new bank is a prerequisite for the support provided by the Bank 

through the PACBA, the reinboursement method will be used to enable the Bank repay, up to five (5) 

billion FCFA, the State of Burkina Faso for the expenses it incurred as part of its participation in the 

capital of BADF. These expenses concern those incurred in order to obtain the favourable opinion of 

the WAMU Banking Commission obtained on March 14, 2018 and the approval of the Minister in 

charge of Finance obtained on April 16, 2018 by Order N ° 183/MINEFID/DGTCP/DAMOF which 

dedicates the effective creation of the BADF. It should be recalled the the Bank's support was 

requested to reimburse the State of Burkina Faso's stake in the capital of a bank, called Banque 

Agricole du Faso. Since the Agricultural Bank of Burkina Faso started to exist as a bank only after 

the authorization obtained on April 16, 2018, this date is used as the date on which the Burkinabe 

State's expenditure on the operation acquisition of a stake in the capital of BADF was incurred. For 

all intents and purposes, the timeline for the creation of the Agricultural Bank of Faso was as follows: 

i. On October 4, 2017 and September 21, 2017, the Burkinabe State, like the other shareholders, 
disbursed the amount corresponding to its planned share in the capital of BADF in two 

blocked bank accounts registered in the name of the "Société en formation (company in 

constitution) Banque Agricole du Faso"; 

ii. On October 13, 2017, Banque Agricole du Faso was created as a public limited company. 
This step is a prerequisite for the review of the BADF application by the UEMOA Banking 

Commission. Thus, at this stage, the BADF does not yet have the status of a bank and is not 

yet registered on the list of WAEMU banks. 

iii. On April 16, 2018, the limited company Banque Agricole du Faso is approved as a bank and 
registered under the number C 0207 J on the list of banks of the UEMOA. 

 

4.1.4.2. Disbursements and Cash Flows: Disbursements from ADF resources will be made in 

accordance with the Bank’s disbursement prodecedures. Three (3) disbursement methods will be 

used:  

1) The reimbursement method: it will be used to enable the State of Burkina Faso to request 
repayment to the Bank of the exepenses, ocuring starting April 16, 2018, related to its 

participation in the capital of the BADF for a total amount not exceeding UA 6,368 million as 

stipulated in the paragraph 4.1.4.1 of the evaluation report referring to the retroactive financing. 

Repayment by the Bank may be made upon receipt of a request for reimboursement 

accompanied by evidence of pre-financing by the State of its participation in the capital of 

BADF. The amount reimboursed will be up to the amount of shares owned by the State of 

Burkina Faso and held in the capital of the BADF. 



21 

 

2) The special account method: it will be used to finance the operation and the training and 
workshop activities organized by the project implementation unit. The provisions of the 

disbursement manual will be fully applicable for the management and justification of resources 

disbursed to the special account. A special account will be opened at the National Treasury with 

the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) for the Bank financing. The special account 

will operate under the principle of double signature. This account will receive the funds to pay 

the eligible expenses on the counterparty. 

3) The direct payment method: it will be used for the payment of contracts and for expenses related 
to the implementation of component 2 "Support for Securing the Agricultural Financing 

Ecosystem", notably for payments in respect of the procurement of the weather stations and 

their maintenance contract. 

4.1.4.3. In addition, disbursements from counterpart funds will be made at national level through a 

special counterpart funds account opened at the treasury and operating under the double signature 

principle. The account will receive the funds intended to pay for eligible expenses from the 

counterpart funds.  

4.1.5 Audit Arrangements  

The project's financial statements will be audited yearly by an independent audit firm acceptable to 

the Bank. The audit report, together with a management letter, will be submitted to the Bank within 

six months following the end of the fiscal year in accordance with the Bank's terms of reference. The 

cost of the audit will be borne by the project.  

4.2 Monitoring and Evaluation 

4.2.1 The physical implementation of the project will cover 25 months, from December 2018 to 

December 2020.  

4.2.2  Upon effectiveness of the loan agreement, a launching mission will be organised to train 

BADF officials in the Bank's procedures. Supervision missions will be organised at least twice a year. 

Quarterly and annual activity reports will also be prepared and submitted to the Bank.  

4.3 Governance 

Burkina Faso has made significant progress in governance over the past three years. At the political 

level, the progress made is in terms of the creation and strengthening of republican institutions, the 

consolidation of the rule of law, and the reinforcement of human rights. As regards corruption, 

according to Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index in 2016, the country is ranked 

72nd out of 172 countries in the world, and among the top 10 least corrupt African countries. With 

respect to public financial governance, Burkina Faso has, with IMF support, implemented major 

reforms to improve transparency and efficiency in public resource management. With regard to 

BADF, it should be noted that as a bank approved by BCEAO, it will be subject to the supervision of 

the WAEMU Banking Commission and will have to comply with the banking regulations in force in 

WAEMU.   

4.4 Sustainability 

4.4.1 PACBA will naturally be sustainable because, given its agricultural insurance mechanism, 

it comprises major actions to reinforce the sustainability of BADF in particular, and agricultural 

financing in general. In addition, the authorities' clear intention to consolidate the PACBA mechanism 



22 

 

by establishing an Agricultural Credit Security Fund, namely the Natural Disasters Fund and the 

Interest Rate Subsidy Fund, will strengthen, complement and replicate the impact of PACBA. 

4.5 Risk Management 

Table 4.5 

Potential Risks and Mitigation Measures 

Risks Level Mitigation Measures 

Rising socio-political unrest Moderate Government commitment to continue negotiations with a view to taking socio-

economic and political demands into account. 

Increased security risks 
Moderate 

The Government has redoubled its efforts to provide strong and sustainable 

responses, and has resolutely embraced a regional antiterrorism framework (G5 

Sahel) to address the various threats. 

BADF’s weak human and 

institutional capacity to properly 

manage the bank 

Moderate 
BADF's managers have extensive experience in banking and, particularly, in 

agricultural financing. In addition, the technical assistance contract with CNCA 

of Senegal will provide support to BADF in various areas, including IT systems 

management and risk management systems and procedures. Similarly, the entry 

of a technical and financial partner into BADF's capital is still under 

consideration.  

Governance: Strong Government 

participation in the bank’s capital 

following the Central Bank's 

request to pull out shareholders 

deemed financially unsound.  

Moderate  
The Burkinabe Fund for Economic and Social Development (FBDES) holds the 

Government’s participation and additional shares owned by organisations 

considered weak by the Central Bank; the Central Bank has requested the 

organisations to pull out of BADF capital. FBDES is also requested to gradually 

transfer the shares, as well as the Government’s participation, to stakeholders in 

line with its area of activity as soon as possible. In addition, the entry of a 

technical and financial partner is still being considered. Independent directors 

will also be co-opted to the Board of Directors to improve the quality of the 

management structure. 

Risk of strong pressure on 

management from farmers’ 

cooperatives who consider BADF 

as a bank established on their 

initiative and dedicated to them 

Moderate  
Strong ownership of the project establishing BADF from the outset by farmers’ 

organisations, and therefore their willingness to ensure the bank's viability. In 

addition, the continued and strong sensitisation of farmers’ organisations on the 

need to ensure the bank's sustainability. BADF will give priority to organised 

farmers' networks that will help to gather customer information and, if necessary, 

collect unpaid debts.  

Strong competition from existing 

banks 

Moderate  BADF will address segments not covered by existing banks. Given the strong 

ownership by farmer organisations, BADF will rely on farmers’ networks to attract 

agricultural customers. The bank will also diversify its activities by financing non-

agricultural sectors.  

4.6 Knowledge Building 

PACBA implementation will help to build several types of knowledge, particularly: (i) best practice 

in agribusiness investment financing within an innovative context; (ii) the adoption of appropriate 

instruments and an attractive deposit remuneration system to substantially improve the mobilisation 

of national savings; (iii) the creation of agribusiness project databases to promote the emergence of 

agricultural processing units and improve agricultural value chains in Burkina Faso; and (iv) studies 

to be conducted on agricultural insurance and warrantage. The practices will be disseminated within 

the administration and to non-State actors through the documents and procedures manuals produced, 

procedures manuals, as well as training sessions that will be organised under the project. The 

knowledge will be acquired through producing the following reports: technical assistance reports, 

activity reports prepared by the executing agency, supervision reports, project completion report, and 

"discussion and working documents" of the Bank's Office in Burkina Faso. Finally, the knowledge 

and lessons learned will be disseminated within the Department, the Bank and in the host country by 

the AfDB through seminars and IDEV reports.

Project Executive Summary 

1.1 Project Overview: A Global Environment Facility (GEF) grant of USD 5,329,452 (UA 
3.807 million) was mobilized to finance the project entitled “Building Resilience for Food 
Security and Nutrition in Chad’s Rural Communities ”. This co-financed grant will be used to 
maximize the impact of the Programme to Build Resilience to Food and Nutrition Insecurity 
in the Sahel (P2RS), funded with African Development Fund (ADF) resources. P2RS, 
approved by the Board of Directors in October 2014, was designed for a 20-year period 
tosustainably increase agro-sylvo-pastoral and fisheries productivity in the Sahel. In addition 
to the regional component, some countries are implementing their own national projects. P2RS 
Project 1 involves seven Sahel countries most affected by food crises, including Chad. The 
project will serve as a basis for GEF co-financing. The P2RS-Chad component, placed under 
the supervision of the Ministry of Agriculture, specifically aims to strengthen the resilience of 
rural communities through the development of agriculture and livestock, irrigation systems and 
regional markets for agricultural inputs and livestock products. The implementation of P2RS 
Project 1 is under way and involves both central and decentralized entities responsible for 
agriculture, animal resources, the environment and nutrition. GEF’s co-financing, which 
targets the same objectives as the initial P2RS, will be implemented concurrently with the Chad 
component. The GEF Project Identification Form (PIF) was approved on 28 April 2015 and 
endorsed by its Chief Executive Officer and Chairperson on 13 September 2017. The aim of 
the GEF project is to help restore and maintain the basic productivity of the natural resources 
on which people depend. The idea is to strengthen food security and nutrition by using 
sustainable and resilient agro-sylvo-pastoral systems in the target regions. 

1.2 The underlying concept of the GEF project is that resilience in the Sahel will be 
impossible if equal attention is not paid to both  the rational and sustainable management of 
the natural systems that support rural livelihoods. The proposed project will also seek to restore 
and maintain the productivity of natural assets in fragile ecosystems through: (i) the 
improvement of agro-sylvo-pastoral productivity in arid zones; (ii) the promotion of integrated 
ecosystem management to protect biodiversity; and (iii) knowledge building and monitoring 
and evaluation. It aims to build the resilience of communities and households regularly affected 
by climate-related extreme events, through a sustained increase in the productivity of natural 
resources, thus helping to enhance food security and nutrition in Kanem and Bahr el Ghazal 
provinces. Therefore, the project will enable stakeholders to contribute to the restoration of 
biodiversity in fragile ecosystems. On this basis, the GEF project will be implemented in the 
regions targeted by the initial P2RS over a four-year period. The Ministry of Agriculture, which 
oversees the initial P2RS, will remain the executing body for the GEF project. The activities 
will be implemented by the existing Project Implementation Unit (PIU) and managed by the 
same steering committee. It should be noted that the GEF project has already been approved 
by the GEF Chief Executive Officer and Chairperson, and has now been submitted to the Board 
of Directors for approval. 

1.3 Needs Assessment: In line with the rural development, environmental management 
and climate change priorities and the Chad Vision 2030 for Development, whose main 
objective is to make Chad an emerging country by 2030, the Government has developed and 
launched a number of sectoral policies and national development strategies, including the 
National Development Plan 2017-2021, which succeeds the previous National Development 
Plan 2013-2015, the National Poverty Reduction Strategies I and II, the National Biodiversity 
Strategy and Action Plan (2014 - 2020) and the National Adaptation Programme of Action on 
Climate Change (NAPA, 2009). The project interventions will help to reduce land degradation 
and promote sustainable management of natural resources, thereby building economic, social 
and climate resilience. As such, it is in line with thrust 4 of the Vision 2030 paper, which aims 



 

v 
 

to improve the quality of life of the Chadian people by creating a healthy environment with 
preserved natural resources. 

1.4 Target Beneficiaries: The project’s direct beneficiaries are the 11,000 smallholder 
farmers who engage in subsistence agriculture and livestock farming on marginal lands and 
derive their income from agriculture, livestock farming or the gathering of wood and non-wood 
products. Through the various activities that will be initiated, the project will help to bolster 
their resilience to food and nutrition insecurity and improve access to agro-pastoral and 
transhumance resources, which should be developed with an emphasis on resource 
sustainability and diversification.  

Professional organizations, grassroots community organizations and actors at both local and 
central levels involved in the implementation of the planned activities will have their capacities 
strengthened through the activities proposed by the project. 

1.5 Bank’s Value Added: The Bank will build on and develop implementation approaches 
and principles based on its long experience in the Sahel, especially in water mobilization and 
control, sustainable natural resource management and resilience-building among vulnerable 
groups. In Chad,, the Bank has developed and implemented a number of projects in the rural 
development sector, including the Surface Runoff Water Enhancement Project (PVERS), the 
Natural Resources Management Project in the Sudan Region (PGRN-ZS) and the Food Crops 
Cultivation Project in the Sudan Region (PCVZS). These have shown that technical support 
for production through the dissemination of appropriate soil fertility management techniques 
and access to water, accompanied by adequate medium- and long-term investments in a 
participatory approach are necessary to cope with shocks and reduce the adverse effects of 
climate change. Through this GEF financing, the Bank will draw on this wealth of experience  
to undertake more sustained investments in support of the organization of farmers, women and 
young people, focusing on the mainstreaming of environmental, climate issues and nutrition 
issues.   

1.6 Knowledge Building: The project will support environmental awareness and 
stakeholder capacity-building, focusing on improving integrated landscape management and 
agro-sylvo-pastoral planning. The project will also comprise sustainable land and forest 
management technologies as well as the dissemination of best practices in Sahelian agriculture 
and biodiversity conservation to stakeholders. The knowledge that will result from the 
implementation of these approaches and techniques, as well as the lessons learned therefrom, 
will be capitalized for dissemination and development  during the design and management of 
future projects.  

Lessons learned will be captured in quarterly and annual progress reports, technical reports 
and the mid-term review and completion reports.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION TO THE BOARD OF 
DIRECTORS CONCERNING A PROPOSAL TO  FINANCE  FROM GEF 

RESOURCES  THE PROJECT TO BUILD RESILIENCE FOR FOOD SECURITY 
AND NUTRITION IN CHAD’S RURAL COMMUNITIES 

 

Management hereby submits the following report and recommendation for a GEF grant 
of USD 5,329,452 (UA 3.518 million) as additional resources to finance the Project to 
Build Resilience for Food Security and Nutrition in Chad’s Rural Communities, as part 
of the P2RS Programme. 

1. STRATEGIC THRUSTS AND RATIONALE 

1.1 Project Linkages with Country Strategy and Objectives 

1.1.1 The Government's development programme is set out in the Vision 2030, the objective 
being for Chad to "become an emerging middle-income country by 2030, whose economy is 
driven by diverse sustainable sources of growth and value-added activities". The National 
Development Plan (NDP 2017-2018) is the first operational planning paper of the Vision 2030. 
It replaces the NDP 2013-2015 and the successive national poverty reduction strategies (2003-
2006; 2008-2011), which give priority and special attention to agriculture and rural sector 
development, with a view to increasing food production and improving the incomes of rural 
communities. The Programme to Build Resilience to Food and Nutrition Insecurity in the Sahel 
(P2RS) was designed to sustainably increase agro-sylvo-pastoral and fisheries productivity in 
the Sahel, thus facilitating the achievement of Vision 2030. The three main components of 
P2RS are (i) rural infrastructure development; (ii) value chains and regional markets 
development; and (iii) project management and coordination. The initial P2RS will serve as 
the basis for GEF co-financing. The project is  in line not only with Chad's Country Strategy 
Paper (CSP) 2015-2020,  focused on "the development of infrastructure to promote robust and 
more diversified economic growth", but also  with the objectives of the Bank's Ten-Year 
Strategy since it will help Chad to move along a growth path that protects livelihoods, promotes 
greener growth and stimulates economic development. The project is also consistent with two 
of the Bank's five priorities, namely: “Feed Africa” and “Improve the quality of life for the 
people of Africa”. 

1.1.2 The GEF Project Identification Form (PIF) was approved in April 2015 and validated 
on 13 September 2017 by the Facility’s Chief Executive Officer and Chairperson for an amount 
of USD 5,329,452. The project aims to build the resilience of communities and households 
regularly affected by extreme weather events, through sustained growth in natural resource 
productivity, which will help to improve food security and nutrition in Kanem and Bahr el 
Ghazal provinces. The project will thus enable stakeholders to contribute to the restoration of 
biodiversity in fragile ecosystems. The GEF project is fully aligned with national strategies and 
P2RS, in that it aims to reduce and reverse trends in desertification, land degradation and 
biodiversity loss, which will improve productivity and food security while preserving the 
natural resources that support agro-ecological production. 

1.2 Rationale for the Bank’s Involvement 

1.2.1 Chad is increasingly confronted with problems of environmental degradation and 
extreme weather events, which are much more pronounced in such sectors as agriculture, 
livestock, fisheries and health. All policy papers (Vision 2030, National Development Plan, 
poverty reduction strategies) highlight the importance of protecting natural resources in a 
context of worsening weather phenomena in Chad, and the need to implement actions that 



 

2 

promote food security and build the adaptive capacities of affected populations. However,  
capacity to sustainably managenatural resources in the face of climate change is limited due to 
the shortage of human and financial resources in existing administrative entities (ministries, 
government agencies and local governments). 

1.2.2 The project is in line with the Bank's Ten-Year Strategy (2013-2022), the ultimate 
goal of which is sustainable inclusive growth. The focus is on protecting livelihoods, enhancing 
water, electricity and food security, promoting the sustainable use of natural resources, creating 
jobs, stimulating innovation and developing the economy. It will help to achieve the objectives 
of the Ten-Year Strategy by strengthening agro-sylvo-pastoral productivity and promoting 
integrated ecosystem management and inclusive growth. Undertaken in the Sahel, a region that 
attracts particular attention because of the difficult living conditions and vulnerability of its 
rural populations, but also because of its agricultural potential, the project will have an impact 
on agriculture and food security, thus helping to achieve two of the Bank’s “High 5s”. Given 
that the project also aims to promote innovative production techniques such as agroforestry and 
sylvo-pastoralism, activities that are mainly carried out by women, it will also help in the 
implementation of the Bank's Gender Strategy. Through its adaptation actions, the project will 
also help in the implementation of the Bank's 2016-2020 Climate Change Action Plan (CCAP), 
contributingapproximately 80.21% of the budget of components (1) and (2). 

1.2.3 As on 1 October 2018, the African Development Bank has 15 operations in Chad, with 
a net commitment of UA 214.23 million. Under the CSP 2016-2020, the Bank's support is 
based on two pillars: (i) infrastructure development to promote inclusive green growth; and (ii) 
promotion of good governance to increase the effectiveness of public actions and make the 
economic framework more attractive.  The Bank's strategic approach is to help create 
conditions conducive to more inclusive economic growth and to improve the country's 
integration into a sub-regional economy. Since the project's interventions aim to reduce land 
degradation and promote sustainable natural resource management, this will improve socio-
economic resilience while strengthening agro-pastoral and transhumance resources, which 
should be developed to enhance sustainability and diversify growth in the country. 

1.3 Donor Coordination  

1.3.1 A Technical and Financial Partners Committee, established in April 2011, is 
responsible for harmonizing donor interventions in Chad. The committee is composed of nine 
thematic groups and is chaired by France. The committee acts as a platform for dialogue, 
consultation and collaboration on development issues and on bilateral and multinational 
cooperation between Chad and its partners. A State/partners committee has also been set up to 
encourage dialogue with national authorities and improve aid management. A matrix of 
interventions for 2018-2021, which presents all partners’ planned interventions, has helped to 
better assess their areas of intervention and improve the division and coordination of work. Aid 
coordination has facilitated co-financing with technical and financial partners such as BADEA, 
the OPEC Fund, BDEAC, UNDP, EU and IsDB. 

2. PROJECT DESCRIPTION 

2.1 Objectives of P2RS (Core Project) and GEF Project  

2.1.1 Objectives and Components of the Initial P2RS: The P2RS Chad project served as a 
basis for mobilizing co-financing for the GEF project. The P2RS programme aims to eliminate 
the structural causes of acute and chronic food and nutrition crises by helping vulnerable 
households to increase their production and income, secure access to basic social infrastructure 
and services, and increase their livelihood options. It was designed for a 20-year period in four 



 

3 

phases, the first of which (Project 1) will be implemented over a five-year period, from 2015 
to 2019. The overall cost of P2RS Project 1, which covers seven CILSS countries, amounts to 
USD 271.77 million funded by ADF-XIII in the form of grants and loans, representing 85% of 
the total cost of Project 1. The remaining 15% is funded by (i) the governments of the countries 
involved in this first phase (Burkina Faso, Chad, the Gambia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger and 
Senegal); (ii) the Permanent Interstate Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel (CILSS); 
and (iii) beneficiaries. 

2.1.2 In Chad, P2RS is under the technical supervision of the Ministry of Agriculture. The 
project strategy  is based on the development of agricultural and livestock farming products, 
the promotion of irrigation systems, accessibility to input markets and capacity-building for 
private and public institutions and communities in the agricultural sector. In that regard, the 
project is  constructing  pastoral and village water infrastructure in targeted rural districts and 
will help vulnerable households to not only improve their productivity through rational and 
sustainable management of natural resources but also to have better access to markets. A value 
chain approach based on growth sub-sectors is currently being used to ensure, maintain and 
increase access to and the marketing of agricultural products. The basic project will be 
implemented through three components, covering: 

(i)  Rural infrastructure development: This component aims to increase and improve 
agricultural production, processing and marketing infrastructure, which is 
indispensable for increasing the competitiveness of promising agricultural 
sectors and strengthening the resilience of agricultural operations in the Sahel. 
The main activities focus on the development of pastoral infrastructure and 
facilities, conservation, processing and marketing infrastructure, and basic 
social infrastructure. 

(ii)  Development of regional value chains and markets: This component aims to 
increase on a sustainable basis the production and productivity of the main agro-
sylvo-pastoral farming systems and to strengthen nutrition.  

(iii)  Programme management: The last component aims to define and deliver the 
institutional architecture for the management and coordination of all project-
related aspects, including procurement, monitoring and evaluation, and 
communication. 

2.1.3 A standing committee, composed of representatives of the central administration of 
the rural sector and all the actors involved in the development of the regions within the project 
area, is responsible for managing and making decisions concerning P2RS. 

2.1.4 Objectives and description of the GEF project: Entitled "Building Resilience for Food 
and Nutrition Security in Rural Communities in Chad", the GEF project will be based on the 
activities planned under the original project, to increase their impact on the environment and 
on the people. The activities are grouped into three components: (i) improvement of agro-
sylvo-pastoral productivity in drylands; (ii) promotion of integrated ecosystem management to 
enhance resilience and biodiversity; and (iii) knowledge management and monitoring and 
evaluation, in accordance with the GEF eligibility criteria for the areas of intervention under 
which this project is funded, namely land degradation, biodiversity and sustainable forest 
management. The components and activities are presented in Table 2.1 below. 

The GEF project’s main expected outcomes  are as follows: (i) improvement of rural 
communities’ agricultural production practices and the management of natural pasture to 
support food security and resilience; (ii) use by rural communities of improved agro-pastoral 



 

4 

technologies and their access to production assets for enhanced livelihoods and reduced 
vulnerability; (iii) improved  management of forests  and/or reforestation areas, to generate 
sustainable flows of ecosystem services; (iv) enhanced integrated landscape planning for 
habitat resilience and preservation; (v) enabling  natural environment is enhanced through 
mechanisms for the conservation of land, woody biomass and biodiversity, (vi) lessons learned 
are captured and knowledge is disseminated; and (vii) the project impact is monitored and 
evaluated. 

2.1.5. The first objective of the initial P2RS is to develop rural infrastructure, value chains 
and regional markets. The additional GEF project will build on the first objective (development 
of rural infrastructure) to undertake investments in irrigation schemes development,  establish 
cereal banks, agricultural input shops and livestock feed shops, and ensure sound land and soil 
management (soil conservation/regeneration techniques and sustainable forest management). 
The second objective of the initial P2RS (development of value chains and regional markets) 
will be strengthened in the additional GEF project through crop diversification, identification 
of resilient seed varieties and selection of other income-generating activities. The additional 
GEF project will therefore increase the attention given to sustainability and resilience in the 
initial P2RS. Its purpose is to enable stakeholders to restore and maintain the productivity of 
natural resources and biodiversity in fragile ecosystems, in order to ultimately improve their 
livelihoods and the natural resources on which they depend. This approach is based on the 
premise that agro-sylvo-pastoral systems are essential for improving food and nutrition 
security.

2.4.2 Experiences and lessons learned by the Bank: The AfDB has been active in the Sahel 
for many years, mainly in the following areas: water management and control, development of 
agriculture, livestock farming, fisheries, and natural resource management. Its experience 
shows that investing in the medium and long terms in the resilience of rural households is 
essential for helping them to cope with shocks (famine, drought, conflict, etc.) and for reducing 
their vulnerability. As at 1 October 2018, the Bank's net commitments in Chad for active 
operations amounted to UA 214.23 million. After a portfolio review conducted in 2013, key 
lessons were learned from previous CSPs and ongoing rural development initiatives. These 
include: the need for greater selectivity in terms of country allocation, division of labour and 
implementation capacity; the need for greater economic integration, stronger partnerships and 
co-financing (to increase the economic and social impact of interventions); the need to 
consolidate governance gains and build Chad's institutional capacities; and the need to promote 
the role of the private sector, particularly in the agricultural sector. 

2.5 Project Impact Area  

2.5.1 The proposed project will be implemented in the Sahel regions of Kanem and Bahr el 
Ghazal, where food insecurity is most acute in Chad, mainly due to difficult agro-ecological 
conditions and high malnutrition rates. The project beneficiaries will be smallholder farmers 
engaged in subsistence agriculture and livestock farming on marginal land, and who derive 
their income from agriculture, stock-breeding or the gathering of wood products. The project 
will specifically target 11,000 land operators who will receive training in integrated natural 
resource management (INRM) and sustainable land and water management (SLWM) with 
demonstrations. It will also train 150 local employees in sustainable INRM policies and 
practices, distribute resilient seed varieties to 100 households, and assist 10 local producer 
groups (including at least five women's groups) to diversify their incomes through agroforestry 
and sylvo-pastoral activities. As the land on which they depend is characterized by sand dunes 
and low-productivity wadis, the beneficiaries live on non-irrigated agriculture. The project will 



 

8 

address this issue by promoting sustainable land management, site-specific soil conservation 
systems and mixed cropping systems, the construction of rural hydro-agricultural 
infrastructure, and crop diversification with the cultivation of appropriate species. Low 
agricultural productivity, lack of income opportunities and lack of rural socio-economic 
infrastructure are the main causes of poverty in these areas. Poverty and insecurity are further 
exacerbated by the weakness of community-based organizations, coupled with inefficient 
service delivery, lack of resources (especially land in the wadis) and weak decision-making 
power and scarcity of information. 
 
2.6. Participatory Approach for Project Identification, Design and Implementation 
 
2.6.1 During the identification of the core programme, extensive consultations were held, 
and a participatory approach was adopted for the development of the programme. During the 
preparation and appraisal phases, discussions and a workshop were held with key institutions 
and stakeholders, including national institutions responsible for agriculture, fisheries, 
livestock, environment, health and water (20 September 2016 to 5 October 2016). The 
consultative process was extended to civil society (NGOs, including women's organizations, 
farmers' organizations, etc.). Meetings were held with communities, key actors in production 
systems, and administrative and local authorities, which provided an opportunity not only to 
share information on the project and collect data on impact areas, but also to discuss planned 
activities. Women's organizations were involved in these meetings to better understand the 
difficulties they face and better capture their challenges and needs. These elements were fully 
reflected in the design of the intervention and this participatory approach will be maintained 
during the project implementation. Various stakeholders will also be involved in the 
development of the envisaged monitoring and evaluation system to ensure smooth 
implementation and achievement of goals. 

2.7 Consideration of Bank Group’s Experience and Lessons Learned in Project 
 Design 

2.7.1 The Bank has extensive experience in resilience-building programmes in the Sahel 
region. For instance, it implemented a USD 4 billion (2014) grant operation aimed at promoting 
stability and economic growth in the region. In addition, the Bank, through the African Water 
Facility (AWF) established in 2006, has funded 9 national and 11 multinational projects 
focusing on capacity-building for integrated water resources management, and established 
appropriate frameworks for collaborative water management, for example for Lake Chad, 
among other interventions. Several statements have been made on the issue of water security 
in the Sahel, reiterated as a priority for the Bank. The lessons learned from these previous Bank 
interventions, as well as the P2RS design, and the actions implemented during the design of 
the proposed project, are presented below in table form:

implementation  

Inclusion in the project design of participatory and 
regular monitoring and evaluation activities with 
sufficient financial allocation 

 
2.8 Key Performance Indicators  
 
2.8.1. The impact, outcome and output indicators are those mentioned in the logical 
framework, which will be measured using the existing monitoring and evaluation (M&E) 
system developed under P2RS. The impact indicator, which will serve as a gauge for the 
development objective, is the improvement of food security and nutrition following the 
adoption of sustainable and resilient agro-sylvo-pastoral systems in the Sahelian regions of 
Chad. Monitoring tools reflecting the multifocal nature of the project will also be developed 
for the GEF project activities, in accordance with the requirements of this institution. 

3. PROJECT FEASIBILITY  

3.1 Economic and Financial Performance  

3.1.1 Economic and financial analyses carried out were based on the premise that incentive 
measures, sustainability considerations and an enabling environment are essential for the 
success of any intervention, all of which conditions the P2RS and the proposed project plan to 
fulfil. The measures envisaged in this regard are: (i) a multi-stakeholder participatory process, 
the creation of three nurseries, the construction of hydro-agricultural infrastructure, the 
establishment of land-use plans and the provision of training in sustainable land and water 
management; (ii) the establishment of pilot areas, training of beneficiaries, promotion and use 
of improved stoves, and the adoption of a forest certification system to encourage the 
sustainable use of land and forests; (iii) the development of grazing plans, the reseeding of 
grazing land, the adoption of species testing based on extension services to ensure the 
availability of healthy animals; (iv) fencing to prevent crop destruction, seed trials, extension 
services and cereal banks to improve crop productivity; (v) pilot/learning sites for training 
activities to encourage soil conservation; and (vi) identification, training and prioritization of 
IGAs to improve livelihoods, mainly for women and young people. 

3.1.2 The implementation of the GEF Project in parallel with the core project (P2RS) is 
expected to build food security and improve nutrition in the project areas. The adoption of 
sustainable and resilient agro-sylvo-pastoral systems will improve agricultural production and 
enhance the availability of fodder resources for livestock. Similarly, integrated space 
management will increase land availability for crops and restore soil condition. The 
dissemination and use of improved stoves, the promotion of related IGAs will reduce the 
pressure on wooded areas and curb deforestation and land degradation. The implementation of 
project activities focused on building resilience and food security will amplify the economic 
benefits of the project, as well as the positive impacts on living conditions and the quality of 
life.  



 

10 

3.1.3 A number of socio-economic benefits should stem from the project, including: (i) 
greater food and nutrition security resulting from the overall increase in agricultural and 
livestock products; (ii) reduced vulnerability due to crop diversification and the cultivat ion of 
resistant seed varieties; (iii) constant flows of agricultural and forest ecosystem services with 
improved habitat resilience and preservation; (iv) the introduction of a sustainable forest and 
IGA management certification system, which will further stabilize incomes; and (v) increased 
awareness and a more favourable environment for managing the ecosystem and combating 
climate change. 

3.2 Environmental and Social Impacts  

3.2.1 Environment: P2RS, the core project, is classified in Environmental Category 2 and 
has undergone Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA), in accordance with the relevant 
procedures of the Bank, as well as its policy and regulatory framework. The purpose of the 
SEA is to integrate environmental, socio-economic and institutional concerns into the design 
and implementation of P2RS. For instance, P2RS-funded infrastructure investments will have 
short-term negative environmental impacts specific to the area. The assessment led to the 
development of an Environmental and Social Management Framework Plan (ESMFP) 
outlining the various mitigation and enhancement measures. The GEF Project specifically aims 
to increase the attention devoted to environmental protection in the core project, which should 
produce a generally positive environmental impact. 

Assessment of environmental conditions during the field visits confirmed that the proposed 
project will have positive impacts. A number of negative environmental impacts are 
foreseeable in the construction and works implementation phases, but they will be limited, 
reversible and controllable, subject to monitoring and the implementation of appropriate 
mitigation measures. These measures will comprise the preparation and validation of a sub-
project selection procedure that is consistent with Chad's regulations, the establishment and 
monitoring of land-use plans in each council or municipality within the project impact area, 
the development of environmental and social project management guides, and the promotion 
of best practices in agriculture and natural resource management. 

3.2.2 Climate Change 

To combat climate change, Chad is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions 
unconditionally by18.2% and conditionally by 71% by 2030, through adaptation and mitigation 
measures. Climate change adaptation is a major concern for the country, which has developed 
its National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA), among other documents, in an effort 
to reduce its climate vulnerability. 

The GEF Project is committed to promoting climate resilience by improving food and nutrition 
security. Livelihoods will be diversified through the introduction of mixed cropping systems, 
crop diversification, agroforestry and the identification of alternative activities that would 
generate incomes while at the same time contributing to climate change adaptation. The project 
will support resilience by promoting (i) sustainable agriculture and livestock production, 
including sustainable management of grazing areas; and (ii) better planning of landscape 
development to ensure the resilience of communities and ecosystems. To build the capacity of 
beneficiaries, the project will support the setting up of micro-projects to demonstrate 
appropriate soil conservation techniques, train local staff in sustainable integrated natural 
resource management (INRM), provide training in sustainable forest management and arable 
land management, and a demonstration of participatory land-use planning to better adapt to 
climate change and reduce climate vulnerability. The project will also contribute to mitigation 
actions through reforestation and the establishment of agro-forestry plantations. It will also 



 

11 

foster the implementation of the Bank's 2016-2020 Climate Change Action Plan (PACC2) by 
mobilizing external climate financing. 

3.2.3 Gender: Chad is ranked 150th out of 187 countries on the Gender Parity Index. While 
discrimination against women is clearly prohibited, the principle of equality is undermined by 
resistance and the existence of de facto inequalities between men and women. Barriers rooted 
in traditional practices favour men, thereby hindering the internalization and appropriation of 
laws. The proposed project will mainstream gender-related issues by specifically targeting the 
implementation of activities usually dominated by women, and for which they have recognized 
know-how (trade, market gardening, rice cultivation, small livestock breeding, traditional 
poultry farming, processing, marketing, etc.) and from which they can derive an income. At 
least five women's organizations will benefit from income diversification assistance through 
agroforestry and sylvo-pastoral activities. The project will also have to ensure that women have 
access to project resources by identifying other income-generating activities to be implemented 
in association with households, and that they are fairly represented in project management and 
executing bodies. 
 
3.2.4 Social: A number of socio-economic impacts are envisaged, including: (i) reduced 
vulnerability to climate and other shocks; (ii) diversification of activities, income generation 
and job creation; (iii) better access to socio-economic services; and (iv) food production 
security. The increased resilience of the population brought about by the new infrastructure 
and techniques will improve the socio-economic situation of the beneficiaries, mainly women. 
Improving the delivery of ecosystem goods and services and building resilience will help 
ensure overall food and nutrition security. 

3.2.5 Inclusive green growth: Within a context of diversified, pro-poor growth in a healthy 
environment that preserves natural resources, the project will promote inclusive growth by 
equitably allocating resources to activities, which will benefit all participating communities at 
all levels. The project will help men, women and young people in rural areas to improve dryland 
productivity on the basis of a sustainable and environmentally-friendly agro-ecological model. 
Improved agro-pastoral techniques, such as rural hydro-agricultural infrastructure and grain 
banks, will also provide opportunities for rural men, women and youth to participate in non-
agricultural activities, thereby improving their livelihoods and reducing vulnerability. 

3.2.6 Involuntary Resettlement: The project activities will not entail any involuntary 
resettlement and land acquisition since they will be implemented within the existing P2RS 
areas in the Kanem and Bahr el Ghazal regions. 

3.3 Project Rationale 

3.3.1 Given the extent of poverty in Chad, there is a tendency to forget that improving the 
exploitation of natural resources can enable the country to use the huge assets at its disposal to 
bring sustainable solutions to the recurrent food and nutrition insecurity that prevails in its 
territory and to the problem of environmental degradation. While the unavailability of arable 
land is an obstacle, it may be resolved by investing in integrated natural resource management 
and strategic actions for resilience. 

3.3.2 The funding being sought is supposed to benefit the inhabitants of the Kanem and 
Bahr el Ghazal regions. The project will have positive socio-economic impacts as well as 
generate many benefits for the biophysical and human environment. The GEF funding will 
contribute to rebuilding Chad's fragile ecosystems by enabling local communities and 
institutions to rehabilitate degraded lands and forests and preserve biodiversity, while building 
resilience and ensuring food and nutrition security.

3.4 Project Objectives and Description 

3.4.1 P2RS, the core project, aims to increase on a sustainable basis agro-sylvo-pastoral and 
fisheries productivity in the Sahel. The GEF project strengthens this core component by adding 
to it substantial environmental benefits and a sustainability dimension. 

The expected outcomes of the financing may be outlined as follows:  

x Improved agricultural, rangeland and pasture production in support of security 
and resilience; 

x Improved agro-pastoral technologies and access to production assets for 
enhanced livelihoods and reduced vulnerability; 

x Improved forest management and/or reforestation to generate sustainable flows 
of agro – and forest ecosystem services; 

x Enhanced integrated landscape planning for habitat resilience and preservation; 

x Enhanced enabling environment through mechanisms for the conservation of 
woody biomass and biodiversity; 

x Lesson learned captured and knowledge disseminated; and 

x  Project impact monitoring and evaluated.    

3.4.2 This multi-focal project contributes directly to GEF Objective LD-1: Maintain or 
improve flow of agroecosystem services to sustain food production and livelihoods. As part of 
this objective, the project contributes to GEF Outcome 1.1 (Improved agricultural, rangeland 
and pasture production in support of security and resilience), Output 1.2 (Improved agro-
pastoral technologies and access to production assets for enhanced livelihoods and reduced 
vulnerability) and Output 1.3 (Improved forest management and/or reforestation generate 
sustainable flows of agro – and forest ecosystem services).   

3.4.3 It also contributes to GEF Objective LD-3 which seeks to: reduce pressures on natural 
resources from competing land uses in the wider landscape, through Outcome 2.1 (Enhanced 
integrated landscape planning for habitat resilience and preservation). 

3.4.4 Under GEF Objective LD-4 (“biodiversity” focal area), which deals with the 
conservation of biodiversity and its sustainable use in marine and terrestrial areas and in sectors 
of economic activity, the project will manage the human-biodiversity interface through 
Outcome 2.2 (Enhanced enabling environment through mechanisms for the conservation of 
land, woody biomass and biodiversity).   

3.4.5 The fourth GEF objective is SFM-2: Enhance forest management: Maintain flows of 
forest ecosystem services and improve resilience to climate change through sustainable forest 
management by means of Outcome 1.3 (Improved forest management and/or reforestation to 
generate sustainable flows of agro – and forest ecosystem services).

4.  IMPLEMENTATION 

4.1 Implementation Arrangements  

4.1.1 The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) that is currently executing the P2RS Project 
will be the same for the proposed project, and no other one will be set up. The PIU will also be 
responsible for implementing the three components of the GEF additional project.  

Due to the interdisciplinary and inter-institutional nature of the project, its Implementation Unit 
will comprise representatives of institutions implementing related agreements, such as those 
involved in rural development support, agricultural production, pastoral systems, food and 
nutrition techniques, and forestry and agricultural research. Representatives of leading 
government institutions in the sectors of agriculture, food security, water, livestock, 
infrastructure, etc., will also be involved.   

4.2 Procurement Procedure 

4.2.1 All procurements of goods, works and consultancy services financed by the Bank's 
resources shall be made in accordance with the Procurement Policy for Operations financed by 
the Bank Group ("Procurement Policy" of AfDB "), October 2015 edition and in accordance 
with the provisions mentioned in the Financing Agreement. In accordance with this policy and 
following the various evaluations conducted, it was agreed that: (a) all the following Goods 
and Works acquisitions: (i) cooking stoves, (ii) goods for micro-projects, (iii) mobiles materials 
and, work on (i) the development of small irrigated areas and ponds, (ii) the construction of 
water points, (ii) the construction of cereal banks, input shops, shops for animal feeding;(ii) the 
rehabilitation of the program’s headquarters will be in accordance with the country's 
procurement system ("National System") embodied by Decree No. 2417 / PR / PM / 2015 of 
December 17th, 2015 on the Public Procurement Code (PPC); (b) the following acquisitions 
(i) all selections of consultants; (ii) community-based contracts; and (iii) the acquisition of the 
Plan Vivo system and standard used for certification of forest products and agroforestry will 
be in accordance with the Bank's procurement system ("System of Procurement" of AfDB ").  

4.2.2 The use of the National System improves efficiency through, inter alia, the following 
actions: (i) better ownership of the procurement system to be used by the executing agency; 
(ii) a saving of time with the absence of a second control (after that of the national entities) that 
represents, the a priori review of the Bank. However, the Bank reserves the right to ask the 
borrower to return to the use of the Bank System if: (a) the legal framework for Chadian public 
procurement changes to evolve into a system unsatisfactory for the Bank; (b) the provisions in 
force were not complied with by the executing agency or (c) the appropriate risk mitigation 
measures included in the Risk Assessment Action Plan were not complied with. . It is indicated 
that the procurements funded by the GEF are subject to respect for the rule of origin. A waiver 
will be asked to have the same rules for the procurements funded by the GEF and the 
procurements funded by the ADF grant already approved. 

4.2.3 Procurement Risk and Capacity Assessment (PRCA): In order to take into account the 
specificities of the project, the Bank assessed: (i) risks at the national, sectoral and project 
levels; and (ii) the capacities of the implementing agencies. The results of these evaluations 
concluded at a Moderate risk level for contracting and determined, subject to the application 
of proposed mitigation measures, the group of acquisitions to be concluded under the Bank's 
system and those acquisitions likely to be implemented, without major risk, according to the 
National System.

4.3 Financial Management and Disbursement Procedures  

4.3.1 Financial Management: This GEF funding integrates the P2RS objectives with more 
substantial environmental benefits and a sustainability dimension. The P2RS Management Unit 
(PMU), set up within the Ministry of Agriculture, will therefore be responsible for 
implementing these activities as well as financial management. It has its own accounting and 
financial administrative procedures manual (it will be updated accordingly). The financial 
management system is composed of an Administrative and Financial Manager (AFM) and an 
Accountant. TOMPRO multi-project accounting software is operational and in use. This 
software allows i) to keep the accounts of several projects at once, ii) to generate the main 
accounting sheets and journal, general ledger and account balance and iii) to prepare the 
consolidated and specific financial statements. The RAF and the Accountant are trained on its 
use. The interim and annual reports produced for the P2RS are satisfactory and show that they 
effectively control the use of the software. The accounting system in place is therefore adequate 
and can produce accurate and reliable information. The GEF complementary financing accounts 
will be integrated into the P2RS accounts with the possibility of disaggregation of expenditures 
by source of financing. This allows for accurate and specific financial information on GEF 
funding. 
 
4.3.2 Audit: The Audit of Accounts, relating to activities financed from GEF resources, will 
be carried out as part of the audit of the P2RS annual accounts. Thus, the consolidated and 
specific accounts for all financings will be audited each year by the same independent external 
audit firm, meeting the required criteria and in accordance with the terms of reference (TOR) 
acceptable to the Bank. The audit report must reach the Bank no later than six months after the 
close of the financial year concerned.  

4.3.3 Disbursement procedure: The project will use the Bank's disbursement methods, 
namely: (i) direct payment, (ii) special account (SA), and (iii) reimbursement methods, in 
accordance with the rules and procedures set out in the Disbursement Handbook. A separate 
foreign exchange special account will be opened for the project with the Central Bank of Chad 
and a local currency account with the same bank, which will be used by the Project 
Implementation Unit to finance operating and other recurrent costs, eligible under the project. 
To facilitate the payment of eligible operating costs, a separate local project sub-account, to be 
managed by the Ministry of Agriculture through the Project Implementation Unit, will be 
opened at a commercial bank acceptable to the Bank, in accordance with existing rules and 
regulations. The management of bank accounts, including the payment of eligible expenses, the 
preparation of requests for the withdrawal of funds from the special account (SA) and the 
documentation of all direct payments, will be subject to the existing procedures within the 
executing body (EB), and placed under the general responsibility of the Director-General of the 
Ministry in charge of Agriculture. The Bank will issue a Disbursement Letter, the content of 
which will be reviewed and agreed upon during the negotiations. 

4.4 Monitoring 

4.4.1 The monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of progress towards achieving project 
outcomes and objectives will be conducted on the basis of the goal and outcome indicators 
identified in the results framework and annual work and budget plans of the project. M&E 
activities will be performed in line with M&E policies and guidelines of the Bank and GEF. 
The day-to-day monitoring of project implementation will be the responsibility of the Project 
Implementation Unit (PIU) and will include the preparation and implementation of annual 
work plans and budgets, and the drafting semi-annual progress reports (SAPRs) of the project.  



 

15 

4.4.2 Specific reports that should be prepared as part of the monitoring and evaluation 
programme are: the project launch report, the annual work plan and budget, project progress 
reports; the annual project implementation review, technical reports, co-financing reports, and 
a completion report. In addition, GEF monitoring tools for the land degradation (LD), 
biodiversity (BD) and sustainable forest management (SFM) focus areas will be updated and 
supplemented by the project team at the mid-term and the final evaluations. 

It is extremely important for the project to use internationally recognized results-based 
monitoring and evaluation frameworks throughout the project implementation process. 
Responsibility for monitoring will rest with the Ministry of Agriculture, which will be 
supported by the Ministry of the Environment. This work will be done in collaboration with 
the Bank and the project team. The information collected through M&E will be taken into 
account in the activities to help to ensure knowledge management, identify and share best 
practices, identify problems and constraints, and promote sustained improvement of the project 
and its contribution to the implementation of national and regional strategies on food security 
and rural development.   

4.4.3 The M&E mechanism will be fine-tuned to ensure that it mainstreams gender issues, 
with special emphasis on the definition of specific parameters for women and young people. 
The parameters to be monitored and evaluated will include, for example, the level of women's 
involvement in decision-making bodies, and the number of young people trained.

4.5 Governance 

4.5.1 In Chad, governance is still a cause for concern in the area of public finance 
management, including public procurement. In addition to using the direct agreement method, 
the procurement process is extremely slow. The existing institutional and organizational 
framework does not function properly due partly to non-compliance with applicable rules and 
procedures and partly to the weak human resource capacity of the entities in charge of this 
process.  

To address these issues, supervision missions, financial and procurement audits will be 
conducted to ensure that the services provided and the works performed are consistent with the 
disbursements made. 



 

16 

4.5.2 Mitigation measures provided to address these issues include: (i) the development of 
a tailored-made financial management procedures manual that will provided the  staff of the 
Project Implementation Unit with programme implementation guidelines; (ii) the use of 
MoFL's internal audit services to conduct project pre-audits; and (iii) the acquisition of serial 
accounting software to capture and process transactions and to interface with IFMIS so as to 
facilitate timely financial reporting, considering the IFMIS-related operational problems; and 
(iv) the implementation of a system of timely submission of the interim quarterly progress 
report (IQPR). 

4.6 Sustainability 

4.6.1 Carrying out activities and building infrastructure that are economically, financially 
and technically viable will enhance the sustainability of project interventions. Sustainability 
factors include: proper sizing and targeting of infrastructure, stakeholder participation and 
ownership (men and women), and beneficiary involvement at all stages of planning and 
implementation, the quality of facilities and equipment, and viable production activities adapted 
to the agro-ecological zone. To ensure post-project sustainability, preference will be given, in 
the conduct of each operation, to reliable and simple but resilient mechanisms, which will 
enhance the scope and coherence of the actions implemented.  

4.6.2 The project aims to build resilience by improving food security and nutrition through 
the enhancement of agro-sylvo-pastoral productivity in drylands. Training in integrated natural 
resource management (INRM), sustainable land and water management (SLWM) and the 
proposed awareness campaigns will provide tools and approaches for maintaining commitment 
and sustainability after the project completion. All stakeholders will be involved in the 
implementation of project activities, including beneficiary communities, to ensure ownership 
and commitment, as well as the viability of improved agro-sylvo-pastoral production 
infrastructure. The project will strengthen the principles of sustainability which lay emphasis 
on the use of a participatory approach during project preparation. This is important as it helps 
to ensure the relevance of the investments and to build institutional capacity at the community 
level in order to guarantee the sustainability of planned activities. The sustainability will be 
achieved by strengthening and consolidating the institutional framework using existing national 
systems. 

4.6.3 The project will lay a great emphasis on building the capacity of beneficiaries and 
strengthening their institutions, such as interest groups, associations or cooperatives. 
Beneficiaries will be mobilized, organized into viable autonomous entities, trained and 
empowered, so they may view their activities as a business rather than a means of survival. 
Awareness and training on gender mainstreaming at the community and local government 
levels will ensure that women and young people continue to participate in and benefit equitably 
from all project activities.    

4.7 Risk Management 

Description Classification Mitigation Measures  

Climate risks, exemplified by the 
recurrent droughts and floods, rainfall 
deficits, extreme heat, which expose the  
country’s natural resources to severe 
degradation. Indicators of this situation 
include land degradation, desertification, 
deterioration of vegetation cover, 
increasingly frequent conflicts between 
farmers and herders, the decimation of 
wildlife, the drying up of Lake Chad and 

2 (moderate) The project’s special emphasis on resilience, for 
example, agricultural practices, crop diversification, 
heat-resistant species, and water management. This will 
gradually reduce the impacts of climate variability. The 
planned project activities will help rural communities to 
better adapt to shocks and improve resilience. 



 

17 

Description Classification Mitigation Measures  

food insecurity. The sectors most 
severely affected by climate risks are 
agriculture, livestock, fisheries, health 
and housing.  
Institutional and organizational 
weaknesses: Exemplified  by 
insufficient coordination between 
governance structures at national, local 
and community levels   

2 (moderate) Strengthen existing structures, particularly those of 
CILSS and national project executing bodies, encourage 
cooperation and communication between the structures 
to allow smooth implementation of the project. 

Agriculture, livestock and fisheries - 
Declining productivity in these sectors 
may impoverish the people and expose 
them to food insecurity. In the 
agricultural sector, for example, fallow-
free cultivation, poor agricultural and 
land-use practices have reduced soil 
fertility, decreased crop yields and led to 
wind/soil erosion. Fishing, on the other 
hand, is threatened by substantial 
desiccation of important water resources, 
attributed to frequent recurring droughts, 
reduced vegetation around watercourses, 
deforestation and overgrazing.  

2 (moderate) Improved crop varieties and hardy livestock, control of 
livestock population levels to ensure that they match the 
carrying capacity; training in improved land-use 
practices; diversification of livelihoods and construction 
of transport infrastructure. 

Conflicts between farmers and 
herders: The project area has been 
identified as a transhumance area, 
although agriculture continues to be 
practised in the wadis. The source of the 
conflict lies mainly in the increasingly 
fierce competition for land and natural 
resources (pasture and water), due to the 
increased frequency of droughts and 
rainfall deficits.  

2 (moderate) Mediation efforts, activities that are tailored to the 
requirements of each group, bearing in mind their 
distinct but closely related realities and needs 
 
 

Conflicts between the project and the 
communities: Poverty and insecurity are 
exacerbated by weak community 
organization, coupled with inefficient 
service delivery, lack of resources and 
weak decision-making powers and 
information facilities. 
 

2 (moderate) Establishment of broad-based consultation mechanisms 
and awareness programmes, including a communication 
plan, development of capacity building/training 
programmes and organization of workshops. 

Environmental impacts - natural 
resources and biodiversity. The P2RS 1 
core project is classified in 
Environmental Category 2 (AfDB 
Environmental and Social Safeguards). 
 

1 (low) Project activities may have negative impacts ranging 
from low to moderate, which should be outweighed by 
the overall environmental benefits  
 
Compliance with Chadian regulations, preparation and 
monitoring of land-use plans, preparation of sub-project 
ESMPs, promotion of agricultural and natural resource 
management best practices 

Health, Nutrition and Hygiene - Risk of 
epidemics, malnutrition and poor hygiene 

2 (moderate) Early warning mechanisms, hygiene programmes, 
improved nutrition programmes, improved and 
increased livelihoods and rural communities assets 

Energy and transportation 
infrastructure facilities - These will 
include irrigation infrastructure, 
boreholes and socio-economic 
infrastructure. These infrastructure 
facilities should minimize the effects of 
extreme droughts and floods  

2 (moderate) Development of climate-resilient energy sources, 
diversification of energy sources, construction of 
climate-resilient infrastructure  

4.8 Knowledge Building  

4.8.1 The project should generate substantial knowledge that will add value to the overall 
design and management of future similar interventions. The lessons and experiences will be 
shared within the Bank and other institutions interested in implementing similar projects, 



 

18 

through project progress reports, audit reports, the mid-term review report and the completion 
report, especially as they will be part of the knowledge transfer and dissemination tools. The 
project will promote community participation and management of agro-sylvo-pastoral 
infrastructure. It will work closely with women's organizations and key stakeholders to ensure 
the sharing of information and learning materials dealing with empowering women and young 
people to build resilience for food and nutrition security. The project will also focus on building 
the capacity of key staff, and the beneficiaries will be fully involved in the implementation of 
planned activities. Exchanges with project beneficiaries will also be an opportunity to acquire 
the valuable knowledge that will be shared. The project will also collaborate with local NGOs 
and community-based organisations (CBOs) to increase their capacity and knowledge so that 
they may be able to continue to carry out sustainable activities for the promotion of food and 
nutrition security. Knowledge-building information will be systematically collected and 
documented in monitoring/evaluation and supervision reports, as well as in the periodic reports 
that will be shared at the Bank.

1. Relevance of program development objective  
 

Rating*  Narrative assessment (max 250 words)  
 

4 The program’s development objective was to contribute to poverty reduction and economic growth 
through enhancing rural incomes and food security. The objective was well aligned to the needs of the 
beneficiaries – where despite a declining trend, 28% of Mainland Tanzanians remain income poor, more 
so in rural areas (33%) than in urban areas (22%).1.  The program’s objective was the mirror image of 
the of the national strategies including the National Strategy for Growth and Reduction of Poverty II 
(NSGRP), and both the 2013 agricultural policy and the Agricultural Sector Development Program II 
(ASDP). 
 
At the regional level, the program’s development objective aligned to several regional development 
strategies to which Tanzania engaged. The program activities of financing rural markets and storage 
facilities were for instance, the mirror image of the EAC’s food security action plan which specifically 
advocates for the construction of agriculture market facilities, feeder roads and storage facilities as well 
as promotion of low-cost technologies on food processing. 
 
The program underwent two Country Strategic Papers (CSP) 2011-2015 and 2016-2020. It was 
embedded in the CSPs’ infrastructure development pillar which considered rural feeder roads as among 
the key supports to local economic development. The program supported the Bank Group’s Agricultural 
Sector Strategy 2010-2014, and the Bank’s framework paper on Post-Harvest (PH) loss reduction. Such 
Bank’s Group policies have prioritised reducing PH loss and investing in market structures, and agro-
processing as among the important enablers for agricultural transformation. See annex 1 for further 
details on the relevance criteria.

Rating*  Narrative assessment (max 250 words)  

 
4 As a multi-sectorial focusing on local areas, the institutional design of the program was appropriately 

opted for the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) as the executing agency.2 The program formulation was 
participatory3, and identified geographical areas and clustered projects to maximize expected 
outcomes. Several lessons from the previous Agricultural Marketing Systems Development Program 
(AMSDP) informed the program formulation including better provision for the design of rural roads 
(civil, geodetic/geomatics and geotechnical engineering) and the need for putting in place a well-
designed and robust Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) system. The program activities were clustered 
such that investments in warehouses, roads and markets complemented each other.    
 
The program design allowed the district authorities4 to compete for resources based on a set of 
eligibility criteria. To ensure full functioning of the market structures, the design financed service 
infrastructures such as cold-storage facilities located within the rehabilitated markets. To enhance 
sustainability of the program’s investments, the design included capacity development sessions to 
Government staff and beneficiary communities to plan for, implement and manage market/storage 
facilities. The support to the rural economy was also a gender sensitive approach to rural development 
as it is estimated that 84% of Tanzanian women are employed in agriculture, against 80% for men.

1. 
Institutional 
design of the 
program. 

The support from the PMO, regional and district authorities (the latter two authorities 
were under the PMO during much of the program implementation time) helped to 
address challenges that risked delaying the delivery of the program’s expected 
outputs. An example is the Government interventions when contractors abandoned 
sites – interventions that allowed completion of construction activities. Lessons: 1) 
Multi sectorial programs need to be hosted within authorities higher than sectorial 
ministries 2) It is even more important for program that devolve implementation to 
local levels to be hosted within an authority managing district and regional 
administrations.

2. Continuity For continuity purpose and transfer of good lessons to the new program, the program 
team was composed of experienced personnel from the previous two programs of 
AMSDP and RFSP. They joined the program with experiences in delivering 
infrastructure development in rural areas, capacity building and networking capacities 
with local authorities.  Lessons: Succession of capacities needs to be prioritised for any 
potential successor to MIVARF.

3. 
Prerequisite
s for the 
matching 
grants 

The program design introduced several prerequisites to be met by potential 
beneficiaries of the matching grants scheme. However, some of the matching grant 
beneficiaries struggled to meet the prerequisites (qualified buildings, electricity 
connection, working capital) and lacked experience on their planned business lines. 
Lessons: Design of agro-processing machinery support needs to include a well-
resourced component on business support to beneficiaries (e.g. skills transfer, 
business advices, certifications etc.)

4.  
Geographica
l coverage. 

Because of the widely scattered villages the Bank’s resources were thinly spread with 
the program team covering vast distances during supervision. The 32 program’s 
districts spread across 16 regions had a combined population of about 6.1 million (1.2 
million households). Despite the challenge on the coverage, the program functioned 
successfully because of effective communication with program’s liaison officers at the 
district/regional level and good liaising with the political and administrative 
structures at such levels. Lessons: Dispersion of resources across many projects, wide 
geographic areas and/or too many institutions/districts need to be avoided. Future 
Bank’s rural development programs need to concentrate in fewer places for more 
impactful outcome.

5. Contract 
management 

Limited contract management capacities by some districts resulted into incidences 
under-designing, and contract variations which increased cost to accommodate design 
components not included earlier on. Also, the quality for some of the complicated 
structures could have been improved if districts had requested additional technical 
support. Such challenges were mitigated by the Bank and the Government exercising 
flexibility to accommodate some of the additional costs. In addition, the program team 
backstopped districts lagging behind in implementation. Lessons: 1) to avoid delayed 
no-objection turnaround and contract variations, ensure that all factors affecting 
implementation are considered when establishing contract duration 2) backstopping 
and additional capacity building to weak districts is unavoidable 3) encourage local 
authorities to use own resources in seeking third party opinion on complex designs 
(e.g. bridges design etc); and 4) intensify supervision, and contractors should be made 
liable for faults before the defect liability period lapses.

B: Effectiveness 

 
1. Progress towards the program’s development objective (program purpose) 

 
Comments 
Provide a brief description of the Program (components) and the context in which it was designed and implemented. 
State the program development objective (usually the program purpose as set out in the RLF) and assess progress. 
Unanticipated outcomes should also be accounted for, as well as specific reference of gender equality in the program. 
The consistency of the assumptions that link the different levels of the results chain in the RLF should also be 
considered.  Indicative max length: 400 words. 
The overall development objective was to contribute to poverty reduction and accelerated economic growth 
through enhanced rural incomes and food security. The program planned to contribute to the Government efforts 
in raising rural incomes and food security through improved market access (feeder roads, market centres and 
linkages, and storage facilities), and increased value-added agricultural produce (through training and matching 
grants equipment). The program which was designed to upscale successful activities implemented under the 
former Bank’s and IFAD’s AMSDP and RFSP5 was made up of three components 1) Marketing infrastructure and 
systems development 2) Rural finance; and 3) Program coordination. The implicit assumptions that linked different 
levels of the results chain were consistent and remained valid to date. For instance, the program’s investments in 
rural infrastructures, in particular rural feeder roads, storage facilities and markets were expected to improve 
access to agricultural markets for small holders, reduce PH losses, all of which were expected to contribute to 
poverty reduction through enhanced rural income and food security. 
 
The program’s 2017 outcome study confirmed the advances made towards the development objective of poverty 
reduction through enhancing rural income. About 78% of program’s beneficiaries in the surveyed program’s wards 
acknowledged increased monthly household income from TSh 95,194 in 2012 to TSh 307,696 in 2017. Surveyed 
beneficiaries attributed such positive income changes to the program interventions of market linkages, utilization 
of program’s warehouses that had reduced PH losses, reduction in transport costs, capacity building and equipment 
support. The program’s support to market linkages, for instance, has expanded markets for program’s beneficiaries, 
as confirmed by 40% of the surveyed wards which reported to have experienced improved market linkages to local 
and out of region markets. The PCR mission also met producers who have experienced increased access to export 
markets for processed breadfruit (producers in Pemba), and onions to Kenya and Uganda (producers in Karatu). 
The advances made on the development objectives of the program were gender sensitive as demonstrated by data 
presented in section B.5. The program also had gender perspective. For instance, through PEML, the program’s 
equally empowering men and women in group’s leadership. In addition, the Program’s infrastructures, such as the 
cold rooms’ in the Mombasa market in Zanzibar largely benefited women (About 50% of traders in that market are 
women).

The program’s outcome study attributes most of the advances towards the program’s development 
objectives to the program’s interventions. Program’s warehouses have improved the overall 
marketing of crops through improved quality management of the agricultural produce, which in turn 
has reduced PH losses and extended marketing period. Extended marketing periods, for instance, 
facilitated farmer’s access to better prices and ultimately improved incomes (annex 5). The 
program’s rehabilitated roads have largely improved market access to distanced farmers as well as 
the improved volumes of crops reaching the markets and warehouses. In addition, transport charges 
and time have been on the decline, an outcome of roads improvement. The rehabilitated rural roads 
have also improved the supply of agricultural inputs (annex 6) which in turn has raised farm 
productivity. In some of the improved program roads, the time to reach markets declined from 3hrs 
to just 1hr. Farmers along the rehabilitated Mapogolo-Mbalino road in Mbarali district, for example, 
used to sell a bucket of paddy for Tsh 5,000 before the road was rehabilitated. The same bucket now 
fetches Tsh 10,000 after road improvement – simply because farmers can now easily take their 
produce to the market rather than selling to buyers who used to collect directly from individual 
farmers. New farming fields have also emerged because of the improved access to markets. An 
example is the paddy field in one of the wards along the Mwapogolo-Mbalino road in Mbarali which 
has expanded from 2,300 acres to 3,700 acres.  
 
Trainings in value addition, and the matching grant equipment have enhanced value addition and 
ultimately reduced PH losses. The program’s outcome study reports that the overall mean for the 
value-added produce in the surveyed program’s wards per season was 849 tonnes ranging from a 
minimum of 6.25 tonnes (in Isandula ward) to a maximum of 4,750 tonnes (in Dakawa ward). 
Through PEML, farmer producer and marketing groups have expanded in numbers and membership. 
Working in groups has enhanced farmers negotiations for better prices, market search including 
links to potential traders and off-takers. Working in groups did also improved farmer enabling 
environment by advancing the use of weighing scales and other measuring facilities (confirmed by 
60% of the surveyed farmers groups). Prior to program support farmers used to rely on volumes.  
 
The advances made on the program’s development objectives are attributed to many factors. They 
included: 1) rigorous backstopping to district staff 2) reliability of   Bank’s financial resources 3) 
flexibility of the Bank, the Government, and the program to take into account field realities 4) close 
supervision and reporting the program, the Government and the Bank 5) capacity development 
efforts 6) participatory approaches e.g. when selecting program sites (that considered the 
dimensions of value chains, presence of complementing interventions such as rural markets) 7) 
agriculture potentiality of the program areas 8) reviews of scope, available resources, and timelines 
of program’s activities to reflect actual situation 9) high level of awareness and relatively good sense 
of ownership of the program by local authorities and commmunities 10) close working relationship 
with partners including the private sector 11) competition for resources between districts has 
allowed the program to invest in best proposals thus ensuring value for money.

The overall physical implementation of the program is highly satisfactory as the program’s outputs were 
136% achieved (36% above targets). With regards to poverty reduction and food security, significant 
achievements were made reported to have increased 8-fold (in nominal terms) from Tsh 95,194 in 2012 
to Tsh 307,696 in 2017 (in nominal terms) (section B.2). Indirect benefits from the program’s markets 
increased farmers increased awareness of prices, and increased productivity that has largely contributed 
to the increased household income. An example is the increased productivity of onions in Karatu from an 
average of 30 sacks to 50 and 70 sacks.  Nevertheless, the markets have made it easier for traders to buy 
onions from the homes of individual farmers. The number of sellers and buyers have significantly increased 
after the commissioning of the new markets. At Kinyasini market (Unguja), the number of sellers increased 
from 150 (pre-program) to 350 (post-program). It is also worth mentioning that the structures of some of 
the program’s markets have been constructed with excess capacity to cater for possible future expansion 
(e.g. additional storeys).

Rehabilitated roads have contributed to the observed progress on the income side (see the discussion in 
section B.1 and B.2). For example, program beneficiaries testified that the roads have largely improved the 
volumes of crops reaching intended markets. Specifically, the volumes of crops reaching the crop markets 
as a result of improved rural roads increased from an overall mean of 230.5 tonnes to 808.6 tonnes per 
season.

(High,

Private sector has taken advantage of business opportunities created by the 
program’s infrastructures. An example is the livestock market in Longido where 
a private investor is currently constructing an abattoir with a daily capacity of 
processing 2,000 goats. The investment will further raise the volume of animals 
being traded in the market.  
 

Business Positive  High 

Ownership disputes of markets, e.g. the Longido livestock market where the 
ownership has moved from the district council to the Ministry of Livestock.  There 
were also few incidences of ownership disputes of the matching grant equipment 
- between farmers groups who contributed the 25% and LGAs who claimed to 
own the facilities (claiming the 75% came from the Bank’s loan as a public fund).  
 

Governance Negative Low 

Increased property values along the program’s rehabilitated roads. For example, 
a 400 square meters piece of land along the rehabilitated Karansi Tanki la Maji 
road in Siha district now fetches Tsh 4 million from Tsh 1 million pre-
rehabilitation.  In rural Tanzania, land constitutes 70-80% of asset endowment; 
and it is key to household wealth. In addition to rising property prices, 
Government investment in securing property rights will be a step toward further 
reduction in rural poverty. 
 

Business Positive  Medium  

Cooling chambers that were intended for fruit and vegetables have been utilised 
for other produce as well. An example is the use of the chambers to store ‘Mbege’, 
a traditional brew of the Chagga ethnic group in Kilimanjaro region. The brew is 
made up of ripe bananas and sprouted millet. 
 

Business Positive Medium 

Disputes on the user fees between district authorities and traders who have 
rented stalls inside the markets. The program advised the markets management 
committee and the district authorities to meet and reach an amicable solution.

Lessons learned Target 
audience 

1. Matching 
grant scheme 

Matching grant scheme was relatively new to both LGAs and potential beneficiaries. It took 
almost three years of awareness campaigns before credible applications could be received. 
Late implementation was an outcome of potential beneficiaries delayed application waiting 
to see what happens to early adopters. Also, most equipment had to be sourced from 
abroad. Despite being a learning platform, the intervention was a success as some of the 
cooperatives went as far as taking loans to finance their 25% contribution. Lessons: 1) 
Matching grants scheme is a time-consuming initiative requiring resources and time for 
awareness raising, capacity building and attitudinal change 2) Program coordination teams 
need to assist producers to identify appropriate technology and the scale of operation; and 
3) Early adopters motivate others to join in and commit the 25% contribution.

2. Sequencing 
of the 
interventions 

Few incidences of non-preparedness of communities to assume fully responsibility of the 
constructed infrastructure. One of the reasons behind such difficulties was the delayed 
efforts from the other donors in forming beneficiary groups at the time construction was 
well advanced. The program sustained its efforts to deliver training to the management 
committees – with an expectation that the district authorities will take over such 
responsibilities post program. Lessons: For effective operation of the infrastructure, 
awareness creation and capacity building of stakeholders need to precede construction and 
rehabilitation works.

3. 
Procurement 
rules 

One of the reasons for varying procurement capacities across districts was the staff 
turnover. The program engaged the new staff to be conversant with the Bank’s procurement 
rules through repeated trainings. Such interventions were inclusive and ensured that even 
if staff leaves the LGAs those remaining are well familiar with the program’s guidelines. 
Lessons: Training on Bank’s procurement rules to LGA is not a one-off activity. Continued 
effort is highly encouraged to get district staff well informed with guidelines.

The loan agreement was signed in September 201114, with the program taking effects in March 2012. The program was 
initially expected to be conclude by December 2016 but was extended to 30 th September 2018. The extension was 
necessary for a number of reasons - as follows. The program was a complex infrastructural based intervention with 
several construction contracts and demanding engineering designs, and procurement. Some of the projects were new at 
the local level (e.g. cold rooms whose design component had to be outsourced). Nevertheless, the identification of 
potential program’s districts was a time-consuming exercise that could have been avoided if the districts were identified 
prior to loan application. Like in many other development programs, contract management at the lower level was a 
challenge which led to variations due to additional works that were left out at the design phase.  
 
Other reasons for the time overruns included: el Niño rains, community indecision on site selections, disputes between 
contractors, communities on areas to extract construction materials, delayed legal opinion on the draft loan agreement, 
the delayed disbursement of 5% counterpart fund, and the prolonged consultations with authorities in Zanzibar on the 
choices of procurement methods for works contracts. To accelerate implementation, the program intensified follow ups; 
terminated grossly underperformed contracts; reviewed workplans to address implementation gaps; and, gave special 
attention on procurements for some infrastructural designs immediately after delays were noted. The PMO was also 
helpful in resolving delays in the release of the counterpart funds from the program’s districts.

The program was financed by the Bank, IFAD, counterpart funding from beneficiary districts and in-kind contribution 
from communities. The Bank and the counterpart contributions financed the marketing infrastructure development and 
value addition aspects of the program’s Component 1 and part of Component 3; whereas IFAD resources financed the 
producer empowerment and market linkages activities of Component 1, all of Component 2 and part of Component 3 
(see the description of the components in section B.1). By the time of mission visit, the disbursement rates were as 
follows: The Bank (91%); IFAD (72%); and the counterpart LGA funding (77.9%). In absolute numbers, as of 30th 
November 2018, the Bank had disbursed UA 36,635,956.25; counterpart LGA funding USD 1.12million (UA 0.80 million) 
and IFAD USD 65.0 Million (46.43 million). All making a total spending at UA 83.87 million. 
 
Taking into account ground realities and other factors (e.g. rising contraction costs), the program’s targets in the result 
framework were revised at the MTR. For example, the target for rehabilitating rural roads was scaled down from the 
initial 1,550 km to 1,000 km due to escalating costs. Per unit cost of rehabilitation increased from US$ 19,500 estimated 
at the appraisal to about US$ 35,000. The construction target for the agricultural markets was also scaled down from 32 
(at appraisal) to 16 because of 1) increased per unit cost of rehabilitation from US$ 200,000 estimated at appraisal to 
US$ 450,000; and 2) decreased demand from districts. Despite the program delivered less outputs set at the approval, 
at the program end, the targets set for the output indicators at the MTR were achieved by an average of 136%. The 
computation of the resource use efficiency was based on the targets revised at the MTR.

Narrative assessment (indicative max length: 250 words) 
The cost benefit analysis is rated highly satisfactory as the ERR at the program end is higher than the ERR at the 
appraisal stage (31% versus 22%). This is despite the downward revision of some of the output targets during the 
Mid-Term Review (MTR). The economic analysis has been undertaken over a 20-year span in line with the projected 
economic life of the program. The analysis is on an estimation of program-wide benefits from 1) investments in rural 
roads and market infrastructure 2) incremental incomes resulting from increases in value of commodity sales; and 3) 
equipment support for value addition (see the key assumptions in annex 10). The EIRR computation is provided in 
annex 10.1. Sensitivity analysis shows the program is more sensitive to changes in benefits than costs. For instance, a 
20% increase in costs results into only 3.1%and 8% reduction in NPV and ERR respectively from the base scenario. A 
similar percentage decrease in benefits leads to 23.1% and 9% reduction in NPV and ERR respectively (ann ex 10.2). 
However, none of such changes has a dramatic impact on the NPV and ERR i.e. pushing the NPV towards zero. Given 
the consistent positive net benefits and ERR from the sensitivity analysis, and the difficulties in quantifying socio-
economic benefits (e.g. from the newly constructed/rehabilitated roads), the program has more benefits than what the 
NPV and EIRR figures suggest.

4 The latest IPR is dated May 2018. The IPR concluded that the overall physical implementation of the 
program was satisfactory bar intervention on bankable proposals for value addition which had 
physical implementation of only 74%. At the time of the IPR (May 2018), a total of 37 bankable 
proposals out of the planned 50 had been prepared, out of which, 19 proposals were funded by the  
program’s matching grant scheme, 7 remained eligible for the matching grant, with 10 proposals 
forwarded to the rural finance component for funding by Microfinance Institutions (MFI). 
 
By the end of the program the number of bankable proposals for value addition surpassed the target 
by 6% (106% achievement rate). As discussed in section A.3, the challenge with the matching grant 
component was the overstretched and limited financial capacity of some beneficiaries, as well as the 
tendency of some of potential beneficiaries to wait and observe what the early adopters would

experience. Despite such challenges, the matching grant scheme was a success, not only because it 
surpassed its targets but also because even financially constrained beneficiaries managed to borrow 
from financial institutions and meet the 25% criteria. As discussed in section B.7, the key lessons 
from delivering the matching grant scheme included the need for extensive awareness and capacity 
development of the processor groups in agro-processing technology to stimulate demand for such 
grants. Programs should also assist groups in identifying appropriate technology, as well as scale of 
their operations to enable the groups to afford 25% contribution.

1. 
Maintenance

under the 
matching 
grants  

Most of the matching grant beneficiaries experienced positive outcomes (e.g. increased 
productivity) with the support they received from the program. Experiences gained 
from supporting processors to secure equipment included the risks for beneficiaries to 
order equipment that are too advanced to their environment; and the need for rigorous 
after-sale maintenance support from suppliers. Lesson: Programs need to be well 
resourced to support verification and selection of delivered equipment (such capacities 
are lacking at the local level).

2. Beneficiary 
contributions. 

The 5% beneficiary contribution for infrastructure programs (markets and warehouse) 
and 25% beneficiary contribution for the matching grant equipment was a challenging 
experience to some communities and local authorities. Delays in contributions from 
some of the program’s districts was among the main reasons for the delayed 
implementation of planned infrastructures. Rather than waiting for the districts to 
advance the 5% contribution, the program proceeded with procuring works contracts 
with districts allowed to advance partial payments. Lessons: 1) Capacity to meet 
counterpart contribution differed between local authorities because of differences in 
endowments 2) Context and nature of the interventions (or technologies to be acquired) 
should guide the choice of cash or in-kind contribution 3) Continuous follow up on 
districts to ensure that they meet their financial obligations including seeking support 
from higher authorities 4) mandatory contribution (matching grants) risks to deflect 
interventions from the targeted poor to the better-off.

3. Group size The program experience shows that the small sized farmers groups are performing 
relatively better than large groups. Among the areas that separate the two groups, is the 
fact that the large groups are characterised by large sized committees which raises 
group management costs. Differences in members objectives, free riding and 
opportunistic behaviours is more prevalent with large groups. Lessons: Encourage and 
advocate for small sized farmer organisations as operators of program infrastructures.

4. Technology Some of the program’s storage facilities were installed with advanced technology (e.g. 
cold rooms, processing machineries) that were very new to most local authorities. As 
such, some local authorities struggled not only to be actively involvement in engineering 
designs but also on best practices when it comes to management and operation of such 
facilities. The latter challenge (engineering designs) was addressed by outsourcing 
designs to experienced entities. Lesson: Complementary TA is necessary to support and 
guide district authorities to establish ideal management and operationalisation models 
for the infrastructures. Overall, the infrastructure interventions need to be accompanied 
by intensive business support taking into account all aspects that would, for instance, 
advances the facilities as profitable business ventures.

5. Co-
financing 
arrangements 
and risks. 

The PAR identified IFAD and AGRA as co-financers of the program. However, only the 
Bank and IFAD proceeded with its co-financing commitment. Commonly to most co-
financing arrangements, co-financers have their own procedures and ways of doing 
business which at times affect the pace of implementation, timelines for supervision 
missions and synchronization of components from different financers. A case in point 
was the mismatch in pace between the Bank’s infrastructure component (‘the 
hardware’) and IFAD’s capacity building component (‘the software’) component. 
Consultations between co-financers helped in avoiding serious misalignments. Lessons: 
1) Flexibility by the Government and/or the Bank in stepping in when potential co-
financers do not fulfil their commitment 2) regular consultations to avoid serious 
misalignment between components being targeted by co-financers 3) Government is an 
important mediator when delays from one co-financer affects the delivery of 
components of the other co-financers.

D:  Sustainability 

 

1.0 Financial sustainability 
 

Rating* Narrative assessment (indicative max length: 250 words) 
 

4 To enhance sustainability, one of the key criteria to initiate program activities was the commercial prospects 
of projects to be financed by the program. To complement such efforts, the program linked the agro-processing 
to the marketing dimensions and access to financial services as well as investing in rehabilitating roads that 
linked beneficiary communities to the pre-existing and program’s rehabilitated markets and warehouses. Of 
recent, the Government has established TARURA, an agency that is tasked to oversee O&M of all rural roads 
including the ones rehabilitated by the program. Such institutional reform raises the likelihood that the 
program investments in rural roads will be sustained.  
 
Strong evidences of potential financial sustainability of the program investment are emerging. The revenue 
collected by the Longido district rose by 300% after the the launch of the program’s livestock market. In fact, 
the district was able to meet its 5% counterpart contribution from the revenue collected from the market. One 
of the program’s market in Zanzibar (Kinyasini market) which used to collect Tsh 1.5million pre-program, 
now collects an average of Tsh 7million – after the new market structure was launched. The milk processor in 
Zanzibar which obtained processing equipment from the program matching scheme used to sell a 175ml cup 
of yogurt for Tsh 500. They are currently fetching Tsh 1,000 for the same due to improved quality. 16 The 
business is now able to price compete with larger processors.  
 
Financial sustainability is also highly likely as some of the program’s markets have introduced additional 
revenue opportunities. The onion market in Karatu, for example, is collecting Tsh 5,000 from each truck 
collecting onions from the villages. Between July-November 2018, more than 1,950 trucks have paid the fee. 
The number of buyers and trucks coming to the market are on the rise due to the program’s rehabilitated 
roads going to the mentioned market. Serve the need for continuous support in strengthening business 
practices in managing the program’s markets and warehouses, revenues being generated from these 
infrastructures currently cover the operating costs.   

 
2.0 Institutional sustainability and strengthening of capacities 
 

Rating* Narrative assessment (indicative max length: 250 words) 
 

4 The program’s effort in training management committees that foresaw the developed infrastructures was an 
important step to reinforce sustainability of the program interventions and ensuring continued use of the 
program’s roads, markets and warehouses. Other training beneficiaries included regional and district personnel 
from program’s region and districts (engineers, procurement, to environmental officers). In addition to the 
provision of training to the beneficiaries and staff the program was well integrated into government 
institutional structure to ensure ownership and sustainability (e.g. implemented by the PMO office with the 
infrastructural assets owned by the local authorities). The field interview shows that 66.7% of the surveyed 
wards have committees in place to ensure continued maintenance of the infrastructures. Moreover, about 
70.4%of the wards confirmed that the committees have a role to set penalties for improper use of the program’s 
infrastructures. Other roles given to the committees included security for the facilities, budgeting, records and 
controlling income from the facilities. In some wards, the committees were given the role of training other 
community members on the proper use of the program’s infrastructures.  
 
The good experiences on maintaining and managing program’s infrastructures from the exemplary districts 
(e.g. Siha district from Kilimanjaro region) have been shared to other districts through workshops and 
documentation for future guidance. Through PEML, the number of farmer producer groups and farmer 
marketing groups have expanded including membership with the groups equally empowering men and women 
in group’s leadership. Working in groups has enhanced producers’ empowerment in price negotiations, market 
search and linkages to potential traders and off-takers. The program also released more than six instruction 
manuals on PH handling of perishables.17

3.0 Ownership and sustainability of partnerships 
 

Rating* Narrative assessment (indicative max length: 250 words) 
 

4 To raise the sense of ownership, groups the received matching grants for agro-processing equipment 
contributed 25% of the cost of buying equipment. Beneficiary districts also remitted 5% cash contributions 
for the market and warehouse facilities. Sustainability of these facilities is also highly likely as the maintenance 
and repairing of some of the equipment are currently fully financed by the beneficiary groups. The same with 
the roads. For example, the Government has invested in upgrading the program’s constructed Mkanyageni-
Kangagani (4.5km) feeder road in Pemba by adding one more layer of gravel. Beneficiaries districts have 
invested additional facilities after taking over the program’s infrastructures. For example, the district 
authority managing the Tibirinzi market in Pemba has installed 100 additional stalls in addition to 82 
program’s installed stalls.   
 
To optimise benefits from the program financed markets, district authorities, Longido for example, is 
consulting the Ministry of Livestock to connect the market to the ministry’s livestock marketing information 
system. District authorities in collaboration with beneficiary communities have also enacted bylaws to enforce 
sustainable use of the rehabilitated roads. In Siha district, for instance, a fine of Tsh 200,000 is imposed on 
livestock crossing the newly rehabilitated roads. Despite the district authorities owning the infrastructures, it 
is the beneficiaries’ committees which are tasked to operate the markets and storage facilities. The 
sustainability of such partnerships is highly likely given the management training that the program delivered 
to both parties. However, further clarification is necessary with regards to ownership, operational costs and 
revenue for some of the facilities.  

 
4.0 Environmental and social sustainability 
 

Rating* Narrative assessment (indicative max length: 250 words) 
 

4 Environmental sustainability: The program developed the Environmental and Social Management Plans 
(ESMP) describing measures to mitigate impacts during the construction works. In addition, training was 
delivered to all district environmental officers focusing on EMSP planning, monitoring and reporting. In 
collaboration with the National Environmental Management Council (NEMC), an environmental checklist for 
monitoring rural marketing infrastructure programs was developed and shared to all participating districts. 
Other efforts which have positive impacts on environmental sustainability included: 1) sensitized 
communities to undertake responsible farming along the road alignments as a way of minimising damage to 
the constructed roads 2) provision of adequate drainage; mitre drains and cross drainages structures 3)  
enhanced capacities of communities close to constructed roads in enforcing bylaws  
 
Social sustainability: The program ensured that alignments of the new roads limit any involuntary 
resettlement of communities. Safety signs have been erected along the program’s rehabilitated roads (e.g. 
speed limit signs) – with the police force training motor cyclists to observe rules. The program team and 
district personnel were also sensitised on gender mainstreaming. By February 2015, 25% of the 1,094 
community members who attended training on operation and maintenance of rural infrastructure were 
women. Moreover, some of the cooperatives that benefited from the matching grant scheme are largely 
dominated by women. The Muwanda cooperative creameries, for example, is composed of 8 female members 
and 4 male members. These benefits will positively impact the lives of women who account for a significant

1. Utilization 
of storage 
structures 
 

Some of the community-operated warehouses were not utilized to the same extent as 
the privately-owned warehouses. The private owned warehouses have incorporated 
broader agricultural value chain activities e.g. paddy and sunflower processing etc. 
Lessons: 1) Need for increased awareness to the beneficiary communities that the 
program support (e.g. warehouse) is just a motivation to trigger their own efforts to 
invest in broader agricultural value chain activities (e.g. agro-processing) 2) capacity 
of stakeholders to implement additional agricultural value chain activities needs to be 
enhanced and synchronised with infrastructure development.

2. Access to 
standards and 
quality 
certifications 

Access to standards certification has been a time-consuming exercise for small 
processors – and of a high transaction cost given their small-scale operations. To 
address this challenge, the program established important contacts with the 
authorities to provide advisory services to processors in addition to inspection, and 
testing towards supporting their applications for certificates. Lessons: Support to 
processors to access standards and quality certification needs to be highly prioritised 
and be considered that is resource demanding similar to other program activities.

3. Access to 
standards 
certifications 

As part of their contractual obligations, equipment suppliers delivered trainings to the 
matching grant beneficiaries. However, few processors enrolled only a single member 
in such trainings, limiting the spread of knowledge on expertise to maintain the 
equipment in case of breakdown.  Lessons: Encourage beneficiary groups to enrol 
more than one group member in the O&M training sessions.  

The Bank, 
beneficiaries.  

4. Market 
disruptions 

In some of the areas that the program invested new markets, traders and middlemen 
are exploiting farmers by directly collecting agricultural produce from homes. Efforts 
from district authorities are well acknowledged to have restored order to some extent. 
Nevertheless, the markets were new experiences in some of the program areas, and as 
a result some farmers tended to ‘wait and see’ before engaging with the markets. 
Lesson: Government intervention is necessary to ensure that the operations of the 
markets are not interrupted by opportunistic behaviours of traders and middlemen.

4 The program was supervised bi-annually making a total of 14 supervision missions between 2012 and 

2018. The Bank’s missions were diversified in expertise by including financial, procurement and 
disbursement personnel as well as agricultural specialists. Keeping in view the infrastructures involved 
in the program, the Bank’s supervision team was also supported by an engineer. The supervision missions 
assisted the program and the executive agency to address managerial and technical aspects that impeded 
implementation. With more decision-making power devolved to field offices, the COTZ18, using both 
formal and informal means, closely monitored implementation and took prompt actions to resolve 
challenges. An example is the Bank’s interventions to restore the program’s coordinator in Zanzibar and 
the Bank’s procurement rules for works contracts.   
 
The Bank’s country office was involved, either through the supervision missions or outside such missions, 
to actively engage with the Government and co-financers in discussing progress and resolve 
implementation challenges. The MTR19 was carried out in June 2015 and helped to identify challenges and 
way forward including revising some of the program end-targets. The Bank also encouraged the program 
to undertake an internal PCR, a document that offered inputs to the Bank’s own PCR. The Bank also 
encouraged and motivated the program team to intensify monitoring, supervision and follow-up to ensure 
that all infrastructures were completed on time and are fully utilised by the intended beneficiaries.

Comments to be inserted by the Bank on its own performance (both quantitative and qualitative). See guidance note on 
issues to cover. (indicative max length: 250 words) 
The Bank provided close and extensive program review missions throughout the period of the programme. Since 
inception, the Bank supervised the program 14 times including the MTR.  All the Bank’s missions aided the programme to 
address managerial and technical aspects that greatly helped to expedite implementation.  In all the supervision missions, 
field supervisions were conducted followed by an analysis and discussion of observations including debriefing sessions 
held with the GoT officials and selected members of the steering committee, whose details and strategies for improving 
the program were presented in the aide memoirs of the missions. Where necessary, the Bank supported and aided re-
allocations of funds to GoT’s preferred areas of greater interests. The intensified Bank supervision towards the final stages 
of the program accelerated implementation and helping in the improvement of revised work schedules and activities 
which turned around the slow pace of implementation experienced initially. 
Key issues (related to Bank performance, max 5, add rows as needed) Lessons learned 
1. Future Bank’s supervision missions should maintain diversified 
personnel as appropriate with the aim of facilitating effective 
interactions and advices on various aspects related to program 
implementation.  

Maintain a team of diversified Bank experts in 
supervision missions as appropriate. 

2. In-kind contribution from beneficiaries were not monetised. To avoid 
understating counterpart contribution, the Bank can introduce a model 
were supervision and other costs incurred by beneficiary Governments 
are quantified, documented and ultimately included as part of the 
counterpart contributions.  

Introduce a model were counterpart in-kind 
contributions are monetised and 
acknowledged.  
 

3. Programs that support access to productive assets (equipment and 
infrastructures) need to invest heavily on business coaching to 
reinforce business mindsets and acumen on beneficiaries.  

Upgrade support to business coaching in 
programs that support access to productive 
assets.

4 Both the central and local authorities worked closely with the program during implementation. Senior 
officials from the relevant Government ministries constituted the PSC providing an enabling environment in 
terms of policy guidelines and staff. The same with the regional secretariat and LGAs (regional engineers, 
district engineers, agriculture and irrigation and cooperative officer etc) who facilitated implementation in 
terms of designing, procurement, supervision and management. The Ministry of Finance (MoF) was very 
active in negotiating the loan and also in meeting the covenants for the effectiveness of the loan. With regards 
to counterpart contributions, the Government provided the required cash contribution in meeting the 
payroll requirements of the staff serving the program. Despite the delays, the Government supported the 
program in ensuring that districts honoured their counterpart funding obligations as well as ensuring that 
periodic roads maintenance are carried out adequately. A vivid example for the latter is the financing of 
additional culverts along the program’s Mwapogolo-Mbarino road. The culverts protected the road from 
being washed away by water streams, while the culverts also allowed farmers to tap the water flow for 
irrigation. District authorities also closely enforced bylaws that aimed at efficient use of the market 
infrastructures. An example is the introduction of permits for trucks collecting onions in Karatu, a move that 
advanced the use of the program’s market, and district’s awareness of the number of traders operating in 
the area.  

Key issues (related to Borrower performance, max 5, add rows as needed) Lessons learned 
The central Government assisted in following up and reminding districts 
to remit counterpart funds. The efforts paid off as of April 2018, the 
program had collected Tsh 1.8 billion (76.1% out of the total planned 
counterpart contributions from the program districts). 

Timely submission of counterpart funds 
necessitates close follow up from local and 
central Government, and the program team. 

The program’s objectives and logical flow from outputs to outcomes and 
impact remain relevant. It is high likely that the program’s benefits will be 
sustained provided that the Government continue to capacitate 
communities and committing resources to maintain the rehabilitated 
roads and other program’s infrastructures.  

Continuous post-program Government 
follow up and support is necessary to 
sustain the program’s investments and 
benefits.  

Overall, the program team was found to prepare good quality progress 
reports and was up to date on the submission of periodic plans and annual 
external audit reports. Most program staff received relevant training in 
their respective fields such as program management; procurement; 
contract management; monitoring and evaluation, and Training of 
Trainers (ToT). 

A strong and well-resourced program team 
is necessary particularly for a complex and 
geographically wide spread program.

3.0 Performance of other stakeholders 
 

Rating* Narrative assessment on the performance of other stakeholders, including co-financiers, contractors 
and service providers. See guidance note on issues to cover. (indicative max length: 250 words) 

3 Generally, the performance of contractors was good, serve for some isolated cases of low quality of 
works and engineering designs. To enhance quality delivery of infrastructure assets, the program team 
in collaboration with beneficiary districts and communities intensified supervision, and whenever 
faults were noted, the responsible contractors were made liable before the defect liability period lapses. 
Continued developing the capacity of the district teams, as well as possibility of seeking third party 
opinion for complex design issues e.g. designing of the bridges, is a lesson for future programs. Other 
institutions such as SIDO and the Tanzania Electrical, Mechanical and Electronics Services Agency 
(TAMESA) had good collaborations with the program’s districts, especially when they were requested 
to repair processing equipment that were financed by the program.

(for lessons learned) 

Service providers were capacitated and rendered services that 
impacted on overall productivity of rural producers. They assisted in 
supplying the required inputs like seeds, fertilizers and pesticides 
intended for use by individual farmers, farmer producer groups, 
processors etc.  

Complementary 
services, e.g. input 
supplies are important 
targets for programs to 
reach their goals. 

GoT, the Bank,

Beneficiary communities were actively involved in the entire business 
cycle from the planning to the implementation stages. This reduced 
the risks of resentment by communities and simplified ways to 
address disagreements on the selection of program sites.  

Community 
participation is 
necessary at all stages 
of the program cycle.  

GoT, the Bank,

Increasing bargaining power and better prices for farmers as a result 
of the market and storage facilities were well acknowledged by the 
interviewed beneficiaries. However, traders continue to exploit

audience 

Management of 
equipment and 
infrastructures 

Rural beneficiaries have limited business acumen to ensure profitable utilisation 
of equipment and infrastructures. As such, the design of the equipment and 
infrastructure support needs to embed a well-resourced component supporting 
business development services to further guarantee sustainable use of the 
equipment. 

The Bank, 
other DPs and

Matching grant 
scheme 

Matching grant scheme is a time-consuming initiative requiring significant 
resources and time for awareness building, attitude change, and support to 
beneficiaries in identifying appropriate technology and the scale of operation. 

The Bank, 
and other DPs 
 

Standard and 
quality 
certification 

Access to standard and quality certification is necessary for expanding market 
penetration but also a time and resource costly activity to most small processors. 
Program component on supporting access to such certifications needs to be 
highly prioritised in program planning.

2.0 Key recommendations (with particular emphasis on ensuring sustainability of program benefits) 
 

Key issue 
(max 10, add 
rows as 
needed) 

Key recommendation Responsible  

1.  
 

Market and warehouse infrastructures have generated several benefits as discussed in 
preceding sections. However, further interventions by the district, regional and central 
Governments are necessary to optimise benefits accruing to farmers. There is a need to 
break buyers’ monopoly; promote and attract increasing number of buyers to advance 
the competitiveness of the market; and, strengthen the existing efforts to enforce the 
established marketing rules.  
 

Central, 
regional and 
district 
authorities. 

2.  The implementation of the IFAD’s components has been extended to March 2020. It is 
recommended for the extended IFAD component of the program to further strengthen 
the utilisation of the market and storage infrastructures by supporting marketing, 
financial services and business acumen in managing rural infrastructures.  
 

 
IFAD, and 
GoT. 

3.  Beneficiaries need to be closely supported to develop transparent and well elaborated 
business, and O&M plans for the program infrastructures and equipment. They need to 
have a clear understanding that the facilities need to be operated in a manner that 
maintenance and replacement costs are well covered.   
 

 
GoT and 
district 
authorities.  

4.  The preparation phase of infrastructure program needs to consider planning for an 
implementation time of the program from 5 to 7 years. The first two to three years of the 
program are spent on program identification, engineering designs and procurement 
processes. Another possibility is for the Government to have in place engineering and 
feasibility studies well in advance of loan application.  
 

 
The Bank, 
GoT. 

5.  Fully integrate program’s investments in the district annual plans and budget for 
maintenance for prolonged use of the infrastructures. Capacitate and sensitize local 
authorities to enforce by-laws (e.g. axel load limits on roads).  
 

 
GoT and 
district 
authorities 

6.  Ensure clear understanding for all parties when it comes to ownership and operational 
modalities of the infrastructure. Though local authorities own the markets and 
warehouses, they need to be encouraged or provided with complementary TA to 
establish formal agreements with respect to the role of owners and operators of the 
facilities.  

 

 
The Bank, 
GoT and 
district 
authorities 

7.  Ensure that all stakeholders are familiar with the Bank’s rules and program’s plans. 
Reference is made, for instance. Implementation delays are minimised if the Bank’s 
procurement rules are well understood. Procurement rules are among the rules that the 
Bank cannot change.  
 

GoT and 
district 
authorities 

8.  The initial ERR model (at the PAR stage) needs to be well documented at the PAR stage 
with the program’s M&E made responsible to regularly collect data necessary to update 
the ERR at the program closure stage.  
 

The Bank. 

9.  Intensify support to processors in quality and standards certification. Small processors 
cannot afford the high transaction costs and the time-consuming activity of following up 
certifications. The program approach in facilitating the standards organisations in 
assisting producers is one of the means to address the issue.  
 

The Bank  

10.  Government needs to intervene and clarify the few ownership disputes of some of the 
program’s markets and warehouses. Reference is made to the Longido livestock market, 
and the warehouses in Chato and Njombe.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF MANAGEMENT TO THE BOARD OF 

DIRECTORS FOR THE PROPOSED ADF LOAN OF UA10 MILLION TO THE REPUBLIC 

OF GHANA FOR THE FINANCING OF THE GIRSAL PROJECT 

 
Management submits the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of UA10 million 

to support the guarantee book and working capital finance requirements of the Ghana Incentive-Based 

Risk-Sharing System for Agricultural Lending (GIRSAL). 

I. STRATEGIC THRUST & RATIONALE 

 

1.1.  Project linkages with country strategy and objectives 

1.1.1 The Ghana Incentive-Based Risk-Sharing System for Agricultural Lending Project (GIRSAL) 

is designed within the context of Ghana’s ongoing agricultural transformation including the Ghana 

Shared Growth and Development Agenda II” (GSGDA II). The underlying theme of the GSGDA 

II is socio-economic transformation, which involves a change in the structure and composition of the 

national output in ways that enhance broad-based, inclusive and sustainable growth. The role of 

GIRSAL is to help accelerate financing and interconnectedness of the agriculture sector to ensure that 

across its key components, it is functioning at optimal levels.  

1.1.2 GIRSAL is also guided by country’s Food and Agriculture Sector Development Policy 

(FASDEP). Which has the following as its pillars: (i) Food Security and Emergency Preparedness; (ii) 

Increased Growth in Incomes and Reduced Income Variability; (iii) Increased Competitiveness and 

Enhanced Integration into Domestic and International Markets;  (iv) Sustainable Management of Land 

and Environment; (v) Science and Technology Applied in Food and Agriculture Development; and 

(vi) Improved Institutional Coordination. The FASDEP anchors on sub-sector policies including the 

Crop Development Policy; Cocoa Strategy; Livestock Development Policy; Fisheries Policy and 

Policies for Services Delivery (Extension. Irrigation, Plant Protection, Agricultural Mechanization). 

1.1.3 The Government has targeted enhancing agricultural productivity and production through its 

Planting for Food and Jobs (PFJ) Campaign. The major interventions under the PFJ are organized 

around the following five pillars: (i) Seed: The program will catalyse market-led production of 

adequate quantities of quality seeds by private enterprises; (ii) Fertilizer:  Private companies engaged 

in fertilizer production/blending and importation will be facilitated in meeting the fertilizer demands 

of the beneficiary farmers; (iii) Extension Services: In partnerships with the local governments and 

private inputs and service providers, the extension services will provide reliable and programmed 

technical assistance to beneficiaries; (iv) Marketing: It is envisaged that the facilitation of increased 

uptake of inputs will lead to increase in production of the targeted crops by the provision of storage 

warehouses; and (v) E-Agriculture: The PFJ Campaign will profile the beneficiaries by e-registering 

them and developing a state-of-art information and communication technology (ICT) platform. 

 

1.1.4 GIRSAL is structured to support agriculture across the nation. While certain financing 

priorities will be provided to the Northern Savannah Ecological Zone (NSEZ) under the proposed 

Savannah Initiative, GIRSAL intends to balance market demand, government priorities and donor 

activity in its national spread. GIRSAL views its national footprint as critical to providing support for 

Ghana’s balance of payments, macroeconomic stability, economic growth, food and nutrition security, 

job creation and poverty reduction.  

 

1.1.5 The Project is anchored in the Financial Sector Department of the Ministry of Finance, and 

draws support from the Ministry of Food and Agriculture as well as the Bank of Ghana. GIRSAL is 



 

2 

 

organized to focus on six pillars of intervention and thereby contribute to the High-5 priorities that are 

crucial for accelerating Africa’s economic transformation: Feed Africa; Industrialize Africa: and 

Improve the quality of life for the people of Africa. It will particularly contribute to the Feed Africa 

priority that focuses on transformation, scaling up agriculture as a business through financing and 

catalysing of value addition. 

 

1.1.6 The Bank has a competitive advantage in supporting the financing and de-risking of agriculture 

value chains in Ghana. The Bank’s growing expertise in risk sharing and issuance of credit guarantees 

in agriculture is a key capability for the transaction. By supporting GIRSAL, the Bank will help reduce 

poverty, reduce food importation and improve living conditions across Ghana’s farming communities. 

This Project will achieve this by catalysing transactions designed to boost the scale up and 

competitiveness of various value-prioritized chains such as rice, maize, soybean and cocoa. The 

Project will also consolidate on the gains made through various previous Bank and third party 

interventions in agricultural finance2.   

 

1.1.7 GIRSAL’s catalytic role in mobilizing private sector financing for agriculture will be critical 

to the success of emerging Government of Ghana initiatives such as the One District One Factory 

(1D1F) initiative. The initiative promotes agro-industrialization that will provide massive employment 

and wealth through value addition activities. A key precursor for 1D1F is the production of agricultural 

raw materials. GIRSAL’s financing guarantees will be vital to securing the volumes of agricultural 

commodities produced locally, including foodstuff, agricultural commodities for industry and 

agricultural commodities for exports. GIRSAL’s support will also enable 1D1F to champion agro-

processing through promoting the setting up of factories or revamping underperforming factories in 

the communities. 

 

1.1.8 GIRSAL is aligned to 2012-2017 Ghana Country Strategy Paper3 (CSP) extended to end 2018. 

The objective of the CSP is economic transformation leading to inclusive and sustainable growth. The 

strategy has two pillar namely: (i) Agriculture Enhancing Inclusive Growth and Economic 

Development; and (ii) Support to Industrialization through Private Sector Development. Based on the 

challenges to the country’s development trajectory the two strategic areas of focus are investment in 

agriculture and energy. GIRSAL falls under Pillar (i) stated above. This Project is would allow the 

agriculture sector to be more inclusive through the leveraging of more finances for the various actors 

along the value chain.  

 

1.2.  Rationale for Bank’s involvement 

1.2.1 The African Development Bank’s Feed Africa Strategy has identified innovative financing as 

critical to mobilizing resources to enable agricultural transformation. 

 

1.2.2 The Risk Sharing Financing Mechanism has been proposed as one of the flagships for the 

Feed Africa Strategy and is premised on developing de-risking instruments, technical assistance, 

integrated ICT platforms, performance management and incentives that would bridge the gaps between 

the agriculture and financing value chains. The GIRSAL therefore offers a packaged solution to: 

i. Fix agricultural value chains in order to provide a reliable platform for de-risking agricultural 
lending; 

ii. Mobilize financing for Ghanaian agribusiness by using credit guarantees to address the risk of 
default; 

                                                 
2 Technical Annex B1: Lessons learnt  
3 Dialogue on  the new CSP Pillars is ongoing 



 

3 

 

iii. Provide technical assistance through capacity building across the value chains; 
iv. Reduce the cost of borrowing by agricultural producers from commercial banks; 
v. To provide technical advice to agribusinesses 

 

1.2.3  While the concept of risk sharing for agriculture is relatively emerging, the Bank would profit 

from experiences of other donors e.g. USAID, AFD and NIRSAL experience to help in developing   

GIRSAL.  

 

1.2.4 The Project has a great potential in contributing to the twin objectives of the Bank’s 10-Year 

Strategy (TYS). GIRSAL will catalyse a wave of inclusive growth across agro-climatic zones and 

geographical locations, age and gender buckets. This will occur because the underlying agribusiness 

investments will take place across Ghana and involve regions with high levels of poverty e.g. the 

North, as well as youth and women agri-preneurs. Reducing poverty indicators among these three 

social groups will boost Ghana’s performance materially. 

1.2.5 The Project will enhance agriculture financing and sector transformation through increased 

capital inflows into critical value chains. That increased inflow will ensure appropriate supply of 

inputs, extension services, critical infrastructure, skilled labour and related services to raise the 

productivity of crops and livestock. GIRSAL will also leverage on the activities of the Savannah Zone 

Agricultural Productivity Improvement Project (SAPIP)4 and link up with Transformation of the 

African Savannah Initiative (TASI)5 as a vehicle for attracting private sector investment in agriculture. 

Furthermore, the Project will provide technical assistance, entrepreneurship and business management 

training to value chain actors to improve their business operations.  

1.3.  Private Sector Engagement  

1.3.1 The key private sector financing partners are primarily commercial banks (e.g. Ghana 

Commercial Bank, Agriculture Development Bank and Société Générale), microfinance institutions, 

private equity investors and specialized credit providers. Existing lender and investor activities centre 

primarily on provision of loans and lines of credit to value chain participants on a limited tenure basis. 

Projects financed include agricultural inputs, mechanization, production, processing, and logistics.  

 

1.3.2 Private sector alignment mechanisms include various industry groups at the value chain; 

segment and activity level e.g. Ghana Chamber of Commerce, Agriculture Sector. In adjacent markets 

– insurance – the Ghana Agriculture Insurance Pool (GAIP) is a club of underwriters who work 

together to provide insurance cover to the sector.  

 

1.3.3 Key on-going financing activities are extensive and vary by financial institution. Based on 

discussions with various partners, the pipeline of transaction opportunities exceeds tens of millions of 

USD. For example, the oil palm value chain, for one single bank (Access Bank), represents a potential 

lending portfolio of $8 - $10M/annum targeted to growers and processors only.  Limited coordination 

of private sector actors is required as the commercial process for originating and managing the 

agricultural investment pipeline is sufficiently well developed. 

 

 

                                                 
4 The SAPIP Project was approved by the AfDB in December 2017 aims at transforming agricultural value chains for food and nutrition security, job 
and wealth creation in the Northern Savannah Zone of Ghana. The Project main components: (i) Crop Productivity Improvement; (ii) Value Chains & 

Agribusiness Development; (ii) Infrastructure Development and will be implemented over a five-year period (2018 – 2023) at a total cost of UA 40.38 

million.

1.4.  Donors’ coordination 

1.4.1 The key development partners that are active in the sector are: L'Agence française de 

développement (AFD); Department for International Development (DFID); Global Affairs Canada; 

European Union; German Dev. Co-op (KfW Development Bank and  GiZ); Netherlands Embassy; 

Australian High Commission; JICA; USAID and World Bank; UN Agencies (IFAD, FAO and WFP). 

Others are IFPRI, AGRA and international NGOs such as Engineers without Borders, SNV and 

Catholic Relief Services. Donor activities cuts across ranges mostly targets various commodity value 

chains development, productivity enhancement, agricultural production and processing infrastructure 

development, mechanization, irrigation, sustainable land management, climate change adaptation and 

mitigation, nutrition, food safety, MSE and agribusiness development, access to finance, access to land 

and ICT for agriculture.  

 

1.4.2 Donor coordination mechanisms for the Agriculture Sector in Ghana are effective. 

Coordination under the Agriculture Sector Working Group (ASWG) began in 2002 and provides a 

platform for sharing information on ongoing and planned future activities with the aim of harmonizing 

interventions. The group holds annual joint sector reviews where donors, Government, implementation 

partners, civil society organizations (CSOs), and the private sector review the performance of the sector 

to inform planning and decision-making. The ASWG is an open group of donors; quasi donors; 

implementers including NGOs, CSOs, private sector, etc.; and Government Ministries.  

 

1.4.3 Key on-going/pipeline interventions by donors include a EUR160 million (UA133 million) 

support for productive investment for sustainable agriculture development capacity building of 

decentralized institutions and community development in the part of the Northern Development 

Authority Zone. The Government of Canada is also supporting the sector with a CAD125 million (UA 

83 million) facility for Modernizing Agriculture in Ghana (MAG). IFAD has provided USD71.60 

million (UA 51 million) as loan for sustainable rural poverty reduction in rural areas and a grant of 

USD10.0 million (UA7 million) to mitigate the effects of climate change. The Bank has successfully 

co-financed projects in the sector with other donors. Notable among these is the just ended Northern 

Rural Growth Program and the on-going Rural Enterprises Program, which were/are both co-financed 

with IFAD. A matrix of interventions by donors is presented in Annex A2 of the Technical Annexes. 

The coordination of aid through the ASWG is enhancing aid effectiveness through harmonization and 

alignment of development partner support.  

II. PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
 

2.1.  Project Details 

2.1.1  Project development goal:  

 

i. Reduce risk faced by commercial banks by providing guarantees to finance risk sharing 
arrangements; 

ii. Improve lending risk profiles by providing technical agricultural and business-related 
assistance to commercial banks and farmers; 

iii. Facilitate creation of appropriate insurance and other risk mitigation products; 
iv. Provide financial rewards to banks that are able to increase agricultural lending in a financially 

responsible manner6; 

                                                 
6
 This could be in the form of cash back or interest rebates to the participating commercial banks. On their end, they 

would be encouraged to extend the same to beneficiary firms that repay loans i.e. akin to an insurance policy without 

claim/loss.

v. Establish internationally credible and robust Bank-rating system; 
vi. Develop integrated systems for sharing information on credit behaviour of agribusinesses 

 

2.1.2  The integrated development objective of the Project is to transform access to finance and risk 

sharing across agricultural value chains. Doing so will boost food and nutrition security, job and wealth 

creation. The specific Project objective is : To increase formal sector lending to across the agricultural 

value chain especially the upstream, primary stages by sharing the risk of lending with financial 

institutions. Such increased lending backed by GIRSAL’s credit guarantee is expected to mobilize 

credit creation and strengthening of agribusinesses. That will in turn help to increase incomes of actors 

along selected value chains on a sustainable basis. 
 

2.2.  Project components 

2.2.1  The Project will have two Components. (i) Promoting de-risking for the Agriculture Sector; 

(ii) Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation.  
 

        Component 1: Promoting de-risking for the agriculture sector:  
 

        The Project will utilize four instruments to reduce risks associated with lending to agribusinesses:  
 

● Credit Guarantee Scheme (CGS): This would entail the provision of guarantees to participating 
commercial banks and other financial institutions on an individual or portfolio basis. All banks and 

other financial institutions which shall be eligible for guarantees under the CGS, are prohibited 

from financing items under the Bank Group’s Negative List. The Bank Group’s Negative List is 

included in Annex C of the appraisal report.  The CGS will provide differential risk coverage 

ranging from 50% - 80%; with the scheme providing greater risk coverage for upstream activities 

(production and primary processing) and lower coverage for downstream activities (value added 

processing, services, logistics and marketing). Associated risks would be covered on a partial loss 

arrangement with loan tenure depending on: the volume of lending; profitability of the value chain 

activities; the type of financial intermediary, experience and capacity for agricultural lending. 

GIRSAL has developed: A business plan and investment strategy for the Risk Sharing Facility 

(RSF); a Financial Model; term sheets & tailored products (Guarantees, Letter of Credit, debt, 

equipment leasing, warehouse receipt financing etc.); financing and operational guidelines for RSF 

transactions (origination, credit diligence, default and contract management, development of risk 

management framework (risk pricing) and agriculture value chain (AVC) selection and 

prioritization criteria. 
 

● Technical Assistance Facility (TAF): This would involve capacity building for both Financing 
Value Chain actors (supply side actors) and Agriculture Value Chain actors (demand-side actors).  

Capacity building targeting demand side actors (such as input suppliers, producers, aggregators, 

processors, trade & logistics) will include training to improve farm and financial management, 

value addition and marketing. GIRSAL will also provide coaching and advisory services targeting 

Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). GIRSAL will provide technical training through 

the Banking and Insurance Colleges of Ghana to enhance the capacity of financial intermediaries 

to assess and manage agricultural credit risk. Training modules and technical support will include: 

establishing agriculture desks, product development and distribution, risk management and 

improving credit information systems. It will also support development of knowledge and 

innovation centres. The TAF will focus on MFI’s given that as at end-December 2016, there were 

five hundred and sixty four (564) MFIs provide commercial credit to agribusinesses (71 money 

lending companies, 11 Financial NGOs and 482 microfinance companies).

● Agriculture Insurance Facility (AIF): While insurance presents opportunities for managing 
upstream risks, the uptake of agriculture insurance in Ghana remains low. As part of efforts to 

reduce exposure, GIRSAL guidelines have made provisions for borrowers to purchase insurance 

policies (where the local market provides appropriate insurance at competitive prices). The pairing 

of guarantee and insurance products offers a more holistic de-risking solution and could have 

positive impact on risk-adjusted interest rates over the long run. GIRSAL will collaborate with 

Ghana Agriculture Insurance Pool; the insurance regulator to define the regulatory framework for 

agriculture insurance in Ghana. The GIRSAL implementation team has initiated discussions with 

re-insurers such as SwissRe and AfricaRe to share costs development and rollout new products. 

The feasibility studies identified need for area-yield index insurance for annual crops, index 

insurance for tree crops, livestock insurance to cover both commercial and smallholder farmers, 

aquaculture insurance to cover commercial aquaculture). During year 1 and year 2, the Project will 

need to define models for low-cost distribution of these products through the private sector. 
 

● Digital Finance Platform: GIRSAL’s Digital Finance Platform is a cloud-based platform that 
would facilitate GIRSAL reporting, and development of predictive models. The platform consists 

of 3 elements: 

(i) Secure web applications that support: a guarantee application portal; payments portal and a 
knowledge and innovations centre portal (KIC); 
 

(ii) A Risk scoring engine to be used by lenders in making credit guarantee applications decisions, 

and by GIRSAL to make guarantee approval decisions. The engine presents yet another 

innovative opportunity for automating loan risk assessment as well as profiling potential 

borrowers and 
 

(iii)A data warehouse that integrates information from numerous sources to build Know-Your-

Customer (KYC) data on production: transaction, insurance coverage, input purchases, sales 

and purchases. The portal will allow capability for integrating information from Credit 

Reference Bureaus, Academic Institutions, Mobile Money providers, utilities etc. 

Component 2: Project Co-ordination and Management Unit (PMU): 

 

The GIRSAL team will implement the PMU. They will be responsible for the day-to-day management 

of the Project. They will also be responsible for Institutional set-up of GIRSAL, Operations 

(origination, due diligence, structuring and approval) and Monitoring and Evaluation.  The summary 

of activities is in Table 2.1 below:

2.3.  Technical solutions retained and other alternatives explored 

2.3.1 Table 2.2 presents design options considered and reasons for their rejection. 

Table 2.2: Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection 

Alternative name Brief description Reasons for rejection 

Instrument: Direct 

Lending 

Creation of a budget financed fund to 

provide on-lending support to Ghana’s 
agriculture sector lenders; BoG mechanism 

would secure funds at low interest rate and 

disburse at a moderate spread 

Approach replicates past instruments whose key weakness is the adverse 

selection problem, moral hazard, and lack of sufficient prudence;. GIRSAL has 
in place TA support for banks and farmer borrowers to enhance their 

performance & productivity. It require borrowers to subscribe to insurance 

before accessing loans under GIRSAL. GIRSAL would create special modules 
to facilitate low cost credit that can address gender issues and therefore “Direct 

Lending” would only be considered in this case. 

Instrument: Limited 
RSF 

Replication of existing RSFs akin to 
partnership between AGRA and 

commercial banks across Africa to provide 

first loss guarantee on targeted portfolios  

While attractive, approach has limited appeal due to its lack of scale, 
involvement of the entire financial system, and limited capacity to deliver  

technical change 

Instrument: Nigeria-
style Full Risk 

Sharing 

Risk sharing facility based on the Nigeria 
model i.e. NIRSAL 

GIRSAL will have a second evaluation on its Digital Platform (NIRSAL did not 
have it), of all approved bank loans to satisfy itself before a decision on 

guarantee would be taken 

 
2.4.  Project type:  

This is a lending Project financed with an ADF loan. 

2.5.  Project cost and financing arrangements 

2.5.1 The total cost of the Project is estimated at UA 44.64 million of which the ADF contribution 

is UA 10.00 million (net of taxes and based on 2018 prices). The financing structure attributes UA 

11.69 million (26.18%) of the total cost to foreign currency transactions, and UA 32.95 million 

(73.82%) to local costs.  

 

2.5.2 The total Project cost of UA 44.64 million will be financed by:  

 

i. An ADF loan of UA 10.00 million (22.4% of Project costs). The ADF loan would largely be 
channelled towards financing of the credit guarantee because this component provides the highest 

potential for income generation that would not only service the loan, but also allow GIRSAL to 

finance the non-income generating components of the scheme; 

 

ii. The Government of Ghana will contribute the equivalent of UA 34.64 million (77.6% of Project 
costs) to cover: capitalization of the credit guarantee, targeted technical assistance and agricultural 

insurance activities, digital platform, operating and capital expenditures associated with start-up 

and staffing costs; 

iii. As part of efforts to leverage GIRSAL financing and capitalize on existing Agricultural finance 
operations in Ghana, the GIRSAL implementation team has proposed creating a Technical 

Assistance consortium which will include donors active in the agricultural finance space and key 

project managers for government-financed agricultural finance operations. Technical assistance 

activities that contribute directly towards achievement of GIRSAL’s mandate have been identified 

with cost estimates simulated in Tables 2.4 and 2.6 of this report. The contribution of the Technical 

Assistance consortium is estimated to cover 1.3% of the Project costs and should be considered as 

in-kind contribution since resources will not be disbursed through GIRSAL but will remain tied to 

their respective projects. The modalities for the memorandum to govern activities of the Technical 

Assistance consortium will be prepared following effectiveness of this Project. Given the nature of 

the Project, (no works involved) and discussions with Government of Ghana, there will be no 

provisions made for physical and price contingencies.

2.5.3 Justification for Local Costs Financing: The ADF loan will finance 25.41% of GIRSAL’s 

financing. At least 50% of GIRSAL’s seed capital would be invested in local treasury bills to generate 

interest income for re-investment and to cover recurrent costs. At least 0.06% of the ADF loan 

resources will be dedicated to carrying out Project Management activities that ensure proper fiduciary 

management of the Project. Given the significant human resource capacity in Ghana, it is likely that 

various technical assistance assignments would be locally sourced. The GoG has approached the Bank 

to support the financing gap given the focus the bank has on the Feed Africa Strategy. The summary 

of estimated costs by component, expenditure category, sources of financing as well as an expenditure 

schedule are presented in the tables below:

2.6.  Project’s target area and population 

2.6.1  The Project is designed to be implemented across Ghana as a national intervention targeting 

selected agribusiness ecosystem7. GIRSAL will have two levels of beneficiaries: 

 

Type 1: Direct Beneficiaries 
 

 This consists of financial institutions and intermediaries who sign Master Agreements with 
GIRSAL to retail guarantees to agribusiness market participants. These will initially be commercial 

and universal banks primarily. Overtime, the mix will also come to include specialized lenders, 

microfinance companies, private equity investors and other types of sector focused sources of risk 

capital; 

 Benefits will be delivered in a number of forms inclusive but not limited to the following: 

 Protection for downside risks to their loan and financing portfolio i.e. up to 80% reduction in loss 
risk subject to the terms of individual contracts purchased; 

 Improved quality of data and market insights regarding agribusiness lending and default 
likelihoods. Data sharing provided by GIRSAL (on a blinded basis) would be  able to show at a 

high level key shifts in the agribusiness financing landscape;and 

 Commercial intelligence related to what investment type and region is attractive versus others. 
 

Type 2: Indirect Beneficiaries 

 

 Group includes the majority of Ghana’s non-subsistence farmers i.e. commercial farmers of all 
sizes, input suppliers, logistics service providers, processors and retailers; 

 Benefits will be delivered in a number of forms inclusive but not limited to the following: 
Reduction in implied risk premium demanded by lenders to finance agriculture; use of credit 

guarantees will likely trigger a decline in the need for collateral in agricultural lending; 

 Improve overall commercial, agronomic and financial capabilities across the agribusiness 
ecosystem as the impact of technical assistance investments start to kick-in; 

 Improvement in business environment and confidence on agriculture, setting up potential for a 
virtuous shift in attitudes towards agriculture lending and investments; 

 Given that the mix of direct and indirect beneficiaries will largely map to current economic and 
demographic structures, the Bank anticipates that women and youth will be critical beneficiaries 

of the proposed intervention. Women and youths are important participants at most stages of value 

chains e.g. primary production, storage and processing. Therefore, in the absence of special 

interventions, we expect proportionate representation in GIRSAL’s guarantee and technical 

assistance footprint. 

 

2.7.  Participatory process for programme identification, design and implementation 

2.7.1  The preparation mission had a general consultation and technical working sessions with 

Government personnel and key stakeholder groups in agriculture including development partners. The 

outcome of the discussions was the development of a logical framework for the Project and the 

preparation report that is forming the basis for the appraisal report.  

                                                 
7 Value chain prioritization is based on export potential (cocoa, vegetables, rubber, cashew & pineapples) and import 
substitution (soybean, maize, rice, cassava, fisheries & sorghum). The Value chain actors will vary depending on the 

commodity and would include input suppliers, farmers, aggregators, quality control, private haulers (transporters), 

warehousing, marketers and processors. 
  



 

12 

 

 

2.7.2  A GIRSAL- Financial Institutions workshop was held on the 15th March 2017, with multiple 

attendees (45) drawn from Ghana’s commercial banks and related financial institutions and  Bank of 

Ghana..  

  

2.8.  Bank Group experience, lessons reflected in the Project design 

2.8.1 The lessons learnt from the Bank’s operations in Ghana and in its recent work on credit guarantee 

systems country has enhanced Project design for implementation efficiency and sustainability. For 

example, the CSPE (2002-2015) indicated that project design flaws limited the sustainability of 

agriculture sector projects, particularly the lack of clear management plans for the maintenance of key 

assets such as pack houses and markets. This flaw has been addressed in this Project by the new 

approaches, which considers intervening to fill the gaps in the operations of actors along the value 

chains of interest as against the concentration of the activities supported by the Project around just the 

farmers. Thus, GIRSAL’s design has a more robust approach to technical assistance than previous 

Bank projects have had. In addition, the Bank’s lessons from its engagement with Sovereign and Non-

Sovereign borrowers including Private Equity firms have shaped the design. These lessons include 

considerations related to the importance of governance, optimizing donor network investments, use of 

investment committees and management of potential conflicts of interest.  

 

2.9.  Key performance indicators 

The overall impact of GIRSAL is to increase the proportion of lending to agriculture from the 3.4% 

total lending at the end of 2015 to a minimum of 6.8% at the end of the ten-year period. 

III. PROJECT FEASIBILITY 

 

3.1. Financial and economic performance 

3.1.1 The viability of GIRSAL has been evaluated through the income model, potential scenarios for 

guarantee payouts and operating expenses. This in turn informed determination of the fund size. The 

following perspectives of capital have been identified as being critical to GIRSAL’s stability: 

 The size of capital; 

 Timing of Capitalization; 

 Cost of capital and prevailing market prices; 

 Securing a fall-back guarantee cover for the capital. 
 

3.1.2 GIRSAL’s seed capital will be GHS 250 million to be secured at the beginning of year 1, with 

additional capital investments envisaged over GIRSAL’s 10-year life. The key assumptions underlying 

the analyses include: (i) Active participation of at least 10 financial intermediaries/digital financial 

services providers with universal coverage in Ghana8; (ii) a leveraging effect of at least 3 times as a 

result of use of the GIRSAL credit guarantees to crowd-in  commercial lending into Agriculture; (iii) 

financial institutions would increase their risk appetite as a result of their improved assessment of 

agricultural financing risks; (iv) AVC borrowers would improve their farm management and financial 

                                                 
8 In March 2018, the GIRSAL implementation team held a technical session with Financial Intermediaries in Ghana to 

validate the assumptions for the Master Agreement. This agreement would define the terms of engagement between 

GIRSAL and the Financial Intermediaries. Chief Risk Officers attended the session from 18 Financial Intermediaries; 

two of which account for 66% of commercial lending to agribusinesses in Ghana. Based on continued negotiations, 

GIRSAL’s implementation team envisions active participation of at least 6 FIs by 2023.

management as a result of TAF consortium and GIRSAL interventions. For the economic analysis, (i) 

incremental benefits from the Project are realized over a 10-year time period; (ii) the applicable 

discount rate is estimated at 20%. The summary of financial and economic analysis is included in 

Technical Annex B6 of the appraisal report. 

 

3.1.3  Financial analysis: Three capitalization scenarios were considered (capitalization of GHS 

600 million/ GHS 400 million/ GHS 250 million). Fund mobilization for GIRSAL is currently secured 

at GHS 263 million (for capitalization, OPEX and CAPEX), which informed the decision to initiate 

GIRSAL using a capitalization baseline of GHS 250 million. The FIRR analysis generated Net Present 

Value (NPV) of GHS 393,503,981 over the first 5 years. This capitalization scenario presents a break 

even IRR. 

 

3.1.4  Economic analysis: The economic analysis was conducted using the same approach as the 

financial analysis. Economic analysis yielded an NPV of GHS 731,137,197 over the 10-year horizon 

and IRR of 6%. While the IRR projections for GIRSAL are modest, they are likely to increase if: (i) 

there is additional capitalization of GIRSAL over the 10-year horizon. Simulations project an IRR of 

10% at an increased capitalization of GHS 400 million and 12% at an increased capitalization of GHS 

600 million. 
 
 Table 3.1: key economic and financial figures 

 

3.2.  Environmental and social impacts 

3.2.1  Environment:  

 

3.2.1.1 Given its magnitude and the expected minimal environmental and social impacts, the Project 

is classified as a Category 4 FI-C for which no ESA studies are required. This is because the Project 

will support FIs through promotion of agriculture sector de-risking credit guarantee schemes, 

promoting incentives and enablers of agricultural financing and project management. Some of the 

financing will go towards, project management. However, GIRSAL will be required to develop an 

ESMS Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS) that will allow it to apply the 

requirements of the Bank’s ISS requirements – in a manner appropriate to the scale and nature of 

GIRSAL operations. GIRSAL will be required to apply the Bank’s Negative and Exclusion list; Bank’s 

ISS requirements; and to comply with applicable national environmental and social regulations 

including labour laws. The Project has integrated E & S risk management procedures within the 

GIRSAL Risk Management procedures and will develop an ESMS and finalise by 31st December 

2018. The ESMS will be reviewed and cleared by AfDB and the ESMS will be disclosed in the 

GIRSAL’s website in compliance with AfDB requirements for Category 4 projects. The Project will 

have the following positive impacts: it will fill the gap in agricultural lending and increase financial 

inclusion especially of youth and women involved in agribusinesses; thereby enhancing the incomes 

of farmers and vendors including women and the youth, and increasing employment opportunities.  

 

3.2.1.2 As a commitment to ensuring implementation of the ESMS, the Project Management 

Component has budgeted for:  ESMS development and training of GIRSAL Staff by a consultant 

(USD20, 000); ESMS implementation and monitoring (USD5, 000 – USD10, 000 per year for five 

years); and capacity building and institutional strengthening resources for GIRSAL staff on ESMS 

implementation within the Technical Assistance Component (USD30, 000).  

 

FIRR : 0%    NPV (base case) is GHS 393,503,981  

EIRR : 6%    NPV (base case)  is GHS 731,137,197  



 

14 

 

3.2.2  Assessment of Institutional Capacity:  

 

In line with the Fund’s requirements, GIRSAL will have to have adequate human, technical and 

financial resources for effective implementation of the ESMS. To ensure the commitment and effective 

implementation of the ESMS, GIRSAL higher management levels will be involved in ESMS 

development and implementation. The Chief Risk Officer will be the focal point in GIRSAL for ESMS 

development and implementation and he/she will provide oversight for E&S risk management within 

GIRSAL. The proposed ESMS Implementation Task force will comprise of GIRSAL staff from the 

following departments/sections: risk management; agricultural insurance and technical assistance. The 

Project-staffing plan includes Credit Risk Officers within GIRSAL and all participating Financial 

Institutions would be staffed with credit risk officers and these will trained to assess and manage E&S 

Risks.  Currently GIRSAL does not have the adequate capacity and its will be strengthened through 

technical capacity building to ensure effective implementation of the ESMS and this has been reflected 

in the Project cost. The overall responsibility of environmental and social risk monitoring as well as 

reporting on Project E & S performance will lie with GIRSAL as part of the overall Project monitoring 

and reporting arrangements.   

 

3.2.3  Climate risks:  

 

Ghanaian agriculture and food systems are climate dependent and the sector is recognized as one of 

the most vulnerable sectors to climate change. The proposed programme will have to take into account 

climate risks that may affect the risk sharing for agricultural lending activities. The Project will also 

support use of improved seeds and climate smart agriculture technologies to support resilience to 

climatic shocks. The bundling of financing with derisking instruments would adequately protect 

agribusiness borrowers from losses resulting from climate events and would provide indemnity for 

financial institutions that extend debt to these agribusinesses. GIRSAL will deploy technical assistance 

to support both agribusinesses and financial institutions to mitigate/manage risks. In addition, the 

facility would also leverage the use of ICT based services to enhance climate and market information. 

 

3.2.4  Gender Aspects 

 

3.2.4.1  In Ghana, women constitute 52% of the national Agricultural labour force and contribute 46% 

to the total GDP and produce 70% of subsistence crops (MOFA, 2002). Women play a major role in 

the agriculture value chain, from farming to food processing and marketing.  However, women 

experience more constraints in accessing agricultural productive resources, compared to men. 

According to FAO, such limitations involve several dimensions such as: (i) ownership of land, 

livestock or other agricultural resources; (ii) management of agricultural resources; (iii) use of financial 

services and other inputs for agriculture (FAO, 2011). As the study mentions, access to credit and other 

financial services is a serious constraint to many actors in the agriculture sector especially the 

smallholder farmers, who are mostly women, for whom funding from the banks is simply out of reach.  

3.2.4.2 The obstacles of women to access funding for agribusinesses are mainly:  limited access and 

ownership of land, as an essential collateral, limited knowledge and capacity in elaborating bankable 

business plans, limited access to information on how and where to access finance, lack of guarantee 

for climate change related risks, mind-sets about the agriculture; considered as for households needs;  

etc.    The available data in Ghana are not gender disaggregated to indicate the number of female-

owned agribusinesses borrowing for agricultural production, but based on the qualitative information 

and estimates, women are poorly involved in the sector, due essentially to the mind-sets and 

perceptions of agriculture: cultivating for households needs and not for businesses.   In most financial 

institutions, women generally receive smaller loans than men, even for the same activities. Female-led 



 

15 

 

agribusinesses largely source financing from microfinance institutions, small savings and credit 

services and some types of micro insurance, for food processing and marketing. Women are 

underrepresented as borrowers and members in many rural and urban finance programs and 

cooperatives that tend to favour larger agricultural production loans.  

3.2.4.3 To address these challenges of women in agricultural financing and increase the number of 

women owned businesses in the agriculture sector, the GIRSAL Project intends to put in place the 

following actions & measures: (i)propose a Gender policy, including for the key affiliated institutions;  

(ii) The selected PFIs may elaborate or review their credit policy to reflect their commitment to 

advancing the empowerment of women;(iii) Create a networking platform for women entrepreneurs 

in the agriculture sector to foster peer-to-peer learning, mentoring and the sharing of information and 

knowledge within communities, and enhance their ability to elaborate the Bankable projects (through 

the TAF) (iv)  Provide incentives to PFIs lending to women; v) Develop and provide innovative bank’s 

products specific to the needs and interest of women; vi) Organise the sensitization campaigns to uplift 

the level of consideration of agriculture’s sector among the population.  The budget allocated to 

implement specific activities and measures for gender equality and women’s empowerment is 

equivalent to 0, 5million UA.  

 

3.2.5  Involuntary Resettlement 

There is no involuntary resettlement or land acquisition or any loss, by the population, of property, 

sources of income and livelihoods envisioned within the implementation of the Project activities.  

IV. IMPLEMENTATION 

 

4.1.  Implementation arrangements 

4.1.1   The GoG, through the Ministry of Finance (MoF) will be the borrower of the loan. GIRSAL 

Limited (also the Company) will be the executing agency. The loan proceeds will be on lent by MoF 

to the Company (an autonomous, specialized limited liability company focused on enabling the 

acceleration of access to risk adjusted credit in Ghanaian agriculture), by signing a subsidiary loan 

agreement (on-lending) on terms and conditions acceptable to the Fund. . The Company will operate 

independently of BoG, and other agents and institutions of the Government of Ghana. Its structural 

and operational designs were arrived at after close collaboration with various stakeholders including 

farmer groups, financial institutions (FIs), Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs), other 

agribusiness ecosystem participants, donor partners and financial services providers.  

 

4.1.2 The National Insurance Commission (NIC) and Bank of Ghana (BoG) will regulate the 

Company. The CEO will be in charge of the day-to-day operation supported by the Chief Operating 

Officer (COO) and Credit Risk Officer (CRO). The various functional units including the Treasury, 

Financial Control, and Administration will report to the CRO whilst Agriculture Insurance, Technical 

Assistance, Marketing and DFS report to the COO.  The Board of Directors shall provide overall 

governance of the Company whose operational guidelines would follow the Basel Guidelines on 

Corporate governance principles. The Board shall also have the overall responsibility for approving 

and overseeing management’s implementation of the entity’s strategic objectives, governance 

framework and corporate culture. To enhance control, there shall be an internal audit function, which 

will carry out periodic reviews of the Company’s operations and report to the audit committee of the 

Board. Internal Audit will also monitor implementation of external audit recommendations. 

 

4.1.3 The Company will have the full complement of staffing with the requisite qualifications and 

experiences to ensure that it operates effectively. External recruitment will complement the initial staff 



 

16 

 

who may be seconded from Bank of Ghana (bound with an MOU signed for return at the end of 2 

years) to ensure that the Company operates efficiently from the onset.  

 

 Financial Management 

 

4.1.4  The overall financial management of the Company including the Fund’s funding will be 

handled by the Finance and Administration Manager (competitively recruited), who shall be a 

seasoned chartered accountant with hands-on experience in the application of International Financial 

Reporting Standards (IFRS) in the banking and insurance environments, with some knowledge of 

agricultural products and multilateral projects. He will be assisted by an experienced Accounts Officer, 

who would also be chartered accountant (to be hired) with reasonable experience in the application of 

IFRS and knowledgeable in financial services, insurance, agricultural financing and donor funded 

projects.  An accounting software (ERP) would be procured and used for accounting entries and 

financial reporting. An accounting policies procedures manual (in draft) that has been customised from 

BoG’s existing finance Manual and will be implemented to ensure unified financial management 

practices within GIRSAL Limited. The Finance and Administration Manager will use the accounting 

software to produce monthly, quarterly and annual reports. Quarterly interim unaudited financial 

reports must be shared with the Bank within 30 days of the end of each calendar quarter reported on, 

while the annual financial statements must be audited in accordance with terms of reference approved 

by the Bank, and submitted to the Bank within six months of the end of the year audited. 

4.1.5 Other key draft manuals customised from existing BoG’s manuals including: (i) Human 

resources policy; (ii) Internal Audit Procedures; (iii) Information Security Policy; (iv) 

Communications Policy;, and (v) Procurement Manuals will be finalised in time to ensure a smooth 

start to operations. 

  

4.1.6     Disbursement: Three (3) of the Bank’s four disbursement methods shall be used in disbursing 

funds from the Bank to GIRSAL namely: (i) Reimbursement; (ii) Direct payments; and (iii) Payments 

through Special Account (SA). All payments relating to consultancies will be made through direct 

payments based on milestones achieved, as verified by GIRSAL Limited’s management. The ADF 

resources to fund the risk sharing facility (RSF) will be advanced in a single tranche to a segregated 

USD denominated Special Account (approved by the Minister of Finance), opened at the Bank of 

Ghana (BoG) for GIRSAL. A second local currency investment account will be opened at BoG, for 

investing all GIRSAL RSF funds (in less risky instruments) and drawdowns made as and when the 

guarantee is called upon. All disbursements under the Project will follow the disbursements procedures 

outlined in the Bank’s Disbursement Handbook. 

  
4.1.7    External audit arrangements: An external audit firm will audit the Company in full compliance 

with the country’s practices for limited liability companies. In fulfilment of the Ghana’s Companies 

act,1963 (Act 179) and registration, GIRSAL has appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) as its 

external auditor, whose  appointment shall be renewed annually based on satisfactory performance for 

a maximum of 5 years. PwC is experienced in the Bank’s auditing requirements and the audit ToR 

must be agreed with the Bank before commencement of the audit. The audited financial statements 

and the accompanying management letter must be submitted to the Bank within 6 months after each 

financial year.  As neither the financial management staff, nor the proposed system is in place, the 

overall financial management risk at appraisal is deemed substantial. To mitigate the risk, the GIRSAL  

team will need to ensure appropriately qualified and experienced staff are brought on board at the 

earliest, and further actions as listed in the FM action plan are implemented. 

  



 

17 

 

4.1.8  Procurement arrangements: “Procurement of goods (including non-consultancy services), 

and the acquisition of consulting services” financed by the Fund for the Project, will be carried out in 

accordance with the “Procurement Policy and Methodology for Bank Group Funded Operations” 

(BPM), dated October 2015 and following the provisions stated in the Financing Agreement. 

Specifically, procurement would be carried out as follows: 

 

i. Bank Procurement Policy and Methodology (BPM): Bank standard PMPs, using the relevant 

Bank Standard Solicitation Documents (SDDs), will be used for International Competitive 

Bidding (ICB), and National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures for contracts of goods, 

while the procurement process for the acquisition of Consulting Services will be undertaken 

through shortlists as indicated in the Technical Annex B5, Para. B.5.3.2.  
 

ii. Procurement Risks and Capacity Assessment (PRCA): The assessment of procurement risks at 

the Country, Sector, and Project levels and of procurement capacity at the Executing Agency 

(EA), were undertaken9 for the Project and the output have informed the decisions on the 

procurement regimes (Banks PMP) being used for specific transactions or groups of similar 

transactions under the Project. The appropriate risks mitigation measures have been included 

in the procurement PRCA action plan proposed in Annex B5, Para. 5.3.8. 
 

4.2.  Monitoring 

4.2.1 The foundation for the overall Project monitoring and evaluation systems will be the logical 

framework, a series of key performance indicators and project operational manual (POM) which will 

be prepared by the PMU within GIRSAL Limited shortly after Project loan approval. MOF will have 

an oversight role and monitor all operations for planning and facilitation purposes. The PMU will 

monitor and evaluate overall impact of the Project including environmental and social compliance and 

performance and compile the Project’s half year (first year and quarterly thereafter) and annual reports 

for dissemination to the Bank Group, MOF, and relevant line ministries. A mid-term review (MTR) 

will be undertaken two years after Project start to review the Project’s achievements and constraints. 

Similarly, upon completion of project investments at the end of program year four, the PMU will 

prepare a Borrower’s project completion report.  

 

4.2.2  The initial assessment of national capacity indicates a satisfactory rating. The Ghana Statistical 

Service leads the efficient production and management of quality official statistics based on 

international standards, and will be used to assess the contribution of the Project towards the country 

and regional development goals and objectives as defined in the relevant development plans. In using 

the performance indicators and targets specified in the results-based framework, Project implementers 

tracking progress towards Project results are expected to take special note of changes that reflect 

advancement towards the translation of outputs into development outcomes. In developing monitoring 

and planning indicators, they will be disaggregated along gender lines. The key functions of the M&E 

Officer in the PMU will be to ensure quality and accountability of monitoring; information 

management; facilitation of knowledge building; and knowledge sharing on monitoring and 

evaluation. 
 

4.3.  Governance 

4.3.1 Based on Bank’s experience in implementing projects in Ghana, the existing governance 

practices and controls have been deemed satisfactory. The implementation of GISAL requires 

                                                 
9 See Technical Annexes for details

excellent governance across multiple layers of the agriculture ecosystem and within multiple value 

chains. This is in relation to better responsiveness, transparency, accountability and efficiency in the 

use of resources. Hence, the institutional arrangement has been designed to ensure good governance, 

and will serve as an instrument for achieving Project objectives.  
 

4.4.  Sustainability 

4.4.1  The ownership and sustainability of the Project is enhanced by the roles that various 

stakeholders played during formulation and preparation of the Project. Leading the process on behalf 

of the Government of Ghana was the BoG. The BoG chaired a systematic review, consultation and 

design process that has since resulted in the formation of the Company. On a day-to-day basis, the 

BoG Team Leader worked with and consulted parties from inside the Government including the 

Ministry of Food and Agriculture and Ministry of Finance. The BoG chaired process acted as a 

technical review team of experts with respect to the various reports and recommendations produced 

by PwC.  

 

4.4.2  Post-launch, the Company has been transferred to the MOF and will function as an 

autonomous and independent legal entity for accelerating growth in Ghana’s agribusiness sector. That 

structure is important in order to avoid any conflicts of interest between BoG’s role as a financial 

systems regulator and GIRSAL Limited’s role that also participants in the agriculture financial sector.  

 

4.4.3  A key part of that crystallization will be achieved by ensuring that GIRSAL Limited is 

launched with a start-up operating budget that would be sufficient to fund its annual recurrent budget. 

It is anticipated that within 3 to 5 years of launch, GIRSAL Limited will be able to self-fund itself 

using a combination of its fee income and drawdowns from its investment portfolio.  
 

4.5.  Risk management 

4.5.1 The current agricultural finance policy and sectoral strategies of Ghana have been developed in 

a consultative manner with the full participation of all relevant stakeholders. The Bank Group will 

engage in continuous policy dialogue to ensure that the policy, institutional and funding (particularly 

public expenditure) environment remain conducive to agricultural growth and development. 

Furthermore, social risks will be reduced through gender-sensitive approaches and ensuring that the 

poor are not excluded from Project benefits. GIRSAL is expected to be classified as a Category 4-FI 

C because the Project activities are expected to have environmental and social impacts that can be 

avoided and minimised since they will mostly be transaction-specific. Direct impact on climate change 

is expected to be immaterial to limited; hence, climate screening was approached with a degree of 

flexibility. The following are the main risks identified and with mitigation measures.  

 
Risks  Mitigation measures 

Macroeconomic risks - High probability: slow 

economic growth and deterioration of the country’s 
creditworthiness due to fall in cocoa and other 

commodity prices.  

Mitigation measure: GIRSAL will intensify the dialogue with the government to adopt 

supportive macroeconomic policies to rationalize fiscal expenditure, protect exchange rate 
flexibility, strengthen the banking system to prevent systemic crisis, and implement structural 

reforms for economic diversification. 

Productivity risks - Moderate to High probability: 
failure to achieve forecast crop and livestock yields 
due to soil conditions, inadequate access to extension 

workers, delays in rainfall, and inability to eradicate 

biological threats such as locusts 

Mitigation measure: GIRSAL will proactively support the Ministry of Food and Agriculture 

to ensure that deep collaboration occurs between GIRSAL and itself, to ensure that critical 

productivity enablers are mobilized on schedule and at scale. Such support may occur in the 
context of normal technical assistance, or in addition to it 

Commercial risks - High probability: sharp rise in 
supply of agricultural commodities  domestically and  

globally, exerting downward pressure on prices, 

resulting in lower than planned price realization for 

farmers and other ecosystem participants  

Mitigation measure: GIRSAL will work closely with its Ghana based and global crop market 

experts to gather pricing data as well as monitor early warning systems issued by 3rd parties 
e.g. US Dept. of Agriculture price forecasts for rice, corn, etc. If additional action is necessary 

based on the anticipated pathway for crop prices, then the Bank will work with GIRSAL to 

provide support to lenders on how to best communicate the shift, as well as prepare them for 

potential events of default. In addition, as appropriate, the Bank will support GIRSAL as it 

seeks out potential price hedging solutions and innovative tools to protect farmer earnings. 



 

19 

 

Environmental, Social and Climate Risk – 

Medium probability: The Project activities are 

anticipated to have transaction and site specific 

environmental and social risks. The proposed Project 
area (all of Ghana) is likely subject to climate change 

impacts, with impact zones more intensive in 

northern Ghana. 

Mitigation measures: An ESMS will be developed for the Project and the Project will 

undergo climate screening and categorisation as appropriate. During project implementation, 

if required - and it is unlikely to be the case given the Project type - transaction site specific 

ESMPs will incorporate integrated pest management plans and climate risk mitigation and 

adaptation measures. As specific transactions warrant it, ESMP development and 
implementation will be part of the monitoring and reporting of the Project activities.  

 

4.6.  Knowledge Building 

Knowledge building will be vital to the success of the Project. Considering the new approach in 

agricultural value chain finance, the results of the Project will be monitored closely. Knowledge will 

be built on the evolving concept of risk sharing systems; the likelihood of reducing default probabilities 

by deploying technical assistance; the impact on interest costs; the role of value chain actors including 

farmers and farmers’ organization, women, youth, private sector, commercial and public sector. 

Knowledge will be captured using analysis of M&E database, supervision missions, mid-term reports, 

and periodic impact assessments and field exchange visits of the stakeholders within and outside the 

production clusters. In addition, knowledge would be disseminated using GIRSAL’s knowledge portal 

and the Bank’s communication systems (Intranet, short documentaries on Bank website, etc.). For the 

purposes of publicity and sharing of Project results, the Project may recruit a local firm as and when 

the need be. The Technical Assistance projects will serve as sources of innovative knowledge and 

information sharing learning tools empowering farmers and other actors of the value chain to train 

their peers, share knowledge and experiences, thus reducing their overdependence on the public 

extension agents. This will also expand significantly the number of value chain actors having access 

to the disseminated knowledge and information. The technical assistance supports will introduce and 

consolidate knowledge and skills, and facilitate technology and skills transfer at both the community 

and national levels.

Executive Summary 

Project Overview: In Guinea, agriculture remains at the core of development policies and the main source of 
income for 631%  of people living in rural areas, and generates 80% of the country's jobs. It contributes about 
25% to GDP and employs nearly 80% of the Guinean population. Rice is the dominant food crop, accounting for 
67% of the area cultivated, 65% of the country's cereal requirements, 37% of the workforce, 80% of farmers, 
23% of primary GDP and 6% of national GDP. On average, rice represents 20% of the population's consumption 
budget. To compensate for the food deficit, around 600 000 tonnes of rice are imported yearly. The Support 
Project for the Transformation of Guinean Agriculture and Youth Agricultural Entrepreneurship (PATAG EAJ) 
was designed as part of a participatory and inclusive approach involving all stakeholders – farmers’ organisations, 
local communities and devolved technical services. The discussions and studies conducted with the PATAG EAJ 
Project Preparation Facility (PPF) in 2018 led to a thorough assessment of the situation and to identify not only 
the investments needed for the transformation of Guinea’s agriculture through promotion of the rice and market 
gardening value chains, but also the implementation modalities most appropriate for the Boké and Boffa 
Prefectures. In formulating PATAG EAJ, account was also taken of the country’s fragile context, lessons from 
Bank projects and those of other partners in Guinea, and the need to develop synergies and complementarities. 
In view of the Bank’s strategic orientations for the country, the project was designed with special emphasis on 
the following: (i) irrigation and market access infrastructure; (ii) value chain development; (iii) decent youth 
employment, empowerment of women and promotion of women’s leadership; and (iv) improvement of resilience 
and adaptation to the impacts of climate change. 

The specific goal of the proposed project, which is expected to cost UA 8.987 million and span a four-
year implementation period, is to ensure the development of climate-smart agricultural value chains and the 
promotion of youth entrepreneurship through the sustainable revival of rice production and market gardening 
value chains in the Boké and Boffa Prefectures. In addition to the basic transformative infrastructure that will 
result from the project (development of 237 ha of lowlands comprising 25 ha for off-season market gardening 
based on the use of shallow wells, 50 ha for seed production, 15 ha for women's gardening activities and 31 ha 
for youth-run modern market gardening activities; 65.5 km of access roads, 1 weekly market/consolidation centre, 
2 markets (stalls), and 6 stores and 2 input shops.), the project will support 20 agricultural processing units and 
contribute to the dissemination of 25 innovative techniques for increasing productivity (TAAT), improving 
storage and promoting food processing. These activities will be accompanied by local and organisational capacity 
building, and special attention will be paid to the creation of value added, youth employment and 
entrepreneurship, and to women's empowerment. PATAG EAJ will target at least 1 000 young people and 
women, 5 000 producers, 200 seed companies, 100 groups and 20 women’s and youth unions. It will affect a 
total 39 252 direct beneficiaries and 247 287 indirect beneficiaries through its various activities. The project will 
eventually increase rice production by about 1 030 tonnes, including 210 tonnes of certified seeds, and market 
gardening production by about 2 000 tonnes, generating a 19% boost in income. It will create 3 526 direct decent 
jobs, including 147 jobs generated by agricultural development works, 2 780 jobs by strengthening 
entrepreneurship and SMEs, and 600 temporary jobs. 

Needs Assessment: The project area covers two prefectures - Boké and Boffa - located in agricultural 
development hubs A and D, whose hydro-agricultural and socioeconomic potential requires the establishment of 
a rehabilitation and upgrading mechanism, in light of several factors: (i) the existence of high development 
potential (rice farming and market gardening); (ii) the proximity of consumption areas (Boké, Kamsar, Sangarédi, 
Fria Kindia, Boffa, Dubréka, Conakry, etc.); and (iii) current and future Bank interventions (the Forécariah road, 
the Boké-Quebo road and the future Boké agricultural hub). The project is based on the geographic concentration 
of operations at sector, village and priority site level, designed to maximise impact on target groups and to 
guarantee the sustainability and visibility of activities. 

In line with the country's strategic orientations, PATAG EAJ will contribute to the improvement of productivity 
and production in priority sectors by transforming Guinean agriculture and improving food and nutritional 
security through rice production and market gardening. The country has an annual rice deficit of more than 600 
000 tonnes. The project will also develop market gardening, whose current production covers only 53% of needs. 
This activity will help to improve the nutritional status of the beneficiaries, contribute to women’s empowerment 
and develop youth entrepreneurship. Therefore, the project will serve as a catalyst for agricultural expansion in 
the area by facilitating water control and the development of abundant quality natural resources (water, soil and 
solar energy), strengthening agricultural infrastructure, promoting sustainable, resilient and smart production,

packaging and processing technologies, and facilitating access to product markets by supporting the growth of 
the two strategic sectors, i.e. rice production and market gardening.  

Value-added for the African Development Bank: Agriculture remains at the core of development policies 
and the main source of employment. The Bank financed the Nerica Rice Development Project, the Upper Guinea 
Rural Development Support Project (PADER-HG) and the Beyla-Kérouané Agro-Pastoral Development Project 
(PRODABEK), etc. These operations made it possible to develop certain specific expertise and provide new 
insights into key areas (irrigation, seed production and control, processing, etc.). To consolidate these gains, the 
Bank will support the Government in financing the Support Project for the Transformation of Guinean 
Agriculture and Youth Agricultural Entrepreneurship (PATAG EAJ), in an effort to encourage the emergence of 
production hubs. By supporting the development of infrastructure in areas that are economically and socially 
disadvantaged, but endowed with huge irrigated agriculture potential, the Bank will contribute to reducing 
poverty, promoting decent employment for young people and women, strengthening adaptation to climate change 
and increasing the resilience of people vulnerable to food and nutrition insecurity. 

Knowledge Building: PATAG EAJ will help to train producers and consolidate their expertise. In an inclusive 
way, it will enable young people and women to develop technical and entrepreneurial capacity by accessing 
modern factors of farming, and will promote the emergence of leadership. In terms of resilience to climate change, 
it will develop and disseminate innovative technologies in the agricultural sector for the production, storage and 
processing of agricultural products, while enhancing local knowledge. PATAG EAJ will support the development 
of expertise in drip irrigation and solar pumping techniques, as well as in new processing technologies. In 
addition, support for quality improvement and labelling/certification will help to ensure compliance with norms 
and standards that promote access to new markets. Knowledge building will also be carried out through 
mechanisms for the communication and capitalisation of project results and best practice, and generation of 
endogenous value for the benefit of vulnerable groups via value chain development. Therefore, this project will 
contribute greatly to improving the attractiveness of the agricultural sector for private enterprise and youth 
employability.

GUINEA: SUPPORT PROJECT FOR THE TRANSFORMATION OF GUINEAN 
AGRICULTURE AND YOUTH AGRICULTURAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP (PATAG EAJ) 

 
Management hereby submits this report and recommendations concerning a proposal to extend a UA 
4.63 million loan and award a UA 3.24 million grant from the Transition Support Facility (TSF) to 
the Republic of Guinea to finance the Support Project for the Transformation of Guinean Agriculture 
and Youth Agricultural Entrepreneurship (PATAG EAJ). 

I- Strategic Thrust and Rationale 

1.1. Linkages with Country Strategy and Objectives 

1.1.1 In Guinea, agriculture remains at the core of development policies and the main source of income 
for 57% of people living in rural areas, and creates 80% of the country's jobs. It contributes about 23% to 
GDP and employs nearly 80% of the Guinean workforce. In the medium term, it will remain the engine of 
growth and the source of jobs, and an indispensable sector for achieving the objectives of poverty reduction 
and food security in Guinea. Rice is the dominant food crop, accounting for 67% of the area cultivated, 
65% of the country's cereal requirements, 37% of the workforce, 80% of farmers, 23% of primary GDP 
and 6% of national GDP. On average, rice represents 20% of the population's consumption budget. To 
compensate for the food deficit, around 600 000 tonnes of rice are imported yearly, representing about 15% 
of requirements. The rate of coverage of market gardening was 53% in 2015. 

1.1.2 In addition to occupying the 12th place among the most fragile countries, Guinea ranked 183rd out 
of 188 countries in the 2017 Human Development Report. The level of poverty has remained high, with 
the incidence of poverty rising from 41.9% in 2002 to 55.2% in 2012. About 80% of Guineans live in rural 
areas, where poverty is exacerbated by the lack of production infrastructure, basic social services and access 
to markets. The sector's contribution to economic growth was only 0.99% in 2015. The agricultural 
subsector is the driver of growth in the primary sector, but its contribution to the growth of the rural sector 
remains considerable, and stood at 4.1% in 2015.  The sector’s performance has been weak in terms of: (i) 
the cereal balance sheet; (ii) the productivity and processing level; and (iii) entrepreneurial capacity. The 
lack of infrastructure for improved access, production with poor water management and processing stifles 
the development of value chains, product competitiveness and improvement of the living conditions of 
Guineans. The principal challenge is to strengthen institutional, economic and social resilience while 
building the capacity of actors and reducing disparities between men and women, and to support the 
country's structural transformation by setting up key infrastructure for inclusive and green growth. The 
transformation of agriculture through the development of value chains, the promotion of youth employment 
and agricultural entrepreneurship, gender mainstreaming and increased involvement of non-State actors 
(including civil society and the private sector), will help to strengthen the resilience and mitigate the 
economic, socio-demographic and environmental dimensions of the country's fragility.  

1.1.3 In pursuing its objective to develop agricultural value chains, PATAG EAJ will help in increasing 
the sector’s contribution to GDP and in creating jobs and business opportunities by promoting the rice and 
market gardening sectors in targeted areas. It is an essential response for supporting production and 
processing activities, and contributing to the improvement of the people's living conditions by promoting 
value chains and creating entrepreneurship opportunities for young people and women. Therefore, it will 
contribute to the operationalisation of the National Economic and Social Development Plan (PNDES) 
2016-2020, which is in line with the 2040 forward-looking vision for a prosperous and emerging Guinea 
reliant on the agricultural sector to ensure that: (i) the productivity of the primary sector is doubled between 
2014 and 2020; (ii) food security is assured (reducing the incidence of food poverty from 18.2% in 2012 
to 9.1% in 2020); and (iii) sustainable agriculture is promoted. PATAG EAJ aligns squarely with the four 
PNDES pillars: (i) promotion of good governance for sustainable development; (ii) sustainable and 
inclusive economic transformation; (iii) inclusive human capital development; and (iv) sustainable natural 
capital management. This project is also in synergy with the various existing strategies, including the 
revised National Agricultural Development Policy (PNDA 2016-2025), the overall objective of which will 



 

2 

be to increase the contribution of the agricultural sector to food security, nutrition and reduction of poverty 
among Guineans by boosting growth and agricultural trade through: (a) increased productivity; (b) 
improved access to promising markets; and (c) improved governance of the agricultural sector. PATAG 
EAJ also concords seamlessly with: (1) the National Agricultural Investment and Food and Nutrition 
Security Plan (PNIASAN); (2) the Accelerated Programme of Food and Nutrition Security and Sustainable 
Agricultural Development (PASANDAD), the precursor to the implementation of PNIASAN through four 
components: (i) promotion of a favourable environment for sector development (promotion of 
transformative investments and the institutional framework); (ii) strengthening agricultural chains 
(structuring of actors and improving the performance of agricultural chains); (iii) promoting nutrition and 
gender; and (iv) sustainable natural resource management. 

1.2. Rationale for Bank Intervention 

1.2.1 Despite having many assets (fertile soils, water resources, fishery resources, etc.), Guinea still 
faces poverty (72% below the poverty line) and food insecurity (around 18%). The low unemployment 
rate (5.2% in 2014) in fact masks the scope of underemployment, unstable jobs and disparities. The 
unemployment rates of graduates of vocational schools and higher education institutions stand at 27.7% 
and 34.7%, respectively. Poverty is essentially rural, with a rate of about 80%, although these areas have 
proven hydro-agricultural potential. Rice is the staple food and the food deficit is filled annually by 
imports of about 600,000 tonnes. The main constraints facing the sector include: inaccessibility to 
production areas, poor water management, degradation of production systems, especially the mangroves 
owing to salinity and acidity, poor access to inputs, and low processing capacity. The aim of various 
strategies put in place is to reverse that trend, in particular by boosting investments in the agricultural 
sector and in production, marketing and processing infrastructure, and by promoting youth 
entrepreneurship and private sector involvement. It is vital to develop potential water resources and 
optimise the soil resource management, and to add value to products by reducing post-harvest losses 
through storage and quality processing that will open access to various markets. PATAG EAJ will fulfil 
that mission by modernising systems and factors of production, improving access to production areas, 
restructuring actors and improving conservation, processing and marketing conditions, with increased 
attention to value chains, youth/women's employment, and learning. PATAG EAJ is also a tool for 
implementing the CSP (2018-2022), which is built on two pillars: improving access to energy (Pillar 
1); and developing agricultural and industrial value chains (Pillar 2). Since it supports the 
transformation of the Guinean agricultural sector, this project is founded on Pillar 2. Through the 
development of agricultural value chains, agribusiness and agricultural entrepreneurship, it will 
contribute to inclusive and green growth, and to the improvement of people's living conditions. The 
project is in synergy with current and future operations, including those related to the construction of 
the Boké-Québo road and the Agricultural Processing Area Project. The area of intervention was also 
chosen based on the presence of an agricultural economic hub with identified potential in the rice and 
market gardening sectors. Hence, this project will seek to build on ongoing activities in targeted 
intervention areas and ensure complementarity to create greater impact. 

1.2.2 The objectives of PATAG EAJ are consistent with the Bank’s "High 5s", which aim to feed 
Africa by 2025 and improve the people’s living conditions through the development of agricultural 
value chains, build the capacity of stakeholders, create jobs and generate income. The project is aligned 
on the Bank's Ten-Year Strategy (TYS) 2013-2022 and its two guiding objectives of inclusive growth 
and transition to green growth, as well as three areas of special interest: gender, agriculture and food 
and nutrition security. It plugs into the Bank's Strategy for Addressing Fragility and Building Resilience 
in Africa, and will help in achieving the objectives of the Enable Youth Initiative and the Jobs for Youth 
in Africa Strategy by creating opportunities for young people. It is consistent with the Bank's 
Technologies for African Agricultural Transformation (TAAT) programme, which focuses on the 
adoption of new production and processing technologies in agricultural value chains. Specifically, it is 
in harmony with climate change adaptation initiatives by promoting renewable energies, water-saving 
techniques and resilient systems.

1.3. Aid Coordination  

Development aid is coordinated by the Government of Guinea through the Coordination and Consultation 
Framework (CCC) of the Permanent Secretariat in the Prime Minister’s Office. In addition to the CCC, a 
strategic mechanism for coordination between the Government and technical and financial partners (TFPs), 
a technical monitoring committee (TMC) to strengthen inter-sector coordination, and thematic dialogue 
groups (TDGs) bringing together TFP and Government representatives have been set up at the sector level. 
The "rural development, food security and environment" thematic group is chaired by the World Bank for 
TFPs, and the Ministry of Agriculture for the Government. Through its Country Office in Guinea (COGN), 
the Bank is an active member of the CCC and some TDGs. The key ongoing projects with an agricultural 
value chains and youth agricultural entrepreneurship support component backed by TFPs, and with which 
PATAG EAJ will need to develop synergies, are highlighted in Volume 2. The project will also establish 
synergies with Bank projects: the Boké-Quebo Road Construction Project with a rural roads component 
for the supply of agricultural products (ongoing) and the Boké Agropole Agricultural Processing Area 
Project (2019). In the wider rural sector (agriculture, livestock, fisheries, and environment), the intervention 
of the different partners is presented in Annex A4 of Volume 2, and is summarised as follows:

II- Project Description  

2.1. Project Objectives and Components  

2.1.1 PATAG EAJ’s sector goal is to help foster strong and inclusive economic growth. The specific 
objectives are to contribute to the development of climate-smart agricultural and agribusiness value 
chains, and to promote youth agricultural entrepreneurship in the Boké and Boffa Prefectures. It will: 
(i) help to boost production and productivity, and improve access to production and processing factors 
and markets; (ii) contribute to the development of climate-smart agricultural value chains that can 
employ a high number of young people and women; (iii) help to improve access to basic socioeconomic 
services for economic development; and (iv) build the capacity of the stakeholders involved in 
implementing PNIASAN/PASANDAD to achieve the objectives of PNDES in general, and of the 
PNDA in particular, and for better sector governance. 

2.1.2 PATAG EAJ was designed in light of results and lessons from the Bank's experience in the 
country and in the sub-region, acquired from efficient operating procedures, targeting of high-impact 
priority activities, and strong stakeholder involvement. The activities will take place in the two hubs – 



 

4 

A (Boffa) and D (Boké) – and will target poor, highly inaccessible areas with huge agricultural potential. 
Beyond the development of production, processing and marketing infrastructure in the areas concerned, 
the project will support: (i) the strengthening of the organisational and technical capacity of actors, 
particularly young people and women; (ii) the promotion of processing and marketing through the 
dissemination of new technologies (TAAT) and support for product labelling; (iii) the promotion of 
youth entrepreneurship and women’s empowerment; and (iv) the improvement of governance in the 
sector through the organisation of beneficiaries and capacity building. The selection and involvement 
of committed farmers, the choice of proven techniques and transformative actions will aim to ensure 
the sustainability of interventions and infrastructure. PATAG EAJ will support 5 000 farmers, 1 000 
young people and women, 100 seed growers, 100 groups and 20 unions, and will impact 39 252 direct 
beneficiaries and 247 287 indirect beneficiaries through its different activities. It will be implemented 
over a four-year period (January 2019 - December 2022) and will include three components, 
summarised below.

2.2. Technical Solutions Adopted and Alternatives Explored  

2.2.1 The technical solutions used in PATAG EAJ are based on field data and lessons learned from 
similar projects, and based on design methods adapted to the specific context of the intervention area. 
It involves development of medium-sized sites of lowlands with access to new technologies and solar 
energy for the dewatering. 



 

5 

 

2.2.2 The technical options selected took into consideration the ease of work management and 
equipment, the willingness of the beneficiaries to adhere and adopt these choices. The main arguments 
are: (i) to maximize the intensification level in these areas where two campaigns can be made, (ii) to 
achieve better water efficiency and control; (iii) to introduce solar energy, clean and renewable resource 
and appropriate mechanization; (iv) to promote new irrigation technologies through the introduction of 
drip systems, (v) mastering management and maintenance aspects to ensure sustainability. 

Table 2.2: Alternatives Explored and Reasons for Rejection 

Alternative Short Description Reason for Rejection 

Development of one large 
area, with total water 
control where the project 
would be concentrated 

Build a large pumping station, 
coated water transport channels 
with large civil engineering 
structures for water collection, 
supply and delivery for the 
various blocks and 
neighbourhoods 

This alternative is not technically feasible and does not 
ensure the availability of labour, in terms of both quantity 
and quality, for the development of the facilities and the 
investments to be made. It is highly likely that the area 
will not be fully exploited, since available labour on 
several sites close to small villages or large towns can be 
used to better exploit irrigated areas and develop the 
facilities. 

Development of market 
gardening areas with 
improved wells without 
any means of dewatering 

Build large-diameter wells at a 
rate of one well per hectare where 
irrigation water is manually 
drawn and carried by farmers to 
the parcels 

The challenge for the development of market gardening 
production is the manual removal of water from wells. 
This takes up a considerable amount of work time in 
return for mediocre efficiency and makes the task, which 
is performed mostly by women, very tedious and limits 
the production capacity of women involved in market 
gardening, consequently leading to a loss of interest. This 
method is also only feasible on small gardens not 
exceeding a few dozen square metres, especially during 
the dry season, when the demand for water is high. 

Development of 
intermediate animal-
draught cultivation 
instead of motorized 
ploughing 

Animal-draught cultivation in the 
project regions is adapted to light 
soils and a limited amount of 
moisture for high productivity. 
Its effectiveness depends highly 
on the physical state of the area to 
be ploughed 

The large areas of arable land in the region, the short 
period conducive to land preparation and the reduction of 
the rainy season impede animal-draught cultivation and 
militate in favour of mechanised ploughing. 
Consolidation of the network of agricultural 
mechanisation service providers in the project area will 
contribute to the achievement of this objective. 

2.3. Project Type  

PATAG EAJ is an investment operation financed from TSF resources. The Government of Guinea has 
not yet committed to implementing programmes using the sector approach, given a number of 
institutional constraints and fragility context. The project approach is the most appropriate, to ensure 
the achievement of results and the efficient and effective use of the resources allocated to the project. 

2.4. Project Cost and Financing Arrangements  

2.4.1 The cost of the project is estimated at UA 8.987 million or GNF 113 274 million. The foreign 
exchange portion is UA 3.845 million and constitutes 43% of the total cost. Customs duty and taxes are 
the responsibility of the State, which must take the necessary measures to ensure the enforcement of 
this provision. The provision for physical contingencies is expressed as a percentage of the base cost 
(5%) and applied for civil engineering works, mainly in the form of construction/rehabilitation of 
irrigation facilities, roads, markets, stores, shops and storage centres. The provision for price escalation, 
commonly referred to as "financial contingencies", is calculated based on the inflation level. The 
inflation rate used was 8%. The breakdown of project cost is presented in the tables below, by 
component and expenditure category. An expenditure schedule by component is also provided. The

2.4.2 The project will be financed through a grant of UA 3.24 million and a loan of UA 4.63 million 
from the TSF, representing 87.6% of the project cost, net of taxes and customs duty. The Government's 
financial participation, estimated at UA 0.898 million, will be limited to covering the costs of taxes and 
customs duty, and the establishment of a revolving fund for the procurement of inputs (fertilisers and 
seeds). The contribution of beneficiaries will be limited to their participation in routine maintenance 
and upkeep, which can easily be carried out, and their 10% participation in the financing of young 
entrepreneurship projects, estimated at UA 0.220 million. The breakdown by source of financing is

2.5. Project Beneficiaries and Target Area  

2.5.1 The project area, consisting of the Boffa and Boké Prefectures (A and D hubs), is part of the 
Boké region, located in the North-West of the Republic of Guinea. The Boké region covers an area of 
35 234 km² and has 5 prefectures (Boké, Boffa, Fria, Gaoual and Koundara), 32 rural municipal councils 
(“communes”) and 5 urban municipal councils. The region’s climate is conducive to agriculture, with 
abundant rainfall in coastal areas (2 500-3 000 mm/year) that decreases gradually towards the north to 
800 mm and 1 000 mm in Gaoual and Koundara. Estimated at 1 190 724 inhabitants (INS/Demographic 
Prospects, General Population and Housing Census (RGPH3), 2017 projection), the Boké region 
population is highly cosmopolitan and is primarily engaged in agro-pastoral activities. The average 
population density is 32 inhabitants/km². 

2.5.2 The Boké region is one of the most important bauxite areas in Guinea. Currently, 14 mining 
companies are active in the region, attracting a large number of people to the area (accelerated 
population growth), with growing demand for food and nutrition. Young people, who account for more 
than 60% of the region's population and the bulk of its agricultural workforce, are abandoning 
agriculture and opting for work in the mining sector. They are involved in the social unrest that the area 
has been experiencing because of its status as the bauxite basin par excellence. 

2.5.3 The intervention sites were selected based on an analysis comprising multiple criteria: (i) 
accessibility; (ii) existence of a participatory and community/local operating set-up; (iii) absence of 
latent land conflict; and (iv) overall consistency with project objectives (availability of labour, level of 
organisation and spirit of initiative of future beneficiaries, expertise and participation of women and 
young people). Various types of sites have been pre-identified: (i) development of lowlands: with partial 
control of irrigation water (sites in rice-cultivation lowlands), and with total control of irrigation water 
(Koba sites for rice seed growers and mixed rice cultivation and market gardening areas in the Boké 
area); (ii) mixed areas of rice cultivation and market gardening alternating over the agricultural year 
with total water control; (ii) market gardening areas (wells, solar pumping equipment, loading tank and 
drip irrigation). 



 

8 

2.5.4  The population of the area is mainly engaged in agriculture (rice, maize, cassava, groundnuts, 
sorghum/millet, cowpeas, market garden produce, cashew nuts, etc.), livestock farming and trade. 
Traditional and family-type agriculture faces various challenges, including lack of or dilapidated state 
of facilities, difficulty of accessing factors of production (certified seeds, quality inputs, ploughing and 
post-harvest equipment, etc.) and markets. Women are involved in all rural agricultural activities and 
participate mainly in work on rice fields and market gardens, as well as in produce processing and 
marketing. The project is aimed at small farmers, particularly women and young people, who constitute 
the bulk of the vulnerable segments of the population in terms of food and nutrition insecurity and 
poverty. The project will reach 1 000 young people and women, 5 000 farmers, 200 seed growers, 100 
groups and 20 unions. Other direct targets are artisans, processors, traders, young entrepreneurs, 
students in pilot school canteens, various service providers and NGOs, etc. Through its activities, 
PATAG EAJ will reach 39 252 direct beneficiaries and 247 287 indirect beneficiaries. 

2.6. Participatory Approach for Project Identification, Design and Implementation  

2.6.1 The project design is the result of a participatory process that involved all stakeholders: 
government departments, farmers’ organisations, women's groups, civil society, private sector, TFPs, 
projects, etc. Initiated as part of implementation of PATAG EAJ PPF activities, these broad 
consultations continued during the project preparation and appraisal mission. Consultation meetings 
organised in each of the two prefectures with all the parties (decentralised technical services, NGOs and 
support and advisory associations, local authorities, beneficiary representatives, including women) led 
to a consensual identification of the challenges and needs of the intervention area, and for the two sectors 
concerned. Focused discussions with local institutional and civil society partners and visits to various 
potential sites, followed by working sessions with beneficiaries, including women and young people, 
made it possible to draw up an exhaustive inventory of development needs in the area and to identify 
the support needs for the two sectors and the most appropriate methods of implementation, as well as 
the appropriate measures for the effective action. The sites and activities were chosen following several 
investigations and fruitful discussions with the beneficiaries and other stakeholders. 

2.6.2 This participatory process revealed strong enthusiasm for the project and a broad consensus on 
its design and implementation methods. For instance, farmers reaffirmed the need to fully exploit the 
high potential of the intervention area (land, natural watercourses, mangroves, lowlands, etc.). Women 
emphasised their interest in market gardening, farm produce processing and marketing with 
modernisation of production and processing tools, and improved market access. During visits to various 
sites, stock was taken of existing facilities and infrastructure, and technological options to be adopted 
for their construction/rehabilitation proposed. Developing a good communication plan around PATAG 
EAJ and maintaining the participatory approach during its implementation will ensure that local actors 
take ownership of the project during its execution.  

2.7. Consideration of Bank Group Experience and Lessons Learned in the Project Design  

2.7.1 PATAG EAJ design drew largely from lessons learned from projects executed by the Bank in 
Guinea and the sub-region, with every effort made to reflect the context of the country's fragility and to 
address some of the weaknesses identified during project implementation and highlighted in portfolio 
reviews and completion reports. At the last review conducted in July 2018, the portfolio performance 
was deemed satisfactory, but efforts will have to be made with regard to: (i) the effectiveness timeframes 
(11 months instead of the 6 months recommended by the Bank); (ii) the timely appointment of project 
management teams, including the coordinator and financial management and procurement officers; (iii) 
the lengthy procurement timeframe; (iv) delays in the release of counterpart funding, which impedes 
smooth project execution; (v) the systematic introduction of performance contracts and objective-based 
annual evaluation; (vi) the timely preparation of the baseline situation and deployment of monitoring 
and evaluation systems; and (vii) the availability of studies to improve the quality-at-entry of operations. 

  



 

9 

2.7.2 The Portfolio Performance Improvement Plan (PPIP 2018) also advocates the implementation 
of specific measures to accelerate project execution and the implementation pace. These lessons were 
taken into account in this project, as reflected in: (i) continuous dialogue and close monitoring by the 
Country Office to gradually reduce the long delays and fulfil the conditions for effectiveness; (ii) 
improvement in project quality by supporting the formulation and preparation of the detailed 
designs/competitive bidding documents (APD/BDs) and management and monitoring/evaluation tools 
prior to project start up (with PPF resources); and (iii) building of the procurement and financial 
management capacity of project management teams. It should be noted that the current portfolio has 
become significantly younger in recent years, the average age of operations having dropped from 5.5 
years in 2011 to 2.7 years in 2017. Moreover, the portfolio had no problematic projects (PP) or 
potentially problematic projects (PPPs) in 2017. 

2.7.3 PATAG EAJ was designed to take the following into account: (i) the need to enhance the 
quality-at-entry of the project by making feasibility studies available and by preparing the initial 
competitive bidding documents; (ii) the need to pay special attention to the involvement of local actors, 
notably farmers directly concerned, through an inclusive participatory approach; (iii) the intervention 
of other partners (World Bank, World Food Programme, etc.) to ensure coherence, complementarity 
and synergies in the activities selected; (iv) the need to pay attention to the procurement process and 
methods; and (v) the primordial importance of building the capacity of the different actors. In light of 
the above-mentioned strategic thrusts, special emphasis was also placed on certain thematic areas in 
formulating the project: (a) food and nutrition security; (b) value-chain approach; (c) decent youth 
employment and women's empowerment; and (d) resilience to climate change. All these provisions will 
make it possible to satisfy the design and execution criteria contained in Presidential Directive No. 
002/2015. 

2.8. Key Performance Indicators 

The monitoring and evaluation system of the project's logical framework indicators is part of the 
Ministry of Agriculture’s monitoring and evaluation system. The system will come under the 
supervision of the monitoring and evaluation officer, with the support of Project Management Unit 
experts (rural engineer, value chain expert, etc.), the Prefectural Directorate of Agriculture (DPA) and 
the Rural Engineering Technical Office (BTGR). Particular emphasis will be placed on targeting 
parameters that may be tracked and collected internally, and those relating specifically to women and 
young people (disaggregated data for women and young people). The main performance indicators that 
will be monitored from the baseline scenario include: (i) surface area of lowlands developed for rice 
farming with partial water control; (ii) surface area developed for rice farming with total water control; 
(iii) surface area developed for market gardening; (iv) infrastructure built (number of hectares with drip 
irrigation, number of garden farming hectares protected with grill fences, number of markets 
commissioned, number of kilometres of farm roads, number of product storage warehouses, number of 
input shops, etc.); (v) level of additional production (tonnes) and crop yields (tonnes/hectare); (vi) 
number of farmers (including women) by type of development; (vii) number of demonstration units 
(DUs) and TAATs distributed; (viii) number of farmers’ organisations structured and management 
committees established; (ix) level of increase in farmers' income, including those of women and young 
people; (x) number of jobs for young people and women created through entrepreneurial initiatives and 
number of young entrepreneurs established; (xi) number of farmers, processors and merchants trained 
and organised; (xii) level of involvement of women in decision-making bodies (leadership), and 
women’s rate of access to land following the development; (xiii) number of processing units established 
and allocated (including to women); and (xiv) number of nutrition activities and school canteens 
supported, and level of impact on food and nutrition security. The indicators selected for the project will 
be aligned on those selected under PNIASAN and will be used to assess the impact of the project on 
fragility, resilience and inclusion. The Bank’s various supervision missions and periodic progress 
reports will reflect the level of achievement of the indicators.

III- Project Feasibility  

3.1. Financial and Economic Performance 

Table 3:  Key Economic and Financial Data 

NPV (baseline scenario) GNF 20 370 million  
IRR (baseline scenario) 12.7% 
ERR (baseline scenario) 18.8% 

 

3.1.1 The project’s financial and economic analysis was conducted based on the cost/benefit of the 
additional cash flow from the production models of the two priority sectors (rice and market gardening). 
The following assumptions were used: (i) the period for evaluating the impact of PATAG EAJ is 25 
years; (ii) the average basic prices, yields and production costs of the 2016/2017 crop year were selected 
for the baseline scenario and realistic projections were made covering up to full project development, 
taking into account the existing potential and the absorptive capacity of beneficiaries; (iii) additional 
income was determined by calculating the difference between the baseline scenario and the “with-
project” scenario, based on gross proceeds minus production costs; (iv) an equal inflation rate was 
selected for jobs and resources on the cash flow table; (v) for the calculation of the economic rate of 
return, a cost correction coefficient was added for factors related to distortions inherent in customs 
duties. The detailed assumptions of the financial and economic analysis, the tables of the operating 
models (baseline scenario and “with-project” scenario) and financial and economic flows are presented 
in Annex B7 of Volume 2. The results of the financial and economic analysis show that PATAG EAJ 
is financially and economically sustainable.  

3.1.2 Financial performance: The hydro-agricultural improvements and land exploitation will 
generate additional production of approximately 1 030 tonnes of paddy rice, 210 tonnes of certified 
seeds and about 2 000 tonnes of market gardening products, in addition to creating 3 500 permanent 
jobs. The additional income resulting from the various development and farming models selected are 
the following: (i) lowlands with partial water control (rice): GNF 3 205 641 per ha; (ii) lowlands with 
total water control (double cropping for rice seeds): GNF 10 309 850 per ha; (iv) lowlands with total 
water control (double cropping for rice and one cropping for market gardening): GNF 12 325 695 per 
ha; and (v) irrigated market gardening: GNF 24 326 025 per ha. The overall additional income generated 
will help to increase the value added brought about by the project, thus increasing the project's 
contribution to agricultural GDP. The financial internal rate of return (IRR) is estimated at 12.7% for a 
NPV of GNF 20 370 million. 

3.1.3 Economic Performance: The basic economic rate of return (ERR) stands at 18.8%, for a net 
present value (NPV) of GNF 71 691 million and a cost-benefit ratio (CBR) is 1.81. This result is 
significant, especially since some benefits could not be included in the calculations due to the lack of 
data to permit their evaluation, notably improvements in living conditions and food security brought 
about by increased income and food availability, the effects of watershed and environmental protection 
measures, capacity building in other types of economic activities carried out by the beneficiaries and 
the multiplier effects on sector actors (suppliers of inputs, equipment, services, etc.). Sensitivity tests 
were performed based on the assumption of a possible escalation in costs (10%), a decline in agricultural 
production with the risk of non-adoption of farming techniques by farmers (10%), and a reduction in 
the benefits generated by the rehabilitation of agricultural products and  agricultural infrastructure, and 
the availability of processing and storage units for agricultural products (10%). Based on the results 
summarised in Annex B7 of Volume 2, the EIRR seems insensitive to any decreases in the benefits 
generated by rice and market gardening productions (-10%) (for an IRR of 16.6%), in storage, 
processing and rural roads infrastructure (-10%) (for an IRR of 18.5%). Similarly, a possible escalation 
(+10%) in investment and maintenance costs reduces the IRR to 16.8%. 



 

11 

3.1.4 The project’s other economic impacts may be summarised as follows: (i) upstream effects of 
additional income on service providers (NGOs, businesses, suppliers, consulting firms); (ii) downstream 
effects of the generation of additional income on producers, traders and processors who are essentially 
women; (iii) decrease in foreign exchange costs owing to the sharp drop of rice import costs in the trade 
balance; and (iv) impact on wealth creation in the country due to the increase in GDP resulting from the 
generation of additional value added. For households, project benefits will translate into, among other 
things, better nutrition for vulnerable groups (children, women of childbearing age and the elderly); 
lower medical bills and reduction of the difficulty of farm work, especially for women, decline in the 
incidence of monetary and non-monetary poverty; strengthening of livelihoods and the resilience of 
PATAG EAJ targets in relation to food insecurity and the effects of climate change.  

3.2. Environmental and Social Impact 

3.2.1 Environment: The project is classified in Category 2 under the Bank's Environmental and 
Social Safeguards Policies. It was subjected to an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment, the 
summary of which was posted on the Bank's Website on 12 September 2018. PATAG EAJ activities 
will be carried out in 18 areas located in the Boffa and Boké Prefectures. The project’s environmental 
impacts will be minimal given the relatively modest size of the infrastructure/development and their 
distribution across several locations. Moreover, the impact assessment reveals that the project 
implementation will be really beneficial for the socioeconomic development of the Boké and Boffa 
Prefectures since it will enable: (i) better management of soil and water resources, thanks to technical 
supervision of the irrigation methods and the rational distribution of the water to the plots, which will 
limit their over-exploitation and degradation; (ii) proper water control through adapted and appropriate 
(environmentally friendly) facilities, and the use of renewable energy; (iii) the reduction of agricultural 
land degradation, water and soil conservation, the development of vegetation cover, through the 
installation of erosion-control structures; and (iv) the development/promotion of new technologies and 
resilient/smart practices. In short, the project’s physical activities will cause no major environmental 
and social impacts. The impacts, if any, will be very short-lived on the receiving environments and on 
the environmental components as a whole. The summary of the Environmental and Social Management 
Plan (ESMP) was posted on the Bank's Website on 15 October 2018. 

3.2.2 Climate change: The project complies with the Bank's climate protection policies since the 
climate risks have been identified. The programme’s climate sensitivity has been analysed in accordance 
with the Climate Screening and Adaptation Review and Evaluation Procedures Booklet and the Climate 
Safeguards System (CSS). Based on the preliminary analysis of project activities, some operations will 
be more sensitive than others. The roads and facilities will be more climate-sensitive than other 
infrastructure. The design of the roads that will be built will incorporate engineering structures to ensure 
the normal flow of waterways crossed by the roads. In addition, the longitudinal and transverse profiles 
of feeder roads will be so designed as to facilitate the evacuation of water that falls or flows onto the 
road surface and to avoid water stagnation along the right-of-way. The building materials that will be 
used should promote a good compaction level that can strengthen the adhesion of different primary 
particles to reduce their crumbling with the falling of exceptional showers. In building supporting 
infrastructure for the agricultural sector other than the roads, account will be taken of their likely 
exposure to hazards (high winds, rising temperatures, exceptional rainfall, etc.). In addition, the project 
will favour the use of solar energy for dewatering in irrigated areas and for operating the equipment that 
will be installed. This alternative will make project activities cleaner and greener. 

3.2.3 Involuntary Resettlement: PATAG EAJ activities will not lead to any people resettlement or 
restriction of access to goods and livelihoods. 

3.2.4 Gender: Women play a major role in the agricultural economy, and are found throughout the 
value chain from production, processing to marketing. However, they face major constraints in gaining 
access to resources and factors of production, including land, inputs, fertilisers, financing, new 
technologies and extension services. As a result, they work under less favourable conditions compared 



 

12 

to men, which considerably undermines their performance. In rural areas, the income gap between men 
and women in the agricultural sector may be as high as 50%. To address the gender disparities described 
in the above gender analysis, PATAG EAJ pays specific attention to women's strategic interests and 
aims to improve their socioeconomic status in the two regions covered by the project. 

3.2.5 Based on consultations and exchanges with individual women and women's groups, as well as 
with other partners involved in the agricultural value chain and entrepreneurship, the project will 
implement the following activities: (i) Build capacity in  agricultural production, entailing the 
development of 237 ha of lowlands for rice cultivation that will enable women to have at least two rice 
seasons and one market gardening season per year;  development of 46 ha strictly for market gardening, 
of which 15 ha will be for women's market gardening activities, and 50 ha for the production of rice 
seeds. In addition, 30% of the rice schemes to be developed will be reserved for women's groups. 
Despite the strong involvement of women in the rice-farming sector, the management of rice farms 
remains a male preserve (only 9% of rice areas are managed by women). To address this situation, the 
project will train all women and men directly affected by the project (5000 producers), on issues 
pertaining to land tenure security and women's right to acquire land. An awareness campaign on the 
respect of the community's right of use and conflict prevention and management mechanisms will be 
organised to facilitate support for rice producer groups to acquire land and title deeds in newly 
developed areas. The project also includes a package of integrated services for women and young 
people, aimed at improving their access to socioeconomic infrastructure and innovative production 
technologies. Through the rehabilitation of rural roads, the project will help to open up the Boké and 
Boffa areas and facilitate the evacuation of agricultural products to the markets. Socioeconomic 
infrastructure (rural markets, processing units, market gardens and storage warehouses) will be provided 
primarily for the benefit of women and young people, with a view to improving their working 
conditions, easing their tasks, strengthening their economic empowerment, and improving food and 
nutrition security. The project will apply affirmative action in favour of women and vulnerable groups, 
wherever local traditions tend to exclude them from decision-making bodies or from certain benefits. 
Generally, the project will ensure that women are included when it comes to access to factors of 
production (managed land, agricultural inputs, equipment and production equipment), organisation and 
management of the new infrastructure (shops, markets, etc.), and training. Therefore, the project will 
help to strengthen women's economic autonomy and decision-making power; (ii) Enhance skills in 
agricultural production and processing, management, marketing and market access, which entails 
developing the skills of women and young people through the dissemination of Technologies for 
African Agricultural Transformation (TAAT), with focus on production and processing. Skills will also 
be developed in management, packaging, marketing and networking for market access, procurement 
and inventory management, leadership and entrepreneurship. In this regard, study tours will be 
organised for women engaged in processing to enable them to draw on the experience of neighbouring 
countries such as Burkina Faso; and (iii) Entrepreneurship, job creation and leadership and market 
access for women and young people: Increasing production and improving processing conditions will 
rekindle young people's interest in the agricultural sector, which will reduce youth unemployment rates. 
Women and young people will be trained in business plan development and given the support needed 
to set up their own businesses. In addition, women in the processing sector will be put in touch with 
private economic operators that have been identified as well as with WFP to ensure the direct purchase 
of their products. The project is classified in Category 2, according to the Gender Marker System. The 
budget allocated to specific gender promotion and economic empowerment activities stands at 
approximately UA 2.7 million. Details on the gender analysis are provided in the Technical Annex on 
gender. 

3.2.6 Nutrition: The project will develop initiatives to improve the hygiene and nutritional quality 
of food consumed by the people, especially by women and children, and will collaborate with the World 
Food Programme (WFP) to supply school canteens with food products from the area. The additional 
production of rice (1 000 tonnes) and horticultural products (2 000 tonnes) will help to improve feeding 
and nutrition, and hence the people’s health. Incorporating direct nutrition events into project activities 



 

13 

is essential to impacting the people’s nutritional status. Furthermore, activities aimed at supporting 
product quality, labelling and certification will help to improve the nutritional intake. Activities to 
prevent the resurgence of waterborne diseases and rice urticating caterpillars will also contribute to 
improving the health and nutrition of the local population.  

3.2.7 Social: The different activities implemented under the project (improved access to factors of 
production, technical routes for production, processing and marketing) will considerably help to 
enhance food and nutrition security and improve income levels, thereby significantly reducing the 
incidence of poverty. The project will further strengthen the connectivity between producers and the 
market through partnerships that will be beneficial to all stakeholders of the rice and horticulture value 
chains. Enhancing food security through the developments, coupled with awareness raising concerning 
dietary best practice, will help  to improve the people’s nutritional status, particularly that of  vulnerable 
groups such as women of childbearing age and children below the age of five. The rehabilitation of 
roads, construction of the storage/conservation warehouses, rehabilitation of the markets and the support 
of the processing units, will contribute to reducing post-harvest losses (expected to decline by at least 
30%), as well as facilitate product marketing. As a result, the income of households will increase, putting 
them in a better position to bear food, health and education expenses. By making it easier for 
beneficiaries to participate in decision-making processes and to secure land (management of community 
infrastructure, management of conflicts between farmers and herders, maintenance of access roads, 
etc.), the project will also bolster the local development process and promote good governance. Project 
activities will lead to: (i) a 19% increase in the people’s income; (ii) the creation of 3 526 direct decent 
jobs, including 147 in agricultural development works, 2780 in entrepreneurship and SME 
strengthening activities, and 600 temporary jobs; (iii) the creation of self-promotion capacity among 
project beneficiaries in terms of rural development operations in agricultural value chains; (iv) increased 
accountability and the development of human resources, leading to better organisation of rural 
communities; and (v) promotion of small operators (workmen, craftsmen, agricultural workers, micro-
enterprises), following the experience acquired by associations from participating in works 
implementation. The number of direct and indirect project beneficiaries is estimated at 39 252 and 247 
287, respectively. The increase in income will benefit the most vulnerable rural households, as they will 
henceforth be in a better position to bear the food, health and education expenses. Overall, by improving 
living conditions, the project will help to reduce rural poverty and exodus by retaining the people, 
especially the youths, in the localities. 

3.2.8 The promotion of rural entrepreneurship among young people and women (nearly 100 persons 
targeted) will help to develop the entrepreneurial culture among project initiators with a view to 
increasing income, creating decent jobs and promoting leadership among young people and women. 
The development of agricultural entrepreneurship will improve the attractiveness of the rural 
environment and create several production hubs in the area. This will produce concrete results and 
ensure the sustainability of the activities. The project will also facilitate the access of young promoters 
to critical materials, equipment and inputs (basic kits), depending on their business plans and areas of 
specialisation. The training will provide basic concepts and will include specialisation modules. There 
will also be tailor-made training designed to address the specific needs identified. 

IV- Implementation 

4.1. Implementation Arrangements 

4.1.1 Implementation modalities: Project implementation will be overseen by an autonomous 
Project Management Unit (PMU), comprising a small team based in Boké and placed under the 
supervisory authority of the Ministry of Agriculture (MA). The Ministry shall exercise its authority 
through the National Directorate of Agriculture (DNA), which shall be responsible for the technical 
supervision. The team will be recruited through a call for candidature and will include: (i) a project 
coordinator; (ii) a responsible for monitoring and evaluation; (iii) a rural engineering specialist, 
responsible for monitoring the implementation of agricultural infrastructure works; (iv) a value chain 



 

14 

expert, specialised in farmers' organisations and gender issues; (v) an administrative and financial 
officer; (vi) a procurement specialist; and (vii) an accountant. All experts will sign a performance 
contract that will be evaluated annually. 

4.1.2 The Technical Directorates of the Ministry of Agriculture will monitor the implementation of 
operations in consultation with decentralised services. Partnership agreements will be signed with 
DNGR (infrastructure monitoring), ANPROCA (advisory support and PO), IRAG (research 
development), AGUIPE (youth employment and entrepreneurship), etc. The Strategy and Development 
Bureau (BSD) will be responsible for project external monitoring. These entities will receive capacity-
building support and will adjust their operational mechanisms, if need be, to allow close monitoring on 
the ground. An agreement will also be established with BGEEE for project environmental monitoring. 
The project will also ensure the close involvement of Prefectural Directorates of Agriculture and the 
Rural Engineering Technical Office (BTGR) of Boké and Boffa. Private service providers (enterprises, 
consulting firms, NGOs, individual consultants, etc.) will be responsible for the delivery of certain 
works, goods and services, in accordance with the procurement methods defined in the financing 
agreements. The local population will take part in some labour-intensive works (ring dike, hedgerows 
and routine maintenance), under the supervision of specialised NGOs and with the support of the 
Directorate General of Forests and Wildlife. 

4.1.4 Supervision of activities: A Steering Committee will be set up, chaired by the Minister of 
Agriculture or a designated representative. The Committee’s secretarial services will be provided by the 
Project Coordinator. In addition to the relevant technical directorates of the Ministry of Agriculture, the 
Steering Committee will comprise (indicative only) designated representatives of MPDE, MEF, 
MASPFE, ME, MPAEM, MEEF, METFPET, MC, MIPSP, and representatives of the Chamber of 
Agriculture and CNOP-G, the private sector and civil society. Its function will include: (i) monitoring 
the project implementation; (ii) ensuring coherence and planning of eligible activities; (iii) conducting 
the annual review of the progress report, and approving the annual technical programme and budget; 
(iv) evaluating the project impact; (v) identifying constraints to and opportunities for improving the 
project impact; and (vi) ensuring technical and methodological compliance with project objectives, 
PNDES objectives and relevant sector policies, including the PNIASAN and the rice development 
strategy. The Steering Committee will meet twice a year to review project outcomes, validate financial 
statements, discuss programmes and approve the related budgets.  

4.1.5 Procurement. Goods, works and consultancy services financed by the Bank will be procured 
in accordance with the Procurement Policy for Bank Group-Financed Operations (AfDB Procurement 
Policy), October 2015 edition, and the provisions set out in the Financing Agreement. In line with this 
policy and following various evaluations conducted, it was agreed that procurement of goods, works 
and services under the project be made using the Bank's procurement system (AfDB System). 

4.1.6 Procurement Risk and Capacity Assessment (PRCA): In order to take project specificities 
into account, the Bank assessed: (i) risks at country, sector and project levels; and (ii) the capacity of 
the executing agencies. The outcomes of these assessments pointed to the existence of a substantial level 
of procurement risk. Therefore, the Bank's procurement methods and procedures will be used for project 
implementation, with the understanding that the capacity development action plan proposed in 
paragraph B.5.9 of Annex B5, Volume 2, will be discussed with the Guinean authorities so that the latter 
may carry out the reforms identified as necessary to expedite the use of the national procurement system. 

4.1.7 Financial management: Given that the public management system in force at the Ministry of 
Agricultural was deemed unsatisfactory upon assessment, a parallel accounting system based on the 
SYSCOHADA accrual accounting method will be set up and managed by the PMU responsible for 
project administrative, financial and accounting management. In addition to the other experts, the PMU 
in charge of PATAG EAJ will comprise an administrative and financial officer (AFO) who will have at 
his/her disposal the management tools that were procured under the PATAG EAJ PPF. These tools, 
comprising the administrative, financial and accounting procedures manual, and the accounting 



 

15 

management software, will be developed and staff trained in their use. The AFO will produce quarterly 
financial monitoring reports providing details on the implementation of project activities and the use of 
financial resources, and an annual financial statements consisting of the balance sheet, the consolidated 
financial statements, the status of the capital assets and notes to the financial statements to which the 
reconciliation statement of the special account will be appended. Training on Bank financial 
management requirements will be provided by Bank experts at the project launch.  

4.1.8 Disbursements: Project financial implementation will mainly involve the reimbursement, 
special account and direct payment methods. An account will be opened with a commercial bank 
acceptable to the Bank to receive part of the TSF loan resources and will be used to finance operating 
expenses. This special account will be used for an initial advance whose amount will be determined 
based on the estimated budget for six months of project activities. The special account will be 
replenished on the same basis after the Borrower must have justified the use of at least 50% of the 
amount of the previous advance. The direct payment method will be used for disbursements relating to 
goods, services and works contracts. Training in Bank disbursement rules and procedures will be 
provided at the project launch  

4.1.9 Audit: In accordance with the general conditions applicable to African Development Fund 
financing agreements, the country shall account for the use of the resources allocated. Therefore, an 
independent and competent external audit firm will verify once a year the reliability of the consolidated 
annual financial statements prepared by the project management team, and will assess the functioning 
of the internal oversight system of the entire project. The audit firm will be recruited according Bank 
terms of reference and following a competitive bidding procedure prescribed by the Bank. The terms of 
reference shall be subject to the Bank’s prior approval. The continuation of audit services during the 
last two years will be contingent on the Bank's validation of the audit report for the first year. The audit 
expenses will be financed with ADF resources. Audit reports will be forwarded to the Bank yearly latest 
six months following the close of the audited fiscal year.  

4.2. Monitoring  

4.2.1 Monitoring mechanisms: The project’s monitoring and evaluation mechanism will be 
integrated into the PNIASAN monitoring mechanism of the Ministry of Agriculture. It will be designed 
taking into account the common target indicators adopted in the project logical framework to enable the 
production of homogeneous and regular information (on a half-yearly basis) on the operations. The 
baseline situation will be consolidated through the Project Preparation Facility (PPF), with gender-
disaggregated data. This system will be participatory and will provide regular information on 
performance and impact indicators, as well as on the implementation of activities planned. The project 
partners will be systematically involved in the data collection and monitoring effort. A baseline situation 
will be established, based on the final hydro-agricultural sites selected. The monitoring and evaluation 
framework will systematically include gender-disaggregated data to highlight the impacts on women, 
young people and the most vulnerable groups. Targeted surveys will also be conducted to better 
understand issues relating to income, food security, nutrition, job creation, gender mainstreaming,  
vulnerability, and resilience. The information collected will be fed into the computerized monitoring 
and evaluation system to capture actual values and gauge project impacts and outcomes. This 
information will be recorded in periodic progress reports, highlighting the level of project progress and 
the achievement of outcomes. External monitoring and evaluation missions involving the relevant sector 
departments and the Strategy and Development Bureau (BSD) will also be organised regularly by the 
Government, in addition to the two annual supervision missions fielded by the African Development 
Bank with support from its Conakry Office. The ESMP will be monitored by the Guinean 
Environmental Studies and Evaluation Bureau (BGEEE).

4.3. Governance 

4.3.1 Indicators of political, economic and social governance remain mixed in Guinea, despite the 
strides made in recent years. The country’s weak performance in terms of governance and combatting 
corruption generally translates into a higher frequency of political and institutional hazards. The trend 
of the corruption perception index indicates that despite the slight improvements witnessed over the 
past five years (2012-2017), the situation remains virtually unchanged. Guinea is ranked 148th out of 
180 countries with an average score of 25, compared with a regional average of 34. 

4.3.2 As part of PATAG EAJ implementation, and with a view to mitigating the risks inherent in the 
weaknesses highlighted, capacity building for actors and institutional support are envisaged as a means 
of contributing to sector good governance. Furthermore, it was decided that financial management and 
monitoring/evaluation tools would be developed and the PMU team recruited through a call for 
candidature prior to project start up. In addition, although progress has been made in aligning the 
procurement system on WAEMU guidelines, the sluggishness of the procurement system is one of the 
major weaknesses encountered during the implementation of development projects. With regard to 
procurement, operational arrangements were adopted to address the weaknesses observed.  

4.4. Sustainability  

The sustainability of project investments mainly relates to the beneficiaries' ability to regularly and 
sustainably maintain and manage the infrastructure. In this regard, the project will pay special attention 
to the quality and sustainability of the facilities that will be put in place. Transformative works will be 
carried out based on detailed technical studies and using qualified companies or specialised jobbers. 
Other activities that will contribute to the sustainability of structures relate to the security of tenure over 
the land needed for the structures, support for the organisation of beneficiaries, provision of 
management tools to ensure better maintenance, support of recurrent costs of infrastructure (hydro-
agricultural development, markets, shops, farm road, etc.), and strengthening the structuring of 
producers both men and women. The management committees will be offered technical skills, for the 
introduction of an annual fee that allows the management of facilities and building maintenance fund. 
The managerial, accounting and logistical capacity of these entities will be built to enable them, upon 
project completion and in the long term, to become autonomous enterprises capable of initiating income-
generating activities in such areas as maintenance of structures, mechanics, transportation, agricultural 
product processing, etc. Moreover, the developments will enhance the people's adaptation and resilience 
capacity in the face of recurrent climate risks, as well as reduce the economic vulnerability of the 



 

17 

beneficiaries. The strong motivation observed among the beneficiaries during field missions is a factor 
that guarantees the sustainability of the facilities and the participation of beneficiaries in all activities 
and maintenance works. Other project activities that will contribute to its sustainability include land 
security for the facilities, support for the organisation of beneficiaries and the availability of 
management tools to ensure better maintenance, support of the recurrent costs of infrastructure (hydro-
agricultural development, markets, shops, farm roads, etc.), and strengthening of producer 
organisations. In addition, the activities included in the rural entrepreneurship promotion, 
transformation and market access components will generate value added and wealth, which are factors 
that would foster the ownership of project developments by the direct beneficiaries. 

4.5. Risk Management  

Besides the risk posed to this project and to other operations of the portfolio (i.e. the risk of political 
instability coupled with a difficult economic situation), several other risks were identified, for which 
mitigation measures are proposed. 

Risk Mitigation Measure Level 
Political instability, coupled with a 
difficult economic situation  

Contribution to improving socioeconomic and environmental 
resilience for greater stability. High 

Low mobilisation of counterpart resources   Counterpart resources limited to providing premises and paying the salaries of project employees. Low 

Inadequate commitment on the part of 
technical services of the relevant 
Ministries and weak capacity of the 
Project Coordination Unit (PCU) 

Prior involvement of technical services in PPF preparation from the 
project preparation phase; provision of support and capacity 
building services; recruitment of PCU staff on a competitive basis 
and establishment of performance contracts. 

Low 

Procurement and works implementation 
delays  

Enhancement of quality-at-entry through the use of the PPF 
mechanism; use of the delegated contracting management method 
(this will be confirmed at the end of the evaluation mission); and 
use of the community labour system. 

Moderate 

Inadequate ownership by the beneficiaries 

Involvement of beneficiaries in the selection of sites, clarification 
of land tenancy through an inclusive social assessment process, 
structuring and training of Management and Maintenance 
Committees 

Moderate 

Risks of conflicts between farmers and 
transhumant herders 

Involvement of municipalities in the management of cattle 
corridors, development of reception areas for transhumant herders 
and protection of facilities. 

Moderate 

Weaknesses in financial management and 
monitoring/evaluation 

Prior preparation of the procedures manual and establishment of the 
monitoring and evaluation mechanism as part of the PPF. Moderate  

4.6. Knowledge Building  

PATAG EAJ operations that will lead to better knowledge management and building may be 
summarised as follows: (i) strengthening of local expertise in local community resilience and 
adaptability to the recurrent impacts of climate change, through hydro-agricultural works and better 
water resource management; (ii) dissemination of new production and processing technologies: 
dissemination of improved seeds and resilient farming techniques, development of drip irrigation and 
solar pumping techniques, dissemination of new technologies for processing agricultural products,  and 
promotion of mechanisation; (iii) the establishment of demonstration units and the dissemination of best 
practice will help to protect and preserve resources, and mitigate the vulnerability of soil resources; (iv) 
support for quality improvement and labelling/certification will help to ensure compliance with norms 
and standards that promote access to new markets; (v) organisation of workshops and exchange of visits, 
as tools for interaction between researchers, support staff and producers for the purpose of adapting 
technologies to the local context;  (vi) conduct of awareness and information campaigns through various 
communication channels (community radios, media programmes, websites, films, etc.); and (vi) 
promotion of innovative youth and women's employability actions.

Overview 

Programme Name: Inclusive and Sustainable Development Support Programme for Agricultural 

Sectors in Morocco (PADIDFA).  

Scope and Sector: National Territory / Inter-sector.  

Overall Schedule: May 2018 – December 2019.  

Operational instrument /Financing: Sector Budget Support / EUR 200 million to be disbursed in two 

tranches (2018 and 2019). 

Programme 

Outcomes 

The objective of PADIDFA is to help boost agricultural sector competitiveness with a view to ensuring 

inclusive and sustainable economic growth by promoting value chains, employment creation, 

improvement of the business climate and sustainable natural resource management. It builds on two 

components: (1) “Support to job creation through the development of agricultural and agro-industrial 

sub-sectors” which will ensure: (i) skills development for access to employment in agricultural and agro-

industrial sectors; (ii) improvement of the investment climate and youth and female entrepreneurship in 

rural areas; and (iii) support for the structuring of agricultural sectors, processing of agricultural products, 

the development of agro-industry and exports; (2) “Support lasting rural employment through sustainable 

use of natural resources by the agricultural sector” which will ensure: (i) the strengthening of sustainable 

agricultural sector governance; (ii) improvement of water resource management to mitigate water stress 

and boost sustainability; and (iii) Support for energy transition in the agricultural sector.  

 

The implementation of these reforms will make it possible to support, by 2020, the following major 

outcomes: (i) Support to agricultural exports; (ii) Contribution to poverty reduction in rural areas; (iii) 

Mobilisation of additional private investments in the Sector Programme Contracts; (iv) Job creation for 

youth and women (nearly 3,000 jobs) ; (v) Irrigation Water Saving (a total of 990 million m3 in 2020) ; 

(vi) Extension of the use of renewable energies (solar pumping for 100,000 ha in 2020; (vii) Promotion

in rural areas; (ix) Formal recognition of all inter-professional associations in 2020 (21 inter-professional 

associations); (x) Validation of a Sustainable Development Action Plan for at least four key sectors 

(agriculture, water, energy, industry, etc.) by 2020; (xi) Annual training and qualification of nearly 300 

trainers, 2,600 graduates as young agricultural workers or technicians, and certification of approximately 

10,000 young daughters and sons of farmers benefiting from apprenticeship training. 

 

Alignment with 

Bank Priorities  

This sector budget support operation is fully aligned with the Bank's "High 5s", and directly contributes 

to creating an enabling environment for achieving the following three High 5s: "Feed Africa", "Integrate 

Africa" and "Improve the living conditions of the people of Africa". It also supports the green and 

inclusive growth objectives of the AfDB's Ten-Year Strategy for 2013-2022.  It is perfectly consistent 

with Morocco's Country Strategy Paper (CSP) for the period 2017-2021, more particularly its Pillar II to 

"Improve living conditions through jobs for youth, women and in rural areas". PADIDFA is aligned on 

the Bank's Agriculture and Agro-Industries Sector "Feed Africa" Strategy. In particular, it supports the 

inclusive development of value chains and the sustainable promotion of strategic value chains. Lastly, 

PADIDFA is in line with the Bank's Gender Strategy (2014-2018) "Investing in Gender Equality for 

Africa's Transformation", particularly on Pillar II "Economic Empowerment". PADIDFA would also 

support the thrusts of the new economic model and is fully in line with the process of establishing the 

advanced regionalization system launched by the Government. The approach emphasizes 

interdependence and complementarity between agriculture, the environment, employment, water and 

energy to promote harmonious and sustainable economic and social development.  

Needs 

Assessment and 

Rationale 

Since 2008, Morocco has undertaken structural reforms to support the Green Morocco Plan. The Bank 

contributed to the Green Morocco Plan through two budget support operations (PAMV 1 and PAPMV 

2) which generated positive results. Based on lessons learned, PADIDFA adopts a holistic approach 

aimed at stimulating intra- and inter-sector synergies and complementarities within the Green Morocco 

Plan Ecosystem (E-PMV) and between the upstream and downstream sectors of agricultural value 

chains. Emphasis is laid on interactions and complementary synergies between the Green Morocco Plan 

(PMV) and other sector strategies, with a view to achieving common and shared objectives. This 

approach involves inter-sector design and a quest for convergence and consistency between the policies 

of stakeholder ministries (agriculture, employment, environment, water, energy, industry, etc.). 

Accordingly, this operation is a truly inclusive and sustainable ecosystem for the Green Morocco 

Plan. Based on these considerations, the proposed support programme would represent a new generation 

of inter-sector budget support. Essentially, it will engage in selective and optimal targeting of the main 

components of E-PMV in a bid to support accelerated, inclusive and sustainable growth, amplify the 

dynamics driven by PAPMV 1 and 2, consolidate the achievements made and strengthen stakeholder 

mobilization to attain the appropriate objectives. It is not a mere counterpart to the implementation of a 

reform package. Rather, it fully fits into the national sustainable development policy and proposes to 



 

vii 

 

bring real value added to national policy implementation by systematically strengthening the 

convergence and overall consistency of sector policies relevant to the agricultural and rural sector.  

Harmonisation 

During the preparation of this budget support, the Bank's team met with major donors in order to promote 

potential synergies and complementarities within the framework of this operation. Thus, this programme 

is designed in coordination with other donors, more particularly the World Bank, which recently 

approved results-based financing in December 2017 (USD 200 million) aimed at promoting agricultural 

value chains. The same applies to the European Union Delegation (D-EU) in Morocco, which supports 

the VMP in addition to other bilateral financing (in particular KfW, AFD, JICA, BTC, etc.). Generally 

speaking, donor coordination in Morocco is very satisfactory and takes the form of formal dialogue and 

exchange frameworks, of which the Bank is an active member. In addition, thematic groups, led either 

by the partners or by the administration, meet regularly to coordinate activities related to sector 

operations. 

Bank’s Value 

Added 

The rationale for PADIDFA is the importance of agriculture in the Moroccan economy and its impact 

on employment, especially women’s and youth employment in rural areas, and its role in adaptation to 

climate change and water stress. It follows upon and consolidates the two phases of support to the Green 

Morocco Plan (PAPMV-1 & 2), implemented over the 2012-2017 period, and a welter of interventions 

contribute to the inclusion and sustainability of the Green Morocco Ecosystem Plan (E-PMV) which 

require synergies and complementarities with other sectors. The promotion of agricultural sectors will 

enable Moroccan agriculture to play a pivotal role in the country's economic and social development. 

The Bank is better placed to support Morocco in the reforms of this sector given the investments it has 

financed, the numerous technical assistance operations provided and the success of the two budget 

support operations (80% of the measures fully implemented for PAPMV-1 and 91% for PAPMV-2). The 

choice of this instrument will also provide the government with the necessary financial resources to 

implement its development policy and continue its reform efforts with the Bank's support and assistance. 

Contribution to 

Gender Equality 

and Women’s 

Empowerment   

The acceleration of the Green Morocco Plan and sustainability of its achievements will create lasting 

jobs, especially for youth and women, and build the institutional capacities of women's and youth 

organizations. This will have a positive impact on the standard of living of these target groups. Particular 

attention is paid in this programme to the capacity of agricultural sectors to generate additional 

employment, especially for rural women and youth. This requires a series of measures to improve the 

provision of training, adapt it to the needs of the rural world and promote entrepreneurship in rural areas. 

Policy Dialogue 

and Related 

Technical 

Assistance    

PADIDFA's preparation benefited from wide-ranging consultations, which enabled quality dialogue with 

all stakeholders, in particular the Moroccan authorities, trade associations, the private sector and civil 

society. These stakeholders were actively involved in the programme’s design by focusing on a 

participatory and inter-sector approach that allows the views of the sectors to be superimposed and 

potential convergences to be identified. The quest for ownership of the measures was at the heart of the 

design process. This process was reinforced during the preparation and appraisal by the organisation of 

consultation and validation workshops with all the actors concerned (seven administrative departments 

and representatives of the trade associations) to discuss the proposed measures, their relevance and the 

expected impact. This consultation will be continued during implementation through the inter-sector 

steering committee.

I. INTRODUCTION: PROPOSAL 

1.1. This is a proposal to grant a EUR 200 million loan to fund the Inclusive and Sustainable 

Development Support Programme for Agricultural Sectors (PADIDFA). It is a sector budget support 

operation in two tranches to be executed over the 2018-2019 period to help achieve the objectives of the 

Green Morocco Plan (PMV). The programme entails consolidation and deepening of reforms already 

implemented under PAPMV-1 & 2 between June 2012 and September 2017. Its design is informed by 

lessons from Phases I and II of PAPMV (cf. 4.4.3), the principles of the Paris Declaration as well as good 

practice principles for the application of conditionality. It will supplement other programmes financed by 

the World Bank, the European Union and bilateral funds (AFD, JICA, KfW, CTB, etc. see Annex 5).  

1.2.  The programme objective is to contribute to the creation of sustainable jobs in the rural 

areas of Morocco by boosting agricultural sector competitiveness through the promotion of value 

chains, improvement of the business climate and sustainable natural resource management. 
PADIDFA is based on Morocco’s various strategic orientations and is consistent with the second pillar of 

CSP 2017-2021 by supporting the improvement of living conditions through employment for youth, 

women and rural areas.  

1.3.  The programme is intended to sustain and consolidate the achievements of the Green 

Morocco Plan, and launch its acceleration phase (2017-2020). It helps the authorities with the 

formulation and implementation of inter-sector strategic reforms to strengthen the social and 

environmental dimensions of the PMV and promote inclusion, sustainability and competitiveness in 

Morocco’s agricultural sector.  

II. COUNTRY CONTEXT 

2.1. Political Situation and Governance Context 

2.1.1 Since adoption of its new Constitution in July 2011, Morocco has enjoyed outstanding 

stability while implementing reforms in tandem with multiparty politics. The September 2015 

regional and municipal elections were an important step towards implementing the decentralization 

process enshrined in the new Constitution. The October 2016 parliamentary elections resulted in the 

victory of the Justice and Development Party (PJD). In March 2017, Mr. El Othmani was appointed Head 

of Government by the King and a new Government was formed on 5 April 2017.  

2.1.2 In the last decade, Morocco recorded highly satisfactory results in good governance and 

corruption control. On 28 December 2015, it adopted the National Anti-Corruption Strategy that covers 

various aspects, including the improvement of institutional and legal measures, the implementation of 

preventive and enforcement measures, and the strengthening of community education and awareness-

raising. In November 2017, the decree to establish the Anti-Corruption Commission, placed under the 

authority of the Head of the Government, was published in the Official Gazette.  

2.2. Recent Economic Trends, Macroeconomic and Budgetary Analysis 

2.2.1 In 2017, the estimated real GDP growth rate of the Kingdom of Morocco was 4.1%. That 

year was characterized by an exceptionally good agricultural season. Hence, the Ministry of Agriculture 

announced in September that the overall cereal output reached 96 million quintals (compared to 33.5 

million in 2016), representing an increase of 187%. This was the fourth best cereal output in the country 

since the launch of the Green Morocco Plan in 2008 that has expanded the use of certified seeds and 

targeted areas best suited for cereal farming. Hence, real GDP growth in 2017 was largely driven by an 

increase in agricultural value added (+15.1%). The non-agricultural value added also grew, albeit at a 

slower pace (+3.1%) but at a higher rate relative to 2016 (+2.2%), driven mainly by the processing 

industries, mining and tourism. The manufacturing sector production index improved by 1.9%, the largest 

increase since 2012. This robust performance in the sector is consistent with the excellent sales trends 

abroad for all major export sectors, including aeronautics (+20%), the food industry (+8.8%), electronics 

(+7.6%), automobile (+7.3%), textiles and leather (+6.1%).  



 

2 
 

2.2.1 Domestic consumption continues to be supported by controlled inflation and improved 

revenue.  Household consumption increased in 2017, benefiting from the positive impact of a good 

agricultural season, an increase in remittances from Moroccans in the Diaspora (+4.5%) and the creation 

of 57,000 jobs (35,000 in rural areas). With regard to public consumption, the Government's investment 

efforts were sustained in 2017, and benefited from positive trends in outstanding equipment loans 

(+11.4%) and investment spending from the State budget (+5.1%). For 2018, the primary economic 

indicators point to the continuation of investments.  

Table 1: Key Macroeconomic Indicators - PEA, 2018 (% of GDP, unless otherwise stated) 

Indicators 2016 2017 (e) 2018 (p) 2019 (p) 

Real GDP growth 1.2 4.1 3.1 4.1 

Agricultural GDP growth -12.8 15.2 -1.0 - 

Non-agricultural GDP growth 3.1 3.0 3.6 - 

Inflation  1.6 0.9 1.8 1.9 

Budget balance (% of GDP) -4.1 -3.6 -3.0 -2.6 

Current account (% of GDP) -4.4 -4.0 -3.2 -2.9 

2.2.3 In 2017, Morocco continued its fiscal consolidation policy started in 2011. The budget deficit 

was expected to reach 3.6% of GDP in 2017 compared to 4.1% in 2016. External trade recovered in 2017 

compared to 2016, mainly due to the net decline in wheat imports (owing to increased production and a 

fiscal policy change limiting imports) and consolidation of the growth pace of exports through the 

development of the “new industries of Morocco” initiative (automobile, aeronautics and electronics). 

Despite the increase in the energy bill (+30%), imports rose at a lower rate (+5.7% compared to 7.2%) in 

2016, mainly due to the decline in grain imports (-22%). The current account deficit was estimated at 4% 

of GDP in 2017 compared to 4.4% in 2016. This improvement also stemmed from the increase in FDI 

and remittances from abroad, which rose in 2017 by +32% and +2% respectively, compared to 2016. 

Foreign exchange reserves remained at a reasonable level in 2017, i.e. approximately six months of 

import. 

2.2.4 The public debt was estimated at 64.3% of GDP in 2017 compared to 64.7% in 2016. The 

authorities have set a debt target of 60% of GDP by 2021, to be achieved through the stringent budgetary 

control policy initiated in 2013. Although the Treasury debt continued its upward trend from 2010 (its 

ratio to GDP was 63.2% in 2014 compared to 62.3% in 2013 and 49% in 2010), it started declining from 

2017. The debt ratio is expected to rise to 64% in 2018. It is worth noting that the increased debt since 

2010 stems from the recovery plan to combat the effects of the international financial crisis and the 

sluggish growth in Europe. Nevertheless, since 2013, the State has initiated a public expenditure control 

strategy to gradually reduce the budget deficit to 3% and ultimately reverse the upward trend in the debt 

volume (scenario validated by the IMF). According to the latest IMF mission (July 2017), the public debt 

will remain sustainable in the medium term mainly because its composition and structure are dominated 

by domestic debts, which account for 78% of the total debt. 

2.2.5 Morocco has an accommodating monetary policy and kept its interest rate unchanged in 

2017 (2.25%) after a decline of 0.25 point in 2016. It will be recalled that Morocco has kept its key 

interest rate low in order to stimulate its economy by encouraging credit to businesses. Inflation remained 

low at an average 0.9% in 2017, although it is expected to double to 1.8% in 2018. Furthermore, in January 

2018, Morocco announced the adoption of a new and more flexible exchange rate regime. 

2.2.6 In terms of the economic prospects for 2018, the real GDP growth rate should reach 3.1%. 

This prediction is based on an “average” agricultural season that yields a lower forecast (-0.8%) for 

agricultural value added.  Non-agricultural GDP will continue rising and is expected to reach 3.7%. The 

industrialists consulted during the economic situation survey conducted in the manufacturing sector by 

Bank Al-Maghrib expect an increased production and sales in 2018. Similarly, the forecasts for 2018 are 

also good for the tertiary sector, including tourism that grew by 32.3% in January 2018 compared to 

January 2017.

2.3. Public Finance Management 

Morocco has initiated several reforms to modernize its financial management system, as defined in 

the new Constitution adopted in 2011. In accordance with Article 75 of the Constitution, Parliament 

adopted the Organic Finance Law on 2 June 2015. This law, which went into force in 2016, has been 

gradually and progressively implemented over five years to enhance ownership of the new budgetary, 

accounting and financial rules that it advocates. The new Constitution guarantees the independence of the 

Court of Auditors and enshrines regionalization and administrative decentralization by strengthening 

control at the regional level. Accordingly, a Court of Auditors will be established in each region to carry 

out more exhaustive management control of public bodies and municipalities. 

2.4. Economic and Agricultural Sector Competitiveness 

2.4.1 According to the Davos Global Competitiveness Report, Morocco was the fifth most 

competitive economy in Africa and the first in North Africa in 2017. The Kingdom has maintained its 

ranking (71st out of 137 countries) and confirmed its significant advance made in: (i) improvement of the 

effectiveness and efficiency of institutions (49th/137); (ii) infrastructure development (54th/137); (iii) 

macroeconomic stability (55th/137) and (iv) improvement of the efficiency of goods markets, in particular 

the efficiency of the Agricultural Policy, which ranks Morocco 16th/137.   

2.4.2 This economic performance stems from considerable efforts made by the authorities to 

implement structural reforms that accelerate the transformation of the country’s economic model 

and industrialization. In 2016, manufacturing sector exports accounted for 70.1% of total exports, 

compared to 65.8% in 2005. In 2017, export from Morocco’s “global industries”, such as aeronautics 

(+20%), the food industry (+8.8%), electronics (+7.6%) and automobile (+7.3%) increased remarkably.  

2.4.3  Despite these economic diversification and sophistication efforts, the agricultural sector 

still accounts for a significant share of the Kingdom’s GDP (14%) and its performance, which is 

highly sensitive to climatic fluctuations, considerably affects the country’s economic growth (see §2.2.1). 

Nevertheless, the agricultural sector holds enormous potential in terms of development and job creation 

owing to its structuring of value chains and improvement of product quality (ADB, 2016).  

2.4.4 The agricultural sector has experienced sustained growth since implementation of the 

Green Morocco Plan in 2008 that has boosted sector competitiveness. Since 2008, the Plan has helped 

to increase: (i) the irrigated surface area by over 25% (137,000 ha); and (ii) the fruit and vegetable yield 

by 70%. Exports of agri-food products increased sharply to over USD 4.8 billion in 2016, representing a 

280% rise since 2001 (and more than 170% since 2008). Despite growing competition, especially from 

countries of the Mediterranean basin, Morocco is ranked among the five leading exporters of several 

products. Mindful of the importance of the sector and of the underlying issues, Morocco 

triggered the acceleration of the Green Morocco Plan (APMV) in 2016 as an instrument for 

implementing the agricultural strategy, with emphasis on the agricultural downstream, 

promotion of agricultural value chains and convergence with other complementary sectors. 

2.4.5 Besides, competitiveness gains are possible because agricultural value chains remain little 

developed and fragmented. Agricultural production is characterized by the coexistence of a large 

number of small-sized farms (70% of the 1.5 million farms have a surface area below 5 ha), the low 

quality of their output, little market integration and a limited number of large farms with high value added 

whose output is mainly exported. In fact, the 1.5 million farms only account for 4% of exports, while the 

agribusiness sector, which is less labour-intensive (60,000 workers), accounts for 2%.

2.5. Inclusive Growth, Poverty Situation and Social Context 

2.5.1 Efforts made to reduce social inequalities and poverty are beginning to bear fruit, with an 

estimated poverty rate of 4.2% in 2014. This result is the culmination of many reforms initiated in the 

1990s. Poverty is on the decline but remains rooted in rural areas. The constitutional reform of 2011 

promotes the universal character of the social safety nets. Since then, reforms are aimed at improving the 

coverage and efficiency of the social protection system, particularly regarding pensions, unemployment 

and health insurance. Nevertheless, this mechanism affects only a fraction of the population due to its 

fragmented targeting and the lack of an integrated strategy. In 2016, the authorities announced the 

establishment of a single identifier, coupled with the institution of a social identifier to improve targeting 

by 2021.  

2.5.2 Morocco has also made significant efforts to achieve the SDGs, especially SDG4, although 

major challenges remain in terms of the secondary education dropout rate and efficient support to 

out-of-school youth. The country has almost achieved universal primary education and significantly 

reduced the literacy rate for youth aged 15-24 by 10.8% (HCP, 2018). However, the school dropout 

phenomenon and its management by the authorities remains a concern particularly in secondary 

education. Although data from the Ministry of Education shows a decrease in the dropout rate, the number 

of dropouts remained significant at 279,177 compared to 329,618 in 2016.  

2.5.3 The persistent dropout rate and the poor diversification of the Moroccan economy tend to 

create structural unemployment for the youth and women, and increases underemployment in 

rural areas. In 2017, net job creation by the Moroccan economy was estimated at 86,000 jobs, comprising 

32,000 in urban areas and 54,000 in rural areas, relative to a loss of 37,000 in 2016 especially in the 

agricultural sector. This is far from the target of 200,000 annual jobs referred to in the National 

Employment Strategy. Hence, the unemployment rate rose from 9.9% in 2016 to 10.2% in 2017. In rural 

areas, underemployment affects 10.8% of rural workers. Young people aged 14-24 are still the most 

vulnerable to unemployment at a rate of 26.5%, followed by graduates at 17.9%, and women at 14.7%. 

The low level of qualification for the youth who are not in education, employment or training (NEET) 

confines them to precarious jobs with little pay and no future prospects (approximately two thirds of 

employees have no work contract and almost 78.4% have no health insurance). Similarly, the poor 

matching of training to employment is one of the causes of unemployment among graduates from non-

technical disciplines who predominantly come from the faculties of social sciences. Such graduates leave 

school with skills for which there is no demand in the domestic labour market and especially in the 

agricultural sector. Difficulties in ensuring the socio-professional integration of the youth prevent 

households from investing in education and fuel the school dropout rate.  

2.5.4  The agricultural sector employs 40% of the labour force and over 93.2% of the female 

labour force in rural areas, thus playing a major economic, social and environmental role.  The 

agricultural value added to the national economy increased by 13.5% in October 2017, thus by 3.9% year 

on year, compared to +1% during the same period in 2016 (HCP). In the third quarter of 2017, the 

agricultural sector (including fisheries and forestry) grew by 1.3%, creating a further 47,000 jobs 

nationally (40,000 in rural areas and 7,000 in urban areas), compared to losses of 75,000 jobs in 2014, 

27,000 in 2015 and 66,000 in 2016. The agro-industrial sector employed 143,000 people in 2016 with an 

output mainly destined for the domestic market. This sector has 2,050 industrial units composed largely 

of SMEs. Agricultural exports accounted for approximately 12% of all industrial goods exported in 2016. 

Hence, the sector accounted for 5% of national GDP in 2016, representing almost 27% of industrial GDP 

with a value added of approximately MAD 30 billion. 

2.5.5. Lastly, challenges in terms of gender inequality and the inclusion of small farmers in 

agricultural value chains persist. Women usually hold unskilled and non-permanent jobs with no 

social insurance. According to HCP data, over 93.2% of the rural female labour force is recruited by the 

agricultural sector, which often employs them as seasonal or occasional workers while men hold longer-

term jobs. Although the presence of women at decision-making levels is increasingly affirmed, women 

are still confined to labour-intensive manual tasks that require no special skills while men occupy the 

more skilled positions. These inequalities are also observed in income distribution because women earn 



 

5 
 

less than men and the number of women entrepreneurs in agricultural and agribusiness value chains 

remains insignificant. Unpaid employment is estimated to account for 40% of rural jobs (ILO 2014) and 

concerns 74% of the female labour force and 68% of young people aged below 25 years. These differences 

limit women's opportunities to access skills development and entrepreneurship, increase their 

vulnerability in the labour market and further relegate them to the informal sector. 

III. GOVERNMENT DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME 

3.1 Government’s Development Strategy and Medium-Term Reform Priorities 

3.1.1 Morocco has adopted a series of sector plans to accelerate growth, ensure sustainability 

and promote inclusion. The strategies marshalled are aimed at modernizing traditional sectors such as 

agriculture and fishing, and developing innovative sectors like renewable energy and services with high 

value added (industry, etc.). 

3.1.2 In 2008, the Government rolled out its 2030 Strategic Vision for the agricultural sector and 

initiated the Green Morocco Plan. The objective of the Plan is to boost agricultural productivity and 

increase exports and private investment in the sector. The Plan will help to combat poverty, ensure food 

security and equip the Kingdom with the skills needed to cope with vagaries of the weather and preserve 

its natural resources (water, soil and energy). 

3.1.3 The agricultural sector is also targeted by several other strategies. The National Industrial 

Acceleration Plan for 2014-2020 is aimed at integrating agricultural value chains to support the agri-food 

sector through the promotion and restructuring of strategic sectors (including staple food crops and export 

crops) by supporting the development of agropoles (integrated logistic platforms). Furthermore, the 

National Sustainable Development Strategy (SNDD) 2015-2030, the National Water Strategy 2009-2030 

and the National Energy Efficiency Strategy 2008-2030 focus on sustainable natural resource 

management and protection. Consequently, there is need for a systemic vision to support the 

sustainability and inclusion of the Green Morocco Plan Ecosystem. In this regard, PADIDFA, which 
is consistent with all the above strategies and with the Government Gender Equality Plan (GEP), 

advocates inter-sector coordination and is fully in line with the process of establishing the advanced 

regionalization system.  

3.2 Constraints to Implementation of the National/Sector Development Programme  

3.2.1 The growth diagnostic (conducted by the Bank in collaboration with the authorities and 

MCC) identifies poor coordination between economic stakeholders as one of the constraints to 

private investment. There are numerous public policies aimed at accelerating Morocco’s economic 

transformation and the development of value chains. However, the lack of coordination between public 

entities (agencies and ministries), private stakeholders (within value chains) and between the public and 

private sectors (promotion of trade agreements, for example) has a negative impact on the expected 

outcomes of public action. This problem is fundamental to agricultural development. The development of 

this sector requires support for concerted nationwide action at different levels, namely: (i) collaboration 

between the various departments of the Ministry of Agriculture; (ii) inter-ministerial coordination; and 

(iii) coordination between central and decentralized structures. For natural resources, such coordination 

involves the development of transversal governance and planning tools for the concerted monitoring of 

natural resource utilisation. 

3.2.2 The growth diagnostic identifies human capital as a major constraint to more inclusive and 

robust growth. The agricultural sector faces three major challenges: (1) the skills developed should be 

tailored to the needs of sector stakeholders - the involvement of inter-professional associations in the 

training cycle and the streamlining of higher education are essential in this case;  (2) research and 

development by public training-research structures must satisfy the needs of sector stakeholders; and (3) 

the adult population with a low human capital should not be excluded from value chain development. The 

development of human capital through agricultural vocational training in the regions is essential to 

improve the quality of the workforce, enhance salaried employment and promote self-employment. 



 

6 
 

Furthermore, there are other challenges to the encouragement of investment in agriculture, namely: (1) 

the low level of investment due to the fact that farm sizes in Morocco are limited by land tenure insecurity 

in rural areas as well as problems of joint ownership and fragmentation; (2) the lack of greater investor 

visibility in the agricultural sector; (3) the need for better promotion of recourse to PPPs; (4) the lack of 

dedicated logistics platforms that enable the private sector to develop synergies; (5) the lack of 

mechanisms that  enable small farmers to come together and offer a common service of sufficient 

magnitude to other stakeholders in the chain; and (6) the need to strengthen advisory services (with private 

initiatives) to support agricultural production (in terms of quality and quantity). 

3.2.3 Land tenure policy that facilitates investment in agriculture. Land tenure is one of the major 

obstacles that investors face. In particular, the growth diagnostic shows that the frequent lack of land titles 

in the agricultural sector limits investment by farmers and consequently undermines agricultural sector 

transformation.  Several projects have been initiated to address this constraint. One example is the public-

private partnership operation intended to make land of sufficient size available to private investors for a 

relatively long lease period. At the end of 2016, a surface area of 111,000 ha was made available to 

investors (particularly in the agropoles), who have ended up making actual investments of nearly MAD 

14 million on the ground; i.e. 95% of planned investments. Furthermore, to address the constraint of land 

fragmentation and improve the management of small farms, aggregation around private stakeholders or 

professional organizations with significant managerial capacity was adopted and implemented. This 

model yields a win-win partnership between the productive upstream and the commercial and industrial 

downstream.  

3.2.4 Resource overexploitation is a concern for Moroccan authorities. From an environmental 

standpoint, the agricultural sector is currently the bedrock of sustainable development in Morocco, given 

that it is the primary user of water and land resources, and one of the main users of energy resources 

directly (pumping, mechanical tools) or indirectly (fertilizers). In fact, agriculture uses 80 to 85% of the 

country's water resources. Another challenge for the sector is the achievement of sustainable growth 

through agriculture, considering the fragility of natural resources. This problem is even more acute as 

Morocco is encountering water stress. Rainfall is very low and the water is unevenly distributed among 

the various regions. The national water context is marked by increasingly growing scarcity, mainly due 

to climate change, irrational use and population growth. Morocco's natural water resources are among the 

lowest in the world.  This potential is estimated at the equivalent of 700 m3/inh./year and this quantity 

could drop to 520 m3, compared to the critical threshold of 1000 m3/inh./year. Therefore, it is necessary 

to manage water demand efficiently by planning investments, synchronizing with dam water resources, 

controlling water extraction and organizing stakeholders, while stimulating the search for new non-

conventional water resources. The issue of land and energy management, particularly the use of 

subsidized butane gas by this sector, is also the focus of attention. In this regard, there is a growing national 

advocacy for increased use of solar pumping. 

3.2.5 Finally, particular attention should be given to rural women, who hold 61% of jobs in the 

sector. The inclusive transformation of this sector is possible only if special attention is paid to rural 

women who are considered fragile stakeholders. 

3.3 Consultation and Participatory Process 

Stakeholders were actively involved in programme design through a participatory and inter-sector 

approach that allowed for consideration of views of various sectors and identification of potential 

convergences. The quest for ownership of measures informed programme design. Stakeholders 

concerned (various administrative entities, representatives of professionals, private operators, civil 

society, etc.) were involved throughout the process. This process was reinforced during the preparation 

phase through the organization of a consultation workshop with all stakeholders (seven administrative 

departments and representatives of inter-professional associations) to discuss the proposed measures, their 

relevance and impact. A workshop on the ownership of measures involving civil society and the private 

sector, organized during the appraisal, made it possible to agree on common ground, find a better basis 

for addressing the interests of stakeholders, and produce a validated matrix of measures and programme 

performance indicators. This consultation will be continued during implementation phase through the 

inter-sector steering committee.

IV. BANK SUPPORT FOR THE GOVERNMENT’S STRATEGY 

4.1. Linkage with the Bank Strategy  

4.1.1 This budget support programme falls under the second pillar of CSP 2017-2021 for 

Morocco, namely “improving living conditions through employment for the youth, women and 

rural areas”. It contributes to the achievement of three of the High 5s, namely: “Feed Africa”, “Integrate 

Africa” and "Improve the quality of life for the people of Africa". It pursues the green and inclusive 

growth objectives of the Bank's Ten-Year Strategy for 2013-2022 and is fully consistent with the 2016-

2025 Feed Africa Strategy (agricultural transformation through value chains development) as well as the 

Bank’s other sector strategies (including youth employment, the water and energy strategies, etc.). 

PADIDFA is also part of the Strategic Framework and Governance Action Plan 2014-2018 (GAP II). 

4.1.2  The Programme is justified by: (i) the importance of ensuring the sustainability of  

Morocco Green Plan (PMV) achievements and supporting its acceleration phase; (ii) the magnitude 

of the financial needs created by the reforms implemented by the PMV and associated sectors 

(environment, water, energy and employment); (iii) the urgency of instituting rational natural resource 

management (through operationalization of the National Sustainable Development Strategy (SNDD), the 

implementation of the Sustainable Development Action Plan (PADD) in the agricultural and associated 

sectors, management of the water stress and disruption of the water resources balance, and the insufficient 

development of agricultural products and clean energies); (iv) insufficient inclusive development (social 

inclusion based on age, gender and geography; insufficient creation of employment particularly in the 

agro-industry ecosystem, etc.); (v) poor promotion of value chains, limited empowerment of inter-

professional associations and low private sector involvement; and (vi) the urgency of addressing the 

demands of unemployed young graduates and marginalized rural women. The programme is also fully 

consistent with the advanced regionalization and inter-sector convergence process to sustain and support 

the impact of PMV and the PMV acceleration phase initiated in 2017. 

4.2. Compliance with Eligibility Criteria 

4.2.1  As presented in the previous chapters, Morocco enjoys a political and economic 

environment that is conducive to the use of the reform support instrument. The country has also 

demonstrated its commitment to the sector reform process, particularly in the agricultural sector (see 

Annexs 3 and 5). 

4.2.2  Furthermore, from the fiduciary standpoint, the country meets the eligibility criteria. The 

performance assessment results of Morocco’s PFM systems obtained in 2016 using the PEFA 

methodology (including public procurement) confirm that the country fiduciary risk level is moderate. 

According to the report, the main conditions for budgetary and financial discipline have been met, 

especially budget reliability and the achievement of set stability objectives. It specifies that more strategic 

public resource allocation remains a priority objective for the Government and that this objective is central 

to the reform programme currently being implemented. Lastly, it points out that the current public finance 

management system contributes only moderately to the improvement of public service quality, which is 

why the LOF introduces a performance-based approach and provides for objectives and indicators for 

measuring the quality of services. 

4.2.3 The public finance management and procurement framework has undergone significant 

reforms in recent years to attain international standards, as reflected in satisfactory fiduciary 

assessments conducted by the Bank and other partners. In particular, the Bank recently assessed 

Morocco's national public procurement system in November 2017 using the OECD/DAC methodology 

and the fiduciary risk for the procurement component at the national level was deemed moderate. The 

evaluation report of the national procurement system was validated with the participation of the major 

public procurement stakeholders and the key technical and financial partners. 

 

 



 

8 
 

4.3. Collaboration and Coordination with other Partners 

4.3.1 Since 2010, a donor coordination process has been conducted by the Ministry of 

Agriculture (Directorate for Strategy and Statistics-DSS) to coordinate PMV support. Regular 

meetings are held in the presence of technical and financial partners. The Bank plays an important role in 

this process through its country office (COMA). Hence, the design of PADIDFA was characterized by 

sustained consultation with the DSS and close coordination with partners, particularly the World Bank, 

the European Union, French Cooperation (AFD) and Belgian Cooperation (CTB). Considering the 

programming schedules, parallel financing was recommended. Furthermore, Moroccan authorities 

harmonize interventions through the MEF. The design of this programme took into consideration 

complementarity with the other TFPs, especially the World Bank, which operates in the same field. 

Additional measures were recommended, including processing zones, the establishment of an agricultural 

register and strengthening of agricultural extension (supported by the EU). 

4.3.2 In the water sector, coordination between the various donors is done through a thematic 

group established in 2011. This thematic group meets regularly to discuss sector trends, and to seek 

greater coordination and harmonization of sector interventions. The Bank has led this thematic group 

together with the AFD and the World Bank since 2016. 

4.3.3 In the areas of training and employment, the Working Group on Youth (2016) and donor 

coordination on education and training (initiated in 2008) are the discussion platforms for 

employment and training issues. The Bank actively participates in these working groups while 

harmonizing its interventions bilaterally with those of partners.  This coordination supplements the 

government’s consultative framework through annual consultation meetings and discussions on sector 

strategies that impact skills development and employment. 

4.4. Linkage with Other Bank Operations  

4.4.1 The Bank’s active portfolio in Morocco comprises 28 ongoing operations for a net 

commitment of UA 1.7 billion. The Bank’s overall portfolio performance remains satisfactory in 

general, with an average total score of 2.7 on 3 in 2017. The portfolio covers seven sectors: energy 

(35.4%), transport (23.5%), water and sanitation (16.7%), social (5.7%), agriculture (3.6%), and multi-

sector (15.1%). 

4.4.2 Promoting inclusive and green growth, and inclusive value chain development is a crucial 

issue of particular interest to the Bank. This programme is linked to the Bank's investment operations 

in Morocco, notably PAPNEEI, which supports the irrigation sector, as well as operations that promote 

renewable energies. The programme also consolidates budget support for reforms aimed at improving the 

business environment, boosting competitiveness (PACEM and PAAIM) and ensuring training-

employment matching (PAAFE). Furthermore, it supplements the two phases of the Green Morocco Plan 

Support Programme (PAPMV-1 & 2). The Bank also backs the establishment of a “Result Delivery Unit” 

within the Office of the Head of Government. Part of this support will be mobilized to monitor the results 

of SNDD implementation (see the measurement framework given as annex). 

Table 2 : Lessons learned from PAPMV-1 & 2 and previous Bank operations in Morocco 
Key lessons learned Measures taken to factor the lessons into the programme 

Adoption of an inter-sector approach to 

programme design that can generate institutional 

value added and rally stakeholders 

An inter-sector approach was adopted to promote additional synergies among 

the various departments and strategies. The programme identified areas of 

convergence and inter-sector interests. 

Importance of a collaborative approach and an 

inter-ministerial steering mechanism  

Programme design was conducted through grassroots consultation (organization 

of consultation workshop with stakeholders during the design phase) and the 

consolidation of the inter-ministerial steering committee was recommended. 

Ownership of measures guarantees 

sustainability 

Consideration was given to ownership of measures and provision made for the 

necessary support items (measurement forms, ownership workshop, 

consultative validation process, etc.).  

Enhance the management of preliminary 

dialogue to reduce the timeframe for adopting 

regulatory and legislative texts pertaining to 

stakeholder ownership 

Consideration was given to dialogue on ownership and measures were balanced, 

thus giving rise to texts containing direct action measures on the effective 

implementation of reforms. 

Need to sustain the PMV and strengthen water 

sector governance and regulation 

Provision was made for measures relating to the Supreme Council for Water and 

Climate (at the central level) and Water Basin Councils (at regional level). 



 

9 
 

4.4.3 Furthermore, the two PMV (PAPMV-I & 2) support phases generated conclusive results 

with highly satisfactory performance. The programme managed to satisfy virtually all the proposed 

measures through its two phases. Of the 56 measures planned under PAPMV-1, 45 were fully executed 

and 11 were partly implemented. At PAPMV-2 completion, a high implementation rate was recorded for 

the various measures (91%, or 30 out of the 33 scheduled measures plus two measures partly completed). 

For some measures, progress has been significant and achievements have exceeded set targets (national 

irrigation map, inter-sector coordination mechanism, institutional reform road map, measures to promote 

local products and organic production, agricultural insurance, support for the agricultural development 

fund, adoption of more than 10 laws, including those relating to aggregation, inter-professional 

associations, the private agricultural advisory services, water law, the law on organic production, the 

framework law on the environment and sustainable development, the law setting up ONCA, approval of 

the National Strategy for Sustainable Development by the Government Council, support for the 

establishment of four agropoles and one zoopole (livestock sub-sectors) development of the national agri-

food strategy and signing of framework programme contracts with inter-professional associations, etc.). 

The main lessons learned from PAPMV I and II were strategic and enhanced the design of PADIDFA 

(see Table 2 and more details in the technical annex). 

4.5. Analytical Work Underpinning the Budget Support 

Programme design was informed by the results of several analytical studies conducted by the Bank, 

the Government and technical and financial partners. The results of the Bank's 2014 growth 

diagnostic remain valid.  They highlight the economic and social role of the agricultural sector (almost 

40% of jobs, 61% of which are held by women). However, the report highlights several sector challenges, 

including: (a) human capital problems especially in rural areas; (b) microeconomic distortions and 

especially access to titled land; (c) lack of coordination among stakeholders, which impedes the promotion 

of value chains; and (d) the disturbing water resources situation. The approach advocated by the 

programme helps the authorities to resolve these challenges. Component I focuses on improving access 

to employment through value chain development (skills improvement, etc.), while Component II focuses 

on sustainable employment. Sector upgrade and stakeholder mobilization are crucial. Stakeholder 

coordination is central to this budget support, either to improve natural resource management (in particular 

water, soil and clean energy) or to structure and develop value chains.

V.  PROPOSED PROGRAMME 

5.1. Programme Goal and Objective 

The programme objective is to help boost agricultural sector competitiveness to ensure inclusive 

and sustainable economic growth through the promotion of value chains, job creation, 

improvement of the business climate and sustainable natural resource management. The programme 

is intended to support the Green Morocco Plan 2008-2020, mainly in terms of the acceleration and 



 

10 
 

sustainability of achievements as well as the strategies of associated sectors (National Sustainable 

Development Strategy, National Water Strategy, Energy Strategy, National Employment Strategy and 

Industrial Acceleration Strategy). Hence, PADIDFA will help to: (i) support the PMV ecosystem and 

amplify its impact; (ii) promote the inclusion of vulnerable stakeholders (especially the youth and 

women); and (iii) build agricultural sector resilience. It is an important institutional lever for creating 

synergies between strategies governing agriculture, the environment, water, energy and employment. 

5.2. Programme Components 

5.2.1 The creation, sustainability and improvement of employment quality in agricultural sub-

sectors are essential to the reduction of multidimensional poverty in rural areas and thus remains 

the focus of national concerns. Based on data from the 2014 population census, the number of people 

living in multidimensional poverty rose from 80% in 2004 to 85.6%. Hence, among the 3.9 million poor 

Moroccans identified through the multidimensional poverty mapping exercise conducted in 2014, over 3 

million live in rural areas. Therefore, the development of agricultural value chains remains a major 

challenge for their socioeconomic integration. PADIDFA supports a series of medium- and short-term 

strategic reforms to improve the quality of life for the people through quality jobs and self-employment 

in rural areas, and the protection of such jobs through sustainable natural resource management.  

Component I: Support to Job Creation through the Development of Agricultural and Agro-Industrial 

Sub-sectors 

5.2.2 This component seeks to lay the institutional and operational foundations for the inclusive 

development of agricultural sub-sectors in Morocco, which create better quality jobs that particularly 

benefit women and the youth in rural areas. Job creation will be enhanced through: (i) skills development; 

(ii) improvement of the business climate and support to agricultural entrepreneurship; (ii) structuring of 

agricultural and agribusiness sub-sectors; and (iv) support for agricultural produce processing. 

Sub-Component I.1: Skills Development to Ensure Access to Employment in the Agricultural and 

Agro-Industrial Value Sub-sectors 

5.2.3 Problems and Constraints. Despite the considerable investments in human resource training 

under the PMV, the skills and qualifications deficit continues to limit access to employment.  This deficit 

also affects the productivity and competitiveness of agricultural enterprises, and reduces the potential of 

agro-industrial exports, de facto affecting job creation. Hence, the problem is twofold.  According to 

businesses, difficulties pertaining to unreliable access to quality raw materials, informal processing in 

production processes, product selection and packaging as well as poor traceability and certification partly 

stem from the lack of technical skills at the grassroots to ensure quality-at-entry, especially for products 

coming from cooperatives and small farmers. This situation further limits access to large markets and the 

creation of supplementary value added. Similarly, the limited access of agri-food VSEs and SMEs to 

business support services and highly-qualified personnel hampers quality improvement and an increase 

in product value added. The insufficient number of trainers, the quality of training programmes and the 

limited involvement of inter-professional associations are major challenges to be met in the medium term. 

5.2.4. Recent Action by the Government. Training and research are major levers of the Green 

Morocco Plan to: (i) support the development of agricultural value chains by providing a skilled workforce 

and anticipating skills needs in the medium term; and (ii) build the capacity of structures responsible for 

the national agricultural training and research system. The government has established an agricultural 

vocational training scheme with 52 schools covering all regions of the Kingdom to satisfy the demand for 

skilled labour in the various sub-sectors, boost their competitiveness and promote the socio-professional 

integration of rural youth. The new and current modes of work-related vocational training and 

apprenticeship partly meet the needs of the production sectors retained under the Green Morocco Plan but 

still fail to achieve the objectives of the Green Morocco Plan quantitatively and qualitatively, and meet 

the emerging rapidly evolving inter-professional needs. 



 

11 
 

5.2.5. Programme Activities and Expected Outcomes. To meet the demand for training skills in the 

medium and long term, the programme will support: (i) the extension of the agricultural apprenticeship 

training mechanism; and (ii) the strengthening of research and development in partnership with 

universities, inter-professional associations and the private sector. In this regard, the following measures 

will be taken: (1) the establishment and operationalization of the Centre for Pedagogical Engineering and 

Training of Trainers; (2) the opening of an additional centre for local agricultural vocational training; (3) 

signature of the amendment to the delegated management agreement on the livestock production zoopole; 

(4) signature of an implementation agreement between the Vocational Training Department and the 

Ministry of Agriculture to increase the number of apprentices in agricultural apprenticeship training 

programmes; (5) launching of a call for projects under the competitive fund to focus research more on the 

needs of inter-professional associations with the greater involvement of universities and the private sector; 

(5) production of JCF and DJT for the agricultural sector; and (6) creation and establishment of vocational 

guidance centres in rural areas. Yearly, these actions will lead to the training and qualification of nearly 

300 trainers and 2,600 young agricultural workers or technicians, and the certification of approximately 

10,000 farmers’ daughters and sons who would receive apprenticeship training. These are work-based 

short-term training courses (10 months) that yield a vocational qualification in about 30 professions 

leading to recruitment in agricultural enterprises or to self-employment (see Annex - Volume 2). 

Sub-component I.2: Improvement of the Investment Climate, Access to Employment and 

Entrepreneurship for Rural Youth and Women 

5.2.6. Problems and Constraints. As indicated in paragraph 3.2.3, the growth assessment shows that 

the frequent absence of land titles in the agricultural sector limits farmer investments and consequently 

agricultural sector transformation. In terms of financing, ignorance of the existing mechanisms and limited 

access to seed loans remain the major challenges for agricultural entrepreneurs. Despite their diversity, 

existing financing instruments are often unknown to rural youth and are intended more for project 

proponents who demonstrate maturity and experience in agricultural value chains and who present robust 

and bankable business plans. This raises the problem of a deficit in entrepreneurial culture and education 

as well as in long-term quality technical support. However, most young people embarking on agricultural 

entrepreneurship do not have the requisite technical skills to ensure the success of their businesses due to 

a lack of training, social capital and an entrepreneurial culture. The establishment of an environment 

conducive to dynamic, integrated and quality support for entrepreneurs as well as market access for young 

farmers remain a priority. 

5.2.7  Recent Measures Adopted by the Government. To overcome the major financing challenge, 

the Moroccan Government has developed a range of tools for start-ups through the establishment of 

competitive funds and guarantee mechanisms for independent entrepreneurs, start-ups and VSEs/SMEs. 

The State also supports several promising incubator/accelerator programmes including Réseau 

Entreprendre Network, Eirene 4 Impact, Espace Bidaya which target innovative start-ups with high 

potential, and Dare INC which supports social enterprises from ideation to growth and international 

markets. However, the pilot nature of these programmes and limited access opportunities for rural youth 

reduce their potential impact on self-employment, owing to the remote location of these youth and 

concentration of the programmes in large urban centres. The State has also undertaken to formulate a legal 

framework that grants access to work and income-generation opportunities to the most isolated rural 

communities.  

5.2.8  Programme Activities and Expected Outcomes. To facilitate investment, the programme will 

help to secure agricultural land mainly through: (1) transmission of the law on the National Agricultural 

Register (RNA) to the SGG; and (2) transmission to the SGG of the four decrees implementing Law No. 

113-13 on the management of pastoral and sylvo-pastoral areas. In particular, the programme supports 

the promotion and active participation of young people and women in the development of agricultural and 

agro-industrial sectors through reforms and affirmative employment initiatives that favour rural women 

and youth, including greater access to active employment programmes. Specifically, the programme will 

support the establishment of an entrepreneurial and employment support ecosystem to inform, guide and 

accompany young people and women wishing to invest in agricultural sub-sectors. It will also support 

businesses in the various sub-sectors in general. This entails: (3) implementing a national plan for the 



 

12 
 

establishment of regional agricultural incubators; (4) drafting and implementing a framework agreement 

with COMADER on agricultural advisory services, training and support for farmers; (5) transforming the 

framework agreement into specific agreements; (6) conducting a gender diagnostic in two vocational 

training establishments; (7) conducting a study on women’s entrepreneurship; and (8) drafting and 

signature of a partnership agreement between DIAEA and ONCA for the development of agricultural 

advisory services in irrigation areas. 

Sub-Component I.3: Support for Structuring of Agricultural Sub-sectors, Processing of 

Agricultural Products, and Development of Agro-Industry and Exports  

5.2.9. Problems and Constraints. The agricultural sector needs to develop its value chains and boost 

its competitiveness, sustainability and productivity to meet national and export needs for products with 

comparative advantages and to generate more jobs. Despite the economic performance of the sector, 

Moroccan agriculture still faces challenges in developing its agricultural products, especially on the 

international scene. Although commendable efforts have concentrated on upstream production 

(modernization and upgrading of facilities, improvement of production and productivity), focus should 

shift to the processing and enhancement of agricultural products (agribusiness, etc.). There is need to 

develop processing and logistics platforms to accommodate agro-industrial processing units. Similarly, 

agro-industry support structures for ensuring compliance with standards, particularly those responsible 

for the promotion of Moroccan agricultural and agri-food exports, such as ONSSA (National Authority 

for the Health Safety of Food Products), still face a legislative deficit in certain areas. Consequently, the 

regulations must be reviewed and/or enhanced to create a conducive framework for the upgrade of 

agricultural products in order to boost their marketing and export value and volume.  

5.2.10. Recent Measures Adopted by the Government. In a bid to consolidate the achievements of 

PMV 2 and promote the inclusive development of agricultural sectors, Morocco has embarked on a 

thorough effort to restructure inter-professional associations covering 21 sub-sectors and ensure the 

formal recognition of 14 inter-professional associations. To accelerate agro-industry development and 

boost exports, Morocco has embarked on the implementation of an Agro-food Sector Development 

Strategy covering promotion, export and distribution on the domestic market. A programme contract for 

the agri-food industry was signed for the period 2017-2021. This contract is intended to increase turnover, 

exports and value added in the sector. It specifically targets the promotion of certain agri-food sectors (the 

CP forecasts an investment volume of MAD 12 billion, including MAD 8 billion to be borne by the private 

sector). Similarly, the 2014-2020 Industrial Acceleration Plan was implemented in the Souss-Massa 

region in January 2018 and 8 agreements were signed on that occasion, thus creating a competitive 

economic hub. The Ministry of Agriculture, Maritime Fisheries, Rural Development, Water and Forestry 

is also planning to set up Agro-Food Innovation Centres (CIAA). Moreover, two of the seven agropoles 

scheduled under the Green Morocco Plan are already operational (Meknes and Berkane). These agropoles 

are expected to be a major lever for the agricultural sector. They seek to enhance the processing and 

marketing of agricultural products by providing a framework for the integration of all the segments of the 

value chain. Finally, ONSSA (National Office for the Health Safety of Food Products) set up in 2010 

under the PMV and under the supervision of the Ministry of Agriculture, is continuing its efforts to 

promote agri-food product exports.  

5.2.11 Programme Activities and Expected Outcomes. This sub-component is intended to develop 

Agro-food Processing Zones (ZTAA) while improving standards to boost exports especially to the rest of 

Africa. There is a dual social inclusion challenge at this level, namely: ensuring the transformation of very 

small agricultural enterprises and increasing the qualitative participation of small farmers in value chains. 

Therefore, the programme will support the development of inclusive mechanisms that ensure the 

participation and equitable remuneration of these vulnerable groups through a unified and more inclusive 

vision of value chains, including increased and improved access to production resources, markets and 

social coverage for agricultural workers. It provides for: (1) support for the creation and revitalization of 

agricultural cooperatives; (2) publication of the decree introducing the new FDA subsidy rates for 

agricultural processing units; (3) revision of legal instruments developing new legislation in the field of 

food safety – ONSSA’s legal arsenal (involvement of various structures in control activities; supervision 

of professionals; pesticides; exports; plant health; fertilizers); (5) drafting and transmission to the SGG of 



 

13 
 

new sanitary instruments governing the export of poultry products and preparation of terms of reference 

(CPS). These measures will support small producers, facilitate the processing of agricultural products and 

accelerate agricultural exports through the improvement of standards. 

Component II: Support Lasting Rural Employment through Sustainable Natural Resource 

Utilisation by the Sector 

5.2.12 This second component targets the long-term protection of jobs created in the agricultural sector 

through promotion of sustainable natural resource management (especially water) by the agricultural 

sector, and encouragement of renewable energy usage in rural areas.  

Sub-component II.1: Strengthen Sustainable Development Governance 

5.2.13 Problems and Constraints. As in other countries in the region, promoting green governance in 

Morocco is now an absolute priority for meeting the challenges posed by climate change in particular. 

Nevertheless, these challenges must be addressed as part of an inter-sector approach that includes the 

agricultural sector. Coordination around these objectives is crucial to the protection of created rural area 

jobs that are threatened by dwindling resource availability. 

5.2.14 Recent Measures Adopted by the Government. Morocco also played a major role on the 

international scene by undertaking to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions under COP 21 and organizing 

COP 22 in 2016, which included water resources on its agenda.  For COP 21, Morocco undertook to 

reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 13% before 2030. This target could be raised to 32% if international 

funds (estimated at USD 45 billion) are mobilized. As regards climate change mitigation, 50% of the 

projects focus on energy. They include: (i) the determination to increase the share of renewable energy in 

the installed electricity capacity from 34% in 2015 to 42% by 2020; and (ii) the improvement of energy 

efficiency. As regards adaptation, the programme includes: (i) the substitution of overexploited 

groundwater with surface water; and (ii) the acceleration of desalination programmes, construction of 

dams and recycling of wastewater by 2030. Water conservation is an essential pillar that can be developed 

through appropriate technologies and improved efficiency in usage. The National Sustainable 

Development Strategy (SNDD) was drawn up and presented to the Government Council on 1 June 2017, 

and adopted by the Council of Ministers of 25 June 2017. It received backing under the second phase of 

the Bank's support to the Green Morocco Plan (2015-2017). This strategy seeks to achieve Morocco's 

vision of a green and inclusive economy by 2030. In total, seven major challenges have been identified 

as pillars and have been broken down into 31 strategic sub-pillars and 137 objectives with precise 

indicators. This makes it a reference and convergence tool for various public policies aimed at ensuring 

Morocco's sustainable development. Thus, the Sector Sustainable Development Action Plans (PADD) 

specifying the contribution of each department to the implementation of this Strategy, as well as the 

Action Plan relating to State exemplariness have been drafted. To achieve these objectives, a governance 

framework is being established that comprises two committees: a Strategic Committee that has a policy 

and guidance role, and a Steering Committee that has an operational role. 

5.2.15 Programme Activities and Expected Outcomes: In a bid to support the operationalization of 

the SNDD, promote green governance and give impetus to a new inter-sector governance drive, the 

programme proposes the following measures: (1) Publication of the decree creating the Sustainable 

Development Strategy Committee in the Official Gazette; (2) Validation of at least four Sustainable 

Development Action Plans (PADD) in 2019; and (3) Design of a monitoring and evaluation system for 

the SNDD in 2019. The expected outcomes from implementing these measures are: (i) the scheduling of 

meetings of the strategic committee; (ii) the drafting and adoption of a ministerial order institutionalizing 

the steering committee mentioned in Article 6 of Decree No. 655 to create the strategic committee for 

implementing the SNDD; (iii) implementation of the PADDs of four sectors validated in 2019; (iv) 

strengthening of the steering and of the monitoring/evaluation strategy as well as improvement of 

decision-making.

Sub-Component II.2: Improvement of Water Resource Management to Mitigate the Water Stress 

and Boost Sustainability  

5.2.16 Problems and Constraints. The renewable water resource rate is less than 600 m3/person/year 

(the critical threshold being 1000 m3/person/year). Although drinking water production increased fivefold 

over the past three decades, the 145 dams have a storage capacity that is below the population's annual 

water consumption. Climate trends in the sub-region are disturbing due to declining rainfall estimated at 

30% by 2050. This pressure on water resources is compounded by the development of irrigation (1.5 

million hectares), although efforts are underway to convert large-scale conventional irrigation systems to 

drip irrigation.  In response, Morocco has initiated the development of non-conventional resources such 

as seawater or wastewater. The adoption of an integrated approach to ensure water resource sustainability 

is crucial to the development of sustainable and job-creating agriculture. 

5.2.17  Recent Measures Adopted by the Government. The National Water Sector Strategy 

formulated in 2009 is the strategic framework followed by: (i) the National Water Plan - PNE (focusing 

on demand management, especially demand for irrigation and water development); (ii) supply 

management and development (including non-conventional resources); and (iii) water resource 

conservation and adaptation to climate change. With the Bank's support, under PAPMV-2, the 

Government adopted a new Water Law in 2015 (Law No. 36-15), which introduced innovations in water 

planning, water governance and adaptation to climate change. 

5.2.18  Programme Activities and Expected Outcomes: The proposed measures are essentially aimed 

at implementing the new Water Law through promulgation of its main implementing instruments. These 

measures are: (1) transmission to the SGG of the decree governing the Supreme Council for Water 

Resources and Climate; (2) as regards water resource planning: transmission to the SGG of implementing 

decrees relating to: (i) planning documents (National Water Plan, Integrated Water Resource Management 

Master Plan, Local Water Management Plans); (ii) the water basin boards (including the publication of 

the decree governing water basin agencies in the Official Gazette) and (iii) Presentation of the PNE to the 

Interministerial Water Commission; (3) as regards the water information system: preparation of the decree 

relating to the Water Information System, preparation of the reference frameworks for agricultural water 

needs per region for rational use of irrigation water. To improve adaptation to climate change, regional 

vulnerability indices and Regional Climate Change Adaptation Plans for three pilot regions should be 

developed.  These actions will strengthen the legal framework for planning and governance for the 

concerted, territorialized and sustainable use of water resources. These actions will also help to build 

stakeholder resilience to climate change. 

Sub-component II.3: Support for Energy Transition in the Agricultural Sector 

5.2.19 Problems and Constraints. Faced with the challenges of climate change and the energy bill, a 

drive is already underway to use renewable energies, especially solar pumps, in agriculture. However, 

this drive remains essentially limited to large farmers. Small farmers are still difficult to reach, mainly 

because funding problems force them to rely on butane gas, which is still subsidized. Butane gas is 

frequently used to pump irrigation water and its consumption has even attained alarming proportions for 

some crops, thus putting pressure on the compensation fund (for 2017, a structural increase in butane gas 

compensation was noted, with a total subsidization cost of over MAD 9.9 billion in 2017 compared to 

MAD 6.7 billion in 2016). In the agri-food industry, additional efforts are also needed to reduce the energy 

bill of agri-food companies. Hence, public authorities should support increased energy development for 

agricultural holdings and agro-industrial units.  Furthermore, the development of agro-industry and 

irrigation systems generates a certain amount of waste (plastics, agricultural product processing by-

products, etc.) that is beginning to increase in volume and needs to be treated and recycled to avoid 

environmental pollution and contribute to job creation. 

5.2.20 Recent Measures Adopted by the Government. Morocco has a clear desire to optimize its 

economy through the adoption of energy efficiency in several sectors (with agriculture included among 

the five priority sectors). This drive is essentially based on the National Energy Efficiency Strategy for 

2030, which seeks to achieve a renewable energy share of 52% instead of 34% in 2015. This strategy 

provides for the adoption of a programme contract between the State, the Moroccan Energy Efficiency 



 

15 
 

Agency (AMEE) and priority sectors (industry, construction, agriculture, transport and public 

electrification). Crédit Agricole du Maroc (CAM) introduced a special financial product (called 

“EcoTaqa”) to finance initiatives that promote renewable energy. Through its Nationally Determined 

Contribution (NDC), Morocco has undertaken to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 42% of projected 

emissions by 2030. The use of solar energy in the agricultural sector is a highly publicized strategy (solar 

pumping is part of the energy efficiency programme contract). In this regard and in partnership with 

GEF/UNDP, AMEE has launched the “Development of photovoltaic pumping systems for irrigation” 

project, which is part of implementation of Morocco’s commitments to develop renewable energy and 

combat climate change. For the climate change adaptation component, Morocco has adopted a National 

Climate Change Adaptation Plan and drawn up a green sectors promotion plan under the law on waste 

management (adopted in 2006).  

5.2.21 Programme Activities and Expected Outcomes. The programme provides for the following 

measures: (i) Presentation of the Energy Efficiency Strategy to the Government Council (by 2030); (ii) 

conduct of the strategic study and provision of mechanisms to support the promotion of solar pumping; 

and (iii) preparation of a skills directory for energy auditors to support the energy optimization for farms 

and agro-industrial units. These measures will promote renewable energy and energy efficiency, and 

facilitate butane substitution in the agricultural sector. 

5.3. Policy Dialogue 

The Government is moving towards the PMV acceleration phase by 2020 following the mid-term 

evaluation of the Plan. The major themes to be addressed in the policy dialogue during the programme 

implementation period are: (i) inter-sector coordination; (ii) sustainable natural resource management 

(reforms related to agricultural water use, agricultural land tenure, renewable energy support, energy 

efficiency and agricultural institutions); (iii) capacity-building (agricultural register, monitoring system, 

private agricultural advisory services, empowerment of inter-professional associations, competitive 

agricultural research mechanisms); (iv) development of green sectors and of the circular economy; and 

(v) the promotion of agro-industry and value chains. Furthermore, policy dialogue will be conducted in 

coordination with development partners, through the existing PMV thematic support group and under the 

G20 Compact with Africa programme.  

5.4. Loan Conditions  

Preliminary Measures - Triggers: Dialogue with the Government led to the identification of relevant 
measures that can support the programme and which the Government has undertaken to implement. These 

preliminary measures were selected based on their maturity status, relevance and significance. They are 

summed up in the table below: 

Table 4: Preliminary measures - Triggers

Measure 3 Start of construction work on a local agricultural vocational training centre 

Evidence: Copy of the service order launching the works 

5.5. Good Practice Principles for the Application of Conditionality  

The five good practice principles for the application of conditionality were factored into the 

programme design in accordance with the Bank's policy governing programme-based support 

operations (PBO), namely: (i) strengthening of national ownership by emphasizing on dialogue with the 

Government throughout the design and implementation of the Bank’s CSP 2017-2021 for Morocco in 

general, and the budget support programme in particular, due to the fact that PADIDFA was designed 

with the active collaboration of the authorities: (ii) the existence of a coordination drive initiated between 

TFPs; (iii) alignment of the Bank's support procedures on national priorities, including the priorities of 

the PMV acceleration phase 2017-2020 and the strategies of associated sectors; (iv) the targeting and 



 

16 
 

streamlining of disbursement measures and conditions resulting from the matrix developed in close 

coordination and cooperation with Moroccan authorities; and (v) alignment of Bank support with the 

country’s budget cycle, especially for FY 2018 and 2019 and the 2018 Budget Act. 

5.6. Financing Needs and Mechanisms  

5.6.1 The 2018 Budget Act provided for a budget of MAD 276.1 billion compared to MAD 285.6 

billion in 2017. This decrease stems from the reduction in operating expenses pursuant to the restrictive 

policy adopted by the Kingdom since 2012. Capital expenditure increased slightly by MAD 2.4 billion. 

According to the Budget Act, the overall financing requirement for 2018 is estimated at MAD 33.3 

billion or approximately EUR 3 billion. Nearly 57% of these needs will be covered by domestic loans 

and 43% by external loans, representing EUR 1.3 billion. The increased recourse to domestic borrowing 

is consistent with the Kingdom's prudent debt management policy. This debt allocation enables Morocco 

to hedge against exogenous shocks, especially against exchange rate risks. PADIDFA will be 
implemented in two tranches of EUR 100 million. In 2018 and 2019, the Bank's budget support will 

cover 3.4% of total budget financing needs (4.5% of the external financing need in 2018). AfDB financing 

will cover 3% of the current account financing requirement in 2018, helping to stabilize external debt by 

preserving foreign exchange reserves.

VI. PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION 

6.1. Programme Beneficiaries  

PADIDFA will benefit the Moroccan population in general, and the youth and women in the rural areas 

in particular. It will specifically benefit: (i) local councils; (ii) inter-professional associations and 

professional organizations; (iii) agricultural VSMEs and organizations (crop sectors, waste management, 

etc.); (iii) the private sector (training, research, private agricultural councils, etc.); (iv) project proponents 

and young agricultural and rural entrepreneurs due to improvement of the business environment; and (v) 

women's associations and rural women (access to value chains, land tenure security, local services, etc.).  

6.2. Impact on the Environment and Climate Change  

6.2.1 Environmental Impact. The programme concerns the implementation of sector reforms and 

will not have any direct or indirect negative impact on the natural environment. Consequently, in 

accordance with Bank guidelines, it is classified in environmental and social category 3. It will enhance 

environmental protection through: (i) improvement of the environmental and social performance of 



 

17 
 

agricultural activities through the development and popularization of tools; (ii) promotion of resilient and 

sustainable agriculture through operationalization of the National Sustainable Development Strategy 

(2015-2030), particularly in the agricultural sector; and (iii) rational management and protection of water 

resources. 

6.2.2 Climate Change. The programme will have a positive impact by promoting the establishment 

of a legal, institutional and organizational framework that facilitates the development of climate change 

mitigation and adaptation measures. Accordingly, it will significantly contribute to the reduction of GHG 

emissions resulting from irrigation activities by replacing diesel and/or gas-powered pumps with solar 

pumps. It will also enable Morocco to play its role under the Paris Agreement and the Nagoya Protocol. 

6.2.3 Social and Gender Impact. Given the social objectives of the programme, social risks are 

virtually non-existent since the programme will ensure the social protection of rural communities and the 

promotion of Moroccan youth and women. In particular, it will focus on: (i) youth and women’s 

integration through the creation, preservation and quality improvement of employment in agricultural 

value chains; (ii) the definition of a framework for protecting and developing agricultural value chains; 

(iii) the inclusion and strengthening of the resilience of women small-scale farmers under the general 

drive to boost the productivity and competitiveness of agricultural businesses. In addition to the 21 inter-

professional associations identified, the programme will benefit young people, particularly women under 

35 who are likely to be absorbed into agricultural value chains as self-employed entrepreneurs, farm 

employees, members of cooperatives or farmer's daughters/sons wishing to perpetuate their family 

farming business. The programme targets 20,000 young people who will benefit from agricultural training 

or support services in rural entrepreneurship.  Besides, the economic empowerment activities of the inter-

professional associations and the signing of delegated training management agreements will improve the 

productivity of their members and develop their marketing and market integration skills at the national 

and international level. The programme will also facilitate the integration of out-of-school youth into rural 

family homes and agricultural apprenticeship training centres where they will be trained in various trades, 

including agricultural production, processing and marketing techniques.  Finally, the programme will 

support the development and implementation of an action plan for women's entrepreneurship that will 

help, in the medium term, to eliminate the major constraints that still hinder the full commitment and 

economic empowerment of women in promising agricultural sectors. 

6.3. Impact in Other Areas  

6.3.1 Apart from the major impacts cited, the programme will support South-South cooperation 

with other African countries. Strategic value chains are likely to initiate and consolidate this cooperation 

(e.g. poultry, olive, red meat, milk, etc.) as well as capacity-building activities on training by inter-

professional structures (e.g. the Casablanca zoopole which is a PPP success story).  

6.3.2 The programme can also generate an impact in other areas, such as regional integration 

(development of regional agricultural trade and exports), food security (increase in agricultural production 

and product development), skills development in the various value chains, agricultural entrepreneurship 

(PMV stakeholders) and the development of private initiatives (resulting from the initiatives of inter-

professional associations, promotion of the circular economy and waste management, etc.). It also targets 

synergy between PAIIM (general budget support) and PADIDFA (sector budget support). 

6.4. Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation  

6.4.1. As was the case for PAPMV-I & II, the programme executing agency will be the 

Directorate for Strategy and Statistics (DSS) in the Ministry of Agriculture. As far as inter-sector 

measures are concerned, the Budget Directorate will be charged with the strategic coordination of the 

programme.  Based on the results recorded, these directorates are qualified and have the required skills. 

The programme provides for the establishment of technical coordination within the Ministry of 

Agriculture and a strategic committee within MEF. The Bank adopts an approach that stimulates synergies 

between the various sector strategies, ensures stakeholder involvement and strengthens the 

complementarity of donor interventions. Special attention will be given to results-based management. 

This operation is of particular interest to seven ministries, namely: (i) MEF (DB); (ii) MA (DSS, DIAEA, 



 

18 
 

DF, DDFP, DEFR, ORMVA); (iii) the sector ministries in charge of water resources, the environment, 

energy and employment and vocational training; and (iv) the inter-professional associations concerned. 

Local involvement is reflected through local structures such as ORMVA, the WBAs and ONCA’s and 

DEFR’s decentralized agencies, etc. 

6.4.2. The matrix of measures agreed upon with the Government and the Performance Measurement 

Framework will serve as PADIDFA’s monitoring/evaluation tools (Annex 2). The MA will collect data, 

coordinate monitoring/evaluation and provide information to the Bank through MEF. In this regard, it 

will produce half-yearly reports providing necessary information on programme’s progress. Supervision 

missions are planned during the implementation phase to assess progress. The Bank's country office will 

continuously monitor the implementation of programme reforms. At programme completion, the 

Government will prepare and submit a completion report to the Bank. That report will serve as the basis 

for organizing the programme completion mission. 

6.5. Financial Management, Disbursements and Procurement 

6.5.1. The ERFP or CFRA was conducted by the Bank in September 2016 through a review of 
Morocco's public finance management. It concluded that the overall fiduciary country risk is moderate, 

thanks to the generally satisfactory public finance management processes. The September 2016 PEFA 

report confirms this finding because Morocco obtained the following 30 ratings out of 31 public finance 

management performance indicators: 5 As, 14 Bs and B+, 5 Cs, 6 Ds and D+.  

6.5.2  The outcomes of these assessments confirmed Morocco's implementation and execution of the 

reforms set out in LOLF No. 130-13 of 2 June 2015. These include strengthening public management 

performance through a programme budget; establishing principles and rules on the financial balance of 

the Budget Act; ensuring public finance transparency; and increasing the role of Parliament in budget 

discussions and public finance control. On this subject, Morocco has initiated a major reform 

implementation drive through a progressive and evolutionary approach. Some reforms have been 

implemented and others are underway. However, the challenge remains optimizing the functional 

organization of MEF to improve reform implementation, which has generated an ongoing study. Fiduciary 

risks relating to the management of programme fund flows are low at Bank-Al-Maghrib, which holds the 

Single Treasury Account.  Budget appropriations management mechanisms are in place in the sector 

ministries involved in the programme and remain under the supervision of the internal and external State 

control bodies. Although these ministries have sector strategies, the strategies are sometimes not fed with 

sufficient data. Due to the weaknesses noted, an LOF training plan is organized for the sectors by the 

Budget Sub-Directorate.  

6.5.3 Considering Morocco’s fiduciary country risk level, the vast public finance management 

reform drive and the fiduciary assessment of the sectors concerned, the programme’s overall fiduciary 

risk is also moderate.  Capacity-building needs were expressed in the areas of triennial budgetary 

programming, programme evaluation, performance measurement, risk mapping package, procedures 

manual and control system, etc.  

6.5.4. Financial Management and Disbursement Mechanisms. MEF will manage the fiduciary 

aspects of the operation.  By its very nature, the operation will help to cover the 2018 and 2019 budget 

deficits, subject to the Borrower meeting its general and specific conditions. Programme funds will be 

tracked through the budget revenue circuit on external funding and in accordance with national regulations 

governing public finance management. The accounting regarding the funds will be based on the budget 

revenue nomenclature. At the Borrower's request, the Bank will make disbursements in two tranches in 

accordance with principles of fungibility (single till) and the single treasury account. Each year, the 

Moroccan Government tables the Audited Budget (“Loi de Règlement”) (BRL) on the execution of the 

Budget Act (FL) before Parliament in the first quarter of year n+2. This BRL is accompanied by the report 

of the Court of Auditors on the implementation of the FL and the general statement of conformity. The 

IGF will carry out the specific audit of programme fund flows and performance audit because of its 

proven experience in auditing the Moroccan PBOs financed by the Bank. The ToRs for the specific audit 

of fund flows were be drawn up by the IGF and discussed with the Bank. The time limit for submission 

of the audit report to the Bank will be six months from closure of the programme. The programme could 

be subject to fiduciary supervision.

6.5.5 Public Procurement Trends and Reforms. The national public procurement system made 

remarkable progress with the installation in January 2018 of members of the National Public Procurement 

Commission (CNCP), which is responsible for investigating complaints from competitors concerning 

public procurement and issuing legal opinions on disputes between public procurement holders and the 

Administration concerning the application of the regulations governing public procurement. In a bid to 

further improve public procurement transparency, the following key actions will be implemented by the 

National Public Procurement Commission (CNCP): (i) creation and commencement of trials for the 

effective operationalization of the CNCP website; (ii) preparation of the Ethics Charter, the internal rules 

of the Commission (including for ad hoc experts), the procedures manual per mission (processing of 

complaints, request and analysis of opinions, standing committees); and (iii) preparation of the strategy 

document on a rolling three-year programme. With regard to reforms, the decree creating the CNCP will 

be reviewed with a view to including the essential function of data-collection and production of statistics, 

among others.  

6.5.6  Sector Context of Public Procurement. Sector analysis highlights the following findings:  (i) 

Social sector: the procurement timeframe (from publication of the bid invitation to contract signature) is 

three months on average; the definition of needs (to prepare a CPS for the construction of a building for 

example) can take up to one year.   The Ministry reported limited productivity among the staff who need 

training in public procurement. (ii) Agricultural sector: in the Ministry of Agriculture, the definition of 

needs takes three to six months. The General Inspectorate of Agriculture carries out audit missions for all 

eligible contracts in accordance with the public procurement decree. However, the summaries of the 

control and audit reports are not published in accordance with Article 165 of the said Decree.  (iii) 

Environment sector: on average, the Ministry of Environment launches a maximum of 15 bid invitations 

for rehabilitation of landfills and two to three for delegated management (design, construction, operation). 

The ministry has introduced terms of reference with ecological specifications (air, biogas) in compliance 

with environmental regulations.  (iv) Water sector: minor weaknesses were noted in the management of 

public contracts, for instance the accumulation of incompatible tasks at the internal control level (e.g. 

needs determination and participation in the bid opening).  

6.5.7  Procurement of goods and services. Being a multisector budget support operation (agriculture, 

water, environment, social), the resources provided by the Bank will be fungible with those of the 

Treasury and used for the country's current needs and procurements, in accordance with the national 

procurement system whose regulatory framework is governed by Decree No. 2-12-349 of 20 March 2013. 

The Bank conducted the latest review of this system in November 2017 through a country procurement 

system assessment using the OECD/MAPS methodology (BPAR), and concluded that the risk level was 

moderate. An assessment of procurement practices in the sectors concerned reveals that no significant 

procurement element would justify the application of a fiduciary risk assessment in identified sectors that 

is different from the situation at the national level. Consequently, usage of the national procurement 

system will guarantee the efficient use of resources to be allocated under this operation, thanks to 

acceptable procurement procedures and an effective and reassuring control mechanism. However, the 

assessment mission identified measures to enhance the transparency of the national procurement system 

and improve the effectiveness of control and audit mechanisms in the agricultural and water sectors (see 

Technical Annex, Volume 2, procurements). To reinforce these improvements in public procurement, the 

government is undertakes to: 

 Publish the opinions issued by the CNCP on its website. This site, currently being finalised, will 
be operational by 31 December 2018 at the latest; 

 Ensure latest 30/06/2018, the effective application of Article 165 of the Public Procurement 
Decree through publication by the Ministry of Agriculture and Maritime Fishing (MAPM) of the 

summaries of all control and audit reports for contracts exceeding MAD 5 million (OC) or for 

negotiated contracts exceeding MAD 1 million DH produced as of 31/12/2017 in the public 

procurement portal. In this regard, the General Inspectorate of the Ministry of Agriculture shall 

submit the verification report to the Bank latest 30 June 2018; 

 Ensure latest 30/06/2018, the effective application of Article 165 of the Public Procurement 
Decree through publication by the Ministry of Water Resources of the summaries of all control 



 

20 
 

and audit reports for contracts exceeding MAD 5 million (OC) or for negotiated contracts 

exceeding MAD 1 million DH produced as of 31/12/2017 in the public procurement portal. In this 

regard, the General Inspectorate of the Water Resources Secretariat shall submit the audit report 

to the Bank latest 30 June 2018. 

 

VII. LEGAL DOCUMENTATION AND AUTHORITY 

7.1. Legal Documentation  

7.1.1 The legal document to be used under this programme is the Loan Agreement. The parties 

to this Agreement are the African Development Bank and the Government of the Kingdom of 

Morocco. The Loan Agreement shall become effective subject to fulfilment of the conditions provided 

for in Section 12.01 of the General Conditions for Loan Agreements. 

7.2. Conditions Associated with the Bank’s Intervention  

7.2.1. Conditions precedent to presentation of the programme to the Board. Through dialogue 
with the Government, it was agreed that the Government will implement certain preliminary measures 

before the programme is presented to the Bank's Board of Directors. These conditions are outlined in 

Table 5 on preliminary conditions. 

7.2.2. Disbursement in two tranches. Disbursement of the loan shall be subject to fulfilment of the 
following preliminary conditions:  

First tranche (EUR 100 million in 2018): Provide the Bank with proof of: (i) the opening of a Treasury 

Account in Bank-al-Maghrib acceptable to the Bank and intended to receive loan resources; (ii) the 

establishment of an inter-sector coordination mechanism, including the creation of: (a) a Programme

create an environment conducive to the achievement of the High 5s and the operational priorities of the 

Bank’s Ten-Year Strategy 2013-2022 and the Country Strategy Paper 2017-2021 for Morocco. No 

exemption from Bank guidelines is requested under this operation. 

VIII. RISK MANAGEMENT 

8.1  Major risks could arise from external shocks caused by unfavourable international 

economic conditions and hydrocarbon price trends. These could be compounded by severe vagaries 

of the weather and extreme phenomena as well as weak inter-sector coordination capacity. With regard 

to components, the risks stem from the overexploitation of natural resources, the marginalization of 

certain groups of stakeholders, divergent interests of stakeholders, the limited capacity of users and 

stakeholders in the cooperative sector, and sociocultural resistance on gender issues.  



 

21 
 

8.2. Mitigating the anticipated risks depends on government's ability to rollover certain 

measures (especially insurance to mitigate climate risk); set up integrated flood forecast and warning 

systems (flood event management); and draft water shortage management plans (drought management). 

These plans should contain measures established in advance in accordance with the degree of scarcity and 

that include all user sectors for proactive water scarcity management. It would also require the 

strengthening of inter-sector coordination through high-level support from the country's 

authorities. At component level, provision is made for consultation committees (working groups) to 

facilitate the search for solutions, particularly on key issues (water, environment, energy and social), as 

well as institutional and legal measures to protect all stakeholders. Each reform is also accompanied by 

awareness-raising and communication actions, particularly on gender and youth issues. Follow-up 

workshops will be organized with the support of the Bank's Office (COMA) to strengthen inter-sector 

coordination. 

IX. RECOMMENDATION 

It is recommended that the Board of Directors approve an African Development Bank loan, not exceeding 

EUR 200 million, for the Kingdom of Morocco to fund the Inclusive and Sustainable Development 

Support Programme for Agricultural Sectors in accordance with the conditions set out in this report. 

 





The PPP irrigation programme concerns the following: 

 New hydro-agricultural development projects: extension of irrigation in 
Gharb (30 000 ha), development of new irrigated areas downstream of 
the Adossa dam (5 442 ha) and the Saiss plain (30 000 ha), located 
downstream of the Mdez Dam ,and extension of irrigation in the Dakhla 
irrigated area using desalinated water (5 000 ha); 

 Irrigation safeguard projects in areas with high agricultural production 
potential: the seawater desalination-based irrigation project in the 
Shtouka area in Souss-Massa (15 000 ha) and the Azemmour-Bir Jdid 
coastal area irrigation project (3 200 ha). 

5. Enhancement of agricultural production 

> Promotion of agricultural exports 

Enhancing agricultural and food exports has always been one of the fundamental 
objectives of Morocco's agricultural policy. The Green Morocco Plan attaches special 
importance to the development and diversification of agricultural exports. It plans to triple 
the export volumes for citrus fruit and vegetables and fruit by pursuing efforts to promote 
exports to new destinations and also to traditional markets such as the European Union. 

Also, in order to help strengthen the competitiveness of the agricultural sector and ensure 
its integration into the European market, financial and technical support was provided by 
the European counterpart under the advanced status arrangement. The support targets 
the modernization of the agricultural sector as a whole and provides for assistance in the 
process for aligning the Moroccan normative framework with the European normative 
framework on sanitary and phytosanitary matters, which would ultimately allow the 
elimination of non-tariff barriers limiting access to Moroccan products. 

Moreover, to enhance and promote production quality, Morocco and the European Union 
concluded, in accordance with the terms of the Agricultural Agreement, an agreement 
on the reciprocal protection of geographical indications (GIs) for agricultural products, 
including fisheries products. This GI protection agreement was initialled by both parties 
in January 2015 in Berlin. 

> Development of local products 
The Department of Agriculture designed a comprehensive strategy for increasing 
existing supply of local products and established a legal framework encouraging farmers 
to promote and market their produce.  

It thus triggered a momentum that motivated the collective upgrading of small-scale 
farming, particularly in mountain and oases areas, where agriculture is characterized by 
remarkable specificities and the products have specific qualities, often bearing witness 
to the time-honoured traditions and secular know-how of the local people.  

Thus, the implementation of Law No. 25-06 on the distinctive marks of origin and quality 
(SDOQ) for foodstuffs and agricultural and fisheries products created the necessary legal 
framework for the recognition and protection of products with a specific quality linked to 
the country. 

The Moroccan system of labelling, implemented since the entry into force of Law 25-06 
in 2009 and up to the end of 2017, has led to the recognition of 53 distinctive marks of 
origin and quality (SDOQ), including 43 marks for Protected Geographical Indication 
(PGI), 5 for Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) and 5 Agricultural Labels. 

> Agropoles for enhancing the value of agricultural products 

As part of the implementation of the Green Morocco Plan, the Department of Agriculture 



 

VIII 
 

established 7 agropoles at Meknès, Berkane, Tadla, Souss, Haouz, Gharb and Loukkos 
to enhance the value of agricultural products through agro-industry. 

Furthermore, in a bid to build the capacity of stakeholders and support the efforts of 
professionals to improve the productivity of competitive and high-potential sub-sectors 
and enhance the value of each region’s agricultural products, the Department of 
Agriculture set up in each Agropole a Food Qualipole comprising 3 groups of specific 
operational laboratories (ONSSA, INRA and EACCE) and common spaces (reception 
centre, conference centre, accommodation area and restaurant). 

III. PRESENTATION OF THE WATER SECTOR 

The water sector in Morocco has been of special interest to public authorities and a 
central concern of the economic policies because of its crucial role in ensuring the 
country's water security and supporting its development, especially in the area of 
irrigated agriculture. 

In this context, Morocco has for long been engaged in a dynamic policy to build major 
hydraulic infrastructure, in an effort to improve access to drinking water, meet the needs 
of industries and tourism, and develop large scale. irrigation. 

Indeed, Morocco has managed to build an efficient water management model specific to 
the country and cited as an example internationally. 

This undeniable success was based on: 

• The water resource control and mobilization policy involving  the construction of 
large reservoir dams (major hydraulic infrastructure comprising 140 major dams 
with a total capacity of nearly 17.6 billion m3), water transfer structures and several 
wells drilled for groundwater; 

• The development of technical skills and applied scientific research; 

• The launch of a long-term planning policy in  the early 1980s that allows decision-
makers to anticipate water scarcity by giving public authorities long-term visibility 
(20 to 30 years); and 

• Lastly, major advances in the regulatory and institutional spheres, such as Law No. 
10-95, which consolidated the integrated, participatory and decentralized 
management of water resources by establishing watershed agencies and 
introducing financial mechanisms for the protection and preservation of water 
resources. 

As part of the modernization of the arsenal of legal provisions on the water sector, the 
Government revised Law No.10-95 on water in order to have a comprehensive, clear, 
precise and applicable legal and institutional framework. Indeed, the new Law No. 36-15 
on water, published in August 2016, strengthened the achievements of the Law No.10-95 
and incorporated new aspects, including: 

• Consolidation and strengthening of management and decentralized, integrated and 
participatory planning of water resources; 

• Strengthening of consultation and coordination bodies and agencies by setting up 
the Basin Council, which is a regional forum for discussion of water management 
issues; 

• Establishment of legal bases for the diversification of supply through the use of 
unconventional water resources; 

• Strengthening of the institutional framework and mechanisms for the protection and 
preservation of water resources through participatory management contracts; and 

• .Integration of the management of extreme events related to climate change. 

Moreover, in order to consolidate the above-mentioned achievements and meet water-
related challenges, the Government drafted the National Water Plan (PNE), which is an 
extension of the guidelines of the National Water Strategy presented to His Majesty on 14 



 

IX 
 

April 2009 in Fez. 

The main principles considered in the development of the PNE action plans focus on: 

 Integrated and concerted management of water demand and water resources; 

 Strengthening of the country's water security and adaption to climate change; 

 Solidarity in its various dimensions; 

  Promotion of good governance in the water sector and the search for efficiency in 
the activities of stakeholders, the search for convergence and the alignment of 
sector programmes; and 

 Search for mechanisms and means of financing the water sector combining public 
subsidies and the direct recovery of costs through water rates. 

The PNE is based on three pillars, namely: 

•  Management of water demand and water valuation; 

•  Supply development; and 

•  Preservation of water resources, the natural environment and adaptation to climate 
change. 

Currently, and in accordance with of the new Law No. 36-15 on water, the National Water 
Plan (PNE) and the Water Resources Integrated Development Master Plans (PDAIRE) are 
being updated to cover the period up to 2050, taking into account impacts of climate 
change. 

IV. PRESENTATION OF THE NATIONAL ENERGY EFFICIENCY STRATEGY 

The 2030 National Energy Efficiency Strategy, which is part of His Majesty King 
Mohammed VI's far-sighted vision for energy transition and the reinforcement of 
renewable energies, aims to achieve a target of 52% of renewable energies in 
Morocco's energy mix. 

This strategy will be translated into a programme contract between the State and 
the Moroccan Energy Efficiency Agency (AMEE). It includes several measures 
planned for the period 2018-2021, affecting the most energy-intensive sectors, 
notably the Transport sector, the leading energy consumer sector with a 
consumption  rate of 38%, followed by the construction sector with 33%, and 
industry with a final energy consumption share of 21%. The agricultural sector 
and public lighting, with an energy consumption rate of 8%, are also targeted.  

Today, the energy bill remains high, given the Kingdom's energy dependence on 
outside sources. This bill is amounts to approximately DH 52.5 billion annually, 
of which 93.3%  is for imported energy, whereas Morocco has an institutional, 
legal and organizational environment that could enable it to guarantee the 
sustainability of this service and ro diversify its sources of energy. 

When this strategy was presented to the Government Council, the latter decided 
to further review the measures and commitments of the ministerial departments 
concerned by the strategy and to verify the indicators in an effort to enable 
collective participation and mobilization of the sectors concerned, and indicated 
that the National Energy Efficiency Strategy would be adopted by a Council of 
Ministers. 

V. AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK SUPPORT FOR THE GREEN MOROCCO PLAN 

The Moroccan Government uses the agricultural strategy of its Green Morocco 
Plan to capitalize on its experience and wishes to deepen its cooperation with 
the African Development Bank through a multi-sectoral support programme for 
the inclusive and sustainable development of agricultural sub-sectors, covering 
the following components: 

• Support for job creation through the development of agricultural and agro-industrial 
sectors, 

• Support for the sustainability of rural employment through the sustainable use of 



 

X 
 

natural resources by the agricultural sector. 

 

VI. MODALITIES FOR THE MONITORING AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 
PROGRAMME 

Based on the first two experiments with the Support Programme of the African 
Development Bank for the Green Morocco Plan, an institutional framework will be 
formalized, focusing on the technical responsibility of the relevant ministries and on 
the overall coordination of the Budget Directorate of the Ministry of Economy and 
Finance.

I. Project Summary 
1.1. The Agriculture Value Chain and Youth Empowerment Project (AVACYEP) is an integrated 
project to strengthen the capacity of rural communities to address the inter-linked challenges of food 
production, rural poverty, food insecurity and access to markets through the provision of horticulture 
and livestock related infrastructure, and improving food production and marketing activities, as well as 
capacity building for the affected communities. The total project cost is 12.241 Units of Account (17.294 
million dollars) over 5 years (2018-2023) and will be implemented in the four districts of Moamba, 
Namaacha, Chókwé and Chonguene with estimated total direct beneficiaries of 20,000 and additional 
20,000 indirect beneficiaries. This project consists of three approaches for scaling up agriculture water 
infrastructure development through: (i) increased horticultural crop production through value chain 
improvement, (ii) contribute to the introduction of best practice agricultural technologies to improve 
productivity of the red meat (i.e. cattle and goats) value chains, (iii) establishment of incubation centers 
for youth and women in order to promote entrepreneurship and agribusiness in order to create an 
appropriate and conducive environment for business development through advisor services and transfer 
of technologies to the beneficiaries of the program; (iv) through the aforementioned activities enhance 
the resilience to climate change and climate variability and risk.   

1.2. Needs Assessment: The AVACYEP emerged from the need to promote a competitive and inclusive 
agribusiness in the Maputo and Gaza provinces through increasing agricultural productivity and animal 
production; providing rural infrastructure to support production (i.e. irrigation, storage facilities); use of 
improved agricultural inputs (i.e. certified seeds and fertilizers); practical and lower-cost breeding 
programs, such as Community-Based Breeding programs (CBBPs); vaccinations; agro-processing; 
access to market; and, promotion of value chain development. The project also emerged in order to 
tackle the Bank’s and Government investment made at the Massingir Dam to promote irrigation 
development for the production of food crops and livestock with the aim of improving food security, 
thereby contributing to the diversification of the agricultural economy in the region, and ensuring wealth 
creation for the rural population, including women and youth. It is expected that the private sector will 
fully participate in supporting the smallholders and the emerging farmers throughout-grower or contract 
farming approaches, supply of agricultural inputs, agro-processing, marketing the agricultural produce, 
and financing agricultural activities.   
 
1.3 Bank’s Added Value: The Project is also in line with the Bank’s High 5 Action Plan the Bank’s 
Ten Year Strategy (2013-2022), Agricultural Transformation in Africa Strategy (2016-2025) under the 
Bank’s High 52 including the Technologies for Africa Agricultural Transformation (TAAT) and Enable 
Youth Programs in order to transform the agriculture sector to enhance the country competitiveness and 
develop domestic clusters of agri-business and integrated value chains that can increase domestic value 
addition, generate jobs and attract FDI and know-how. The AVACYEP will also contribute to the second 
pillar of the new Country Strategy Paper 2018-2022, under preparation, through the envisaged increased 
agriculture productivity as a result of the improved water and land management activities and 
introduction of science based, proven and high impact technologies. The new CSP 2016-2021, currently 
under preparation, focuses on two strategic pillars that have been approved by CODE: Pillar I infrastructure 
development; and Pillar II Agriculture. 

                                                 
2 High 5 refers to the five priority areas that the Bank will be focus on in the next 10 years.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE MANAGEMENT TO THE 
BOARD OF DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED GRANT/ TO MOZAMBIQUE FOR 

THE AGRICULTURE VALUE CHAIN AND YOUTH EMPOWERMENT 
PROJECT (AVACYEP) 

 
Management submits the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed grant of UA 11.00 million 
from the ADF and UA 0.73 million from the Republic of  Mozambique for the financing requirement of 
the Agriculture Value Chain and Youth Empowerment Project (AVACYEP) in Mozambique. 

I. – Strategic Thrust & Rationale  
 

1.1.  PRSP and CSP priorities, Key Development Issue(s) project  
 
1.1 The Mozambican Government has been making efforts to transform the agriculture sector which 
culminated in the preparation of the National Investment Plan for the Agrarian Sector (PNISA -2014 to 
2018, currently under review to extend it up to 2022). Through PNISA, the Government identified 6 
Agricultural Growth Corridors to promote agricultural development, namely: (i) Pemba-Lichinga corridor 
that is suitable for the production of potatoes, wheat, beans, maize, soybeans, cotton, tobacco and poultry; 
(ii) Nacala corridor with potential to grow cassava, maize, cotton, fruits, poultry and peanuts; (iii) Zambezi 
Valley corridor that can produce rice, maize, potatoes, livestock, poultry and cotton; (iv) Beira corridor for 
maize, wheat, vegetables, soybeans, rice, livestock and poultry; (v) Limpopo corridor for rice, vegetables, 
livestock and poultry; and (vi) Maputo corridor that would focus on rice, vegetables, livestock (red meat) 
and poultry. While these corridors are not necessarily aligned to the transport corridors, some have achieved 
a degree of development in terms of infrastructure, institutions and agricultural development, while others 
have not commenced any form of development. 
 
1.2 Under the effort of contributing to the Bank’s Feed Africa Strategy and also supporting the 
implementation of the Government’s 5-Year-Investment Plan, the Maputo and Limpopo corridors have 
been selected for the implementation of this project considering their high potential for unlocking the 
development of approximately 450,000 ha of arable land, out of which 110,000 ha are suitable for irrigation 
development. The target staple commodities include horticulture and livestock (red meat), and are 
considered as priority commodities in both the Maputo and Limpopo Development Corridors, especially in 
the large irrigation schemes of Baixo Limpopo and Chókwé (Gaza Province) and the Sabié-Incomati 
(Maputo Province). The main constraints the horticulture value chain faces are related to the availability of 
appropriate seeds, pest control and processing; while for livestock the challenges are related to health 
(disease control), nutrition (feed stock production) and markets (value addition and processing).  If these 
limiting factors are addressed, both value chains can contribute to the improvement of the quality of life, 
nutrition and income of the local people, in particular youth and women, through the creation of business 
opportunities and decent employment for both groups along the priority agricultural value chains.  
 
1.3 The investments will also complement previous Bank financed projects such as the Massingir Dam 
Agriculture Rehabilitation and Emergency Projects, Baixo Limpopo and climate Resilience project 
(BLICRP), Sustainable Land and Water Management Project (SLWMP) and Drought Recovery and 
Agriculture Resilient Project (DRARP), all of which have invested in irrigation and livestock infrastructures 
and processing facilities for horticulture. The project also incorporates the Technologies for African 



 

2 
 

Agricultural Transformation (TAAT), an initiative to help African countries significantly increase 
agricultural and livestock productivity and production rapidly and at scale by adopting existing 
technologies, including high yielding and climate resilient seed varieties. The project is also well in line 
with the Government’s poverty reduction efforts looking to support increased agricultural production and 
employment promotion (on a national scale) with particular attention given to youth and women. The 
project is furthermore aligned with the Bank’s Ten Year Strategy (2013-22), particularly in its operational 
focus areas (private sector infrastructure) and areas of special emphasis (agriculture and food security). The 
project also aligns with the Banks Climate Change Plan (CCAP 2, 2016-2020) which promotes the 
implementation of climate smart agriculture. Furthermore, the project is therefore expected to provide an 
enabling economic environment for private sector development and participation. 

1.2.  Rationale for Bank’s involvement  
 
1.2.1 The project will be implemented in two provinces of Maputo and Gaza, which have potential for 
horticulture and livestock (red meat) production. These provinces are covered by three of the largest 
irrigation schemes in the country, namely Chókwé, Baixo Limpopo and Sabie, and also accounts for the 
largest number of livestock heads in Mozambique. The interventions under the High 5 are aligned with the 
Government 5-year Plan of promoting agriculture production and productivity, that will increase 
employment as well as improving competitiveness of the national economy. The AVACYEP is in line with 
the Bank’s Ten Year Strategy (2013-2022), Agricultural Transformation in Africa Strategy (2016-2025) 
under the Bank’s High 5, including TAAT and Enable Youth Action Plans in order to transform the 
agriculture sector to enhance the country competitiveness and develop domestic clusters of agri-business 
and integrated value chains that can increase domestic value addition, generate jobs and attract FDI and 
know-how. The AVACYEP will also contribute to the second pillar of the new Country Strategy Paper 
2018-2022, under preparation, through the envisaged increased agriculture productivity as a result of the 
improved water and land management activities. The new CSP 2018-2022, currently under preparation, 
focuses on two strategic pillars that have been approved by CODE: Pillar I infrastructure development; and 
Pillar II Agriculture.

1.4. Comments on Donor Coordination  
 
1.4.1 An active thematic donors’ group for the Agriculture sector named the Agriculture and Rural 
Economic Development Group (led by the World Bank), in which the AfDB is member meets on a regular 
basis.  Other members of the group are: IFAD, USAID, Canada, Sweden, Switzerland/SDC, JICA, Ireland, 
Austria, Italy, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Netherlands, UK/DFID, Norway, European 
Commission, FAO, UNDP, DFID, and Belgian.  Most of these are providing support to the agriculture 
development through the Development Strategy of the Agrarian Sector (PEDSA) 2011-2020, the National 
Investment Plan for the Agriculture Sector (PNISA) and the Integrated Plan for Agriculture 
Commercialization (PICA).  Related to climate change and environment issues, the Bank regularly 
participates in the meetings of the Environment Group, led by the UN.   

II. –  Project Description  

2.1.  Project Components 
 
2.1.1 The overall objective of the proposed Project is to contribute to rural poverty reduction by ensuring 
food, income, and nutrition security in a sustainable manner. The specific objectives are to (i) increase 
horticultural crop production through value chain improvement, (ii) contribute to the introduction of best 
practice technologies to improve productivity in the red meat (cattle and goats) value chain, (iii) establish 
incubation centers for youth and women in order to promote entrepreneurship and agribusiness with the 
goal of creating an appropriate and conducive environment for business development through advisor 
services and transfer of technologies to the beneficiaries of the program; (iv) through the aforementioned 
activities, enhance resilience to climate change and climate variability and risks.

Table 2.2:  Project Alternatives Considered and Reasons for Rejection 
Alternative name Brief description Reasons for rejection 

Focus on cattle value 
chain 

There is a long-standing history of 
research on cattle while small 
ruminants have been relatively 
neglected by international and local 
research  

� There is growing demand for small ruminant meat 
production, especially goats. Meat consumption in 
Mozambique, as in many other parts of Africa, are met by 
imports. The urban population can benefit from local small 
ruminant production, whilst increasing incomes of various 
actors across the meat value chain. Hence this project’s 
focus on small ruminants. 

 A non-integrated 
value chain solution 
for enhancing 
productivity for the 
small ruminants 
sector.   

The challenges of smallholder 
livestock producers in Mozambique 
spans across the spectrum, from 
health, breeding and production, 
feed and forage to value addition 
and marketing 

� Focusing on only one segment of the value chain will be 
insufficient to increase productivity and production 
volumes.  In order to increase productivity, it is key to 
address both supply and demand constraints of the small 
ruminants’ value chain.

services through local  

Use the existing financial services 
to provide financial resources to 
youth and women 

� Bank guarantees are the limiting factor for women and 
youth access to financial services. 

� The Banks do not offer any capacity building on financial 
managements services  

2.3.  Project Type   
 
2.3.1  The project is a stand-alone investment operation with a source of funding mainly coming from 
the African Development Fund blended with Government financing. The Project is one of the three 
selected interventions planned for 2018 under the new CSP for Mozambique 2017-2022.  

2.4.  Project Cost and Financing Arrangements  
 
2.4.1  Project Cost and Financing Arrangement  
 
The Project cost, including physical and price contingencies, is UA 12.24 million, which will be financed 
by (i) ADF Grant of UA 11.0 million (89.6%%) covering all major Project activities, and also taxes and 
duties; (ii) the Government contribution of UA 0.73 million (6.0%) through in-kind (monetary value) for 
existing Government staff salaries participating in Project activities, office space, and office utilities;(iii) 
beneficiaries in-kind contribution of UA 0.24 million (2.0%) through specific labour during installation of 
the irrigation systems, agricultural production activities and also valuable time for attending training 
sessions; and (iv) AfDB TAAT contribution (Grant) of UA 0.3 million (2.4%). The price contingencies 
were based on projected local and foreign inflation rates of 5% and 2% per annum, respectively. The 
physical contingencies ranged from 0% to 8% (works) based on (i) common technical practices, and (ii) 
available Engineer’s cost estimates. Taxes and duties cover the total amount of UA 740.500,00 
corresponding to 6% of the total project costs. This is motivated by the need to ensure seamless project 
implementation in an environment of tight budgetary space for the Government, a full case for the ADF to 
cover duty and taxes, in line with the Policy on Expenditure Eligible for Bank Financing is formulated in 
Appendix IV. Summary of the Project costs by components, sources of financing, expenditure categories 
and schedule by component are presented in Tables 2.3 to 2.6 and the details are in PAR Volume II

2.5.  Project’s Target area and population  
 
2.5.1  The activities of the project will be undertaken in two provinces, Gaza and Maputo. In each of the 
provinces two districts are selected to participate in the project. In Maputo, the project will be implemented 
in the districts of Moamba and Namaacha, while in Gaza the selected districts are Chókwè and Chonguene. 
The selected communities are those that are cultivating horticulture and livestock owners. They will be the 
direct beneficiaries of the activities under the project. The total direct beneficiaries of the project will be 
circa 20,000 individuals, of which about 60% will be women. The project will target 4000 households to 
increase the production of an additional 20,000 small ruminants in four districts in two provinces - Moamba 
and Namaacha districts (Maputo Province), and Chonguene, Massingir and Chókwè districts (Gaza 
Province). The indirect beneficiaries will be in the range of 20,000 people. With an average of 5 persons 
per household this would result in improved livelihoods for approximately 100,000 rural dwellers.   
 
2.5.2 Public institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security (MASA), the Provincial and 
District directorates of Agriculture and Food Security, Veterinary Services, IIAM, the Agriculture 
Development Fund (FDA), the National Institute for Small and Medium Enterprises (IPEME) and the 
Office for Supporting Economic Production (GAPI) will benefit from the project interventions in terms of 
capacity building. Other indirect beneficiaries are agro processors, traders, entrepreneur, various service 
providers, NGOs, etc. In addition to infrastructure and improved agricultural practices, innovative 
techniques needed for quality maintenance of infrastructure, and conservation and processing of food 
products, will be developed.  

2.6.  Participatory Process for Project Identification, Design and Implementation  

2.6.1   Project Identification  
 
The investment in integrated agricultural development in the Lower Limpopo and Sábiè-Incomati regions 
within the Limpopo and Maputo Corridors, will respectively have a component for leveraging the existing 
infrastructure to increase agricultural productivity and producers’ access to markets. Increasing agricultural 
productivity, strengthening its resilience to climate shocks and building agriculture value chains, are all 
areas where the Government of Mozambique is looking forward to working with the AfDB.  



 

8 
 

The Value Chains and Youth Empowerment Project emerged from the need to promote a more competitive 
and inclusive agribusiness in the Maputo and Gaza provinces through increasing agricultural productivity 
and animal production, by providing rural infrastructure to support production (irrigation, storage facilities), 
use of improved agricultural inputs (certified seeds and fertilizers), practical and lower-cost breeding 
programs, such as Community-Based Breeding programs (CBBPs), vaccinations, agro-processing, access 
to market and promotion of the value chain development. The project also emerged in order to tackle the 
investment made at the Massingir Dam to promote irrigation development for the production of food crops 
with the aim of improving food security, contributing to the diversification of the agricultural economy in 
the region, and wealth creation for the rural population including women and youth. It is expected that the 
private sector will fully participate in supporting the smallholders and the emerging farmers throughout-
grower or contract farming approaches, supply of agricultural inputs, agro-processing, marketing the 
agricultural produce, and financing agricultural activities.   

2.6.2   Project Preparation and Appraisal  
The project design was prepared following constant consultations with beneficiaries, government 
authorities, NGOs and development partners in Maputo and Gaza provinces.  While in the field, numerous 
interactions/consultations were conducted at the provincial and district levels; site visits to the selected 
districts and mini-workshops were held; and consultations with government, non -government and 
private organizations as well as community representatives near and within  some of the targeted 
communities were carried out to modify and fine-tune the project proposal. The Bank also deployed 
designed resources to fine-tune into AVACYEP, existing designs from the most recently implemented 
projects, i.e. Sustainable Land and Water Management Project and Baixo Limpopo Irrigation and Climate 
Resilience Project, in order to adjust proposed infrastructures to the implementation sites. The consultation 
also involved the provision of agricultural inputs to match farmers’ needs and their financial limitations to 
ensure sustainability of activities and meet the outcomes. Consultations were also carried out with a number 
of Government authorities and other development partners that participate in different development donor 
programmes.   

2.6.3    Project Implementation  
 
2.6.3.1  The proposed AVACYEP is based o n  a  fully participatory approach involving capacity training 
of members of the community and substantial training through demonstrative processes. The Project 
Implementation Unit (PIU) at the project headquarters and the provincial technical staff will be responsible 
for the monitoring of project results including output and outcome indicators on a participatory fashion. 
Data collection and evaluation tasks would be performed by all the institutions involved in the project or in 
partnership with other relevant institutions under close supervision of the Monitoring and Evaluation expert 
of the project.  The community members will thus develop the capacity to maintain the community 
infrastructure, to be installed with support from the Agriculture Departments. 

2.7.  Bank Group Experience, Lessons Reflected in Project Design  

The overall performance assessment of the Bank’s portfolio in Mozambique conducted in 2017 is 3.30 on 
a scale of 1-4. The portfolio is comprised of 19 projects (17 public projects, 2 private sector projects and 1 
multinational project). There are no projects at risk. Learning from recent Project Completion Reports 
(PCR’s) and the ongoing Bank Projects in Mozambique which have informed the design features of the 
AVACYEP include the need to: a) improve the project design process with consideration to existing 
capacity within the country so as to ensure timely implementation; b) project readiness and quality at entry 
for both regional and national operations; c) Rationalize the number of conditions necessary to declare the 



 

9 
 

Grant effective in order to reduce implementation delays; d) increase capacity of implementing agencies 
especially in the project management); e) enhance the supervision of projects, particularly monitoring and 
evaluation to minimize delays in completion; and, f) delays in provision of counterpart funds, partly owing 
to late approval and release of funds by Government. For the closed Projects in the last 5 years, the PCRs 
are up to date with all the reports prepared and posted on the Bank website.  

2.8. Key Performance Indicators  
The key performance indicators for the project have been outlined in the Result Based Logical Framework.  
Special emphasis in order to assess the changes in the livelihood and nutrition levels within the household 
will be placed on the targeting indicators that should be monitored and those related specifically to women 
as they carry the majority of agriculture activities in the project area. Regular implementation progress will 
be measured through bi-annual Bank supervision missions led by Mozambique Country Office, Quarterly 
Progress Reports, and annual technical and financial audits.  The M&E of the PIU will collect and analyze 
project data to monitor performance. The main performance indicators disaggregated by gender will be 
monitored from the baseline scenario of the log frame include among others: (i) Area developed with 
irrigation kits; (ii) N° of farmers and livestock owners adopting new production technologies (including 
climate compatible technologies); (iii) N° of processing facilities and marketing service providers; (iv) N° 
of surface and subsurface reservoirs, water troughs, multifunctional boreholes slaughter-houses, disease 
control centers, processing facilities and feed stock sites; (v) N° of business plans and proposals approved 
for financing (50% of which owned by females) within the incubation program, including access to financial 
mechanisms; and (vi) number of women & men trained with basic agriculture and livestock skills. All 
indicators selected for the project will help to enhance agricultural performance in the Maputo and Gaza 
Provinces in particular, and in Mozambique in general. The Bank’s various supervision missions and 
periodic activity reports will reflect the level of achievement of the indicators.  

III – PROJECT FEASIBILITY  

3.1 .  Economic and Financial Analysis  
 
The DCF analysis carried out on the net cash-flow gave an Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) of 
28% and the Economic Net Present Value is estimated at USD 220 million at an opportunity cost of 10%. 
The economic values for the production inputs and equipment were developed using a standard conversion 
factor of 0.95, taking into account the taxes in the country. The economic prices used for the horticultural 
and red meat products were the prevailing market prices in the country.  
 
Sensitivity analysis using economic prices showed that a 5% decrease in capital costs marginally increased 
the ENPV to USD 222 million while maintaining the EIRR at 28%. On the other hand, a fall in the product 
prices by 3% reduced the ENPV to USD 93 million and EIRR to 16%.  Refer to Annex 3 on details on 
sensitivity analysis.  
 

FIRR, FNPV (base case) 24.81 % : USD 141 million  
EIRR, ENPV (base case) 28 % : USD 220 million  

 

Note: detailed calculations are available in Appendix in the Volume II, Technical Annex ….. 
 

The financial analysis has been carried out at the farm household level as well as the entire project level. 
This has been done by comparing the benefits accruing to the individual beneficiaries, and aggregated for 
the project as a whole, on a with – and - without project basis. The analysis was carried out for on the 



 

10 
 

horticulture value chains focusing on five priority horticultural crops namely tomatoes, cabbages, 
cucumber, onion and pepper and red meat value chains, the latter focusing on beef and goat meat. The 
analysis is based on the assumption that the participating households will be producing horticultural crops 
under irrigation system and rearing of beef animals and goats under improved management systems. The 
project is expected to increase agricultural productivity through the provision of inputs and irrigation 
facilities, multipurpose boreholes, agro-processing and packaging equipment, livestock equipment and 
infrastructures for disease control and improved sanitation, extension services and institutional 
strengthening and capacity building. The analysis takes into account the current and incremental production 
under the improved management and assumes full production levels from year 3. The analysis shows that 
an average net income (gross margin) per farming household participating in the project will increase from 
USD 22.182 under the existing situation (without project) to USD 31,966 under project situation. The 
discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis carried out on the net cash-flow gave a Financial Internal Rate of 
Return (FIRR) of 24.81%, and a Financial Net Present Value (NPV) of USD 141 million at an opportunity 
costs of 12%.  
 
Sensitivity analysis was conducted on the price changes on for the horticultural and red meat products and 
capital investments in the project. The results showed that a decrease in the prices of produce by 3% resulted 
into a reduction of the FIRR to 14.17% with FNPV of USD 28.30 million. This shows that the revenue is 
very sensitive to changes in the prices. It was also noted that a decrease in the capital cost by 5% resulted 
into an increase in the FIRR to 25.02% and FNPV increased to USD 142.50 million.  

3.2.  Environmental and Social Impacts  
 
3.2.1  Based on the proposed project scope the environmental and social (E&S) classification was 
validated as a Category 2 according to the African Development Bank’s Environmental and Social 
Assessment Procedures (ESAP). Hence an Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) was 
prepared and disclosed on the Bank’s website before 20th of June 2018.  This classification and attendant 
requirement is commensurate with the project classification stipulated by the country’s Regulamento Sobre 
Processo de Avaliação do Impacto Ambiental – Decreto No.54/2015. The principal objectives of conducting 
this environmental and social assessment and planning was to ensure that the project integrates mechanisms 
to reduce environmental impacts along the entire value chain, from production, marketing to product value 
addition/manufacture, usage and disposal. 

3.2.2  Environmental and Social Assessments indicate that although the project will have some site 
specific negative impacts, it is also posed to have numerous positive impacts among them: (i) improved 
production and competitiveness of selected agriculture commodities that will contribute to increased 
income opportunities for value chain actors, and support the local economy of the Gaza and Maputo 
Province; (ii) improved access to irrigation kits that will foster water management and reduce the 
vulnerability of farmers to precarious weather conditions, ensuring all year round agricultural activities; 
(iii) improved agronomic practices and technologies for selected crops and improved varieties that are 
adapted to different climatic conditions; and (iv) improved agricultural production, productivity and market 
linkages that will foster job creation along the value chains. 
 
3.2.3 The negative impacts will stem from a number of activities in the infrastructure development and 
value chain components of the project. The potential negative impacts of the project include those 
associated with the construction of the infrastructure development, and agriculture production and value 
chain activities. Construction activities may result in (i) losses of vegetation cover due to site clearing, soil 
erosion, landscape degradation; (ii) noise, vibration and emissions from operation of machinery that may 
impair air quality and induce health implications: (iii) generation of wastes (including construction wastes); 



 

11 
 

(iv) disruption of water flows and hydrologic cycle which may impact activities of other water users. During 
operation phase, agriculture activities of value chain actors may lead to (i) increased use of agrochemicals 
including pesticides and fertilizers, which may contribute to soil and water (surface and groundwater) 
contamination, and increase health-risks of people exposed to pesticides, and (ii) waste and effluents from 
processing and marketing facilities.  These impacts are site specific and can be readily managed with the 
application of well-defined measures elaborated in the ESMP. Some of the mitigation measures to be 
implemented include (i) refilling the exposed or excavated soil soon after completion of works and avoiding 
or minimizing compaction of soils, (ii) establishing sustainable water management systems, and (iii) 
capacity building of value chain actors to promote good agriculture practices, improved agriculture 
technologies such as integrated soil fertility management (ISFM), integrated pest management (IPM), 
Waste-to-Energy techniques, and other sustainable land and water management practices.  

3.3.  Climate Change  
 
3.3.1  Agriculture production in Mozambique is vulnerable to the impacts of climate variability and 
change.  Drought, floods and storms are increasing in frequency and intensity, while average temperatures 
during the growing season are rising. Crop failure, loss of livestock, reduction in productivity of pastures 
and outbreaks of pest and diseases are exacerbated by extreme climatic events.  Furthermore, severe floods 
and storms damage infrastructure (road, market and storage infrastructure) that support agriculture value 
chain development).  
 
Cognizant of the national commitment to combat climate change, the projects is being prepared taking into 
consideration the various National Strategies, Plans and Institutions relevant to Climate Change among 
them; (i) the Nationally Determined Contribution (2015)   which articulate the actions to be undertaken to 
adapt  to the inevitable impacts of climate change and to contribute to the global mitigation agenda . (ii) the 
National Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation strategy 2013-2030 (2012)  which identifies adaptation 
and climate risk reduction  and low carbon development as national priorities (iii) National Adaptation 
Programme of Action (NAPA) (2007) and the Strategic Program for Climate Resilience (SPCR), aim to 
coordinate the elaboration and implementation of an action plan for adaptation to climate change for various 
economic and social development sectors, with an emphasis on disaster risk reduction, early warning 
systems, agriculture, fisheries, energy, water  resources, ecosystems, and coastal zones.  
 
In relation to the climate risk screening the project is category 2, it is potentially vulnerable to the impacts 
of climate change and requires the identification and integration of practical climate risk management 
measures in project design. In this regards, the proposed AVACYEP will address critical climate adaptation 
needs of the smallholder farmers and other value chain actors in the project area. Some of the priority areas 
of action include (i) increase access to seeds adapted to local conditions (ii) promote good agriculture 
practices such as sustainable land management for increased agricultural yields; (iii) facilitate climate 
proofing of infrastructure, (iv) build capacity for agricultural planning and extension services to facilitate 
dissemination of climate information to farmers, and (iv) promote livelihood diversification.  Overall, the 
project will facilitate climate resilience along the selected value chains by promoting climate smart 
agriculture and improved agriculture technologies.

3.4.  Gender  
 
3.4.1 Agriculture is the most important economic sector for the wellbeing of rural households in 
Mozambique. As such, agriculture is linked to the income and consumption levels of rural households, and 
influences their food security, poverty, and malnutrition status, among other characteristics. Smallholders 
continue to dominate the agrarian sector, with 3.86 million households engaged in small-scale agriculture, 
out of a total of 4.268.585 farms, predominantly farmed by women. Gender mainstreaming in agriculture 
is guided by the Agriculture Gender Strategy. The strategy seeks to guarantee access and control of the 
resources, benefits, rights and equal opportunities, between women and men, and to increase food security 
and household revenue of men and women, with the ultimate goal of contributing to reduction of poverty 
and sustainable development.    

3.4.2 Key gender equality challenges in rural agriculture include i) Access to land- The Mozambican Land 
Law (Lei de Terra) provides for equal access to land for men and women but majority of women still do 
not have security of tenure for the land they work on.  Many are unaware of the registration process and 
access to land is still based on gender structures where women’s claims are usually socially embedded in 
their relations to their male relatives the project will therefore support land registration for women. ii) 
Access to affordable financial solutions- whilst women are the main household financial managers, they 
are often an overlooked target client for financial services providers. Although un- and underserved by 
formal financial institutions, women in Mozambique save using informal methods such as xitique (group 
savings) making them viable customers for local financial services. The project will therefore support 
business coaching, incubation and linkages to financial services for youth and female agripreneurs. Building 
on existing savings groups the project will support the strengthening of community based financial schemes 
to promote financial inclusion in rural areas. iii) Limited production capacity and value addition- both 
women and men in Mozambique are involved in the horticulture and red meat value chains, albeit with 
different patterns between male- and female-headed households. While women generally participate at all 
levels of the chains they face production related challenges and are minimally involved in value addition. 
The project will therefore support increased productivity for women and youth through the provision of 
starter kits for horticulture and red meat value chains including training and coaching in agribusiness, 
animal health, and training of community based extension services workers and creating linkages to formal 
extension services. 

3.5. Involuntary Resettlement 
 
3.5.1  The project is not expected to trigger any form of involuntary resettlement. 

IV – IMPLEMENTATION  

4.1.  Implementation arrangements  
 
4.1.1   The Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security (MASA) will be the Executing Agency (EA) for the 
Project which will be implemented in Gaza and Maputo Provinces, through MASA’s Directorate of 
Planning and International Cooperation (DPCI). A Project Coordination Unit (PCU) will be set up at the 
MASA, for the day to day effective implementation of the Project activities over a period of five (5) years. 
The MASA institutions such as the National Irrigation Institute (Instituto Nacional de Irrigação/INIR), the 
National Directorate of Agriculture and Silviculture (Direccão Nacional de Agricultura e 
Silvicultura/DINAS), Fund for Agriculture Development (Fundo de Desenvolvimento Agrário/FDA), and 
National Directorate for Agricultural Extension (Direcção Nacional de Extensão Agraria/DNEA), National 



 

13 
 

Directorate of Veterinary (Direccão Nacional de Veterinária / DINAV) and National Institute for 
Agricultural Research of Mozambique (Instituto Nacional de Investigação Agrária de Moçambique / IIAM) 
will be responsible for technical implementation in the areas linked with their mandates. Some of the 
components, i.e. Youth and Women Empowerment will be outsourced. The PCU will be constituted of a 
Project Coordinator (PC), Project Accountant, Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Specialist, Procurement 
Specialist and support staff. For effective implementation, the agriculture offices in Gaza and Maputo 
Provinces will be provided with logistical support. The PCU will also be responsible for the overall 
monitoring and supervision of ESMF/ESMP implementation. The Project activities will be supported by 
MASA Technical Council that will compose the Project Steering Committee (PSC) which will be set-up, 
by the Government, to provide oversight responsibility and oversee Project compliance with sector policies 
and strategies. The PSC will comprise MASA Permanent Secretary and senior officials from DPCI, FDA, 
DNEA, DNP, INIR, DNE, IPEME (Institute for Promotion of Small and Medium Enterprises), and GAPI 
(Small Scale Investment Support Office), DNS and IIAM. The PC will be secretary to the PSC. 
 
4.1.2  Financial Management, Disbursement and Auditing Arrangement: 
 
4.1.2.1  Financial Management: The overall conclusion of the FM Assessment is that MASA’s (through 
the Department of National Planning and Cooperation, DNPC) capacity to handle the FM aspects of the 
project satisfies the Bank’s minimum requirements as per the Bank FM guidelines. The Ministry has 
handled donor-funded (APSA- World Bank, PROSUL- FIDA, PASF- Austria, PSP- IFAD and PADR- 
Italy) projects. The DNPC is generally adequately staffed. The Ministry utilizes a functional computerized 
accounting system (e-SISTAFE) to record and process transactions, complemented by use of spread sheets 
for financial reporting purposes for projects. The control environment from budget preparation, execution, 
monitoring and reporting were found to be adequate. There is a functional internal audit unit which will 
further strengthen the internal controls within the ministry including the project. In that regard, the Bank 
will make use of the existing systems within MASA (while closely monitoring and providing assistance as 
required) under the overall responsibility of the Director, Department of Finance and Administration, to 
handle the project’s FM including accounting for the project resources and submitting the required financial 
reports to the Bank. In accordance with the Bank’s financial reporting and auditing requirements, the project 
will be required to prepare and submit to the Bank Interim Quarterly Progress Report (IQPR) no later than 
45 days after the end of each quarter. In addition, the project will be required to prepare separate project 
annual financial statements which will form the entry point for external audit due diligence. The overall FM 
residual risk for the project is assessed as Moderate. (The detailed FM assessment is attached as Annex B4).  
 
4.1.2.2  Auditing arrangement: The MASA has been audited by the Tribunal Administrativo (TA) bi-
annually. The TA is constitutionally mandated to audit all public institutions in Mozambique, however 
given the capacity constraints, some of the audits especially in Bank funded projects have been audited by 
private audit firms competitively recruited with the involvement of the TA. Specific for the project, a 
separate audit report will be prepared for the project annually with the audit carried out by an independent 
external auditor recruited in accordance with the Bank’s requirements. The audit will be conducted in 
accordance with a Bank approved audit Terms of Reference with the costs of the audit financed from the 
grant. The annual audited financial statements including the auditor’s opinion and management letter will 
be submitted to the Bank not later than six months after the end of each fiscal year. 
 
4.1.2.3 Disbursement Arrangements: Flow of funds to finance the institution follows the national treasury 
and appropriation procedures with controls over the use of funds generally adequate. The entity operates 3 
bank accounts with adequate controls over access to the funds and up to date recording of transactions. The 
review noted that donor-funded projects funds have been managed generally satisfactory. However, the 
institution lacks practical experience in managing Bank funds flow. Specific to this project, payments will 



 

14 
 

be primarily by direct payment method where the Bank will pay contractors/consultants and suppliers 
directly based on satisfactory performance in accordance with the Bank’s Disbursement Handbook. 
Disbursements would be made upon preparation and submission of all relevant documentations by DPCI 
to the Bank’s Disbursement Division, through the Bank’s Country Office in Mozambique. In addition, a 
Special Account denominated in USD and its associated MZN denominated project operating account shall 
be opened at the Central Bank, and will be limited for use in paying for the small operating project expenses 
that are recurring in nature. A Disbursement Letter will be issued by the Bank. 
 
4.1.3 Procurement Arrangements:  
 
4.1.3.1 Borrower Procurement System (BPS):  
 
Procurement of goods (including non-consultancy services), works and the acquisition of consulting 
services, financed by the Bank for the project, will be carried out in accordance with the “Procurement 
Policy and Methodology for Bank Group Funded Operations” (BPM), dated October 2015, and following 
the provisions stated in the Financing Agreement. Specifically, Procurement would be carried out 
following: 
 

x Borrower Procurement System (BPS): Specific Procurement Methods and Procedures (PMPs) 
under BPS comprising its Laws and Regulations, namely, Decreto 5/2016 de 8 de Março – 
Regulamento de Contratação de Empreitadas de Obras Públicas, Fornecimento de Bens, e Prestação 
de Serviços ao Estado (Regulations for Contracting of Public Works, Supply of Goods and 
Consultancy & Non-Consultancy Services to the State), using the national Standard Solicitation 
Documents (SSDs) as amended to be in consistent with the new law, using the national Standard 
Bidding Documents (SBDs) or other Solicitation Documents agreed during project negotiations” 
for various group of transactions to be entailed under the project. 

x Bank Procurement Methods and Procedures (PMPs): Bank standard PMPs, using the relevant 
Bank Standard Solicitation Documents SDDs, for contracts that are indicated in Annex B5, Para. B 
5.5, or (ii) in case BPS is not relied upon for a specific transaction or group of transactions; and (iii) 
in case BPM have been found to be the best fit for purpose for a specific transaction or group of 
transactions. 

Procurement Risks and Capacity Development: the assessment of procurement risks at the Country, 
Sector, and Project levels and of procurement capacity at the Executing Agency (EA), were undertaken3 
for the project and the output has informed the decisions on the procurement regimes (BPS, Bank or Third 
party) being used for specific transactions or groups of similar transactions under the project. The 
appropriate risks mitigation measures have been included in the procurement PRCA action plan proposed 
in Annex B5, Para. 5.2. 
 
4.1.3.2 Procurement Risks and Capacity Development:  
 
Procurement Risk Assessments were undertaken for this project by conducting an exhaustive assessment 
covering the risks associated with the country, sector and project environments as well as the Executing 
Agency responsible for the implementation of the Project’s procurement activities.  
  
Most of the issues/ risks associated with the procurement activities for implementation of the project have been 
identified and mitigated. The mitigation measures have been discussed and agreed with the Executing Agency

4.2.  Governance  
 
GoM has been implementing a number of reforms to enhance governance, transparency and accountability. 
There have been major structural and functional reforms with emphasis on policy and institutional actions 
including public financial management system, decentralization and capacity building all in an effort to 
ensure accountability and transparency in Government operations. The Project will be utilizing qualified 
staff to ensure economy and efficiency of project procurement and financial management process. 
Furthermore, the governance structure of the project provides for a statutory body like the MASA Conselho 
Consultivo and Conselho Tecnico (Consultative Council and Technical Council) as the steering committee, 
which gives oversight policy direction for the implementation of the project. The Bank will follow up on 
governance through regular field supervision missions, audit reports, Annual WorkPlan and Budget 
(AWPB), progress reports and procurement plans. The Bank is effectively on the ground with the Country 
Office (COMZ) in Maputo and thus close interaction and follow up will be undertaken at the Country level to 
ensure that implementation of Project activities are on course. The COMZ Sector Experts and from RDGS 2 
will give a quarterly schedule of implementation progress to the Country Manager and the Manager of RDGS 2 
.

4.3.  Monitoring  
  
4.3.1 The monitoring and evaluation specialist will be responsible for the internal monitoring and 
evaluation of project activities and logical framework indicators, working in liaison with the technical 
experts on the project implementation team. The Project Implementation Unit at the project headquarters 
and the province levels will be responsible for the monitoring of project results including output and 
outcome indicators. Data collection and evaluation tasks will be performed by all the institutions involved 
in the project or in partnership with other relevant institutions.   

4.3.2 The PIU will work closely with relevant Ministries Directorates and Agencies of government and 
research institutes for the purposes of data collection, and monitoring and evaluation of the project. The 
PIU will be recruited and staffed with a qualified M&E Specialist, who will benefit from tailored capacity 
building programs to acquaint him/her very well with the scope and nature of the project, and the 
methodology to be followed. The project will support the deployment of an M&E and Management 
Information System (MIS) that will facilitate performance monitoring and impact evaluation against the 
specified indicators, including gender tracker and environmental safeguards related indicators. While the 
performance monitoring process facilitates informed decision-making, the outcome assessment will provide 
information on whether the project has achieved its development objectives.

4.4.  Sustainability  
  
Use of simple technologies that are appropriate for the rural farmers ensures that adoption and replicability 
is assured. The project design is based on feasibility studies as well as stakeholders consultations to ensure 
ownership and sustainability. Community participation and capacity building will further bolster the 
abilities of the various groups to continue project activities even after completion. The market activities 
offer additional sources of income and therefore greater capacity for the horticulture farmers and livestock 
owners to continue with the activities after conclusion of the project. The project will establish 
communities’ led-committees for overseeing infrastructure operation and maintenance as well as for 
enhancing community participation and ownership. The committees will be technically supported by the 
National water and agriculture agencies. The infrastructure to be installed for irrigation and water harvesting 
was selected based on the national plans from both MASA and Ministry of Public Works, Housing and 
Water Resources (MOPHRH). Therefore, the infrastructure will be owned both by the communities and the 
relevant Government agencies and token amounts paid for their day to day operations. 

4.5.  Risk management  
The Project assumes (i) that the Government will continue with its commitment to social and political 
consensus and macroeconomic stability; (ii) Mozambique will have no restriction on water extraction for 



 

17 
 

irrigation; (iii) no restriction on private sector/NGO participation in water harvesting infrastructures and 
setting up of livestock. The current risks include the following:

4.6.  Knowledge building  

The AVACYEP will allocate resources to systematically document and publicize new lessons, especially 
on the adoption technologies for small ruminants and Youth Empowerment components that are less 
documented. The outcome of this project will be carefully monitored and documented. Furthermore, the 
Project will be financing number of studies in particular related to build a knowledge implementation of 
FEAST for monitoring inventory and uptake of feed resources; promotion of forage production and support 
to IIAM for conducting research on effective seed distribution system for forage seeds; introduction of hay 
bale making and ration formulation to young entrepreneurs; construction of multipurpose boreholes for 
water provision. All project related studies and research would be made readily available on the AfDB 
websites for wider dissemination. Finally, the third approach is to bring agro-processing to the farm level 
by farmer and women/youth groups, all of which will also be documented. Contracted service providers 
will train beneficiaries, especially women, on value addition and post-harvest operations including cleaning, 
sorting, drying, cutting and packing produced vegetable. The successes of these practices will also be 
documented.

PROJECT SUMMARY 

1. The Savannah-Based Agricultural Value Chains Development Support Project 
(PADECAS), jointly financed with the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) 

seeks to sustainably grow food and beef production. PADECAS, which will span five years (2019-

2023) and cost UA 22.1 million (CFAF 17.3 billion) including an UA8.28 million grant from the 

Bank, will be implemented in the Prefectures of  Lobaye, Ombella-Mpoko and L’Ouham Péndé. The 

project will target around 60,000 households with over 500,000 direct beneficiaries.  

2. The agricultural sector employs 66% of the labour force and accounts for 23% of GDP. The 
agricultural and livestock sectors together employ 63% of poor households. Thanks to the agricultural 

sector assessment and ongoing operations, the project intervention will target five promising sectors: 

cassava, beans, maize and rice for plant production and cattle for animal production. The value chains 

approach was adopted to boost productivity and agriculture production through the introduction of 

innovative technologies that will enhanced the competitiveness of the sectors. The project will also  

involve the development  of infrastructure to support the sector. Lastly, the project aims to boost 

inclusive development in the sectors, particularly by encouraging the involvement of women and 

young people and improving access to affordable financing and the marketing of productions.  

3. CAR went through an unprecedented political and security crisis between 2012 and 2015. 
Two years after a return to constitutional order and the establishment of all democratic institutions, 

the security situation remains extremely fragile. Indeed, less than 40% of the territory is controlled 

by the Central African State. The crisis had devastating effects on the agricultural and livestock 

sectors,  and led to food and nutritional insecurity as well as increased poverty. In this context, 

improving agricultural and livestock production became an urgent priority for the Government. 

4. PADECAS stems from the CAR Government’s desire to make the agriculture and livestock 
sectors participate actively in the quest for economic growth capable of generating jobs and 

substantial incomes for rural communities. The project is perfectly in line with the Bank’s Ten-Year 

Strategy (2013-2022), especially 2 of High-fives: “Feed Africa” and “Improve the quality of life for 

people in Africa. It is also consistent with the Strategy for Agricultural Transformation in Africa, 

2016-2025; the Strategy to Address Fragility and Strengthen Resilience in Africa (2014-2019); the 

Youth Employment Strategy in Africa; and the Bank’s Technologies for African Agricultural 

Transformation (TAAT) Programme which seeks to disseminate agricultural technologies to boost 

productivity and agricultural production in the selected five sectors.  

5. PADECAS will experiment on a pilot basis: (a) new technologies for increasing 
productivity; (b) inclusive funding mechanisms; and (c) youth entrepreneurship. In addition, a 

mechanism will be put in place to monitor dynamics of the food and cattle sub-sectors as well as the 

initiative designed to extend social protection to rural areas. The sum of these interventions will serve 

as pilot experiments for the Bank in the Central African Republic and generate invaluable knowledge 

for the future development of agricultural sub-sectors in the country and elsewhere in Africa. These 

interventions will be documented and will enable the Central African Government to redirect and 

better entrench its agro-pastoral development policies and strategies.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION BY BANK GROUP MANAGEMENT TO THE 

BOARD OF DIRECTORS CONCERNING A PROPOSAL TO AWARD A TSF AND 

ADF GRANT TO CAR TO FINANCE THE SAVANNAH AGRICULTURAL VALUE 

CHAINS DEVELOPMENT SUPPORT PROJECT  

(PADECAS) 

 

Management hereby submits this report and recommendations concerning a proposal to award 

UA 7.0 million and an ADF grant of UA 1.28 million to the Central African Republic (CAR) to 

finance the Savannah-Based Agricultural Value Chains Development Support Project in 

(PADECAS). 

 

I. STRATEGIC THRUST AND RATIONALE 
 

 National Context 

1.1.1 The outbreak of the March 2013 crisis 
led to the most serious security, political and 

humanitarian crisis in CAR's history. This 

political crisis gave rise to a difficult three 

years’ political transition, supported by the 

international community. The return to 

constitutional order, notably with the elections 

of February 2016, made it possible to form a 

Government regrouping several political 

parties. With the exception of the Senate, all 

republican institutions were set up within the 

constitutional period. The last reshuffle of the 

Government in September 2017 was 

representative, taking into account all the 

sociological and political diversity of the 

country, including representatives of armed 

groups. 

1.1.2 On the security front, the presence of 
the UN peacekeeping force (MINUSCA) of 

nearly 12,000 men has stabilized the country, 

despite the fact that less than 40% of the 

territory is controlled by the Central African 

Government. Community tensions and regular 

clashes between armed groups are common 

across the country. In addition, the formation of 

several armed groups, who now clash for 

control of some areas of the country's mineral-rich territory, hold back hopes of a swift 

appeasement of the situation. On the other hand, in rural areas, especially those with significant 

mineral resources, insecurity remains persistent and could continue until disarmament of armed 

groups is effective. Several mining sites have been taken over by these groups and the resulting 

looting of resources is funds the war and further weakens the capacity of the state to meet the 

urgent needs of the population. 

1.1.3 Despite this relatively volatile security situation, the Central African authorities remain 
strongly committed to implementing the Disarmament, Demobilization, Reintegration and 

Repatriation (DDRR) program, whose success is a key element of the Government's strategy to 

Text box 1: Summary of the main fragility factors in 

CAR 

The key factors of CAR’s  persistent fragility are many, 
complex, and intertwined. The country’s violent political 
history, malfunctioning institutions, previous failed 
disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration 
programmes and social exclusion have hindered social 

and national cohesion. The main challenges the country 
must tackle include: 

Restore security throughout the national territory and 

consolidate peace and national cohesion. Despite the 

return to constitutional order in 2016 and the 

establishment of key democratic institutions enshrined in 

the Constitution, insecurity persists and inter-community 

confrontations have continued in several localities of the 

country. Today the CAR Government controls only a 

very small part of its territory, and armed groups have 

split into numerous uncontrolled rebel factions, which 

has multiplied criminal activities. 

Limited productive capacity of businesses and their 

financial situation depressed by the plunder and 

destruction of their production tools. CAR is particularly 

vulnerable to external shocks because of poor economic 

diversification, including specialisation in primary 

products. Developing the private sector is crucial for the 

expansion and diversification of the economy. 

Poor development of economic infrastructure (transport, 

energy, ICT, water and sanitation). In the context of a 

vast landlocked country like CAR, the availability of 

infrastructure in quantitative and qualitative terms is a 

major factor for reducing fragility and poverty.

work for an inclusive peace. The process launched on August 30, 2017, allowed, the collection 

of weapons, the insertion of more than 200 ex-combatants in the socio-economic process and the 

incorporation of more than 200 others in the national army. 

 Project Linkages with Country Strategy and Objectives  

1.2.1 The country's medium-term development and socio-economic objectives are contained 
in the National Plan for Recovery and Peacebuilding (RCPCA, 2017-2021), adopted in October 

2016. This plan aims to create the foundations for 'sustainable and inclusive economic and social 

development, in particular through' the restoration and extension of the State throughout the 

national territory and massive public investment, in order to consolidate peace. 

1.2.2 PADECAS activities align with the pillars of the RCPCA. In addition, the project is in 
line with the two pillars of the CAR Country Strategy Paper (CSP) 2017-2021 Country Strategy 

namely: (i) Support for agriculture development and for social inclusion support infrastructure; 

and (ii) Strengthening of institutional capacity and governance. The project is also in line with 

the National Agricultural Investment and Food and Nutritional Security Programme (PNIASAN) 

and the National Employment and Vocational Training Policy Framework Paper (PNEFP).  

 Rationale for the Bank’s Intervention 

1.3.1 The agricultural sector employs 66% of the labour force and accounts for 23% of GDP; 
livestock is practiced by more than 80% of the rural population. The two sectors occupy 63% of 

poor households, and are thus crucial for improving food security and reducing poverty. The 

security crisis led not only to the loss of all inputs for agricultural and livestock production and 

the destruction and plunder of socio-economic facilities (storage facilities, markets, 

slaughterhouses, agricultural processing centres, etc.). The necessary support services for 

agricultural and livestock activities also declined during the crisis years. For example, only 4% 

of communes indicate that trade in inputs as fertilizers, seeds and phytosanitary products is 

conducted in their headquarters, which represents a 10% drop compared to the pre-2013 crisis 

period. Approximate 41% report the existence of veterinary services in their communes, 

representing a nearly 60% drop compared to the pre-2012 crisis situation.  

1.3.2 The food security situation remains disturbing. According to the 2016 National Food 
Security Survey (ENSA), about half of the population (48%), making up 2.1 million people, live 

in food insecurity. The crisis takes a heavier toll on women since 22% of urban women declare 

that their income sources are aid, gifts and family transfers, against 14% of men. For their part, 

rural women mostly depend on petty trading, agriculture and processing of natural products. The 

main income-generation- related constraints mentioned by households are the lack of capital to 

invest (61%), the lack of job opportunities (31%) and the lack of land /production equipment 

(27%).  

1.3.3 AfDB’s comparative advantage to implement PADECAS is that the project is in line 
with the Bank’s Ten-Year Strategy (2013-2022), especially 2 of High-fives: “Feed Africa” and 

“Improve the quality of life for people in Africa. It is also consistent with the Strategy for 

Agricultural Transformation in Africa, 2016-2025; the Strategy to Address Fragility and 

Strengthen Resilience in Africa (2014-2019); the Youth Employment Strategy in Africa; and the 

Bank’s Technologies for African Agricultural Transformation (TAAT) Programme which seeks 

to disseminate agricultural technologies to boost productivity and agricultural production in the 

selected five sectors.

 Donor Coordination 

1.4.1 In CAR, aid is the main source of financing for Government programmes. Aid 
coordination has been strengthened under the RCPCA. A Technical Secretariat has been 

established to monitor the implementation of TFP commitments. The Bank, through COCF 

played a key role in putting this mechanism in place.

II. PROJECT DESCRIPTION  

 Project Components 

2.1.1 PADECAS complements IFAD's Agropastoral Production Revival Project (PREPAS). 
It will be implemented through three components as follows: (i) Development of agricultural and 

animal sectors; (ii) Institutional support to the agricultural sector; and (iii) Project Coordination 

and Management. 

2.1.2 Component 1 aims to develop value chains for the cassava, maize, rice, bean, and 
bovine value chains. The project will introduce technologies to improve the productivity, 

processing and marketing of agriculture products. Through this component, the project will 

support farms and groups through an approach focused on the development of a strategy for the 

inclusion of women and youth in selected activities. The project will contribute to the 

establishment of the necessary agricultural and rural infrastructures that will allow the opening 

up of the production areas, as well as the storage, marketing of plant and animal productions. 

This component also aims to provide livestock farmers with the knowledge, skills and material 

resources to increase livestock productivity and production. 

2.1.3 Component 2 supports coordination and dialogue among actors in value chains through 
capacity building of support institutions (the Central African Institute for Agronomic Research 

(ICRA), the National Agency for Development of Agricultural Livestock (ANDE), National 

Federation of Central African Herders (FNEC), Central African Agency for Agricultural 

Development (ACDA)) and through support for partnership between stakeholders, including 

public-private partnerships. The Project will support the preparation, adoption and 

implementation of detailed policy documents, with the aim of improving governance and 



 

4 

 

enabling an effective transformation of the rural environment. These supports will target in a 

non-exhaustive way, seeds being the most decisive factor of production on which the efficiency 

of the other inputs depends. The project will work with the International Labor Office (ILO) to 

create conditions for youth and women's participation in value chains. 

 

2.1.4 Component 3 provides technical, administrative and financial management of the 
project. 

2.1.5 A Summary of the activities for each of the components is provided below.

 Technical Solutions Adopted and Alternatives Explored 

2.2.1 Discussions with the ministries responsible for agriculture and livestock and various 
stakeholders allowed for the consensual adoption of the project’s technical design centred on 

support for the vegetable and cattle sub-sector with private sector participation. The option 

adopted is to introduce proven technologies in the different value chain segments to increase 

their productivity and agricultural production. In addition, the project aims to stimulate and 

support private initiative and lend impetus to inclusive sub-sector development by encouraging

The results of natural breeding are usualy 

modest. The choice to use artificial 

insemination to improve cattle productivity 

is based on numerous advantages offered, 

namely:  

 Better disease control under tropical 
conditions;  

 Post-weaning performance improved 
 Carcass value improved and  
 More productive dairy replacement

on intensive stockbreeding (imported 

breeds, close veterinary monitoring, 

feeding based on concentrates and 

cultivated fodder)  

 Veterinary treatment and intensive 
feeding cannot be afforded by most 

stockbreeders 

 Poor adequacy between human and 
institutional capacity and the practice of 

intensive stockbreeding 

 

 Project Type 

This intervention is an autonomous investment project.  

 Project Cost and Financing Arrangement  

2.4.1 The indicative project cost, net of taxes and customs duty, is estimated at about UA 
22.1 million (CFAF 17.3 billion), 52% of which in foreign exchange and 48% in local currency. 

The project financing includes UA 7 million, or CFAF 5.5 billion, by a TSF grant; UA 1.28 

million or CFAF 1.6 billion by an ADF grant; UA 12.8 million or CFAF 10 billion by an IFAD 

grant; and the rest, UA 1 million or CFAF 784 million constitutes the in-kind contribution of 

Government and beneficiaries. Project activities will span a period of five (5) years. The 

summary of project costs, financing distribution and expenditure schedule is presented in Tables 

4-8. 

2.4.2 The IFAD co-financing comes in the form of a project that will be implemented 
concurrently with PADECAS. IFAD is in the process of developing the project concept note 

which, once approved, will enable the preparation mission to undertake the studies for the 

proposed infrastructure. According to IFAD’s provisional schedule, these studies will be 

conducted at the end of 2018 or at the latest beginning of 2019.

 Project Target Area and Beneficiaries 

2.5.1 PADECAS will intervene in the prefectures of Lobaye in the southwest; Ombella 
Mpoko in the center-west and Ouham Pandé (Bozoum) in the north-west. With regard to support 

to the vegetable and animal sectors; the project area includes the following: (i) for Ombella-

Mpoko: Bimbo, Boali, Bossembele, Damara-Bogangolo; and (ii) for Lobaye: Boda-Mbaiki and 

Boganda-Boganangone. Added to this is Bozoum and Sakai for rice. The choice of these zones 

is justified by their accessibility to the security plan. The project will target about 30,120 

households to be added to the other 30,000 households of the PREPAS Project, making a total 

of 60,120 households with more than 500,000 direct beneficiaries. 

2.5.2 The main areas of the project, Ombella Mpoko and Lobaye, cover an estimated 
beneficiary population of about 1.5 million inhabitants, or 32% of the total population of the 

country. The young make up 61% of this population while women make up 50%. The prefecture 

of Ouham Pandé, which is predominantly young (63% of the total population) and female (51% 

of the population), is estimated at more than 60,000 inhabitants. Agriculture, which mobilizes 

more than 85% of the population, is the predominant sector for the prefecture's economy. Fishing 

Livestock and trade are also practiced. 

2.5.3 A landlocked area whose economy is essentially based on agriculture, the Préfecture of 
Lobaye has enormous potentialities that remain poorly exploited. In fact, of the nearly 2.3 million 

hectares of arable land, only 2% are cultivated each year. The region has a dense hydrographic 

network, 1.750 million ha of forest, 2.75 million ha of pasture and 2 800 km of road and rural 

roads of which only 12% are accessible by vehicle. The prefecture of Ouham Péndé, like the 

whole country, enjoys considerable assets. Its abundant rainfall and very fertile lands that 

facilitated the development of groundnut economy, earned it its former name of "the lung of the 

Central African economy." 

2.5.4 Lobaye belongs to the Guinea forest zone with 9 months of rainy season and 3 months 
of dry season and annual rainfall exceeding 1,600 mm. Mean annual temperature is 23° with 

relatively low thermal amplitude. Ombella Mpoko occupies the Guinean forest zone to the South, 

the Sudano-Oubanguian zone in the Centre and the Sudano-Guinean zone to the North. Peak 

rainfall varies between 1,200 to 1,500 mm per year. Temperatures range between 23 and 24°C, 

making the thermal gap low. Ouham Péndé (Bozoum) sits astride the Sudano-Oubanguian and 

Sudani-Sahelian climates. Rainfall ranges between 900 and 1,200 mm per year. This zone is 

typified by relative humidity with a more contrasted regime and longer periods of sunshine in 

the year, considering the country’s latitudinal position. Mean annual temperature is 25°C while 

the annual thermal amplitude is 6°C. 

 Participatory Approach in Project Identification 

2.6.1 This project was designed using an integrated participatory approach to improve 
beneficiary ownership and build the resilience of the rural poor. PADECAS design is the result 

of popular consultations (meetings and discussions) with stakeholders (rural population, NGOs, 

institutions, etc.) who expressed their views and concerns about the project’s objectives and 

technical choices during the identification, preparation and appraisal phases. Thanks to the 

participatory approach adopted, stakeholders supported the project objectives and technical 

choices. This same approach, used during the formulation stage, will be continued during project 

implementation. Different agricultural sector actors, State agents, the Chamber of Agriculture, 

NGOs, commercial banks as well as MFIs (micro-finance institutions) were all consulted.

 Consideration of Bank Group Experience  

2.7.1 The Bank’s portfolio is being implemented in an unstable security context, 
characterised by the occupation of three-quarters (¾) of the country by rebel factions. In these 

circumstances, project activities will preferably by located in safe areas to guarantee proper 

implementation with real impacts for the beneficiary population. The July 2017 review noted 

shortcomings in terms of project commencement time frames. The above lessons are reflected 

in the project design. This can be seen in the targeted choice of value chains and consequently a 

better concentration in terms of geography and actors. Government also took measures for final 

design studies to be completed and for the coordination team to be established as soon as possible 

to facilitate the commencement of the project.  

 Key Performance Indicators  

2.8.1 In the long term (2030), the key performance indicator is the rate of food and nutritional 
insecurity and the poverty rate. The rate of food and nutritional insecurity is expected decrease 

to 40% from 48% in 2016. In the medium term (in terms of outcomes), PADECAS will 

contribute to increase agricultural production marketed from 8 to 10t/ha for cassava; 1.5 to 4t/ha 

for rice; 0.85 to 1.5t/ha for maize; and 0.86 to 1.3t/ha for red beans. For animal production, 

additional milk production will increase to 10 liters/day from 1.5 liters per day in the optimal 

year of production. Commercial operators’ incomes (producers, agripreneurs, cooperators, 

collectors, processing operators, traders, etc) will also increase by over 100%. Similarly, the 

project will bring the creation of 1,500 permanent jobs and 3,000 temporary jobs, including 75% 

for women and youths through the creation of about 500 local businesses, making it possible to 

improve the quality and living conditions of the poor. 

III. PROJECT FEASIBILITY 
 Economic and Financial Performance 

3.1.1 Economic and financial performance concerned the trading results of the main selected 
foodstuff and animal products (milk and cheese) based on models integrating both project 

support for each value chain segment (production, collection, marketing and processing) and the 

promotion of agricultural entrepreneurship, especially for the youth.  

3.1.2 In terms of profitability, the project posts a satisfactory rate of economic rate of return 
(ERR) of 19% and a net present value (NPV) of CFAF 10.728 billion at 12% capital opportunity 

cost. A test was conducted to measure ERR sensitivity test to cost and revenue fluctuations. It 

revealed that raising investment costs or reducing project revenue by 10% will not have a very 

significant impact on the  economic rate of return of at least 13%. In contrast, this rate is sensitive 

to a simultaneous variation of 10% of costs and revenue. Indeed, if costs increase while revenue 

drops, the effect will be to reduce ERR to 12.4%.  

3.1.3 The real situation is far better because other economic benefits exist which are not 
quantified. These can be summarized as follows: (i) the upstream effects of additional revenue 

on providers (NGOs, businesses, suppliers, consultancy firms); (ii) the downstream effects of 

the generation of additional revenue on producers, traders and processing operators, most of 

whom are women. Foreign exchange costs will also reduce thanks to the significantly smaller 

import bill of food products in the balance of trade; and wealth will be created in the country due 

to the higher GDP induced by the generation of additional value added. For households, the 

project’s benefits include better feeding of vulnerable groups (children, women of child-bearing 

age and the elderly), a reduction of the medical bill and the painfulness of the work of the 

agricultural labour force, especially the female workers.

 Environmental and Social Impact  

Environment  

3.2.1 PADECAS is classified in Category II. The implementation areas for the infrastructures 
are defined and the project will not involve the resettlement of populations nor the restriction of 

their access to resources or means of life. considering the limited scope of the facilities that will 

be constructed and/or rehabilitated. An Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) 

was prepared from 6 to 21 August 2018 and posted on the Bank’s website on 3 September 2018. 

The PADECAS infrastructure will not generate any major negative environmental and social 

impacts. Most will not only provide an answer to real social issues (fight against unemployment, 

socio-economic integration of underprivileged persons, diversification of agricultural and 

pastoral production etc.), but also improve the beneficiary population’s living conditions and 

boost the rural, semi-urban and even national economy.  

3.2.2 No irreversible or large-scale negative impact was reported. Most impacts are 
temporary and time-bound (local nuisances and the dangers confronting workers and the public) 

during the construction phase (flow of waste water from slaughtering areas and the proliferation 

of solid and liquid wastes.). Possible negative impacts include: (i) air pollution by balls and rice 

sounds, transportation of construction materials (sand, gravels), carbon monoxide emissions 

from gasoline-driven rice hulling machines ; (ii) soil pollution linked to cattle and the 

immoderate use of fertilizers and/or pesticides by framers); (iii) risk of water pollution by the 

worksite, use of pesticides and fertilizers, wastes from slaughtering areas); (iv) destruction of 

plant cover; and (v) destruction and moving away of wildlife. 

3.2.3 To prevent these risks, the ESMP already developed will guide the various stakeholders 
in managing the impacts resulting from the activities in question. The cost of implementing the 

ESMP is 70,000,000 XAF. The project management unit will be responsible for the 

implementation of the ESMP. 

3.2.4 At the institutional level, the monitoring of the ESMP is under the responsibility of the 
Directorate General for the Environment and includes the monitoring, impact control and 

evaluation activities. The coordination of the monitoring of the implementation of ESMP is 

ensured by the Ministry in charge of the environment in collaboration with the administrative 

and local authorities of the project area, the Ministries in charge of Agriculture and Livestock 

and as well as local civil society organizations working in the project areas. 

Climate Change Adaptation 

3.2.5 The sectors considered the most vulnerable to climate change in CAR are in order of 
importance: agriculture, health, fishing, energy, water resources, livestock, forestry, wildlife, 

habitat, transport and industry. Although there is no baseline data on GHG emissions in project 

zones, a rise in these emissions is to be expected due to the development of agriculture, intensive 

stock-breeding, and increased road transport due to the production of agricultural and livestock 

products and sub-products and their evacuation to markets.  On the other hand, two mitigation 

actions will be carried out : (i) setting up of rice hulling units running on an energy-mix (gasoline 

and solar power) which can reduce CO2 emissions by 50% to process paddy into polished rice; 

and (ii) planting of hedges to demarcate areas allocated for intensification of stock-breeding as 

these will contribute to the sequestration of part of the carbon emitted. Other actions to be carried 

out  include: (i) the establishment of prairies for cattle fodder; (ii) the introduction of varieties of 

rice, maize, beans and cassava that are adapted to extreme weather risks; and (iii) the restitution 

of crop residues to cultivated soils.  The use of green fertilizers, the reduction of work on land 

and sprinkling of organic fertilizers will contribute to replenish the soil’s carbon stocks. 



 

10 

 

3.2.6 Weather vagaries (floods, late arrival of the rainy season, prolonged drought, etc.) will 
negatively affect the production level and hence, the products of processing. To remedy this 

situation, the project will need to set up on a concerted basis an early warning and control system 

to monitor these vagaries and build the capacity of stakeholders involved in the implementation 

of activities. As recommended, these actions are consistent with the Strategic and Operational 

Plan for CAR’s Climate Change Response for the 2017-2020 period. 

Gender   

3.2.7 Agriculture and livestock breeding are the main activities in the project intervention 
area. Although these activities employ men, women and youths, it should be noted that men 

control these two sub-sectors since cultivated land and cattle herds are mostly owned by them. 

The plant and animal sub-sectors have great economic potentials to create wealth and generate 

significant revenue.  That is why women and youths are excluded from their control. The 

discrimination women suffer in both sub-sectors is further heightened by social roles which 

determine the position of the woman. She is considered as a chattel belonging to her husband’s 

lineage if she is married or that of her father if unmarried. On the strength of that, she is 

recognized to have the right to only use but not to own property of any kind.  

3.2.8 Although empirical data shows that women and youths are present in different 
segments of the selected value chains, no reliable statistical data exists for characterizing their 

involvement in these sub-sectors. PADECAS will support the conduct of preliminary surveys on 

the participation of women and youths in the plant and cattle value chains. The aim is to collect 

as much information as possible to prepare strategies for action. Therefore, the project will help 

to prepare a gender profile in the selected value chains. Besides, the project plans to construct 

markets for agricultural and dairy products mostly controlled by women.  

Social  

3.2.9 PADECAS will have a sure impact on the population’s food insecurity, seen in 
increased production and better product quality from the five sub-sectors concerned. It will also 

improve the nutritional status of the direct beneficiaries of the support comprising about 60,000 

households including 55,000 children who are under 5 years old and 22,000 pregnant women 

and breast-feeding mothers who are the most vulnerable to malnutrition. Improving the 

nutritional status of women and children will contribute to reducing mortality and morbidity in 

the project areas. Indirectly, all nutrition-sensitive activities such as water/sanitation 

interventions will also contribute to the better nutrition of the population.  

3.2.10 The success of PADECAS’ advocated approach consisting in concentrating activities 
by intervention site will induce a process of self-satisfaction and popular support among the 

population. Due to proximity, this will allow for endogenous development throughout the project 

area, the only factor that can, in the medium-term, roll back poverty, unemployment and rural 

exodus. Youth and women’s entrepreneurship will help to reduce unemployment in the project 

area and increase the incomes of the most vulnerable segments of the population.  

 

IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION  
 

 Implementation Arrangements 

4.1.1 PADECAS will be placed under the joint supervision of the Ministry of Agriculture 
and Rural Development. MARD will supervise the project and, as such, coordinate interactions 

with other sector ministries, technical and financial partners as well as coordinate monitoring 



 

11 

 

and evaluation activities in relation to PREPAS. National-level consultation will be handled by 

a National Steering Committee (CNP) which will be established by a joint order of MADR and 

MESA. At the devolved level, consultation will be done within sub-prefectural Consultative 

Committees (CC) which will approve investment plans at their level and supervise 

implementation in order to ensure that they are aligned and consistent with regional strategies 

and other sector interventions. 

4.1.2 The project will be managed by the PPF Coordination Unit under way for the Support 
for the CAR Agricultural Transformation Strategy and Youth Agriculture and Agri-Business 

Entrepreneurship Promotion (PASTAC-PEJA) whose capacity will be strengthened by recruiting 

new experts. An Order of MADR to broaden the mandate of the PASTAC-PEJA Coordination 

Unit into the PADECAS Management Unit (UCG) must be signed before project 

commencement. Three area offices will be created in the project area within the sub-prefectures 

of Boda, Bouali and Damara. 

 Procurement Arrangements 

4.2.1 Applicable Procurement Policy and Framework :All procurement of goods, works and 
consultancy services financed with Bank resources will be done in accordance with the 

Procurement Policy for Bank Group-Funded Operations (AfDB Policy), October 2015 edition 

and the Methodology for the Implementation of the Procurement Policy of the African 

Development Bank. Details of procurement performance (system, cost, schedule, method, 

review type) agreed between the Borrower and the Bank are described in Technical Annex B.7.  

4.2.2 Procurement implementation: Project procurement will be carried out by a 
procurement expert of the Project Management Unit to be recruited through an open call. This 

expert will be recruited as soon as the project commences in order to carry out procurement 

activities as defined in Technical Annex B7 with the support of a Procurement Assistant, civil 

servant of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development to be appointed. To this end, the 

Central African Government has submitted to the Fund a request to authorize early actions for 

the following acquisitions: recruitment of an administrative and financial manager, a 

procurement specialist and an expert in monitoring and evaluation. 

4.2.3 Procurement Capacity and Risk Assessment (ERCA): In order to take the 
specificities of the project into consideration, the Bank assessed: (i) risks at the national, sector 

and project level; and (ii) the capacity of the executing agency. The results of these assessments 

concluded that the risk level for procurement is high and made it possible to determine that all 

project procurements will be carried out according to the Bank’s system, subject to the 

application of the mitigation measures proposed in paragraph 5.9 of Technical Annex B.5. 

 Financial Management  

4.3.1 The evaluation concluded that the Project Coordination Unit does not have the 

adequate and satisfactory financial management capacity to provide, with reasonable 

assurance, accurate and complete information in a timely manner on the status of the 

project as required by the Bank. The initial level of fiduciary risk related to aspects of 

financial management is considered high due to: (i) the absence of a manual of procedures 

incorporating the specificities of the PADECAS project; (ii) the size of the current fiduciary team 

which is not adequate to manage project funds. In fact, apart from the accountant, the team does 

not have an administrative and financial manager; (iii) lack of refresher training for the existing 

team (revised SYSCOHADA, cash management, disbursement procedures, internal control, 

etc.), this situation may cause the project to risk significant errors in the financial statements for 

the 2018 financial year; (iv) the absence of accounting software; and (v) the absence of an 



 

12 

 

independent internal inspection mechanism within the Unit (internal audit and / or financial 

controller). As a reminder, some of these weaknesses were identified by the evaluation mission 

of the PPF of July 2017, without a satisfactory evolution being observed. Arrangements have 

been formulated to reduce this level of risk. 

4.3.2 Financial Management Arrangements: The fiduciary responsibility for the 
implementation of the project lies with the Central African Republic through the Ministry of 

Agriculture and Rural Development. The Coordination Cell set up under the PPF will be 

responsible for the overall coordination, technical coordination and financial management of the 

project. 

4.3.3 Financial management of the project will be ensured through the implementation of the 
following system: (i) development of the manual of administrative, financial and accounting 

procedures in order to integrate the improvements provided by the new provisions of the revised 

SYSCOHADA standard. It should also describe the organization chart of the project with all the 

actors involved in its implementation, the roles and responsibilities and activities of each actor, 

(ii) organize training in the revised SYSCOHADA, cash management and internal control for 

the benefit the entire Project fiduciary team; (iii) recruitment of an administrative and financial 

manager; (iv) validation of financial reporting formats within three months of effectiveness to 

improve the quality and timeliness of financial statements required by the Bank, (v) in the 

absence of an internal auditor, ensure the involvement of the financial controller of MADR in 

the chain of validation of expenditure and disbursement. In addition, the Coordinator should be 

personally involved in the proper functioning of the internal control system. Before the 

disbursement of resources for capacity building, ensure the implementation, and control by users, 

management tools for the periodic establishment of accounting, budget, and financial reports and 

financial statements closing date. 

 Disbursements  

4.4.1 Disbursement of the FAD and TSF resources under the project will be done pursuant to 
the provisions of the Disbursement Handbook in force at the Bank. For ADF resources: the direct 

payment method for the payment of goods and works. For TSF resources: (a) the special account 

method (for operating expenses, capacity building activities, and the management of certain 

partnership agreements) and (b) the direct payment method for the payment of works , goods 

and service contracts. 

4.4.2 The opening of the XAF-denominated special account for TSF resources, for 
PADECAS, under the responsibility of MADR will be carried out in a local bank deemed 

acceptable to the Bank. All supporting documentation for project expenditures (all funding 

combined) will be filed and maintained in a secure location and in accordance with the Law. 

These supporting documents must be available and accessible for review / audit / audit by 

periodic Bank supervision missions, external audits and internal audits. 

 Audit Arrangements 

4.5.1 Pursuant to the general conditions of the Bank, an annual audit of financial statements 
including, will be performed by an independent audit firm which will be recruited on a 

competitive basis. MADR’s PMU will be responsible for recruiting the independent audit firm 

with the support of the Unit’s Procurement Expert. The selection of the firm will be done 

according to Bank procedures. The auditor’s terms of reference will comply with the model in 

force at the Bank, and submitted for the latter’s approval.  



 

13 

 

4.5.2 The contract with the auditor will not exceed three years and the acceptance by the 
Bank of the first audit report is a prerequisite for the auditor to continue his work. The scope of 

the audit will cover all project activities, all sources of funding, as well as the activities of the 

value chain development fund. Audits reports shall be transmitted six months after the end of the 

fiscal year at the latest. 

 Project Monitoring and Evaluation   

4.6.1 The basic tool for monitoring and evaluation of this project is the logical framework 
that details the impact, effect and product measurement indicators. The PADECAS monitoring 

and evaluation officer who will be recruited after approval by the Bank of his qualifications and 

experience will be placed under the authority of the coordinator. He/she will be responsible for 

the monitoring and evaluation of project activities and the implementation of the ESMP. He/she 

will also be responsible for establishing a diagnosis and baseline situation for the project as well 

as developing specific tools for planning and data collection 

4.6.2 The PMU will be required to provide the Bank with a quarterly report showing progress 
in implementing the approved program and annual budget. This report should include the 

following information for each activity: the physical objectives, the level of achievement and the 

explanation of any discrepancies, the expected costs and actual costs, and the explanations of 

any discrepancies, the financial data of the project. The Bank will carry out two (2) supervisory 

missions per year to assess progress in terms of realization of products and effects as well as 

administrative and financial performance. The mission will then make recommendations to 

improve project implementation. A performance status report will be written after each 

supervision mission. A review will be scheduled mid-term and a project completion mission at 

the end. The project implementation schedule is summarized below.

 Governance 

4.7.1 The multi-sector good governance challenges (environment, agriculture, livestock etc..) 
to be tackled include lengthy time frames and transparency in procurement, the establishment of 

a reference framework for planning investments, transparency in the financial management of 

works maintenance associations and obstacles to the implementation of sub-regional and 

regional policies. However, the management of public resources and the state of corruption in 

the country require that greater attention be paid to procurement mechanisms. In this framework, 

PADECAS should be implemented to strengthen local institutions and improve citizen control 

through better involvement of civil society and farmers’ organisations. 

 Sustainability 

4.8.1 The fact of carrying out activities that meet stakeholder demands, global sub-sector 
needs and priority national and local guidelines while empowering national partner institutions, 



 

14 

 

is the main guarantee of the project’s sustainability. Since the selected value chains indeed exist 

already, the project places emphasis on strengthening their segments and on integrating them 

with a view to upgrading and professionalizing these sub-sectors. Besides, the targeted value 

chain actors (producers, stock-breeder, transporters, processing operators, research, supervision 

and support/advice structures, etc.) participated in project design and are committed to being part 

of its implementation and steering. The involvement of sub-prefectural consultative committees 

makes project ownership possible at the decentralized level. 

4.8.2 The works will be managed and maintained by the beneficiaries or communes. The 
sustainability of the project largely depends on the quality of the works and adequate 

management and maintenance conditions. It also depends on the level of ownership by actors 

and beneficiaries as well as the desire and commitment displayed by Government and devolved 

structures, mostly sub-prefectures, to provide long-term support for the management of 

structures and facilities constructed by the project. There are plans to mobilize technical 

assistance support under PREPAS to define a viable model for the management of all 

infrastructure that will be constructed as part of AfDB and IFAD projects to ensure their 

profitability and sustainability.  

4.8.3 Project actions will also serve to lay the foundations for the promotion of 
entrepreneurship within small foodstuff and market-gardening cooperatives as well as animal 

production cooperatives. In the same vein, project actions in areas such as capacity-building in 

entrepreneurial culture, business management, organisational dynamics of beneficiary groups 

and the management and maintenance of works will stimulate the emergence of small and 

medium-sized enterprises also taking into consideration the technical, financial and 

organizational dimensions. They will also foster inclusive and responsible growth. All these 

support packages taken together constitute additional guarantee of the sustainability of outputs 

while enabling the dynamic initiated to continue after the project ends. 

 Risk Management  

4.9.1 The risks that could limit the achievement of project objectives are related to: (i) the 
deterioration of the country's political and security situation and its spread in the project area; 

(ii) looting of project assets by armed groups; (iii) extreme weather events. The risks identified 

above will be mitigated by strengthening the efforts of the Government and the International 

Community to fight against insecurity and by integrating the adaptation dimension into the 

project activities. 

 Knowledge Building 

4.10.1 PADECAS will experiment on a pilot basis: (a) new technologies for increasing 
productivity; (b) inclusive funding mechanisms; and (c) youth entrepreneurship. In addition, a 

mechanism will be put in place to monitor dynamics of the food and cattle sub-sectors as well as 

the initiative designed to extend social protection to rural areas. The sum of these interventions 

will serve as pilot experiments for the Bank in the Central African Republic and generate 

invaluable knowledge for the future development of agricultural sub-sectors in the country and 

elsewhere in Africa. These interventions will be documented and will enable the Central African 

Government to redirect and better entrench its agro-pastoral development policies and strategies.

PROJECT SUMMARY  

 

General Project Overview: The rural sector has enormous agro-pastoral and environmental 

potential, comprising: 9 million hectares of arable land, about 59% of which is cultivated; 

233,500 ha of irrigable land, about 30% of which is currently exploited; 500,000 ha of mud 

plains that are relatively easy to develop; and enormous potential for the development of 

irrigation, fishing and aquaculture. The above-mentioned high potential, existing prospects of 

diversifying crops and increasing yields, and the existence of a local and sub-regional market 

represent opportunities for stimulating the agricultural and rural sectors.   

 

By intervening in four regions of the country (North, Centre-North, Boucle du Mouhoun and 

Centre-West), the project will create enabling conditions for more inclusive economic growth 

that can reduce youth unemployment and under-employment. Its purpose is to ensure a closer 

match between young people's professional qualifications and the required labour market 

profiles by: (i) strengthening the existing technical and vocational training available to young 

people in rural areas; and (ii) developing the entrepreneurial skills of young people wishing to 

establishing their own businesses in sectors with real job creation potential.  

 

Component 1 is aimed at supporting the entrepreneurship of young higher education graduates 

trained in agriculture and agribusiness, while Component 2 targets skills development to boost 

the employability and entrepreneurship of rural youth, regardless of whether they are graduates 

or not. The total project cost, net of taxes, is estimated at UA 11,444 million, including UA 

10.30 million that will come from the ADF. The project will be approved in September 2018, 

for a five-year performance period. 

 

The Bank’s Value added: The Bank’s value added arises from the implementation of the Jobs 

for Youth in Africa Strategy (2016-2025), which seeks to promote employment and 

entrepreneurship with a view to ensuring inclusion; strengthening human capital; and creating 

sustainable links on the labour market. The project seeks to support the entrepreneurship of 

young graduates in agribusiness, in line with the Enable Youth initiative which is one of the 

flagship programmes of the Strategy for Agricultural Transformation in Africa and Jobs for 

Youth in Africa Strategy. Furthermore, the project will create appropriate conditions for skills 

development by improving the existing vocational training and apprenticeship system for rural 

youth in sectors that have a real job-creation potential. 

 

Knowledge Management: The various studies to be conducted and the strategic plans to be 

formulated in the area of youth employment and entrepreneurship will lead to the 

implementation of relevant measures for strengthening the national mechanism. Formulation 

of the strategic plan to develop a single fund that finances the projects by youths and women, 

as well as the economic and financial feasibility study for the Vocational Training 

Centre/Incubation Centre (CFP-CI) will improve the effectiveness of public funds and 

operationalize the incubator of the Assessment and Vocational Training Centre of 

Ouagadougou (CEFPO). In the area of technical and vocational education and training (TVET), 

the project plans to formulate a strategic plan for the National Vocational Training Agency and 

conduct studies on the establishment of incubators in vocational training centres. These 

activities have a strategic impact on knowledge development and will ultimately improve the 

effectiveness of the country’s vocational training system. A monitoring/evaluation mechanism 

is planned under the project to capitalize on knowledge and leverage the lessons that will be 

learned from it. The knowledge and lessons learned will be published on the Bank's websit e 

and in project reports, publications and videos.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT FUND 

MANAGEMENT TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS CONCERNING THE AWARD OF A 

GRANT TO BURKINA FASO TO FINANCE THE SUPPORT PROJECT FOR YOUTH 

EMPLOYMENT AND SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN RURAL AREAS 

 

Management hereby submits this report and recommendation concerning a proposal to award a grant of 

UA 10.30 million to Burkina Faso to finance the Support Project for Youth Employment and Skills 

Development in Rural Areas (PADEJ-MR). 

I. STRATEGIC THRUST AND RATIONALE 

 Project Linkage with Country Strategy and Objectives  

1.1 PADEJ-MR is perfectly consistent with the National Economic and Social Development Plan 

(PNDES, 2016-2020), which focuses on three strategic pillars, namely: (i) reforming institutions and 

modernizing the administration; (ii) developing human capital; and (iii) boosting sectors that guarantee 

economic growth and jobs. Pillars 2 and 3 focus respectively on education, vocational and technical 

training, health, access to drinking water and sanitation, improving agricultural productivity, and 

increasing value added in the agri-food and service industries. 

1.2 The project is also consistent with the National Strategy for the Development of Agricultural 

Entrepreneurship (SNDEA, 2017-2026), which is the framework document for promoting agricultural 

entrepreneurship in Burkina Faso. The promotion of agricultural entrepreneurship is intended to address 

the low agricultural productivity resulting mainly from extreme vulnerability to agro-climatic conditions, 

land insecurity and especially difficulties in accessing funding, inputs and agricultural equipment.  

Similarly, the project is consistent with the 2018-2020 Three-Year Action Plan of the Ministry of Youth, 

Vocational Training and Employment (MJFIP) which lays emphasis on conducting a series of priority 

actions to achieve the integration of young people into the economic circuit.  

1.3 The project is consistent with: (i) the Long-Term Strategy (LTS) 2013-2022 through its 

operational priorities “Skills and technologies” and “Private Sector Development”; (ii) the Human Capital 

Strategy 2014-2018 whose overall objective is to improve employment skills; and (iii) the Jobs for Youth 

in Africa Strategy, whose flagship programmes include the promotion of rural micro-entreprises and agri-

business by young graduates. The project is fully in line with the Bank's High-5s, notably “Feed Africa” 

and “Improve living conditions for the people of Africa”. Lastly, it ties in well with Pillar II of the Bank's 

Country Strategy Paper (CSP, 2017-2021) to support agricultural sector development for inclusive growth. 

Lastly, the project is included in the indicative programme of the CSP. 

1.2 Rationale for Bank Involvement  

1.2.1 The rural sector has enormous agro-pastoral and environmental potential, comprising: 9 million 

hectares of arable land about 59% of which is cultivated; 233,500 ha of irrigable land, about 30% of which is 

currently exploited; 500,000 ha of mud plains that are relatively easy to develop; and enormous potential for 

the development of irrigation, fishing and aquaculture. The above-mentioned high potential, existing 

opportunities to diversify crops and increase yields, and the existence of a local and sub-regional markets all 

constitute opportunities for stimulating the agricultural and rural sectors.   

1.2.2 The country also has a diverse regulatory framework (framework law on agriculture, forestry, 

livestock, wildlife and fishery activities; law on rural land tenure; investment code for the agriculture, 

forestry and livestock sectors, etc.), offers many opportunities for developing agricultural entrepreneurship 



 

2 

 

and is endowed with an abundant and accessible agricultural labour-force. However, there are many 

obstacles to job creation and entrepreneurship, namely: (i) low levels of training and skills, especially 

among the youth; (ii) a wide discrepancy between the profiles of job-seekers and the economy’s potential; 

(iii) a weak culture of entrepreneurship; and (iv) a large informal sector, characterized by precarious and 

very low-paid jobs. Furthermore, according to the diagnosis carried during the preparatory studies of the 

project, youth employment in the agricultural, forestry and livestock sectors is constrained by many 

challenges, including: (i) access to financing; (ii) better ownership of the process to establish a legal and 

regulatory framework for agricultural entrepreneurship; (iii) support for stakeholder professionalization; 

and (iv) strengthening of stakeholder capacity throughout the value chain. 

1.2.3  These issues are central to the challenges that the Bank intends to address through this operation. 

The Bank's comparative advantage in this operation resides in its experience in Burkina Faso’s agricultural 

and social sectors which it has financed through several investments. These experiences have provided 

the Bank with expertise in skills development, promotion of agricultural value chains and improvement 

of youth employability in rural areas. The Bank's value added in this new operation resides in promoting 

the business spirit and entrepreneurship of young higher education graduates in agricultural value chains 

with a view to creating a critical mass of young farmers through incubation and establishing a financing 

mechanism that will reduce risks associated with establishing a business in the agricultural sector. 

1.3 Aid Coordination  

1.3.1 The Government has established 14 sectoral dialogue frameworks (SDFs) as part of PNDES 

implementation. The dialogue framework is led by the FAO in the rural sector; and by Italian cooperation 

in the employment sector. The AfDB is a member of these two dialogue frameworks. Furthermore, since 

2009, technical and financial partners (TFPs) have set up a harmonization mechanism in the form of a 

troika, which serves as a consultative entity and interface with the Government. The AfDB was the lead 

agency of TFPs from 2013 to 2014. 

1.3.2 This operation complements other Bank projects and those of other partners under appraisal or 

implementation (see Annex III). The employment sector benefits from the support of bilateral and 

multilateral financial partners for the implementation of projects and programmes to improve 

employability and employment. The Bank intends to continue its coordination and complementarity efforts 
with these and other partners during the implementation of this project.

II. PROJECT DESCRIPTION 

2.1 Project Components   

2.1.1. The project seeks to create conditions conducive to more inclusive economic growth that can 

reduce youth unemployment and under-employment. This will be done mainly by mainstreaming 

employment into sector policies and developing young people’s skills in conjunction with the productive 

sector. The project focuses on three complementary components.  

2.1.2. The first component is aimed at supporting entrepreneurship among young higher education 

graduates in agriculture and agri-business with a view to: (i) encouraging them to create and develop 

businesses within the agricultural value chain; and (ii) providing them with the skills and support 

necessary for them to succeed in this sector and to build a respectable professional career through a quality 

incubation process and a seed funding mechanism for their business projects. 

2.1.3  Component 2 focuses on skills development to promote the employability and entrepreneurship 

of rural youth, be they graduates or not. The aim is to improve the matching between young people's 

vocational qualifications and the profiles required by the labour market by: (i) strengthening the existing 

technical and vocational training available to young people in rural areas; and (ii) developing the 

entrepreneurial skills of young people who wish to establish their own businesses in sectors with real job 

creation potential.

4.81 (42%) 

The activities planned under this component are presented, in 

chronological order, as follows: 

(i) Awareness-raising for 5,000 youths (50% being women) to change 
their perception of agriculture This activity is necessary to demonstrate to 

young people that agriculture is not only about tilling the land, it  also  

includes many opportunities to create businesses in which they can make 
a career and flourish as in any other sector. To that end, the project will 

conduct information and awareness campaigns using relay workers and 

organize exchange and experience-sharing visits. 

(ii) Incubation of 350 young university graduates (50% of whom are 
women) to provide them with intensive support to ensure the success of 

their businesses: training, support, access to markets and funding, contacts 

with partners, etc. This activity will be conducted by a public incubator, 
namely the AFP-PME, and private incubators selected and contracted for 

this purpose. The following criteria will be used to select partner 

incubators: similarity of targets with the project; convergence of 

intervention areas; relevance of the candidate selection and incubation 
methodology; and the ability to connect incubates to the market. These 

criteria will be evaluated for the AFP-PME and for the private incubators. 

(iii) Business development through the establishment of a seed fund 
accessible to young entrepreneurs undergoing incubation processes to 

fund the early developmental stages of their (often pre-commercial) 

businesses. This seed fund will be entrusted to the Burkina Faso Fund for 
Economic and Social Development (FBDES) (see text box on the FBDES) 

on an agreement basis, with the objective of financing 500 young 

entrepreneurs (350 higher education graduates and incubates, and 150 CFP 

and CPR graduates who have also benefited from incubation).

The main activities scheduled are: 

(i) Strengthening of the technical and vocational education and training 

(TVET) system through the rehabilitation and equipment of 6 VTCs, 

namely Gourcy (North), Tougan, Boromo, Toma and Solenzo (Boucle du 

Mouhoun) and the provincial ANPE centre of Koudougou (West Centre); 
and 4 RPCs, namely Kodougou (Boucle du Mouhoun), Goundi (West 

Centre), Kongoussi (North Centre) and Bonam (North Centre). 

(ii) Improvement of young people's skills through training in the priority 
occupations found in the PNDES (agriculture, forestry and stockbreeding; 

construction and public works, handicrafts and emerging trades) adapted 

to the needs of the labour market with a target of 1,300 young people, 50% 

of whom are women.

(iii) Professional integration of 650 young people (50% of whom are 

women) with access to employment and 150 young entrepreneurs. The 
objective of integrating 650 young people into the labour market will be 

achieved through: (i) the effective implementation of the national strategy 

for the integration of trained PSCs; (ii) capacity-building support for 
integration stakeholders on the mastery of labour market needs and job 

niches; (iii) support for the development of a partnership between training 

centres (through the supervisory ministries) and enterprises (through 

employers’ organization); and (iv) traceability and monitoring of VTC and 
RPC graduates. Furthermore, the project will select 150 young people 

(50% being women) among the 1,300 trained and desirous of building 

their own business and grant them access to two incubation centres that 

will be created (in 1 VTC and 1 RPC) to support them in their projects.

and coordination 

1.14 (10%) 

The main activities to be conducted are: Administrative and financial 
management, planning and monitoring-evaluation, coordination, 

procurement, audit, communication, monitoring of cross-cutting issues 

such as gender and environment.   

2.2 Technical Solution Adopted and Alternatives Explored  

2.2.1 The project was designed to address the issue of youth integration more effectively through: (i) 

the integration of young higher education graduates into the agricultural value chain as entrepreneurs; and 

(ii) the improvement of employability in growth sectors. The option chosen is twofold, namely: (i) creating 

a critical mass of young entrepreneurs with higher education degrees within the agricultural value chain 

by strengthening their entrepreneurial capacities through incubation and facilitating their access to start-

up capital through a seed fund; the success of these young entrepreneurs and their role as “leaders” will 

serve as a model for raising awareness among other young people, thus creating a virtuous circle that 

should contribute in developing the employment potential of the agricultural sector; and, (ii) improving 

the supply and quality of vocational training for rural youth in order to fill the skills gap in certain 

promising sectors and limit training inefficiencies. Ultimately, skills training for promising occupations 

will help to combat under-employment and low productivity in rural areas and thus maintain or even 

attract young people to rural areas with high economic potential through decent work and income. 

2.2.2  This option was preferred for its capacity to cover the entire ecosystem (agricultural value chain, 

incubation, seed funds) and its potential impact on youth entrepreneurship in a sector (agriculture) 

generally considered as unattractive and unpromising for young graduates and the rural world that is often 

equated with poverty and exodus.

2.2.3  The following alternatives were also explored; but rejected for the above-mentioned reasons. 

 

Alternatives Brief Description  Reasons for Rejection 

Supporting 

access to funding 

for businesses 

without an 

incubation 

process 

This approach would entail 

granting loans to companies 

selected according to certain 

criteria and from a fund 

established within the banking 

system 

- Given the high failure rate of new businesses (over 85% go bust 
before the third year), these loans have a very low repayment 

rate. 

- Financial support for companies does not always lead to growth; 
only a rigorous selection of entrepreneurs with the potential to 

succeed, as well as intensive support through incubation, can 

guarantee viability and sustainability. 

- This approach would focus more on the enterprise than on the 
entrepreneur, unlike the adopted option which guarantees a better 

chance of generating a critical mass of entrepreneurs within the 

agricultural value chain. 

Capacity-

building for the 

TEVT system 

This approach would entail 

strengthening the capacities of 

VTCs/RPCs in order to increase 

the supply and quality of 

training: 

- Training in the trades alone is insufficient, since it does not take 
into account the fact that many trained young people do not have 

the capacity to engage in entrepreneurship. That is why the 

training is combined with an incubation process. 

 

2.3 Type of Project  

2.3.1 PADEJ-MR is an autonomous operation in the form of a grant for an investment project. At this 

stage, the project approach is the most appropriate way to guarantee the achievement of results and ensure 

the effective and efficient use of resources. 

2.4 Project Cost and Financing Mechanisms 

2.4.1 The total project cost, net of taxes and customs duties, is evaluated at UA 11.44 million. This 

cost comprises UA 3.892 million (34%) in foreign exchange and UA 7.552 million (66%) in local 

currency. It is financed by an ADF grant of UA 10.30 million and a Burkina Faso Government contribution 

of UA 1.14 million (10%). ADF financing consists of UA 10.30 million from the ADF 14 country 

allocation. 

2.4.2 Costs were determined on the basis of information obtained from official structures, national 

market stakeholders and the Bank's experience in financing similar activities. They included a 3% 

provision for price increase in accordance with the standards of the Central Bank of West African States 

(BCEAO) and a 5% provision for physical contingencies. Tables 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5 below present project 

costs by component, financing source and expenditure category and Table 2.6 presents the expenditure 

schedule by component.

2.5 Project Area and Beneficiaries  

2.5.1 The project area (PA) selected in accordance with the Government's proposal was defined based 

on the following criteria: (i) high agricultural, forestry, livestock and fisheries (AFLF) potential as well as 

economic potential; (ii) exposure to climate risks; (iii) a high proportion of young people in the region; 

(iv) a high poverty rate in the locality; and (v) the existence of training or financing structures in the region. 

Hence, the Project will be implemented in the following areas: North Region, Boucle du Mouhoun Region, 

Centre-West Region and Centre-North Region.  The beneficiaries of the project are mainly: (i) young 

people living in rural areas; (ii) trained young people, whether qualified or less qualified; and (iii) young 

higher education graduates. The target age bracket is between 15 and 35 years for men and up to 50 years 

for women. Lastly, the project will benefit the following target population: (i) 5,000 young people in terms 

of awareness-raising to guide them towards agricultural value chain professions; (ii) 500 young 

entrepreneurs (350 young university graduates and 150 young people from TVET structures who will all

benefit from incubation services); (iii) 1,300 young people trained in VTCs and RPCs, at least 50% of 

whom will be able to find jobs on the market; and (iv) 1,500 young people who may be employed in the 

500 enterprises created. 

2.5.2 In addition to age (young people between the ages of 15 to 35 years for men and up to 50 years 

for women), the selection criteria will be as follows: (i) for access to incubation services and the seed fund, 

the criteria will be those set by partner incubators; they will be based on the entrepreneurial potential of 

the candidate, the innovative nature of his project and its development and job creation potential; (ii) for 

access to technical and vocational training system, the criteria will be those already in force, albeit with 

an improvement through consultation between the supervisory Ministries (Agriculture and Employment) 

and employers in order to identify sectors, needs, qualification types, etc.  

2.6 Participatory Approach to Project Identification, Design and Implementation 

2.6.1 Project preparation followed a participatory and iterative process that facilitated the consultation 

of all stakeholders. Indeed, consultations were held with public sector institutions (Ministries concerned); 

the private sector (companies, employers); NGOs/CSOs (umbrella farmers’ organizations); as well as 

technical and financial partners active in vocational and technical training, and business creation and 

support. The diagnostic study led to the conduct of surveys among youth and women “entrepreneurs” and 

“potential entrepreneurs” in order to identify the various constraints and expectations regarding the 

project. The stakeholders insisted on: (i) better targeting of young beneficiaries by focusing on their 

entrepreneurial potential; (ii) better handling of the issue of access to funding; (iii) better coordination 

between various stakeholders; and (iv) the quest for synergy with ongoing initiatives. The stakeholders’ 

recommendations were factored into project design, mainly through: (i) the establishment of a rigorous 

mechanism to be initiated by the incubation centres for the selection of young beneficiaries; (ii) the 

establishment of a seed fund; (iii) the strengthening and management of a national consultation framework 

between public and private operational stakeholders (employers, financing structures), and; iv) 

complementarity with ongoing youth employment initiatives. 

2.6.2 This participatory approach followed during project formulation will be continued during project 

implementation. The monitoring-evaluation process will also involve the various stakeholders for the 

proper conduct of project actions. A gender-sensitive information and communication system will also be 

established to regularly disseminate information on project implementation results. 

2.7 Bank Group Experience and Lessons Reflected in Project Design  

2.7.1 As of 30 April 2018, the Bank Group’s active portfolio in Burkina Faso comprised 18 projects 

worth a total of UA 454.04 million in commitments. Of these commitments, UA 69,22 million covers 

agriculture through five projects and one PPF. The total disbursement rate is 39.66%. The portfolio review 

conducted in March 2018 found the overall performance satisfactory. The Bank’s previous interventions 

in the social and agricultural sectors focused on developing rural infrastructure; enhancing food security; 

addressing inequalities; supporting income generation and access to basic social services; improving 

access to and quality of basic education; and building the capacity of the education and training sector. 
Completion reports have been prepared for all these projects. These various reports showed that the 

performance of these operations was generally satisfactory and their impact on the ground was perceptible. 

2.7.2 The main lessons learned from these projects are: (i) the importance of ensuring good quality at 

entry by carrying out studies during the project preparation phase; (ii) the need for appropriate targeting 

of beneficiaries; (iii) the need to take gender into account; and (iv) the need to set up an effective internal 

and external monitoring and evaluation system. These lessons have been factored into this project through: 

(i) the mobilization of a PPF to carry out diagnostic and baseline studies of the project; (ii) the conduct of 



 

10 

 

a rigorous selection of beneficiaries based on their entrepreneurial spirit as well as the innovativeness and 

job creation potential of their project; (iii) the proposal of incentive measures and actions to encourage 

women to contribute to and benefit from the project's spin-offs; (iv) the setting up of a monitoring-

evaluation mechanism involving the various structures and partners of the project as well as the 

strengthening of employment support and monitoring units; and (v) the setting up of an innovative and 

adapted support and financing mechanism. Lastly, the conditions precedent to first disbursement for 

portfolio projects have been met or are well on track. 

2.8 Key Performance Indicators  

2.8.1 The main performance indicators are those included in the logical framework, whose monitoring 

shall be coordinated by the project monitoring/evaluation expert in conjunction with all partners and 

associated structures. Particular emphasis will be placed on targeting the most relevant parameters that 

can be monitored and collected internally, and all indicators will be disaggregated by gender, with the 

objective of reaching 50% of women for each indicator. 

2.8.2 Monitoring will specifically cover: (i) the under-employment rate in rural areas; (ii) the number 

of young people reached through awareness-raising; (iii) the number of young people who have benefited 

from incubation services; (iv) the number of businesses created; (v) the number of jobs created by the 

incubated businesses; (v) the number of training establishments strengthened; (vii) the number of young 

people trained in TVET and starting their own business; and (viii) the number of young people who 

obtained employment after their training. A monitoring/evaluation mechanism will be established as soon 

as the project is initiated.

 4% unemployment rate for VTC/RPC trainees 

 Risk rate of 10% for the cash-flow of newly created businesses

 seed fund 

IRR  
(Internal rate of return) 

32.8% 

(*) The assumptions for calculation are discussed in detail in Technical Annex B7.  

3.1.1 The project is economically viable. Indeed, it alone will help to place 1,300 young people trained 

in vocational training centres (VTCs) and rural promotion centres (RPCs) on the job market to exercise 

trades with high employment potential desired by employers. Furthermore, it will facilitate the creation of 

500 businesses by young people (350 higher education graduates and 150 VTC/RPC graduates) who will 

in turn be able to create 1,500 jobs. Furthermore, the project will sensitize 5,000 young people to the 

agricultural and agribusiness professions. 

3.1.2 Overall, the net present value (NPV) of the project is CFAF 62 billion (which is indicative of its 

viability), and the internal rate of return (IRR) is 33% (which is well above the opportunity cost of capital 

set at 12%). The sensitivity tests conducted suggest that the IRR would vary within a range of 28% to 34% 

depending on the reasonable assumptions used.6 

                                                
6  These results are detailed in the Technical Annex B.7. It should to be noted that the economic rate of return (ratio of the o perating income to amount of 

capital invested), has not been explicitly calculated for the project. The reason is that the notions of equity or net results are not very relevant in component

3.2. Environmental and Social Impact 

3.2.1 Environmental Impact: The activities planned under the project mainly focus on awareness-

raising and capacity-building; the setting up of incubators (structures which receive and guide project 

proponents); increased access to technical and vocational training; support and coaching; facilitation of 

access to finance, etc. Most of these activities will take place in existing facilities (training centres) and 

will not have any direct negative impact on bio-physical and human environments. Implementation of the 

project will not lead to community displacement or the loss of assets or access to resources. Moreover, it 

presents very low risk of accidents, waste generation and non-compliance with working and safety 

standards. 

3.2.2 The sharing and dissemination of best practices as well as awareness-raising on compliance with 

hygiene and quality standards for future agricultural entrepreneurs will enhance the positive impact of the 

project. Actually, the project will generate very little direct adverse impact. In accordance with the national 

legal framework, namely Decree No. 2015-1187 of 22 October 2015 on conditions and procedures for 

conducting and validating environmental and social assessments and its Annex 1, the project, by its nature, 

is not subject to an environmental and social impact assessment. However, it has provided for the 

establishment of a Seed Fund to facilitate young entrepreneurs’ access to funding that is tailored to their 

situation, but which could generate some adverse environmental and social effects if certain measures are 

not taken. The potential negative impacts will be on a medium to small scale, and will concern certain 

agricultural projects submitted for financing by the Fund. Such risks essentially pertain to deforestation to 

create rights of way; as well as worksite pollution and nuisances (noise, dust, safety, etc.) during the 

execution of certain works, owing to non-compliance with certain security and hygiene best practices, etc. 

3.2.3 The project is classified under Category 4 (FI B) in accordance with the Bank's environmental 

and social procedures. Category 4 projects relate to loans or grants awarded by the Bank to financial 

intermediaries, which onlend or invest in sub-projects that may have adverse environmental and social 

effects. 

3.2.4 The Burkinabé Economic and Social Development Fund (FBDES), which is responsible for 

managing the Fund, is required to apply the Operational Safeguards (SO) and equivalent Bank procedures 

to their sub-projects and to comply with national environmental and social requirements. It is also required 

to locally publicize the Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS) of the project which is 

being designed. The ESMS provides guidelines for establishing an environmental and social selection 

process and for determining the activities eligible for Seed Fund financing, depending on the scale and 

nature of their potential impacts on the environment. Furthermore, the ESMS defines the monitoring and 

surveillance framework, the institutional measures and provisions, as well as the capacity-building needs 

and other assistance to be provided before, during and after project implementation. 

3.2.5  Climate Change: The target areas are the Boucle du Mouhoun, North, Centre-North and Centre-

West regions. These areas remain characterized by enormous pressures on natural resources and recurrent 

droughts which sometimes alternated with periods of heavy rainfall that severely aggravate the 

vulnerability of ecosystems and communities. However, given the nature of the project and the main 

activities and sectors targeted (capacity-building, coaching, awareness-raising, support, etc.), the risks and 

vulnerabilities associated with climate change that could arise from project activities are very few. These 

activities are not likely to generate direct negative impacts or major risks for natural environments. Some 

suggested measures to optimize the positive impacts of the project will enhance resilience to climate 

change through the implementation of a series of activities including improving value chains that will help 

                                                
2 of the project where most young people who are trained will enter the job market as self-employed workers in the informal or simple wage sector, such 

that it would not be possible to determine what the amount of their equity would have been (especially for the self -employed). 

 



 

12 

 

to enhance agricultural production systems, reducing extensive practices, applying agricultural best 

practices and introducing innovative techniques. 

3.2.6 Social Impact: The popular uprising that rocked Burkina Faso in 2014 was rooted, inter alia, in 

the social tensions inherent in youth unemployment and under-employment. A few years later, the 

relevance given to the issue of employment and the development of young people's skills in rural areas 

are such that the activities of this project constitute a guarantee of more inclusive growth in the country. 

With regard to the positive effects of the project, a significant social impact will eventually be achieved 

in terms of a reduction of the risks of social exclusion by improving the employment situation of young 

people (decline in the youth unemployment and underemployment rate). More generally, the expected 

project implementation effects will help to reduce the poverty rate estimated at 40.1% in 2014 (Sources: 

INSD, EMC 2014) and which will decrease to 35% in 2020 according to PNDES projections. 

3.2.6.1 By creating jobs for young people, including women, the project will increase their autonomy 

and raise household incomes. This will enhance the economic context in the project area and the country 

as a whole. Furthermore, the increase in agri-food production and the promotion of agri-food processing 

and marketing will improve the nutritional situation of Burkina Faso’s vulnerable population in particular. 

Finally, the project will help to curb rural exodus by keeping young people within their communities while 

enhancing regional and local potential in agricultural value chains, public works and innovative trades. 

3.2.7 Gender: Gender analysis in Burkina Faso shows wide disparities and inequalities between men 

and women in most sectors of economic and social life. In terms of employment, the net activity rate in 

the first quarter of 2014 stood at 67.9% for the whole country, 76.8% for women and 60.2% for men. In 

both urban and rural areas, this rate was higher for men than for women. For instance, it was 71.7% for 

men compared to 58.1% for women in urban areas and 78.9% for men compared to 61% for women in 

rural areas.7 When women hold salaried employment, they tend to work at the lower end of the scale. This 

is essentially due to the socio-cultural strictures that define the role of men and women in society, because 

education and the family tend to shape the future of girls and boys from birth.  

3.2.7.1 To address this situation, the project plans to take into account all aspects of the gender 

dimension. Accordingly, incentive measures and actions are proposed to encourage women to contribute 

to and benefit from the project. The project has extended the age of beneficiaries from 16 to 50 years for 

women compared to 15 to 35 years for men, and plans to raise awareness in the project area by targeting 

women. Personalized and group coaching activities will also be initiated for women to guide them in the 

establishment of their businesses. It has also been proposed that mentoring and reference model (role 

model) activities will be organized to motivate young women to enrol in vocational training courses 

traditionally considered to be the preserve of men. Parental awareness campaigns to prevent and combat 

early marriages are also envisaged in order to keep girls in school for as long as possible so that they can 

achieve the level of education and training deemed necessary for professional integration. The project is 

classified in “category 2” according to the Bank's gender marker system. The detailed gender analysis and 

categorization requirements are presented in Technical Annex B.8. 

3.2.8  Resettlement: The project will not lead to community displacement or restriction of access to 

resources or livelihoods.

IV. IMPLEMENTATION 

4.1 Implementation Arrangements  

4.1.1 Institutional arrangements for project implementation: With reference to the new general 

regulations for development projects and programmes signed on 15/02/2018 (Decree N° 2018-

092/PRES/PM/MINEFID), this project will be attached to the professional integration budgetary 

programme of the Ministry of Youth, Vocational Training and Integration (MJFIP). Accordingly, the 

Director General for Vocational Integration and Employment (DGIPE) is responsible for the budgetary 

programme and is de facto the Project Coordinator. It will be supported by a Project Officer, a procurement 

expert, an administrative and financial officer, an accountant, an expert in youth employment, and an 

expert in monitoring/evaluation responsible for cross-cutting issues (gender and environment). A 

description of the profiles of key PMU personnel can be found in Annex C1. The project will establish 

agreements/protocols with implementing structures, namely; the technical services and the other 

implementing partners selected (AFP-SME, FBDES, FONAENF, DGPER, DGFP, DGFOMR, ONEF). 

These conventions will lead to the establishment of an annual schedule of activities to be carried out by 

each structure, with precise budget and performance indicators. 

A reporting mechanism and a review committee serving as a supreme policy body will be established. 

4.1.2 The review committee shall assume the functions devolved to the Project Steering Committee in 

accordance with the new general regulations for development projects or programmes implemented in 

Burkina Faso. Specifically, it shall: (i) review and adopt the project implementation plan; (ii) review and 

adopt the periodic activity and financial reports; (iii) review and adopt the annual activity programmes, 

budgets and procurement plans; and (vi) approve  project financial statements. 

4.1.3 Ongoing monitoring of project implementation, including the results to be achieved, is a major 

challenge for the project. The Project Management Unit (PMU) will ensure the establishment of a 

monitoring/evaluation mechanism. On the Bank side, COBF will manage the implementation of the 

project supervision missions. Moreover, the PMU will prepare and submit quarterly and annual progress 

reports. The budget for monitoring/evaluation activities will be covered by the project's operating budget. 

4.1.4 Procurement Arrangements: Goods (including services other than those of consultants) funded 

by the Bank under the project shall be procured in accordance with the Procurement Framework for Bank 

Group-funded Operations, October 2015 edition, and in accordance with the provisions set out in the 

Funding Agreement. Specifically, procurements will be conducted according to: 

i) The procurement system (PS) of the Donee: Procurement methods and procedures 
(PMP) applicable to the Donee's procurement system, including its implementing laws and 

decrees, in particular Law No. 039-2016/AN of 02 December 2016 on the general public 

procurement regulations and Decree No. 2017-0049/PRES/PM/MINEFID on procedures for the 

award and settlement of public contracts and the delegation of public services, as well as its 

various implementing texts. This will be done using National Standard Bidding Documents 

(NSBDs) or other bidding documents as approved during project negotiations for low-value and 

low-complexity routine works and goods contracts under the project and generally available in 

Burkina Faso. Details on the thresholds are found in Annex B.5. 

  



 

14 

 

ii) Bank’s Procurement Methods and Procedures (BPM): The Bank's standard BPMs, 
based on the relevant standard bidding documents (SBDs) for contracts above the thresholds 

specified in Annex B5, Para. B.5.3.2, will be used for larger, more complex and high value goods 

and works contracts, as well as consultancy services, for which the country’s fiduciary risk is 

deemed to be substantial. 

4.1.5 Assessment of procurement risks and capacity (APRC): An assessment of the national, sector 

and project risks and of the capacity of the executing agency (EA) to manage procurements was conducted8 

under the project and the results were used as a basis for choosing the procurement system (Donee or 

Bank) used for given activities or a set of similar activities under the project. The appropriate risk 

mitigation measures have been included in the PERCA action plan indicated in paragraph B.5.9. of Annex 

B5. 

4.1.6 Financial Management  

4.1.6.1 Financial management and disbursements: Despite the reforms undertaken since 2013 to improve 

the public finance management system in Burkina Faso, the latest PEFA 2017 shows that certain 

weaknesses persist and continue to hamper budgetary effectiveness and efficiency. Indeed, wide variations 

are always observed between the initial and the final budget, both in terms of amount and the composition 

of revenue and expenditure. This situation, which undermines the credibility of the budget, mainly stems 

from shortcomings in the planning and budgetary framework. A few sectors do not yet have sectoral 

policies. Furthermore, some ministries and institutions have not formally appointed their programme 

managers. In this context, the creation of a PMU for PADEJ-MR within the Directorate General for 

Vocational Integration and Employment (DGIPE) is necessary in accordance with Decree No. 2018-0092 

on the general regulation of development projects and programmes implemented in Burkina Faso. 

Moreover, capacity-building must be organized for the PMU on project management and the Bank's rules 

and procedures. To ensure the effective financial implementation of PADEJ-MR, the Ministry of Youth, 

Training and Vocational Integration will undertake a number of actions immediately after approval of the 

funding.9 These include:10 (i) creation of the Review Committee and the appointment of its members; (ii) 

creation of the PADEJ-MR PMU within the Directorate General of Professional Integration and 

Employment and the appointment of a Project Officer; (iii) the recruitment of financial management and 

procurement experts and the accountant; (v) the procurement of accounting software (multi-project), 

software configuration and staff training; (vi) the recruitment of an external auditor; and (vii) the opening 

of two special accounts: the first one dedicated to defrayment of the operating expenditure of the PMU 

and the second for the seed fund. Details on financial management and disbursement are provided in 

Annex B6. 

4.1.6.2 The special account method will therefore be used to finance operating expenses and the seed 

fund. To that end, two special accounts will be opened: the first special account will be used to finance 

the PMU's operating expenditure and the second will be used for the seed fund. As a condition precedent 

to the disbursement of seed funds (to be included under “Other conditions”), the Donee must provide the 

Fund, no later than three (3) months after entry into force of the financing agreement, with a partnership 

agreement signed with the FBDES to host and administer the seed fund. This agreement shall define the 

conditions justifying the use of special account resources to be submitted to FIFC.3 for approval. 

                                                
8 See the technical annexes for more information. 
9  In dialogue with the Government, initiatives will be taken by COBF to accelerate and/or anticipate the establishment of the PMU to ensure rapid 

commencement of the project. 
10  It should be noted that the budgetary programme officer has already been appointed.

4.1.6.3  Audits: Annual audits of financial statements shall be conducted by an external audit firm based 

on terms of reference approved by the Bank. Audit reports shall be transmitted to the Bank at mo st six 

months after the end of the fiscal year under review. 

4.1.6.4 Disbursement arrangements: Grant resources shall be disbursed in accordance with the Bank's 

Disbursement Manual once the Protocol Agreement becomes effective and the conditions precedent to 

first disbursement have been met. The first disbursement is expected to take place at the latest within three 

months following the signature of the Protocol Agreement. The following disbursement methods will be 

applied for the disbursement of grant resources by the Bank: (i) the direct payment method; (ii) the special 

account method; and (iii) the repayment method. The direct payment method will be used for the payment 

of contracts for expenditure categories relating to construction, goods and services. The special account 

method will be used to finance operating expenses and the seed fund. Indeed, two special accounts will 

be opened to receive grant resources: the first one will be dedicated to financing the PMU's operating 

expenditure and the second will hold the seed fund.   

4.1.6.5 The procedures relating to the resources allocated to the FBDES shall, in principle, be recorded 

in a project procedures manual. 

4.2. Monitoring of Project Activities  

4.2.1 The monitoring and evaluation (M&E) mechanism will make it possible to determine the level 

of physical implementation (implementation rate for the whole project and for each component) and of 

financial implementation (commitment rate and disbursement rate for ADF and State counterpart 

resources). It will be provided with information coming mainly from control / supervision missions 

(physical execution) and progress reports. The monitoring of physical and financial achievements 

(commitments and disbursements), relative to projections, will ensure that the project implementation 

schedule is respected. The evaluation will be done through periodic monitoring/evaluation surveys. The 

project monitoring-evaluation officer will be responsible for harmonizing formats and consolidating all 

partner and project reports. 

4.2.2 A harmonized gender-sensitive monitoring/evaluation framework will be developed for 

operationalizing the logical framework indicators and defining the collection, reporting, processing and 

reporting circuit. Activities scheduled under the project are summed up in the table below. These activities 

will be implemented  following the project implementation schedule.

4.3. Governance  

4.3.1 Burkina Faso has made significant progress over the past two years. According to the 2017 

edition of the Mo Ibrahim Index of African Governance, Burkina Faso is above the average for the whole 

of Africa, with a score of 53.7/100 and a ranking of 23rd out of 54 countries assessed. Regarding rule of 

law and accountability, it ranks among the top 10 least-corrupt African countries in 2016, according to the 

Transparency International corruption perception index. The authorities have initiated legislative reforms 

to step up the fight against corruption, mainly through the adoption in March 2015, of the law on 

prevention and repression of corruption. In November 2015, the new authorities increased the powers of 

the Supreme State Control and Anti-Corruption Authority (ASCE-LC). Since then, ASCE-LC has 

conducted an annual audit of budget management, which is published. Specialized judicial units in charge 

of economic cases were created in 2017 to speed up the adjudication of cases on corruption and related 

offences. Civil society organizations (CSOs), including the National Anti-Corruption Network 

(RENLAC) are also heavily involved in combating corruption. They act as a counterweight to the 

Government by denouncing abuses and the mismanagement of public resources. 

4.3.2 With regard to favourable project implementation conditions, note should be taken of the 

country's performance in business creation (with a score of 88/100) and promulgation of the investment 

code to create an enabling environment for the promotion of entrepreneurship in the agriculture, forestry, 

livestock and wildlife sectors; the promotion of decent jobs; boosting of the competitiveness of national 

production on the domestic and foreign markets; and the modernization of production, conservation or 

processing techniques for products from the agriculture, forestry, livestock, fisheries and wildlife sectors. 

4.4 Sustainability  

4.4.1 To ensure project sustainability, the existing system will be strengthened by providing the 

necessary support to improve not only its governance but also its effectiveness. Indeed, the prominence 

given to youth employment and skills development in national strategies augurs well for a new vision of 

employment as an essential variable in achieving highly inclusive growth. The adoption of the NP/TEVT 

and its three-year action plan 2018-2020 confirms the Burkina Faso Government’s commitment to 

implement key reforms that promote youth employment.  

4.4.2 Furthermore, the recruitment of the youth employment expert within the PMU at the MJFIP will 

lead to capacity-building for the stakeholders involved in project implementation. Ultimately, the PMU 

will make it possible to internalize certain training and employment management functions within public 

services. These capacities will contribute to the efficient management of public resources allocated to 

employment and vocational training, which are expected to increase over the next five years, including 

the share of funding raised by the private sector.  

4.4.3 Finally, to ensure the sustainability of results, capacity-building activities will be organized for 

the benefit of the various key stakeholders. The project will ensure that beneficiaries develop the proper 

skills to carry on with activities after its completion. Sustainability will all the more be enhanced as the 

Government and TFPs have shown an interest in perpetuating the project's achievements (seed funds, 

business incubators in rural areas, etc.). 

4.5 Risk Management and Mitigation  

To ensure the success of the project, mitigating measures have been scheduled to address identified risks. 

The main risks presented in the table below are indicated in the results-based logical framework matrix.

Table of Risks and Mitigating Measures 

Potential risks Mitigating measures 

Insecurity linked to terrorism 

 

Strengthening of the security mechanism in the project area 

Shortage of medium or long-term 

resources to fund young entrepreneurs. 

In addition to the planned funding mechanism (seed funds), implement a 

partnership strategy with financial intermediaries to guide young 

entrepreneurs who have undergone the incubation process  

A regulatory environment that is not 

conducive to the development of 

agricultural entrepreneurship 

Implementation of the law on the investment code for the agricultural, 

forestry, livestock and fisheries sectors  

Quality of education and its consistency 

with market needs 

 

Implementation of apprenticeship-integration agreements between training 

centres and employers’ organizations 

 

4.6 Knowledge Building  

4.6.1 PADEJ-MR will contribute to knowledge development and the strengthening of institutional 

support for youth employment and entrepreneurship. The project will also lay particular emphasis on 

Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET). The various studies to be conducted and the 

strategic plans to be formulated in the area of youth employment and entrepreneurship will lead to the 

implementation of relevant measures for strengthening the national mechanism. Indeed, formulation of 

the strategic plan for developing a single fund to finance the projects of young people and women and the 

economic and financial feasibility study for the CFP-CI incubator will improve the effectiveness of public 

funds and operationalize the incubator of the Assessment and Vocational Training Centre in 

Ouagadougou. 

4.6.2 With respect to the TVET system, the PADEJ-MR plans to develop a strategic plan for the 

National Vocational Training Agency11 and to conduct studies on the establishment of incubators in VTCs 

and RPCs. These activities have a strategic impact on knowledge development and will ultimately improve 

the effectiveness of the TEVT mechanism in Burkina Faso. Furthermore, the project will have a direct 

impact on young people who will benefit from technical and vocational training under better conditions.
