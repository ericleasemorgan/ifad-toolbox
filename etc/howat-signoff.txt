Hi Paul and Eric, 

I wanted to provide one last update before signing off for a while to keep you both posted. 

I linked the current Write Up and results Graphs from Google Drive, as well as the supporting excel data attached. 

We are still waiting on 48 documents from IFAD for 2019-2021. Eric, Paul has reached out to IFAD for these last 48 documents, and once we get them I’ll send you a new folder of all the txt files and an updated metadata file- this should just have to be put through the reader once for the final output. 

After this is done, I’ll send another email to both of you with an edited write up and final graphs with the supporting data. Hopefully IFAD works fast!

Thanks to both of you, I think it’s been an interesting project and I’m looking forward to getting the final results. (Also- you can reach me at this email rather than my nd one from here on out!)

Best, 
Meghan
