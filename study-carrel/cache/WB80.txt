B. Introduction and Context

Country Context

1.  The Republic of Angola is still recovering from a turbulent past despite oil and mineral wealth. 
With approximately 25.8 million inhabitants,  it is the seventh most populated country in Africa. 
Angola is one of the largest oil exporters in the region, and is rich in diamonds and other mineral 
resources. Angola became independent from Portugal in 1975, but was then engulfed in a 27-year 
civil conflict, which ended with a peace accord in 2002. Despite the country➢❨ s upper-middle 
income status with GDP per capita of US$5,400 in 2014, poverty remains pervasive with 30.1 
percent of the population living below the international poverty line in 2008. 
 
2.     Propelled by the end of the civil conflict and the expansion of the oil sector, the Angolan 
economy posted an average growth rate of 12.5 percent between 2004 and 2008. This period of 
high growth was interrupted by the 2008-09 global financial crisis. Following a slowdown 
between 2009 and 2011, when GDP grew at 2.5 percent on average, fast growth resumed in 2012 
(7.6 percent). 
 
3.  Limited progress was made in improving social indicators during the oil boom years. Angola's 
remarkable growth has not been equally shared. Large parts of the population lack access to basic 
services. Life expectancy is 52.3 years and the country ranks 149th out of 188 in the Human 
Development Index. Income inequality is high and marked disparities in regional and urban/rural 
poverty persist. More than half of Angola➢❨ s poor are located in rural areas and depend almost 
exclusively on agriculture for their livelihood. Among the most vulnerable groups in the country 
are women-headed agriculture households, which represent 33 percent of agriculture households. 
 
4.  Angola is experiencing a major macroeconomic shock due to the dramatic oil price drop since 
2014. This is not surprising as oil represents about 30 percent of GDP, over 95 percent of export 
earnings, and 75 percent of government revenue. The country faces a scarcity of foreign exchange 
(FX), fiscal and external deficits, higher inflation and weakened economic activity. The impact on 
households are considerable. Lower government expenditures and a reduced public sector wage 
bill have resulted in reduced private consumption, compounded by the elimination of fuel 
subsidies. Because of the crisis, GDP growth is forecasted at just 0.9 percent in 2016, followed by 
a rebound of about 3 percent in 2017 . 
 
5. The government has implemented bold fiscal measures since mid-2015 to address the effects of 
the oil price drop, but challenges remain on the monetary front. A revised budget was adopted in 
March 2015 to reflect the major shortfall in revenue, with oil prices dropping from US$80 in the 
initial budget to US$40. The government cut capital expenditure by nearly half, and significantly 
reduced fuel subsidies. The Strategy to Exit the Crisis brought further fiscal consolidation 
measures such as the institution of a new tax on financial transactions and the cancellation of 
double payments to former combatants. The adjustment however has not progressed much on the 
monetary and external sector. Although interest rates have risen and the currency has devalued, 
inflation reached 29.2 percent in May and the spread between the official and parallel exchange 
rate has more than doubled. Imports have been contained and international reserves have been 
kept high due to strong administrative controls on access to foreign exchange (FX). As a result, 
companies are postponing investments and reducing production because they cannot import the 
inputs needed. 
 
6. Despite recent reforms, Angola➢❨ s investment climate remains challenging. The country 
underperforms in competitiveness, business environment, and governance rankings. For example, 
the World Economic Forum➢❨ s Global Competitiveness Report (GCR) 2014-2015 ranked 

Angola 140th out of 144 economies while the country ranks 181st out of 189 economies in the 
Doing Business 2016 report, suggesting a complex regulatory environment. Angola lags other 
Sub-Saharan Africa countries in the 2015 Worldwide Governance Indicators. Recent reforms 
include a reduction in the costs and requirements to start a business, a new Labor Code, and an 
overhaul of investment policy. Other efforts are underway to modernize tax and customs 
administration, and the justice sector. Well implemented, they could contribute to a more 
effective and transparent government interaction with the private sector. However, institutional 
weaknesses and governance issues defy reform implementation. Overall, Angola➢❨ s business 
environment is characterized by cumbersome regulations, constrained competition and 
considerable government presence in economic activity. Limited access to finance, poor 
infrastructure, weak workforce skills and corruption are the main constraints mentioned by firms. 
 
7. Diversifying the economy away from oil is an urgent priority and part of the Government➢❨ s 
response to the oil price crisis. Dependency on oil leaves Angola vulnerable to price and 
production shocks. For years, an overvalued exchange rate contributed to reduce the 
competitiveness of the non-oil sectors. The government crisis response strategy, presented in 
February 2016, aims at reducing the reliance on oil to generate revenues, substitute imports and 
promote non-traditional exports. Agricultural production plays a large role in the government➢❨  
strategy. Diversifying the economy will require economic transformation and eliminating 
obstacles to private investment, as well as efficient use of government resources to address 
infrastructure bottlenecks, and invest in human capital.
Sectoral and Institutional Context
8.  Angola➢❨ s agriculture potential remains largely untapped. The country has an abundance of 
land, water, and diversity of climatic and soil conditions for the production of a large variety of 
crops, but only 8 percent of its 58 million hectares of arable land is currently cultivated .  The 
agricultural sector in Angola currently represents around 5 percent of GDP, compared to 57.7 
percent for industry, including extractive, and 37.7 percent for services, and could contribute 
more to employment creation, especially for the youth. Nonetheless, agriculture is the main 
source of income for 90 percent of the 8.5 million Angolans living in rural areas (about 37 percent 
of the population). 
 
9.  Once a large exporter of coffee, cotton, sisal, sugar cane, bananas and tobacco, Angola➢❨ s 
agriculture sector suffered widespread destruction during the conflict and has not fully recovered 
since. Before the war the country was self-sufficient in all food crops except wheat. The exodus 
of Portuguese settlers after independence and the ensuing civil war that ravaged the country 
meant the loss of technical capacity and infrastructure destruction, cutting production areas from 
markets. Roads, bridges and other rural infrastructure were largely destroyed. Large-scale 
population displacement in rural areas and land mines➢❨ as many as 10 million➢❨ further 
constrained the sector recovery.  
 
10.  Production has been growing in recent years and the country has reached self-sufficiency in 
sweet potatoes and manioc, but Angola still relies on imports for most of its food consumption 
needs. For example, locally produced chicken supply only 40 percent of the local demand and 
production is limited by the lack of feed. In general, Angola has greater opportunities to compete 
with imports of perishable goods, including fruits, vegetables, and eggs, and local production of 
these goods has increased in recent years. Statistics on agriculture production are unreliable and 
outdated, but should improve with the planned agricultural census. According to MINAGRI 
2013/2014 production data, major crops based on volume include sweet potatoes, cassava, 

bananas, maize, pineapples, citrus fruits, beans, peanuts, and tomatoes. Agriculture exports 
represent less than 0.8 percent of total exports. Excluding fish, where little value is added in 
country, agriculture exports amount to just US$3.5 million. Coffee accounts for 43 percent, 
followed by non-alcoholic beverages (32 percent), beer (9 percent), fruit juice (5 percent) and 
medicinal plants (3 percent). The country is slowly opening new export markets including to 
neighboring DRC. It recently restarted exporting bananas to Portugal, 42 years later, with a 
shipment of 17 tons.  
 
11. Smallholders represent over 80 percent of agriculture production and 92 percent of land under 
cultivation. A small but growing formal distribution sector is establishing partnerships with local 
producers to ensure quality supply of primarily fresh produce. Still, most agriculture production is 
used for self-consumption or sold through informal channels. 
 
12. Macroeconomic conditions and the business climate constrain private investment in 
agriculture. An overvalued exchange rate in recent years and the current scarcity of foreign 
exchange affect the sector competitiveness and hamper private investment. The challenging 
business environment, including high cost of doing business, uncompetitive input markets, and 
insecurity of land tenure, as well as government crowding out the private sector, further reduce 
the sector➢❨ s attractiveness to private investors. However, based on discussions with private 
operators, investment opportunities exist in the production and processing for products such as 
horticulture, grains and beans, poultry and livestock, as well as aquaculture. While foreign 
exchange shortages are resulting in some of these investments being put on hold, they could 
materialize once macroeconomic conditions improve. New investment could bring much needed 
capital and know-how to the commercial agriculture sector. 
 
13. Access to finance is a serious hindrance to commercial agricultural development. 
Notwithstanding the high credit growth from 2004 to 2014 (going from 5 percent to 22 percent of 
GDP), the share of credit going to agriculture has remained very low at less than 5 percent of 
overall credit provided. Additionally, despite the general increase in access to finance over the 
five years between 2010 and 2014 (with an increase of two-thirds of branches, doubling of ATMs, 
and tripling of Points of Sale), there has been a clear urban/rural divide in access with Luanda 
accounting for the bulk of financial sector outreach. Specifically, Luanda, which has 27 percent of 
the population, accounted for 83 percent of credit, 94 percent of deposits and the majority of bank 
branches, ATMs and POS in 2015. Government programs such as the Angola Investe, offer 
subsidized credit, guarantees and a public risk capital fund, however most supported projects 
belong to non-agribusiness sectors and tend to be concentrated in Luanda. The Angola 
Development Bank also offers some lines of credit to the agriculture sector. Finally, the enabling 
environment for promoting agriculture finance (including agriculture insurance, warehouse 
receipts, equipment leasing, moveable collateral registry) is yet to be developed. 
 
14.  Infrastructure weaknesses hinder the creation of value addition through processing, and the 
integration of small producers into value chains. Market linkages are constrained by poor road 
and storage infrastructure. The total road network is about 76,000 km, many in need for 
rehabilitation, and the road density is 6 km /100 kmÂ², one of the lowest in Southern Africa. The 
rural access index is 42 percent, which is the fourth lowest in the world after South-Sudan, Chad 
and Mali (WDI). Although the government has heavily invested in improving the transport 
network over the last decade, including road and railways, limited budget is available for rural 
roads. Moreover, the limited reach of the electricity grid and the high cost of operating generators 

hamper the competitiveness of agribusiness, including agro-processing, irrigated agriculture, and 
livestock. The sector also suffers from lack of other adequate dedicated public services and 
infrastructure, such as phytosanitary and quality systems and commercial infrastructure. 
 
15.   Lack of technical knowledge and access to inputs further constrain commercial agriculture 
development. Poor agronomic practices, limited use of improved seeds, fertilizers, and irrigation 
technology, undermine productivity, growth and diversification. Most agricultural inputs, 
including fertilizers and machinery, are imported at high cost, and remain out of reach of small 
producers. These shortcomings are compounded by the very low technical capacity all along the 
value chain. 
 
16. Responsibility for agriculture policy and program development falls under the Ministry of 
Agriculture (MINAGRI). The Ministry is represented at the provincial level by the Provincial 
Directorates of Agriculture (DPA), and at the municipal level by the EstaÃ§Ã£o de 
Desenvolvimento AgrÃ¡rio (EDAs). MINAGRI➢❨ s capacity for program design and 
implementation has room for significant improvement. The World Bank Market Oriented 
Smallholder Agriculture Project (MOSAP), which closed in March 2016, and its follow up 
Smallholder Agriculture Development and Commercialization Project (SADCP), approved by the 
Board of Directors on July 5, 2016, include activities to strengthen MINAGRI➢❨ s capacity at the 
local, provincial and national levels. This project will build on and complement these efforts. 
 
17.   Other Government agencies are involved in the development of the agribusiness sector. 
These include the Ministry of Economy, which manages the Angola Investe program to provide 
subsidized credit to productive investments, the Angola Development Bank, the Ministry of 
Commerce and Industry, which is in charge of investment promotion (through APIEX) and  the 
agriculture commercialization program (PAPAGRO). Other relevant agencies include the 
Ministry of Construction (for road construction), Ministry of Transport, and Ministry of Energy 
and Water. The coordination among the various Government agencies in the implementation of 
complex multisectoral projects to support agribusiness development needs substantial 
strengthening. This is hindered by limited technical capacity and a centralized approach to 
decision-making. 
 
18.  In an effort to spur commercial agriculture, the government has invested in spatial approaches 
and infrastructure development. Government-sponsored projects range from integrated socio-
economic projects, following Israel➢❨ s Kibutz model (Aldeia Nova) to large-scale agro-
industrial poles such as the 400,000 ha Capanda development pole, as well as irrigated perimeters 
with plots for large, medium and small-scale producers. These projects are often financed by 
foreign lines of credit, and management is frequently contracted out to foreign firms, which bring 
the technology and know-how to run them. A state owned company, Gesterra, sponsors many of 
these projects. While some of these projects have achieved productivity close to international 
good practices , others are still not operational or have failed to attract private producers (e.g. 
Family Aviculture Project). Overall, the financial and economic viability of these projects on a 
purely commercial basis needs to be confirmed. Other government investments include 
distribution centers and cold storage, some of which remain underutilized. Support infrastructure 
is still insufficient and existing facilities need to be more effectively used. 
 
19.  Low and declining public spending in agriculture highlights the need for mobilizing private 
investment. The share of agriculture in the national budget declined from 1.10 percent in 2013 



(US$701.76 million) to 0.41 percent (US$543.9 million) in 2015. In the current constrained fiscal 
environment, there is a need to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of public expenditures to 
develop strategic infrastructure, strengthen institutional capacity and improve research and 
extension services, and support smallholders. More efforts are needed to attract private 
investment and promote public-private partnerships under transparent criteria. The Commercial 
Agriculture Development project will contribute to these goals. 
 
20.  Weak public sector governance and poor capacity have considerably limited agriculture 
development efforts in the past. These issues affect resource allocation across a range of key areas 
in the agriculture sector, from access to land to financing of irrigation, agricultural infrastructure, 
and inputs. For example, one bottleneck for investment in agriculture is secured land access: land 
allocation procedures and coexistence of several legal systems for recognition and governance of 
land rights in Angola (state law and traditional rights) weaken legal certainty and hinder the 
sector➢❨ s development. To attract transformative private investments in the agriculture sector, 
particular attention will need to be paid to: (i) legal and regulatory measures; (ii) institutional 
mechanisms and delivery platforms; and (iii) transparency and social accountability. Besides 
involving several agencies/departments within the Ministry of Agriculture, the Project will need 
to work closely with, and reinforce the capacities of, several public institutions that have critical 
influence on agricultural investment generation.
Relationship to CAS/CPS/CPF
21. Supporting integrated national economic diversification is one of the pillars in the Country 
Partnership Strategy (CPS) FY14-16. Development of the agriculture sector, through productivity 
increases and market linkages, is seen as an important source of growth, employment creation and 
poverty reduction. Making progress toward the twin goals is found to be feasible building on the 
adoption of pro-poor growth strategies and policies. The draft Performance and Learning Review 
(PLR) envisions an extension of the CPS until FY18 and a reformulation of the objectives to 
respond to the macroeconomic challenges emerging from the oil price drop. The draft PLR 
maintains economic diversification as one of the key objectives of the CPS. A specific outcome 
related to enhancing productivity and competitiveness in the agriculture sector has been proposed, 
which is directly related to the activities of this project. 
 
22.  This Project will also build synergies with other World Bank Group projects, such as the 
Smallholder Agriculture Development and Commercialization Project (SACDP, P154447) and 
Angola Statistics Project (P157671). Close coordination between the IFC and the Bank (IBRD) 
will play an important role to mobilize investment, sector financing and PPPs, where each 
institution will contribute on the basis of its respective mandates. 
 
23.  Economic diversification and the development of commercial agriculture are critical 
priorities for the government, as outlined in the National Development Plan (NDP) 2013-2017. 
The National Development Plan seeks to promote an enlargement of the productive base to 
increase employment, leveraging the country➢❨ s natural and human resources. It underscores the 
role of the private sector as the engine of economic growth, with the public sector playing a 
leveraging role. For the agriculture sector, the NDP objective is to achieve sustainable 
development building on the country➢❨ s natural resources and competitive advantage to ensure 
food security and self-sufficiency, as well as maximizing regional and international market 
opportunities. Developing a competitive agriculture sector, with increased private investment and 
market linkages for smallholders is an objective that will be supported by the activities of this 
project. The project also contributes to the objectives of Angola➢❨ s Medium Term Agriculture 



Development Plan 2013-2017, which seeks to foster agricultural and rural transformation, based 
on the development of smallholder agriculture, cooperatives and public-private partnerships, as 
well as contribute to the country➢❨ s industrialization.

C.  Proposed Development Objective(s)

Proposed Development Objective(s) (From PCN)
24.  The proposed project development objective (PDO) is to promote commercial agriculture 
development, increasing production and employment within selected value chains, in targeted 
areas in Angola.

Key Results (From PCN)
25.  The project strategy to achieve the PDO is to support the transformation of Angola➢❨ s 
agriculture towards a greater role for the private sector, building on existing programs, and 
focusing on value chains with the largest growth and employment creation potential. More private 
investment in agriculture is needed to increase production, productivity and commercialization, 
and to help create employment opportunities for the Angolan poor. This will be achieved by 
identifying and helping prepare Private-Public Partnerships (PPPs) ➢❨  private investment 
opportunities in selected value chains, and providing support to Small and Medium Enterprises 
(SMEs), including cooperatives, and producer organizations, in those value chains to increase 
their production, productivity and linkages with larger firms. In order to create the conditions for 
private investment the project will support investments in supporting infrastructure, as well as 
improvements in the regulatory environment and government capacity to play a catalytic role for 
the commercial agriculture sector development. 
 
26.  Success in achieving the PDO will be measured by the following PDO-level indicators: (i) 
increased investment in dollar terms; (ii) support infrastructure constructed or rehabilitated by the 
project; and (iii) jobs created in the beneficiary firms. 
 
27.  External factors may affect the realization of the PDO: (i) evolution of international markets 
(e.g., commodities prices, growth, and external financing), (ii) security and/or disease outbreak in 
Angola, and (iii) global warming, that may worsen droughts and lead to severe floods.

D.  Concept Description

28.  The overall approach is to foster commercial agriculture  through a set of integrated 
investments in hard and soft infrastructure, and developing an enabling environment for private 
participation in the sector. By simultaneously intervening along multiple dimensions, the project 
aims to remove key constraints to business formation and strengthen the platform for growth in 
high-potential value chains. World Bank support is required first to identify and prioritize these 
investments; and to develop the capacity to procure them and manage their execution. The project 
will also seek to mobilize private funds for the sector through PPPs and targeted investment 
promotion. At the same time, the project will support activities to create more conducive 
conditions for the future development of commercial agriculture, including regulatory reforms, 
and strengthening of research capacity. Strong coordination among the government agencies 
involved (agriculture, transport, energy, commerce, etc.) and building a constituency for the 
project among public, private and non-governmental stakeholders will be necessary, as suggested 
by previous experience in supporting integrated interventions along agriculture value chains. 
 

29.  Initially, two value chains will be supported and this would be scaled up during the life of the 
project to a maximum of five. Criteria for selecting value chains will be based on the 
competitiveness of specific value chain segments, potential impact (on jobs, food production, 
export diversification, and opportunities for upgrading), and readiness (existing production, 
necessary investments, and sector organization). Identifying competitive value chains in Angola 
will require a more in-depth analysis of demand, current cost structure and existing constraints. 
Two initial value chains will be selected during preparation, in consultation with the Government 
and private sector stakeholders. Existing studies of priority value chains for the Government, 
including horticulture, livestock, chicken and dairy, and by extension maize and soy, provide 
limited analysis on existing cost structures to assess their competitiveness. Preliminary work on 
the poultry sector inspired by the value chain segmentation methodology identified opportunities 
for competitive production of fresh chicken to supply the local market, provided reliable supply of 
local feed can be secured (see Annex 3). The Government has requested initial focus on poultry 
and by extension maize/soy as a priority due to growing demand, recent growth and the large 
share of chicken in the country➢❨ s imports. Support to export-oriented value chains, such as 
coffee, another government priority, also requires careful consideration of the competitiveness of 
Angola vis-➃❫ -vis other countries. Analytical work supported by the project will inform public-
private dialogue to agree on priority subsectors and constraints. The experience and capacity 
developed by the project will enable supporting other value chains in the future. 
 
30. The project will be geographically concentrated in the areas (to be defined during 
preparation), with the highest agricultural potential to meet domestic consumption (as would be 
the case for example in the poultry/maize/soy value chain) and export (e.g. coffee value chain). 
Other factors to select geographic areas include having a critical mass of potential commercially 
oriented producers, and access to downstream value chain activities and markets through 
proximity to agrologistical networks and platforms. 
 
31.  Moreover, the proposed project will ensure that: (1) equal opportunities and support will be 
provided to women➢❨ s and youth groups to participate in several aspects of the project; (2) 
training in gender awareness will be provided using appropriate media, language and gender-
sensitive approaches and methods; and (3) a gender informed M&E system will be implemented, 
will collect and present gender-disaggregated data on project beneficiaries. 
 
32. Given the institutional weaknesses, governance, and other risks, a flexible and modular design 
is called for. The project must remain flexible to potential delays in specific components, 
changing implementation realities, and to the response of private sector supply and demand. It 
should allow subcomponents to be removed or amended without compromising the overall 
project framework and the causal chain of activities.  Starting with a focus on existing investment 
opportunities and just two value chains will help test the approach while striving to deliver results 
early on in the project. In parallel, efforts to build client project implementation capacity and to 
improve the enabling environment will start.  Once key conditions   are established, such as: (i) 
progress in business environment reforms, PPD, analytical and implementation capacity (ii) 
selected area and pilot value chains under implementation, in compliance with all activities 
planned for the first two years of the project life, work on other value chain will be undertaken (to 
be defined during preparation). Therefore, the proposed time for the project implementation is 6 
years. 
 
33.  With an amount of $230 million,  the project will support commercial agriculture 


development through three interrelated components: (1) Agribusiness development by means of 
mobilizing investment, including PPPs, providing financial and non-financial support to value 
chain actors and developing support infrastructure (rural roads, storage, irrigation, and energy); 
(2) Support to create an enabling environment for commercial agriculture; and (3) Project 
management, coordination, and public-private dialogue. 
 
34.  Component 1 ➢❨  Agribusiness Development (US$ 190 million). This Component will 
address the following challenges: (i) underinvestment by SMEs in inputs, technology and skills 
development due to access to credit constraints and information failures; (ii) insufficient linkages 
among value chain actors due to coordination and information failures and (iii) underprovision of 
infrastructure oriented to underpin market-oriented agriculture. This component aims to mobilize 
investments in agribusiness and support improvements in productivity, quality assurance and 
market linkages through the following subcomponents: 
 
35. Subcomponent 1.1 Technical and financial support to SMEs development.  This 
subcomponent will have a value chain focus and will aim to (i) support SME development, 
including market-ready producer groups and cooperatives, and help them overcome constraints in 
access to credit and managerial/technical knowledge; and (ii) support links and partnerships 
between large, medium and small-scale producers and purchasers through business alliances. As a 
result of project investments, enhanced capabilities and links to larger firms, it is expected that 
SMEs will be able to grow their business, improve productivity and quality, strengthen market 
connections, and create jobs. An important aspect during preparation will be to assess the actual 
size of the SME sector in the pilot value chains and adapt the intervention design to uptake, 
capacity, and sustainability considerations. 
 
(a) This subcomponent will provide support through a competitive  matching grant facility: 
 
1. Provision of technical assistance for pre-investments. This window will provide financial 
resources for the development of innovative business and linkages between small producers and 
other actors along the value chain. 
 
The competitive grant will provide ➢❨ startup➢❨  capital for promoting the introduction of new 
sustainable practices and technologies, and processes that improve the competitiveness of 
agricultural production by SMEs. The grant will consider three main levels of support to be 
further defined during preparation. These could include: (i) extension and technology 
development; (ii) studies for business alliances, including the formulation of business plans and 
associated productive subprojects and pilots➢❨  investments; and (iii) capacity building for 
entrepreneurs, individually or as member of a formal group (e.g. associations, cooperatives, 
farmer organizations).  
 
2. Establish a Matching Grant facility for Value Chain Development.  . This window will 
finance investments based on the business plans directly linked to the selected value chains and 
will have a geographical focus.  
 
SMEs investments will be identified through a competitive process based on a review of feasible 
business plans and selected proposals identifying SMEs financial contribution through a matching 
grant (at least 60% of total investment, to be confirmed during preparation), and presenting social 
environmental and economic sustainability analysis.  


The grant will combine innovation with a focus on partnerships with the market and will consider 
to implement investments designed based on business plans agreed with their business partners. 
The objective of each proposal would be to reach the product specifications (quantity, quality, 
delivery, etc.) agreed and established in the business plan. Eligible activities that would be 
financed could include expenditures at the level of both individual producers and their 
organizations (e.g. cooperatives), such as: (i) minor on-farm infrastructure and working capital, 
(ii) technical assistance services, (iii) agriculture inputs, equipment, production facilities 
(nurseries, greenhouses), (iv) value addition investments (post-harvest processing and storage, 
packaging), soil and water conservation measures and (v) other minor infrastructure, e.g. off-farm 
infrastructure for storage specific to the needs of the business alliance. If needed, the project will 
provide additional training to improve their governance, organizational, managerial, business and 
risk-management skills and to facilitate adoption of good agricultural and environmental 
practices.  
 
Eligible applicants would include: (i) organized producer organizations associations and related 
farmers organizations with developed or developing linkages to agricultural value chains, and 
supporting the development of smallholder farmers; (ii) agribusinesses linked with smallholders, 
involved in processing, trading, and marketing of agricultural and food products/commodities 
which help to improve the growth and competitiveness of smallholder farmers either directly to 
farmers at the production stage, or further down the value chain as part of the processing chain of 
agricultural commodities; (iii) input suppliers; (iv) nucleus commercial farms working with 
smallholders; and (v) publicly and privately funded agricultural and industrial institutions and 
trusts.   
 
In addition, for mobilizing business alliance investments, the project will carry out a differentiated 
communication and dissemination campaigns to: (i) inform potential stakeholders about the scope 
and rules of the Project; (ii) the publication and dissemination of Project activities including, inter 
alia, information on demand, approvals, procurement and results; and (iii) promote investments 
and contract farming/buying contracts in agricultural sector value chains.  
 
 (b) This subcomponent will also provide support to mobilize and select larger private investors. 
 
1. Selected interventions will need to demonstrate (i) alignment with the value chain development 
and (ii) potential impact on job creation. The stakeholders jointly with the PIU will develop 
proposals to request select interventions that are not firm-specific but that benefit their segment of 
the value chain and the value chain as a whole (i.e. common goods). 
 
2. Following the Client➢❨ s and the Chamber of Commerce➢❨ s advice, the investors will need 
to be strongly involved in crafting these proposals for interventions to ensure their commitment 
aspect and consistency with the constraints faced by groups of firms in the VC. The project will 
support the creation of a national committee composed of public and private sector stakeholders 
that will be in charge of reviewing the requests for funds to finance catalytic activities, ensuring 
that they conform with the strict eligibility criteria that will be imposed (e.g. demonstrate direct 
contribution to the VC➢❨ s development and job creation) and selecting the best proposals that 
receive project support. 
 
36.  Subcomponent 1.3. Establish a Partial Credit Guarantee (PCG) fund to promote access to 


credit for the project target groups. The fund is expected to lower the risk exposure of financial 
institutions through a PCG arrangement and thus increase the incentives for financing agricultural 
activities. The fund would target the agribusiness SMEs in the selected value chains for their 
financing needs whether these are for fixed assets or for working capital. It would therefore 
support matching grants beneficiaries to provide the contribution required to benefit from the 
matching grants. It is anticipated that the project PCG fund will utilize the existing structure 
established by the Angola Investe Program. However, a dedicated Fund for commercial 
agriculture will be created and will be governed in accordance with applicable Bank Group➢❨ s 
policies and the recently issued Principles for Public Credit Guarantee Schemes for MSME, with 
IFC support. For participating banks wishing to benefit from the guarantee coverage, a 
prequalification process will be undertaken.  
 
Financial institution eligibility criteria will be transparent and open to all institutions that have an 
interest to lend to the beneficiaries of the Project.  The PCG will cover 50 percent of the risk pari-
pasu for loans to and it will be priced to cover the administration costs and risks it covers. 
However, the PCG fees would be priced, so that the facility would remain sustainable after the 
project conclusion and would continue to serve this market segment following project conclusion. 
 
37. Eligibility criteria and selection processes for investment support may vary according to the 
type of support required, and will be detailed during the preparation phase and described in the 
Project Appraisal Document (PAD). 
 
38. Subcomponent 1.3. Develop critical infrastructure. This subcomponent aims to (i) address 
existing gaps in infrastructure (rural roads, post-harvest facilities, irrigation, and energy); (ii) 
strengthening the capacity of public agencies to formulate, prepare and promote medium and 
long-term public-private partnerships in the sector. Special focus will be given to the promotion 
of climate smart agriculture approaches and renewable energy technologies. 
 
39. This subcomponent will support infrastructure investments in selected value chains and 
geographic areas of focus. It will leverage existing transport, logistics, energy, and irrigation 
infrastructures to support improvements in agriculture production and productivity, reduce post-
harvest losses, and connect production areas with markets: 
 
- Construction and rehabilitation of feeder roads. Once geographic areas of focus have been 
identified during preparation, a mapping will be conducted of existing road links and current gaps 
between production areas and the main national road networks (for example, the Luanda-Malanje 
corridor for the poultry/maize/soy value chain). Maximum length of rural roads supported by the 
project will be no more than 50 km to the main road (to be confirmed during preparation). The 
project will build on the existing Strategic Plan for the Rehabilitation of Tertiary Roads and the 
National Integrated Plan for Accessibility, Mobility and Transport (PENAMT) by the Ministry of 
Transport. 
 
- Post-harvest facilities: support to landing docks infrastructure and rehabilitation/construction of 
storage facilities to facilitate collection of production. 
- Irrigation infrastructure: support to irrigation infrastructure including water storage facilities and 
main canals will be agreed during preparation. Private investors will finance the construction of 
secondary canals to their farms. 
 
- Energy investments will be further explored during preparation phase, depending on 
confirmation of targeted value chains and the degree of electrification of the selected geographic 
areas of focus. Other sources of clean energy will also be explored. 
 
40.  This subcomponent will also support the identification and assessment of existing 
government storage and agro-industrial infrastructure amenable to private sector participation, as 
well as other rural infrastructure and agribusiness services that could advantageously be 
developed and implemented by private entities as PPP or as purely private investment. Whenever 
the local conditions so require, opportunities for the use of PPPs for the integrated development 
and management of rural facilities and services should be identified, particularly when those 
facilities and services are apt to be co-funded by commercial and individual users. Following that 
initial assessment, the project will support pre-feasibility studies for the 3-4 most promising 
opportunities to enable the government to decide whether to move ahead with a PPP. This 
subcomponent can also provide support to strengthen the legal framework for PPPs in Angola and 
support capacity building efforts in this area. This would be done not as an isolated effort, but in 
order to guarantee an adequate environment for private investment, and conditions for effective 
definition of incentives for private investors to implement the government➢❨ s agricultural 
policy. 
 
41.  Component 2 ➢❨  Support to develop an enabling environment for commercial agriculture 
(US$ 25 million). This component will focus on addressing challenges related to (i) existing gaps 
in the Government strategy for commercial agriculture development and analytical capacity; (ii) 
limited government investment generation capacity (iii) constraints in the agriculture input 
markets; (iv) high costs and uncertainty of doing business, related to burdensome regulations and 
procedures; and (iv) weaknesses in the agriculture research and development capacity. The 
component will focus on strengthening the building blocks for creating a competitive commercial 
agriculture sector, including strategy and regulatory reforms, as well as support to enhance 
research and development (R&D) for the sector. 
 
42.  Subcomponent 2.1 Support sector strategy development and enhance client analytical 
capacity. This subcomponent will contribute to strengthen institutional capacity at MINAGRI to 
develop strategies for competitive and sustainable agriculture value chain development based on 
analysis of local, regional and global demand and existing competitive advantage. By doing so, it 
will complement envisioned support by SADCP to strengthen the capacity of local, provincial, 
and national units of the Ministry of Agriculture to provide services to smallholders in the areas 
of irrigation, extension, market information, statistics and policy analysis. Specific areas of 
support will be defined during preparation, but may include: (i) capacity building for evidence-
based economic research, value chain segmentation analysis, and M&E; and (ii) technical 
assistance to develop Climate Smart Agriculture Country Profile .  It could be an important 
mechanism to build awareness of country options, facilitate dialogue, and help prioritize 
investments to deliver on the ➢❨ triple win➢❨ , implementing agriculture and food production 
practices that not only boost productivity but also enhance resilience and lower greenhouse gas 
emissions, the three pillars that form the basis of climate smart agriculture. 
 
In order to support the thinking on Government strategy, the project preparation advance will 
fund the organization of a practitioners➢❨  forum on international experiences, including 
successes and failures, in developing commercial agriculture with a special focus on value chain 
approaches and agroindustrial poles. 


43.  As part of this component, the project will also support the establishment of a team of 
analysts at MINAGRI with strong skills in economic and market analysis. They will be in charge 
of reviewing and validating the outputs of consultants hired previously by the Government, and in 
assessing the experience of failed prior agribusiness initiatives. They will receive training on 
value chain segmentation methodology and will conduct additional analysis as needed to identify 
the most promising value chain segments for Angola and the existing binding constraints for their 
development. This analysis will inform the discussions in the public-private dialogue platform 
(Component 3). The team will formulate proposals for addressing such constraints in 
collaboration with the relevant government agencies. This activity will be developed in 
coordination with other Government efforts to develop skills to support economic diversification 
strategies. 
 
44.  Subcomponent 2.2 Promote investment opportunities. This subcomponent will work with the 
recently established Agency for Investment and Export Promotion (APIEX) and MINAGRI➢❨ s 
Technical Unit for Investment Promotion to strengthen investment promotion, facilitation and 
aftercare in agribusiness. In particular, the project will support the compilation of a pipeline of 
investment leads and build capacity for assisting investors during the process of establishing their 
operations. Additionally, the project will assess current investor aftercare functions and provide 
training and other capacity building activities to ensure client➢❨ s effective support to existing 
investors, with the goal to encourage reinvestment. Technical assistance will be provided to 
prepare information packages and implement targeted investor outreach efforts in the priority 
value chains. Finally, the project will include additional support to the implementation of the 
revamped Investment policy and legal framework, including an assessment of existing incentives. 
 
45. Subcomponent 2.3 Improving the regulatory environment. This component will support key 
regulatory and administrative reforms to remove barriers to private sector activity in agribusiness. 
Strong emphasis will be given to ensure capacity for implementation of amended regulations is in 
place and adequate monitoring systems are developed. In these, the project will focus on those 
areas (i) have been identified as key constraints by analysis and private sector actors in the 
priority value chains, and (ii) where there is clear government commitment. This subcomponent 
will be closely coordinated with efforts to support regulatory improvements in the business 
environment under the DPL series and other World Bank Advisory work, including support in the 
areas measured by the Doing Business report. Areas for support will be confirmed based on the 
value chains selected. The following four areas have been identified as problematic in initial 
consultations with agribusiness private sector actors: 
 
- Policy and competition barriers in agricultural inputs: limited supply and high costs of improved 
seeds, fertilizers, and equipment is a critical constraint to increased productivity and production. 
The project will support studies to assess existing constraints affecting input availability including 
sector policies, tariffs, entry barriers and market competition. Recommendations emanating from 
these studies will inform public-private dialogue and the development of actions to address 
existing constraints. The project will provide technical assistance for implementation of these 
actions. 
 
- Trade facilitation and identification, classification and removal of Non-Tariff Barriers (NTBs): 
Given Angola➢❨ s dependency on imports for food and agriculture inputs and the country➢❨ s 
objective to develop exports as a way to diversify export revenues away from oil, an efficient 



trade environment is essential. Building on ongoing reform efforts, the project will identify 
activities that will further simplify trade logistics systems and services, focusing on reducing the 
time and cost associated with international trade, through coordinated agency efforts. In addition, 
NTBs in Angola severely hamper the import of key products and inputs. There is a strong need to 
streamline NTBs, especially those related to agriculture. This exercise would include building 
capacity for streamlining non-tariff measures (NTMs) and identifying and removing non-tariff 
barriers, effective simplification of import-export procedures, and strengthening risk-management 
approaches for SPS (Sanitary and Phytosanitary) and TBT (Technical Barriers to Trade) 
measures. 
 
- Land administration: This subcomponent will support targeted interventions to strengthen land 
management and administration. Land in Angola is owned by the Government and the 2004 Land 
Law (Lei de Terras de Angola, Lei 09/04) defines the mechanisms for the Government to grant 
transferable land use rights for rural and urban land. The law recognizes customary uses, and the 
Government can grant surface rights to individuals and entities. Land is a delicate issue in 
Angola. It is estimated that 85-90% of the land is not registered due to weaknesses in land 
administration institutions, among other factors. Given the magnitude of this challenge, the 
project will focus on local level interventions based on needs identified in the priority value 
chains and focus on transparent and fair procedures for land acquisition and regularization, 
protecting communities➢❨  rights to land use and natural resources. The project will build on the 
experience of the FAO implemented Land Project and will follow the ➢❨ principles for 
responsible agriculture investments➢❨ . 
 
- Regulatory reforms to promote agriculture finance: In addition to the catalytic interventions to 
promote access to credit, the project would support reform efforts to improve the enabling 
environment for agriculture finance. Activities will be defined during preparation, but may 
include diagnosis and support to reforms to enable agricultural equipment leasing, establish a 
moveable asset registry, warehouse receipts and commodities exchange development, and 
agriculture insurance (including weather base d index insurance). 
 
46.  Component 3 ➢❨  Project Management, Coordination and Public-Private Dialogue (PPD) 
(US$ 15 million). This component will support the costs of establishing and funding the Project 
Implementation Unit (PIU), which will be comprised of a technical team, supplemented by 
external consultants, to manage the following activities: Project Manager, Financial Management, 
Procurement, Social and Environmental Safeguards, Monitoring & Evaluation, Technology & 
Information, among others. Lessons learnt from Bank operations in several weak and fragile 
environments suggest that both Borrower and Bank teams typically tend to underestimate project 
implementation costs, and run into associated difficulties. The team will re-visit the estimated 
costs of implementation during project preparation. In addition, this component will address 
existing weaknesses in implementation capacity, coordination, and public-private dialogue for 
development of commercial agriculture by (i) providing capacity building and technical assistance 
to the inter-agency working group to be created by MINAGRI to coordinate project activities, and 
(ii) creating and implementing a PPD platform. 
 
47. Subcomponent 3.1 Project Implementation Unit and coordination support. This component 
will fund the activities of the Project Implementation Unit (PIU). Strong emphasis on capacity 
building based on the experience from MOSAP will be included in this component. The MOSAP 
PIU, which will remain in place for SADCP, will be used during project preparation, but the 


client has requested creating a separate PIU for this project. This component will also provide 
technical assistance and training to the inter-agency working group to be established by 
MINAGRI to coordinate project implementation. Support may include successful experiences 
from other countries in planning, development of action plans, and implementation monitoring, 
among others. 
 
48. Subcomponent 3.2. Establishing Public-Private Dialogue. The project will support increased 
public-private dialogue specific to the agribusiness sector. An assessment will be conducted on 
existing public-private dialogue mechanisms in Angola. Recommendations for establishing an 
inclusive public-private dialogue platform, including institutional arrangements, will be 
developed, followed by technical assistance for implementation. The objective of the dialogue 
will be to ensure private sector inputs to sector policies and programs, including the identification 
of priority value chains, identify specific constraints and remedy actions to increase private 
investment, and assess implementation progress, as well as avenues to improve the effectiveness 
of public investments. In addition to government and private sector, efforts will be undertaken to 
ensure the maximum representativeness of the PPD including farmer organizations, as well as 
other stakeholders as relevant, such as academia or civil society. Special attention will be given to 
ensure the voice of women is well represented and the specific constraints for women in 
agribusiness are discussed in the PPD.

II. SAFEGUARDS
A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis (if known)
49.  The project is expected to be at national scale however, specific geographic details of the exact 
project footprint and its impacts will be determined during project preparation and will be reflected 
in the safeguards documents (ESMF, ESIA, MP, RPF, and RAP, PMP, etc.).

B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
50.  At the framework level, there are no relevant gaps between the Angolan environmental 
legislation and the World Bank➢❨ s Safeguard policy and guidelines. The environmental legislation 
in Angola is quite recent and inspired by the international Conventions that Angola takes part. In 
regard to the environmental impact assessment, the existing Angolan regulatory framework covers 
the most relevant principles and best practices, including public consultation and participation, 
monitoring and licensing procedures. 
 
51.  The Ministry of Agriculture (MINAGRI) through the Institute for Agriculture Development 
(IDA) will be the lead implementing agency. IDA will have the responsibility of coordinating 
implementation by hosting a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) with sub PIUs at Province level, 
tasked with the responsibility of project coordination and management using Technical Assistance 
(TA) when needed. MINAGRI has acquired reasonable experience in handling World Bank projects 
that require Safeguards attention, such as MOSAP. Hence, Commercial Agriculture Development 
Project will build up from the experience in safeguards management acquired by IDA-MINAGRI 
during MOSAP implementation. Nonetheless, substantial capacity building and training will be 
required to deal with this project Safeguards requirements, particularly in ensuring adequate 
subproject screening and subsequent preparation of ESIA/ESMP and RAP as necessary.

D. POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional)
Environmental Assessment 
OP/BP 4.01

Yes The construction of rural roads, electricity and water 
infrastructure for irrigation , including a series of 
land administration reforms, under component 2.3, 
may have adverse impacts on soil, water, air quality, 
flora and fauna. Some of the adverse impacts may 
include land right conflicts, soil erosion and water 
logging, alteration of water flows due to irrigation 
schemes, vegetation loss and fauna disturbance for 
access road and power transmission construction, 
risks to the human health by those handling 
pesticides. Consequently the OB/BP4.01 is triggered 
to comply with the Environmental Assessment 
safeguard requirements. Specific geographic details 
of the exact project footprint and its impacts are not 
yet know and will be determined during project 
preparation.  Hence, the recipient will prepare an 
Environmental and Social Management Framework 
(ESMF) to help mitigate the potential environmental 
and social impacts by the direct and indirect 
investments in the project selected areas and to guide 
the preparation of ESIA and ESMP. The ESMF will 
be consulted and disclosed both in-country and at the 
Infoshop prior to appraisal.

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 Yes The project is not expected to invest in activities that 
may have direct impacts on natural habitats. 
However, rural roads improvements and water 
infrastructure may happen in proximity to national 
parks or protected areas and therefore lead to 
downstream impacts that may affect ecosystem 
services and functions provided by natural habitats. 
Hence, OP/BP 4.04 is triggered and the ESMF will 
include the specific provisions to prevent or mitigate 
impacts on natural habitats.

Forests OP/BP 4.36 Yes The Project will not have any direct or indirect 
negative impacts on health and quality of forests, or 
the health and safety of people who depends on 
forests. However, clearance of vegetation for rural 
roads improvements and water infrastructures may 
require compensatory reforestation and tree 
maintenance along the rehabilitated roads. OP/BP 
4.36 is triggered and the ESMF will include specific 
provisions to address the requirements.


Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes Promotion of agriculture activities may include the 
use of small quantities of pesticides, though expected 
only at a small scale, to treat orchards and crops 
against pest and infestations to enhance agriculture 
productivity of project beneficiaries. Hence, OP/
BP4.09 is triggered and a Pest Management Plan will 
be prepared to help mitigate potential risks to human 
health and to the environment using the integrated 
pest management approaches.

Physical Cultural Resources 
OP/BP 4.11

Yes The policy is triggered as project investments 
involve infrastructures (roads, irrigation, electricity) 
that may require large movements of earth in areas 
likely to contain sites deemed physical cultural 
resources by communities living there (e.g. holy sites 
sacred graves, sacred forests, etc.). To ensure due 
diligence, the ESMF will include a Chance Find 
procedures that will be detailed in the ESIA/ESMP 
then reflected in the constructor contracts.

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 
4.10

TBD

Involuntary Resettlement OP/
BP 4.12

Yes The project will finance activities associated with 
construction/ rehabilitation of small scale irrigation 
infrastructures, rural roads, electricity transmission 
lines that could necessitate involuntary land 
acquisition resulting in physical of people and/or loss 
of assets, means of livelihoods or resources. The 
Borrower will prepare a Resettlement Policy 
Framework (RPF) to adequately deal with issues of 
land acquisition resulting with compensation and/or 
the physical displacement of peoples. The RPF will 
be consulted and disclosed both in-country and by 
the Bank prior to appraisal. The RPF will include 
detailed guidance for the preparation of site specific 
Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) prior or during 
project implementation.

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 No

Projects on International 
Waterways OP/BP 7.50

TBD The proposed project is not expected to engage in 
large scale irrigation activities or other activities that 
would adversely affect the quality or quantity of 
water flow within shared waterways. 
Notwithstanding, triggering this policy will be 
determined once specific details of the project are 
known.

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/ No This policy is not triggered. The area in which the 
Project will be implemented is not known to include 


BP 7.60 any disputed areas, at this stage.
