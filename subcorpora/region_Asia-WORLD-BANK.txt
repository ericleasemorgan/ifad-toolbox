Appraisal Review Decision 
(from Decision Note)

I. Project Context
Country Context
With GNI per capita of US$1,269 (2014), the Kyrgyz Republic is one of the low income economies 
of the Europe and Central Asia Region. In 2014, approximately 30.6% of the population lived 
below the poverty line, with the incidence of poverty slightly higher in rural area than in urban 
areas (32.6% vs. 26.9%). Economic growth in the country has been quite volatile. GDP growth was 
6% in 2011 but contracted to 0.9% in 2012, owing to a sharp drop in gold output. In 2013, the 
economy grew at a whopping 10.9%, but slowed to 3.6% in 2014 and remained at 3.5% at the end 
of 2015. The narrow export base is dominated by gold, with agricultural products representing on 
average 16% of total exports from 2009 to 2013. The economy is highly vulnerable to external 
shocks, in particular many households depend on remittances from the energy-based economies of 
Russia and Kazakhstan. It is partially dependent on wheat imports from Kazakhstan and the past 
global food price shocks quickly transmitted to the country. The official unemployment rate in the 
country has hovered below 10% for the past decade, however mostly on account of significant 
outmigration of labor force (predominantly men, a majority from rural areas) to Russia and 
Kazakhstan. The recent economic difficulties of Russia and the strong devaluation of the ruble have 
negatively affected the earnings of the migrants and their remittances to their families in 
Kyrgyzstan.

  

Sectoral and institutional Context
Agriculture is an important sector for the Kyrgyz Republic’s economy and livestock production is a 
major livelihood support system for rural people. Agriculture represents about 15% of GDP, and it 
is still a major employer, providing more than a third of jobs. The sector’s growth rate in 2015 was 
a relatively high 6.2%. Agriculture is a key priority for the government because of its contribution 
to poverty reduction and rural employment. Livestock production, which accounts for about 50% of 
the agricultural GDP, is dominated by household and small farm production. It is important for 
rural household food security, nutrition, regular income generation, and acts as a social safety net 
with animals sold in times of hardship and economic distress. The primary land use of the country 
is native pasture production (87% of the total land is under pastures), which provides an advantage 
for livestock-based livelihood and food security for the rural population.  
 
With the accession of the Kyrgyz Republic to the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), the country’s 
agriculture sector is facing new challenges, and also new opportunities. The Kyrgyz Republic 
became a full member of the EAEU in May 2015. The EAEU includes Russia and Kazakhstan, 
which are the Kyrgyz Republic’s main export markets. However, since 2012, a partial dairy export 
ban has been in force, limiting the number of dairy exporters to seven (more information in 
paragraph 7 below). The Kyrgyz dairy producers and processors may be unable to capitalize on new 
market opportunities due to their inability to meet the animal health, food safety and quality 
standards of the EAEU. However, Kyrgyz dairy products benefit from a reputation of better taste 
due to the production model based on natural pastures. Addressing current constraints in the Kyrgyz 
dairy sector would allow to capitalize on new market opportunities, as well as on the achievements 
and initiatives of the previous and ongoing projects in the agriculture sector.  
 
Market opportunities for Kyrgyz milk and dairy products. The demand for Kyrgyz dairy products, 
in particular in Kazakhstan, is significant. Even though the border is closed to most of the official 
dairy exports (only seven companies can export dairy products to Kazakhstan), informal trade is 
booming. While the official value of exports of milk/dairy products in 2012 was US$30 million 
(equivalent to 4% of the annual milk production volume), the unofficial export revenues were 
closer to US$ 100 million (14% of the milk production volume). Russia is also considered a 
potentially large export market for dairy products (in particular, cheese). Once milk quality is 
upgraded, exporting to other countries (such as China, Afghanistan and Pakistan) should be 
possible.  
 
The Kyrgyz dairy sector is primarily dependent on smallholder private dairy units with an average 
herd size of 3-5 heads of cattle. Around 60% of the rural population own livestock, but the average 
herd size tends to be small. Milk is an important part of the diet and around 90% of the population 
consume dairy products regularly. In value terms, milk is one of the top five agricultural products of 
the country. Per capita availability of milk is around 193 kg and 25% of the milk produced is 
surplus, for processing and export. It should be noted, however, that farmers who keep animals do 
not consider themselves dairy farmers (animals are rather considered a subsistence livelihood 
source), and the animal breeding and management practices are poor, which accounts for low dairy 
sector productivity. 
 
Livestock productivity is low compared to countries with similar production conditions. 
Furthermore, productivity has been declining from 2,041 kg in 2009, to 2023 kg in 2012 and 2, 013 
kg in 2013.  Many factors cause this low productivity at the farm level: inadequate on-farm animal 
health management, poorly equipped laboratories and disease diagnostic services, irregular and 
incomplete vaccinations, low breed stock (genetic) quality, absence of sustainable breeding policies 
and practices, inadequate feeding, improper shed maintenance, and farm hygiene issues, overall 
poor knowledge of animal husbandry techniques, low level of investments into production and 
marketing infrastructure. Addressing these issues can significantly increase both the productivity 
and total output of milk, which would contribute to increasing producers’ incomes and help address 
the sourcing problems faced by dairy processors. Processors experience a shortage of clean and 
high quality milk, and as a result underutilize their processing capacities and forego additional 
incomes that could come from exporting to other countries, and primarily, to the neighboring 
Kazakhstan. Export bans have a multiplier effect, as they affect not only the processors but also the 
milk-selling farmers and households and other players in the value chain.  
 
The Kyrgyz Dairy Sector Development Program (KDSDP) was initiated with support from IFC’s 
advisory program in 2015, to help the country capitalize on market opportunities presented by the 
EAEU. The Program is designed to help ensure steady milk exports to Kazakhstan (and other 
countries) through a dairy value chain approach, which would enable farmers to receive steady and 
increased incomes for the milk. It has already started working by supporting dairy processors in 
Issyk-kul Region. However, issues related to animal health and low productivity continue to persist. 
To make value chain development successful, it is imperative that on-farm improvements as well as 
necessary public sector investments are supported to ensure high quality and increased volume of 
milk. Thus, the KDSDP has grown into a comprehensive program addressing the various 
bottlenecks affecting the dairy value chain. The program covers all aspects of the dairy value chain: 
cattle breed improvement, animal feed improvement, improvements of animal productivity and 
milk quality, extension education and outreach services, animal health and hygiene, milk collection 
upgrades, laboratory, disease diagnosis and testing capacity (animal disease control, food safety and 
milk quality) upgrades, processing capacity upgrades, food safety standard upgrades, enabling 
regulatory framework, and export promotion.

II. Proposed Development Objectives
The Development Objective of the Project is to enhance dairy animal productivity and milk quality 
on beneficiary farms.

III. Project Description
Component Name
Component 1: Strengthening Public and Private Services in the Dairy Sector
Comments (optional)
This component would contribute to the program development objective by improving the public-
private dialogue on private sector development issues, and by supporting the improvements in the 
breed stock (genetic quality) of the dairy cows. This component would focus on the following 
activities: (i) Improving the Public-Private Dialogue; (ii) cattle identification and registration in 
Issyk-kul Region; (iii) Establishment of a World Organization for Animal Health-certified Zone 


Free of Animal Diseases (with a focus on Foot and Mouth Disease in close collaboration with the

V. Implementation
The Ministry of Agriculture and Melioration (MOAM) and the Ministry of Finance (MOF) would 
be the Implementing Agencies for the project. Both Ministries have prior extensive experience with 
implementation of Bank-financed projects.  
 
The Agribusiness Competitiveness Center (ABCC) reporting to MOAM, and the Credit Line 
Management Unit (CLMU) at MOF would be responsible for implementation of the technical 
assistance and credit line activities, respectively. Both implementing units have extensive 

experience in implementing Bank-financed projects. The technical assistance activities 
(Components 1 and 2) would be implemented through the ABCC, which has been successfully 
implementing technical assistance activities in the agriculture sector in three Bank-financed projects 
(Agribusiness and Marketing Project, Agricultural Productivity Assistance Project, and the JSDF-
financed Support to the Community Seed Funds Project). The Revolving Fund for farmers, farmer 
associations, agro-processors and traders would be managed by the CLMU which has successfully 
managed credit lines in three previous Bank-financed projects (Rural Finance II Project, 
Agribusiness and Marketing Project, and Agricultural Productivity Assistance Project).  Similar to 
the previous projects, procurement functions for the proposed project would be carried out by 
ABCC and the overall Financial Management would be the responsibility of CLMU. Safeguards 
support would be the responsibility of the ABCC. ABCC would also open a regional office in Issyk-
kul, where the technical staff and Environmental Specialist would be located. Both PMUs, but, in 
particular, ABCC would closely liaise with the other projects under the KDSDP, to ensure that all 
necessary activities are implemented, and no duplications occur.  
 
A Steering Committee would be set up to provide strategic guidance for project implementation, as 
well as ensure that key issues that need to be resolved are brought to the attention of the 
Government and their resolution facilitated. The Steering Committee would consist of 
representatives of the Prime Minister’s Office, MOAM, Ministry of Economic Regulation, MOF, 
Issyk-kul Oblast Governor’s Office, and private sector representatives. 
 
A consulting firm with international experience in dairy sector development, in particular, in 
working with farmers to improve on-farm productivity and milk quality, would be contracted under 
the project to support project implementation. The consultants would have the following main 
responsibilities: (i) identify the locations for the service points for the Dairy Model Villages 
(Component 2); (ii) provide training-of-trainers to local consulting companies that would train 
farmers in the project area (Component 2); (iii) provide advisory services to individual larger 
farmers; or groups of farmers, on specific areas related to the improvement of milk quality and 
quantity on beneficiary farms (Component 2); and (iv) assist ABCC in coordinating the project 
activities with other activities of the program, in particular, those financed by IsDB and other donors 
(Component 1 and Component 4).  
 
In addition, local consulting companies and/or NGOs would be hired under the project to ensure 
outreach to farmers, training and advisory services on the ground (under Component 2).  
 
Finally, a local consulting company or NGO experienced in group mobilization and group lending 
arrangements would be hired under the project to provide the necessary training to the groups of 
beneficiaries of the Revolving Fund, as well as help with ensuring collection of repayments due to 
the Revolving Fund (Component 3).

Appraisal Review Decision 
(from Decision Note)

The review did authorize the team to appraise and negotiate

I. Project Context
Country Context
Economic growth and poverty reduction gains achieved over the last decade in Moldova have been 
fueled by strong remittance flows that triggered increased, import-served consumption. The decade-
long growth has not been accompanied by an increase in employment. On the contrary, total 
employment in Moldova declined by 27 percent over the period 2000-2010. Agriculture released 
most of the labor that found jobs through internal and external outward migration. Another 
macroeconomic negative resulting from a consumption-led growth model was the buildup of an 
alarming trade deficit. With the value of imports more than triple to that of exports, the trade gap 
has reached over 50 percent of GDP in 2008. The fallout from the global crisis of 2008, as well as 
the lingering crisis in Europe and the Russian Federation in 2014 (key migration labor destinations), 
exposed the fragility of this growth model. As remittances declined, domestic demand fell by 10 % 
and the real economy contracted by 6% in 2009. Moldova’s quick recovery from the crisis in 2010 
and 2011 has been again largely based on the restored supply of remitances, but also on increased 

agricultural prices and growing exports. Remittance flows have not grown much in 2014, and are 
expected to stall in 2015 primarily due to the marked depreciation of the Russian Ruble, tighter 
labor migration controls and a slowing economy in the Russian Federation.  
 
The lessons from Moldova’s development pattern over the past decade, have underlined the critical 
need for a second engine of growth – the revival of exports. As Moldova’s working population 
declines, export-led growth needs to come from investment and improvements in productivity and 
competitiveness. The Government of Moldova recognizes the need for an investment- and export-
led engine of the growth based on on increased capital investments, innovation and 
competitiveness.  The National Development Strategy “Moldova 2020”, reinforces the 
Government's commitment to a development paradigm based on a dynamic model driven by 
domestic and foreign investment and export-oriented sectors. In addition, the Government's reforms 
in 2011-2014 focused on achieving closer trade integration with the European Union, which 
culminated in the conclusion of an Association Agreement between the Republic of Moldova and 
the European Union, complemented by a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement which 
came into effect on August 1, 2014. The latter, has brought about new and exciting opportunities 
for market diversification of the country's agro-food exports.

  

Sectoral and institutional Context
Recently, the country's shift to an export-led growth model has suffered a number of setbacks due 
to uncertainties with supply to the Russian market. Moldovan agricultural and food exports to the 
Russian Federation have been subject to various trade restrictions through 2013 and 2014 - starting 
with a ban on wines, followed by ban on meat and a nearly complete ban on fruits and vegetables, 
and canned goods. The most affected export items were wine, apples and plums. In 2013, prior to 
the bans, approximately thirty percent of the country's wine exports (valued at US$350 million), 
ninety three percent of apple exports (valued at US$43.7 million) and eighty percent of plum 
exports (valued at US$21.1) went to Russia.  The loss of the Russian Federation market represented 
a significant blow to horticulture in Moldova as there are few alternative markets for the agro-food 
produce, especially for apples and plums. There is very limited potential for meaningful import 
substitution. Moldovan imports of apples were only about 1,500 tons in 2013 (valued at US$1.34 
million) and imports of plums are negligible. Un-utilized processing capacity for apples and plums 
in the country is limited and has only absorbed additionally approximately 60,000 tons of apples 
and 40,000 tons of plums in 2014 (15% and 35% of output respectively). The resulting supply glut 
of apples and plums, compounded by an existing large stock of processed products has led to a 50% 
drop in the domestic market price for apples and plums. Similarly, as a result of the wine ban, and 
accumulating stocks in 2014, grapes are traded at 40% of the 2013 price.   
 
In recent years there have been significant productivity gains in the Moldovan horticulture sector 
due to significant investments and, these gains could easily be lost because of the impact of the 
Russian embargoes.  Productivity gains have contributed to a steady  increase in output and are 
likely to have come from stricter application of growing technologies, and/or replacement of old 
orchard/vineyards, more intensive production and use of modern technologies. This is a result of 
increased investment in the sector, which is a very positive development given Moldova’s 
comparative advantage in high value agriculture.  This transformation has been the result of a fairly 
long-drawn struggle, which is finally showing results. The embargos have the potential to have a 
major negative impact on fruit growers’ competitiveness by stalling, if not reversing, 
modernization, as a result of deteriorating financial standing and de-capitalization.   


 
The majority of fruit growers is represented by small peasant farmers (66% for apples, 69% for 
plums, 70% for vineyards) and provides significant rural employment and incomes, for an 
estimated 350,000 people. A large share of these jobs now are either at risk or are yielding 
significantly lower pay due to the impact of the embargo. The resulting social consequences could 
be severe, as the highest poverty rates are already registered among the agriculture-related 
population: 21.7 percent of farmers and 31.3 percent of agricultural workers have been found poor 
in 2013, these two categories accounting for 31 percent of country's poor.

II. Proposed Development Objectives
A. Current Project Development Objectives – Parent
The Project Development Objective is to enhance the competitiveness of the agro-food sector by 
supporting the modernization of the food safety management system, facilitating market access for 
farmers, and mainstreaming agro-environmental and sustainable land management practices.

III. Project Description
Component Name
Compensatory Sales Support Grants
Comments (optional)
The new component will finance targeted support to farmers with farms of less than or equal to 15 
hectares, who sold apple, plums and grapes domestically for processing in 2014. The grants will 
compensate the difference between the potential non-embargo price and the domestic sales price, 
with an aim of avoiding possible de-capitalization and collapse of the horticulture sector, thus giving 
it a much needed respite for reorientation to new markets and/or amortization of the financial losses.

V. Implementation
The parent - Agriculture Competitiveness Project (ACP) was approved by the Board on May 1, 
2012. It is financed by (i) an IDA credit in the amount of US$18.0 million; (ii) a fully-blended GEF 
grant of US$4.4 million; and (iii) a SIDA grant of US$3.0 million. The PDO is: to enhance the 
competitiveness of the country's agro-food sector by supporting the modernization of the food safety 
management system, facilitating market access for farmers, and mainstreaming agro-environmental 
and sustainable land management practices. The ACP has the following components: Component 1: 
Enhancing Food Safety Management; Component 2: Enhancing market access potential; 
Component 3: Enhancing land productivity through sustainable land management. The project 


became effective on September 24, 2012. The closing date for the ACP is June 30, 2017. 
 
The project was designed to contribute to the realization of the economic growth model described in 
the 2011-2014 Government Program aimed at enhancing export competitiveness, attracting 
investment and achieving closer trade integration with the EU. More specifically, the ACP is 
supporting the Government's ambitious efforts in reforming the food safety management system, 
efforts to improve farmers’ market opportunities through investment support (to bring about 
upgrades in post-harvesting infrastructure) and institutional development support (creation and 
strengthening of productive partnerships), and efforts to mainstream the use of good agricultural 
practices and sustainable land management.  
 
Project performance is currently rated “moderately satisfactory” for Implementation Progress (IP), 
“satisfactory” for the PDO, and “satisfactory” for procurement and financial management . Current 
commitments for the IDA credit stand at 70% , and generally progress continues to be solid across 
the project's three components at this phase of implementation.  Currently, disbursement under the 
IDA Credit is at US$3.6 million (20%), under the GEF grant at US$2.1 million (48%), and the 
SIDA grant at US$0.25 (8%). Disbursement rates under the IDA Credit are expected to reach 45% 
by the end of FY15. Procurement of goods, works and consulting services has considerably picked 
up in pace in 2014; calls for proposals for matching investment grants supporting the emergence of 
productive partnerships have been carried out and awards were made; capacity building activities 
have been increasing in scope and complexity. 
 
Component 1: Enhancing food safety management. There is solid progress in the implementation of 
this component. The country's Food Safety Agency, is a relatively new institution (established in 
2012) which has largely become functional due to the support of the project. Two major civil works 
activities are under way - the rehabilitation of the Food Safety Agency (FSA) building and the 
construction of the Border Inspection Point in Tudora on the country's Southern-Eastern border with 
Ukraine. Procurement of civil works for another three border inspection points - Leuseni (West), 
Giurgiulesti (South) and Criva (North) has been completed and works are expected to commence in 
the spring of 2015. Procurement of works for the construction of the country's national reference 
laboratory for safety of products of vegetable origin (Balti) has been completed. Capacity 
strengthening activities at the national reference laboratory for safety of products of animal origin 
and animal health aimed at future international accreditation are in full swing. Additionally, the FSA 
continues to receive support for legislative and regulatory improvements, capacity building 
activities, training and knowledge sharing with various European food safety institutions. 
 
Component 2: Enhancing market access potential. Progress in the implementation of this component 
has been very strong. One call for proposals for matching investment grants from emerging 
productive partnerships has been completed in the summer of 2014, and 8 producer groups received 
matching investment grant awards in an amount of US$2.1 million for a variety of investments in 
post-harvest processing of apples, table grapes and berries. A second call for proposals is currently 
under way until January 30, 2015. In parallel, outreach activities are under way to raise awareness 
about the project's opportunities for fruit and vegetable growers especially in light of on-going 
difficulties Moldovan agro-food exports have on the traditional Russian market, and a stringent need 
for reorientation of trade flows to different, more stable markets. 
 
Component 3: Enhancing land productivity through sustainable land management.  
Implementation of this component is progressing well. All activities related to the rehabilitation of 



protective shelter-belts are on schedule, and the equipment which was procured for these purposes is 
being utilized efficiently by two mobile mechanized agro-forestry squads. The component's 
sustainable land managed grant scheme has been launched and a first call for proposals yielded 
more than 80 applications that are currently under review. It is expected that about 30 awards will be 
made in the next few weeks, for an amount of approximately US$0.6 million.

B.   Introduction and Context

Country Context
Maldives and eleven other countries border the waters of the South West Indian Ocean (SWIO) 
➢❨  the island nations of Comoros, Madagascar, Mauritius and Seychelles; and seven mainland 
countries: France, Kenya, Mozambique, Somalia, South Africa, Tanzania and Yemen. Together 
these countries are members of the South West Indian Ocean Fisheries Commission (SWIOFC), a 
regional fisheries body. The SWIO marine fisheries are part of a larger marine ecosystem shared 
by all countries of the region. They are a regional public good, whose health and sustainability 
require regional coordination to limit the negative and enhance the positive externalities yielded 
by national activities, especially on the migratory fish species, such as tuna. Conservation and 
sustainable harvesting of the regional public goods in particular, and the shared ecosystem in 
general are central to the economy of the island countries in SWIO region.  
 
Fisheries sector accounts for a substantial portion of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the SWIO 
countries. Seafood export from these countries was approximately US$2.7 billion in 2014. Local 
industrial fisheries (mainly shrimp) and tuna processing constitute a substantial part of 
employment, income and foreign exchange earnings. Aquaculture and recreational fishing (sport 
fishing and diving) are rapidly growing industries and growing source of revenues in several of 
these countries. Fisheries, especially small-scale and subsistence fisheries play an important role 
for the livelihoods of estimated 107 million people living within 100 kilometers of the coast in the 
SWIO countries. They are often among the most vulnerable communities with high exposure to 
climate change impacts. The fisheries sector is a major contributor to nutritional health and food 
security in the SWIO region, especially for poor coastal communities with limited alternatives to 
fish for animal protein, as well as essential nutrients, vitamins, minerals and trace elements. 
 
Maldives, comprising of 26 atolls of 1,190 small coral islands of which 188 are inhabited by a 
local population of 338,434, has successfully built on its extraordinary natural assets to promote 
growth and socio-economic development. This was achieved mainly by developing a successful 
high-end tourism sector, whose sizeable rents have been redistributed to the population to address 
its development challenges. GDP per capita increased from US$268 in 1980 to US$7,681 in 2014 
(highest in South Asia), mainly driven by tourism and non-tradable tourism related activities. 
Incidence of poverty in Maldives is in line with that of an upper middle-income country, and its 
human development index is second only to Sri Lanka among the countries in South Asia. The 
share of the population living with less than US$1.25 a day was 4.9 percent in 2010, whereas the 
corresponding share using the US$2 a day poverty line was 17.02 percent in 2010. 
  
Despite this outstanding performance, the pace of poverty reduction has been below potential; and 
the level of inequality remains a major challenge. Limited job opportunities and skill-
endowments, especially for women and youth might have played an important role in limiting 
contribution of growth to poverty reduction. In particular, lack of growth in fisheries is an 
important cause of the limited impact of growth to poverty reduction, especially in the atolls away 
from MalÃ©.   
 
The World Bank➢❨ s Systematic Country Diagnostic, 2015 (SCD) provides a snapshot of the 
inherent vulnerabilities of Maldives➢❨  development program including immediate concerns 
about the fiscal, environmental and social sustainability. Due to its macro-economic vulnerability, 
given the small size, it is important to look for economic diversification away from tourism and 

heavy reliance on imports; and to promote an inclusive development of the labor market with 
particular opportunities for women and youth. There is a need to augment climate-proofing of the 
economy as climate change could cause annual economic losses of more than 12 percent of GDP 
by 2100. Emphasis on environment and natural resources management, especially preventing 
damage and pollution of the coral reefs is important to sustain and increase climate resilience of 
tourism and fisheries, the crucial components of the national economy.
Sectoral and institutional Context
An estimated 28 percent of the SWIO regional fish stocks are over-exploited or depleted 
(especially the high-value resources, such as shrimp, lobster, and sea cucumber). A further 40 
percent of stock are fully exploited (SWIOFC, 2011) from overfishing by industrial vessels and 
artisanal fishers, and widespread use of destructive equipment and techniques (such as dynamite 
or beach seines). Critical ecosystems, already weakened by land-based pollution are further 
endangered by loss of biodiversity, and destruction of coral reefs and mangroves; and 
consequently the coastal resource base is acutely threatened. As a result, it was estimated that 
SWIO coastal states incurred annual losses of US$225 million in 2008. Furthermore, a weak 
investment and business climate, coupled with limited or underperforming infrastructure and 
services, significantly constrain industrial and artisanal private sector development.  
 
As small-scale fisheries modernize, the limited potential of many coastal fisheries will require 
that fishing effort be reduced to become sustainable. This will generally translate into fewer 
vessels or jobs in harvesting operations, and require that attention be devoted to alternative 
livelihood opportunities in post-harvest value addition, aquaculture, and recreational fisheries or 
in other sectors. Reduction or elimination of destructive fishing is also a significant governance 
and social challenge.  
 
The fisheries sector in the SWIO is already largely regional, with each country➢❨ s decision 
affecting other countries➢❨  activities. In particular, large national investments, such as ports, 
fishing fleets, or processing plants, are competing against each other. Regional coordination is 
therefore needed to avoid conflicts and suboptimal sectoral investments, and to promote equitable 
distribution of wealth. Furthermore, several technical aspects of the sector are regional in nature 
(e.g., monitoring, control and surveillance, safety at sea), and their implementation, at the least, 
has to be coordinated at a regional level. The countries also face common constraints with regard 
to their fisheries sector: weak governance, weak human and institutional capacity, and a fragile 
business environment. The SWIO countries will therefore benefit from addressing these 
challenges jointly. They already use regional platforms to share their experience in implementing 
more sustainable and economically viable fisheries policies and practices, including the Indian 
Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) and SWIOFC. Greater regional cohesion will enhance the 
countries➢❨  voice in international fora as well as in negotiating fishing-related agreements, 
where decisions made have significant impacts on the fisheries sector of the SWIO countries. 
 
The SWIO countries have repeatedly called for attention to regional collaboration in the sector, 
recognizing the important contribution by the marine fisheries to regional and national goals: 
poverty reduction, food security, economic growth, balance of payments, and the value of natural 
capital. In response, major donors (the European Union, EU; France; the Global Environment 
Facility, GEF; and the World Wide Fund for Nature, WWF) and the World Bank have all 
supported regional fisheries programs in the recent past.  Consolidating and expanding past 
projects and analytical advice, the World Bank committed in-principle to finance the multiple 


South West Indian Ocean Fisheries Governance and Shared Growth (SWIOFish) series of 
projects (SOP) in 2015. Three consecutive series of projects are expected: SWIOFish Phase 1 
during 2015-21 (hereafter referred as the SWIOFish SOP); SWIOFish Phase 2 during 2022-27; 
and SWIOFish Phase 3 during 2028-32. Under the first series, the First South West Indian Ocean 
Fisheries Governance and Shared Growth Project (SWIOFish1) was approved in 2015 (covering 
Comoros, Mozambique, Tanzania and the Indian Ocean Commission). The second project 
covering Madagascar and the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission) and the third project covering 
Seychelles are expected to be approved in 2017. Maldives is the fourth planned project in the 
SWIOFish, to be followed by similar country-level projects in Somalia, Mauritius and Kenya (all 
expected to be approved in FY18). 
 
At the national level, the fisheries sector is a critical contributor to the national economy and an 
important economic activity in all of Maldives➢❨  inhabited islands. In 2015, primary fisheries 
accounted directly for 1.4 percent of GDP {excluding manufacturing (3.5% of GDP); wholesale 
and retail trade (4.7%) and transport (8.7%) where fisheries has a major role} and 11 percent of 
employment. The sector generated US$140 million in export revenue in 2015 (and a high of US
$161 million 2013), which is amost all of Maldives physical exports. Although the relative 
importance of the fisheries sector has declined since the late 1970s (due to the rapid growth of 
tourism), its role in the economy remains significant, including in providing food and nutrition 
security and as a source of livelihood and employment in remote islands without a major tourism 
facility. In the atolls away from MalÃ©, 30 percent of the household heads work in fisheries.  
 
Although the country benefits from vast fishing resources spread over 923,000 square kilometer 
of exclusive economic zone (EEZ), the total fish catch has declined from 185,923 tons in 2005 to 
127,350 tons by 2015; and direct employment reduced from around 14,000 in 2001 to less than 
9,000 persons now. The bulk of fisheries catch (up to 95 percent) are skipjack and yellowfin tuna. 
The Maldivian tuna is considered a premium product due to high quality fish stocks, pristine 
water, and sustainable fishing methods. Reef fishes, which account for 5 (average) to 16 percent 
(in low ➢❨ tuna years➢❨ ) of catch are mainly used for domestic consumption and supply to 
resorts, but export is rising (especially for grouper, sea-cucumber and aquarium fish). The tuna 
fishery, especially the skipjack ➢❨ pole and line➢❨  fishery has been recognized as one of the 
most environmentally responsible fishery operations in the world (certified by the Marine 
Stewardship Council, MSC), a dimension that has helped maintain the higher than usual export 
prices in recent past. 
 
Sustainable and diversified development of the fisheries sector is part of the Government of 
Maldives➢❨  vision, which encourages economic growth based on a diversified economy and 
aims at increased job opportunities. The Ministry of Fisheries and Agriculture (MoFA), with 
support from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), is preparing a Master Plan for 
Sustainable Fisheries to: (a) update and implement fisheries management plans including 
diversification; (b) strengthen the country➢❨ s monitoring, control and surveillance systems; (c) 
establish a better knowledge of the impacts of climate change on the fisheries sector; (d) reduce 
the excessive use of live bait in tuna fishery; and (e) address the heavy exploitation of export-
oriented reef fishery.  
 
The business-as-usual (BAU) scenario suggests that the fishery sector is threatened, and the 
income and jobs from the sector is at risk. The challenges of the fisheries sector are threefold. 
First, given the dependence of so many island people on fisheries, sustenance of capture fishery at 

about 120,000 tons and maintaining an export of about 60 percent of the catch are important for 
the national income and welfare of fishers and their families. Measures, such as compliance with 
the IOTC recommendations on improved surveillance and monitoring, or improved monitoring 
and generation of evidence to justify continuation of MSC certification, will be important to 
sustain exports and premium export prices. Operationalization of the Government of Maldives➢❨  
decision to focus on all value-added processing of tuna, and a quality control limit for tuna fishing 
are also required. Other challenges include inefficient use of infrastructure, inadequate 
distribution, and lack of access to finance to invest in fisheries value chains. 
 
Second, there is a need to ensure sustainability of live-bait and reef fishing. The high value tuna 
fisheries sector is dependent on live-baits and reef ecosystem. Excessive reef fishing as well as 
capture of live-baits (for tuna fisheries) is considered threats to coral reefs. Anecdotal evidence 
suggests that capture of groupers is already unsustainable. Diversification and consequent 
(partial) shift away from capture fishery is important on three accounts: (a) to minimize impacts 
on coral reefs, and to sustain the reef fish population, especially groupers; (b) ensure sustenance 
of the capture fishery to protect jobs and income of most of the households who are currently 
engaged in fisheries and associated vocations; and create alternatives for households who will not 
be able to continue in capture fishery; and, (c) to create dependable income and growth 
opportunities for communities and individuals who have gradually been excluded from the 
mainstay tuna fishing and related local processing operations, and who are involved in 
opportunistic reef fishing.  
 
The opportunities for diversification are, however, limited. Mariculture appears to be the only 
substantial opportunity, for benefiting the communities, reducing the excessive pressure from reef 
or bait fishing; and providing meaningful employment opportunities for individuals, including 
women and youth currently outside the gainfully employed workforce. Some initial mariculture 
works had been experimented so far: with pearl oysters, Maldivian clownfish, and brown marbled 
groupers. A private aquaculture farm is producing sea cucumbers, producing the larvae in 
hatcheries before growing them in lagoons. The future development of mariculture, however, is 
hindered by limited availability of fingerlings/juveniles, feed, financing and appropriate 
technology.  
 
Third, inclusive development of fisheries sector is important for substantive job creation. Towards 
this, mariculture, diversified capture of relatively deep-sea species and aquarium fishery appear to 
be ideal for Maldives. These have the potential to grow, and contribute to the reduction of 
unemployment among inhabitants of remote atolls. In implementing such a program, however, 
special attention needs to be given to the establishment of gender sensitive policy and regulatory 
framework, the establishment of benefit sharing mechanisms for the natural resources to be 
managed and, capacity building of atoll councils and small businesses. 
 
While Maldives➢❨  fisheries sector represents an undeniable engine of inclusive growth for the 
country, its sustainability and future will depend on three important and interrelated factors: (a) 
better and more transparent governance over fishing through all aspects of the value chain 
including post-harvest processing; (b) ensuring that greater value is captured across the value 
chain and that wealth generation opportunities are shared with marine resources dependent 
communities, especially youth and women; and (c) improved livelihoods and meaningful income 
opportunities for communities in the remote atolls, who should squarely be at the center of future 
sustainable mariculture development efforts. 


Fisheries in Maldives is intricately connected with the wellbeing of the regional fishery stock. In 
spite of using sustainable fishing practices, the capture of tuna has come down from 184,000 tons 
to 127,000 tons ➢❨  arguably due to the diminishing stock in the Indian Ocean as a whole. In 
recent years, Maldives was focusing on yellowfin tuna as one way of offsetting the reducing catch 
of skipjack tuna. In spite of practicing sustainable fishing in the Maldivian waters, the yellowfin 
tuna population in the Indian Ocean Region has shrunk, and the IOTC has now specified reduced 
quota for yellowfin catch. It is evident that these regional level issues have had implication at the 
national level. The tuna stock in the Indian Ocean is somewhat at risk, and it is expected that tuna 
catch will reduce further in the coming years.  
 
The best option for Maldives is to work with other countries to ensure sustainable practices over 
all of the Indian Ocean Region. At the same time, Maldives needs to (a) augment its own systems, 
procedures, compliance mechanisms, and skills to retain the ➢❨ environmentally sustainable➢❨  
branding to capture premium price in international markets, and (b) offer to share the knowledge 
of its own systems, procedures, compliance mechanisms, and the ➢❨ environmentally 
sustainable➢❨  fishing technology to the other countries. By demonstrating higher capture of 
value and premium price, Maldives can demonstrate to the other countries that conservation 
indeed pays.  
 
Nevertheless, Maldives will need to grow, and this need threatens other parts of the ecosystem 
even if tuna fishing is at the current sustainable level. Maldives cannot afford to espouse the cause 
of conservation of tuna fishery (in its own waters and in the region) and at the same t ime destroy/
diminish reef fishery. Therefore, diversification into mariculture and consequent (partial) shift 
away from capture fishery (in particular for new entrants) is important on two accounts: (a) to 
minimize impacts on coral reefs, and to sustain the reef fish population, especially groupers; (b) to 
create dependable income and growth opportunities for communities and future generations, 
especially women who had been gradually excluded from the mainstay tuna fishing and related 
local processing operations, and youth who are involved in opportunistic reef fishing. The agenda 
of conservation of reef and waters, reef fishery, and development of mariculture as the best 
diversification option, therefore are closely linked to the regional conservation agenda.  
 
As discussed above, a Regional IDA investment in Maldives is a crucial part of the SWIOFish 
SOP. SWIOFish1 and SWIOFish2 mention specific investment in Maldives. Maldives is currently 
co-chairing (and will take over as chair in 2017) the SWIOFC, and is participating in the 
SWIOFish Bureau meetings, the Scientific Committee Meetings, meetings of the Working Group 
on Fisheries Data and Statistics, meetings of the Working Party on Cooperation and Coordination 
in Tuna Fisheries; and the overall SWIOFC meetings including annual SWIOFC Sessions ➢❨  all 
supported by SWIOFish1. Maldives also benefits from SWIOFish1 regional support to develop a 
National Observer Program, in line with the IOTC➢❨ s recommendations, to eventually be able to 
participate in the SWIOFC Countries➢❨  Regional Observers Program. Under SWIOFish2, 
Maldives will benefit from training by IOTC Secretariat➢❨ s technical teams to better implement 
Maldives➢❨  international fisheries obligations under the IOTC, such as the Port States➢❨  
Measures to combat Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated fishing. 
 
In essence, an investment in sustainable fisheries resources development in Maldives will be 
beneficial to the countries in South-West Indian Ocean region, due to (i) economies of scale from 

shared infrastructure, technologies, and knowledge; (ii) positive externalities yielded by national 
activities to avoid the ➢❨ tragedy of the commons➢❨  scenario; (iii) addressing common 
constraints jointly through regional platforms and workshops; (iv) greater regional cohesion in the 
international fora as well as in negotiations of fishing-related agreements where decisions need to 
be collective and impacts are shared; and, (v) upgraded value-chain linkages by collectively 
helping their fisheries sector integrate into more competitive value chain.

C.  Proposed Development Objective(s)

Development Objective(s)
To improve management of fisheries at regional and national levels including support to establish 
mariculture in targeted atolls in the Maldives.

Key Results 
The project seeks to achieve the following key results: 
(a) Compliance rate of SWIO countries with IOTC resolutions (Regional-level Indicator; 
same as SWIOFish2 indicator)  
(b) Vessels complying with IOTC and European Union requirements on monitoring and 
reporting (Regional-level Indicator) 
(c) Value of production from mariculture 
(d) Direct project beneficiaries (of which share of female beneficiaries) 
(e) Share of target beneficiaries with rating ➢❨ satisfied➢❨  or above on project 
interventions.

D.  Project Description

The proposed project is the fourth in the SWIOFish SOP. As articulated in the SOP description, a 
central thrust of the SOP is that while the challenges are regional in nature, addressing them 
requires action at the national level, which will yield regional benefits, enhance ownership and 
efficiency, and strengthen national institutions to help enhance the overall health of fisheries in 
the region. The project components are directly linked to the wellbeing of the regional fishery 
stock. Other than ➢❨ Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation➢❨ , the project will 
consist of two components ➢❨  one will focus on improving the currently inadequately managed 
capture fishery, and the other one will support diversifying the fisheries economy so that 
sufficient jobs and income are created outside capture fishery to reduce stress on the regionally 
shared fish stock. Both components will build improved resilience in Maldives.  
 
Component A: Augmentation of Institutional Capacity for Marine Fisheries Management. This 
component seeks to enhance the Government➢❨ s capacity to implement a more effective 
monitoring of fisheries sector and internal control system of key marine fisheries value chains, 
and will focus on delivery of the Indian Ocean Regional agenda (as well as the intended 
adaptation agenda) of improving the overall fisheries management, marine zoning for long-term 
benefits, and a longer-term plan to establish and operationalize in-country skill and capacity 
building activities, essential for sustenance and growth of the fishery sector in Maldives. The four 
sub-components include: (A1) Development of key fisheries management and planning 
instruments including updating fisheries policy and legislative framework, zoning covering the 
entire Maldivian EEZ, and support to grouper fish management, coral reef and reef fishery 
management plans which are essential for regional conservation and improved compliance with 

IOTC recommended conservation and management measures; (A2) Development and 
implementation of fisheries management activities to ensure  compliance with IOTC and EU 
requirements, including expanded MCS, vessel registration and monitoring systems, electronic 
observer systems and augmentation of related reporting systems for commercial marine fisheries; 
collaboration with the SWIO Sub-Regional Fisheries Monitoring Centers; and, support and 
facilitation to regional agencies and international actors on the common agenda of conservation 
and management measures; (A3) Support to long-term program for fisheries management 
including sampling programs for tuna and recreational fish species, stock assessments and 
conservation zone surveys which will contribute to regional assessments and subsequent actions; 
and preparation of protocols disease surveillance, and quality control of brood stocks and fish 
feed; (A4) Fisheries sector capacity building including short and medium-term training, 
development of curriculum and teaching aids, collaboration with National Geographic 
Information System (GIS), and development and operation of a fisheries management information 
system ➢❨  all focusing on strengthening local and national skills that will contribute to national 
and SWIO Region agenda related to fishery management and consequent diversification into 
mariculture.  
 
Component B: Support to Mariculture and Diversification of Fisheries. Potential economic 
growth from diversification of capture fishery and from mariculture are pre-requisites for 
sustenance of the capture fishery resources in the Maldivian EEZ. However, mariculture is 
nascent in Maldives; and to be able to develop this sector, research, demonstration and provision 
of extension services will play key roles in addition to the three primary inputs: seeds, feed and 
access to finance. The four sub-components, therefore, include:  (B1) Development and 
demonstration of mariculture production and technology package, including completion and 
operationalization of, and preparation of medium-term operations plans and service standards for 
the Maniyafushi research and development facility (MRDF) as a center of excellence for the 
entire SWIO region; development and demonstration of technology packages for mariculture 
species; and market studies in support of mariculture choices; (B2) Promotion of mariculture out-
grower schemes and seafood growth clusters, including assessment of carrying capacity and 
supporting community custodianship of the coral reef resources, start-up investments including 
training, advisory support and compliance monitoring in out-grower farms, technical support to 
small enterprises for establishing out-grower contractual arrangements between small producers 
and larger private sector aggregators, and studies to help develop gender actions in mariculture; 
(B3) Supporting design, construction and operation of a multi-species hatchery including breeder 
stock development programs and professional training plans; and, (B4) Scoping of long-term 
marine fisheries diversification studies including planning and scoping of studies related to 
technology packages and conservation plans for new marine species to be explored in future.  
 
 
Component C: Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation (US$2.15 million).  This 
component would provide equipment, technical assistance, training, and incremental operating 
cost to strengthen the overall administrative capacity and capability of the Ministry of Fisheries 
and Agriculture and its Project Management Unit (PMU) to manage, implement, and monitor and 
evaluate project activities. Specifically, support will include staffing and operation of the PMU; 
establishment of adequate financial management and procurement management systems; 
implementation of the communication plan and grievance redress activities; monitoring and 
evaluation (M&E) and third party audits; preparation and implementation of specific 
environmental impact assessments as per the national laws; coordination with other ministries 

such as the Ministry of Environment and Energy and the private sector; special evaluation studies; 
and sharing of monitoring protocols, evaluation studies and specific experience of implementation 
of various aspects of fisheries management activities that are of interest with SWIO Region 
countries.

E.  Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis (if known)

Maldives is an island nation in the Indian Ocean oriented north-south off India's Lakshadweep 
Islands. The Maldives consists of 1,192 coral islands grouped in a double chain of 26 atolls. The 
country➢❨ s atolls encompass a territory spread over roughly 90,000 square km, making it one of 
the world's most geographically dispersed countries.  Of the 1,192 islands, 188 are inhabited by 
the country➢❨ s population, with an average of 5-10 islands in each atoll being inhabited islands 
that have infrastructure such as housing, roads and other facilities built in. The country➢❨ s total 
land area is estimated to approximately 300 square km, with islands varying in size from 0.5 to 
5.0 square km. A significant number of uninhabited islands in each atoll have also been converted 
to resorts and tourism facilities as well as house infrastructure such as industrial facilities and 
airports. 
 
The atolls are composed of live coral reefs and sand bars, situated atop a submerged ridge 960km 
long that rises abruptly from the depths of the Indian Ocean. Maldives is noted as the country 
placed at the lowest elevation in the world, with maximum and average natural ground levels of 
only 2.4 m and 1.5 m above sea level, respectively. More than 80 per cent of the country's land is 
composed of coral islands which rise less than one meter above sea level. The islands consist of 
coral, sea grass, seaweed, mangrove and sand dune ecosystems which are of great ecological and 
socio-economic significance. Maldives is home to a number ecologically sensitive marine habitats 
in shallow and intertidal zones which have been designated as protected areas by the Ministry of 
Environment and Energy (MEE) and these regions and any activities in their vicinity are 
stringently monitored and managed. 
 
Climatic conditions in the Maldives belong to the tropical-monsoon category with temperatures 
ranging between 24Â°C and 33Â°C throughout the year. Climatic conditions in the Maldives is 


predominantly affected by the large landmass of South Asia situated to the north. The presence of 
this landmass causes differential heating of land and water. These factors set off a rush of 
moisture-rich air from the Indian Ocean over South Asia, resulting in the southwest monsoon. 
Two seasons dominate Maldives' weather: the dry season associated with the winter northeastern 
monsoon and the rainy season which brings strong winds and storms. The shift from the dry 
northeast monsoon to the moist southwest monsoon occurs during April and May and the 
southwest monsoon Maldives in the beginning of June and lasts until the end of August. Annual 
rainfall averages 254cm in the north and 381cm in the south, with the southern region 
experiencing more rain.  
 
The project focuses on the whole nation. The island of Maniyafushi where the project will finance 
the augmentation of the infrastructure of the Maniyafushi Research Centre, is an uninhabited 
island and the airport island located in South MalÃ© Atoll, where the physical infrastructure has 
already been set up. The establishment and subsequent operation of mariculture out grower farms 
(in the remote northern atolls, selected specifically to avoid any potential impacts corals and water 
quality).

II. Implementation
Institutional and Implementation Arrangements
The Ministry of Fisheries and Agriculture (MoFA) has the mandate, jurisdiction and experience in 
managing fisheries, and will lead project implementation. The MoFA has implemented or 
participated in implementation of Bank-financed projects several years ago, not in the recent past. 
While MoFA has a large mandate, it has limited staff. A dedicated Project Management Unit (PMU) 
has therefore been established within MoFA, with adequate number of technical staff, including 
expert staff on mariculture development, extension, research, and market studies; environmental and 
social management; financial management, procurement, communication, monitoring and evaluation. 
 
The responsibilities of MoFA including the Steering Committee include providing national policy 
and implementation framework; approval of the project and securing the required budget from the 
Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MoFT); approval of the project➢❨ s overall annual action plans 
and annual budgets; and overall implementation oversight. MoFA will ensure that most of the project 
activities are duly executed by its regular divisions and field offices. MoFA has also prepared a 
Project Implementation Plan (PIP), which describes the project activities and their estimated costs, 
allocation of implementation responsibilities, procurement and financial management arrangements 
and plans, to guide implementation. 
 
The PMU mimics the organizational structure of the MoFA. This is important because: (a) the actual 
execution of project activities will take place using the MoFA divisions and their field offices, and a 
clear coordination between the PMU and the relevant MoFA division is needed, as PMU staff will be 
deputed in those divisions and field offices; (b) an appropriate part of the additional expertise and 
staff recruited under the PMU will be absorbed in the respective MoFA divisions at closure of the 
project for long-term improvement of institutional capacity; (c) even if most of the staff will be 

recruited from market (including expatriate consultants given the shortage of qualified fisheries 
experts in Maldives), the organizational structure of the PMU will allow MoFA to depute permanent 
staff of regular divisions to the PMU in a manner that staff can make career progressions and based 
on performance can return to their parent divisions when the deputation is over.  
 
The PMU will be responsible for project implementation, facilitating statutory clearances, including 
environmental permits; procurement of works, goods and services; and implementation of specific 
capacity building activities as per the PIP. PMU staff working on procurement, financial 
management, knowledge management, monitoring and evaluation will be located in MalÃ© while all 
other PMU functions, including fisheries management, fisheries compliance, marine research, and 
mariculture will be co-located with the MoFA divisions at MalÃ© or at the field (including at the 
offices of Island Councils) and/or the offices of MRC, MRDF, or the site of the multi-species 
hatchery. The PMU, through its marine research, fisheries management, and compliance cells, will 
support MoFA for its retained role in coordinating with IOC, IOTC, SWIO Region countries; and 
through its central cell, will provide research and logistics support to MoFA in its incoming role of 
chairing the SWIOFC. 
 
The PMU will collaborate with and seek support and partnerships with a range of other agencies to 
strengthen the capacity of the main implementing actors. These will include international knowledge 
centers, including the World Aquaculture Alliance; academic and research institutes including the 
Maldives National University; private sector business houses and industries including the Maldives 
National Chamber of Commerce and Industry; civil society groups, atoll level community 
organizations and other government departments responsible for development and protection of 
marine resources (such as the Ministry of Environment and Energy).

III. Safeguard Policies that might apply

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional)
Environmental 
Assessment OP/BP 
4.01

Yes The project was categorized as an Environmental Category B 
project, due to the potential, unless avoided, of direct and 
indirect impacts flowing from physical interventions such as 
(a) establishment of a multi-species hatchery; (b) augmentation 
of the infrastructure of the Maniyafushi Research and 
Development Facility (MRDF); and (c) establishment and 
operation of out grower farms for mariculture in different 
atolls. To avoid, mitigate and/or manage such potential 
environmental impacts, an Environmental and Social 
management Framework (ESMF) has been prepared, which 
provides detailed analysis of the scale of due diligence 
required (such as specific guidance site selection, preparation 
of environmental assessments, environmental management 
plans, etc.) as may be required, or generic but appropriate 
avoidance and environmental mitigation measures in the 
project. Specific standalone environmental impact assessments 
(and subsequent permits from the Ministry of Environment and 
Energy) will also be needed for the multi-species hatchery; 
augmentation of the infrastructure of the MRDF; and out 
grower farms for mariculture. The ESMF provides budgets to 


prepare such environmental impact assessments (which contain 
the respective environmental management plans). A standalone 
EA (including the relevant environmental management plan) 
has already been prepared for the quality assurance, quarantine 
and disease control research laboratory of the MRDF (which a 
front-runner intervention) and has been annexed to the ESMF 
and disclosed accordingly.

Natural Habitats OP/
BP 4.04

Yes This policy was triggered as all of the islands in Maldives are 
surrounded by coral reefs, with some reefs, island and waters 
around being legally protected; and it is important to avoid any 
significant impacts on these natural resources. As per the 
criteria included in the ESMF, the project design avoids any 
activity in and around of the protected marine or terrestrial 
areas. The ESMF has in place the due diligence measures to 
avoid or reduce the impacts on coral reefs, marine ecosystems 
and associated fauna and flora during the establishment and 
subsequent operation of mariculture out grower farms (in the 
remote atolls, selected specifically to avoid impacts on corals 
and water quality). The project will not involve the 
introduction of any non-native/naturalized species for the 
purpose of mariculture.

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No There are no areas classified as forests in Maldives. Any 
potential impacts on island or sea vegetation (such as sea grass, 
seaweed) are covered through OP/BP 4.01.

Pest Management OP 
4.09

No This policy is not triggered as the project will not finance the 
purchase, use or promotion of any pesticides, herbicides or 
similar other synthetic chemicals.

Physical Cultural 
Resources OP/BP 
4.11

No No project-supported activities are expected in the vicinity of 
or will affect physical cultural resources, as defined by OP/
BP4.11. All sites of physical cultural resources value in the 
Maldives are already designated and mandated as protected 
areas where no physical interventions can take place. Measures 
for safeguard chance finds have been included as part of 
mitigation measures defined in the ESMF.

Indigenous Peoples 
OP/BP 4.10

No This policy is not triggered as there are no identifiable 
indigenous communities in the project locations (islands and 
atolls).

Involuntary 
Resettlement OP/BP 
4.12

No No involuntary resettlement from land, livelihood or access to 
livelihood is expected in the project. Project activities such as 
capacity-building, research, MRDF, quality control and disease 
surveillance, establishment of household-level mariculture out-
grower farms do not give rise to any involuntary resettlement 
from land, livelihood or access to natural resources. However, 
there remains a possibility of indirect impacts that could arise 
if the marine zoning, zoning plans, and conservation plans for 
reef fishes financed by the project proposes restrictions on 


non-sustainable practices, establishment of new conservation 
areas if any, or increased level of enforcement of management 
regulations for existing conservation areas. In all such cases 
the short-term economic and/or livelihood interests of local 
communities currently engaged in activities that rapidly 
deplete resources including fish stock could be impacted. 
Although the OP4.12 explicitly provides exemption to actions 
such as natural resources management, or preparation of 
fisheries management plans, the ESMF contains a framework 
compliant with the principles of OP4.12, to specify that any 
activity which has the chance of adverse impact on citizens and 
communities, or any chance of restricting traditional access to 
natural resources will be excluded from the project (throughout 
during implementation), and the process of preparation of 
zoning and other fisheries sector conservation plans will 
employ participation and citizen engagement. The policies and 
priorities that drives preparation of any zoning plans and 
regulations, conservation plans and/or strategies in Maldives 
are to protect the rights, claims and access of Maldivian 
citizens to the territorial waters of Maldives. These principles 
are also be strictly adhered to by the project, and all such 
zoning plans and conservation regulations will require 
approval of the Atoll Councils. Therefore, it is not conceivable 
that any restriction of access to traditionally used natural 
resources will be restricted by zoning plans, regulations, 
conservation plans and enforcement supported by the project. 
Further, while the exact locations and potential impacts of all 
activities, especially the mariculture grow-out facilities, are not 
yet known, the ESMF and the site specific social assessments 
will guide these sets of activities.

IV. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify 

and describe any potential large scale,  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
While the project is classified as environmental category B, the project is expected to bring 
positive environmental benefits to the project areas as the entire design of the project is based on 
the need to conserve the marine resources, avoid and stop unsustainable capture and yields, 


comply with the best regional and international standards, and diversify into mariculture as an 
alternative to threatened reef fisheries. The project will not lead to potential large scale significant 
and/or irreversible impact as the impacts will be largely localized to project sites and can be 
managed via stringent due diligence and adherence to national and international sectoral standards. 
Specific standalone environmental impact assessments and subsequent permits from the Ministry 
of Environment will be needed for the (i) multi-species hatchery; (ii) augmentation of the 
infrastructure of the Maniyafushi Research Centre; and (iii) out grower farms for mariculture and 
it is through these assessments that site specific impacts will be identified. 
 
The project will support the establishment of infrastructure such as training and research centers 
and laboratories as well as infrastructure to conduct mariculture activities such as fish cadges and/
or pens. These could, unless carefully managed and mitigated, lead to localized environmental 
impacts typical to civil works, such as the generation of construction wastes, generation of dust, 
noise, etc., and occupational and safety impacts that will be managed accordingly. The civil works 
contracts may involve the use of expatriate/ migrant/ non-local labor but no influx related issues 
are expected - two out of the three islands involved are uninhabited (therefore, there is no host 
community), and the work at the Airport Island/ Hulumale will be expansion of an existing small 
building to create the required laboratory facility. 
 
The project will finance start-up investments into household-level aquaculture/mariculture 
production, for example, cage cultivation of native/naturalized fish species. Operations of the 
multi species hatchery, and the MRDF could also pose potential operational impacts. During 
mariculture operations, typical environmental impacts include eutrophication from feeds and 
effluents, release of antifouling chemicals and antibiotics, and impacts introduction of alien 
invasive species. The project, in conformity with the Maldivian national environmental regulations 
will support mariculture of native/naturalized species. Careful site selection of grow-out 
mariculture farms will avoid eutrophication, pollutant loading on undersea surfaces, and use or 
accumulation of synthetic pollutants. Other impacts include scenarios of fish escaping from farms 
may compete with wild stocks, or transfer of parasites and diseases, or genetic interaction between 
escaped farmed fish and wild fish stocks. However such site-specific impacts will be regulated, 
controlled and managed, especially through specific EA/EMP that will be undertaken, and 
incorporating stringent measures for mitigating and managing operational impacts in the design 
and operation of the grow-out mariculture farms. Mariculture is not entirely new to the Maldives; 
in the last decade two projects have been initiated in the islands, for which EAs were undertaken, 
and the recommended mitigation and management measures were undertaken. Similar EAs will be 
prepared for the grow-out mariculture farms, which will also comply with the requirements under 
Maldives➢❨  own regulatory framework.  
 
While the project does not envisage any adverse social impacts, some of the Component 1 
activities may lead to possible restrictions in access and increased cost to some fishers. Sub-
Components A1 and A3 in particular seek to improve the regulatory and management practices of 
the fishing industry but, in doing so, may restrict access to fisheries resources and could reduce 
income for some fishers. However, given that any fishery management plan will, by its 
characteristic intent, will try to curb overexploitation of fish stock without exception, the 
management plans (sub-components A1 and A3) will need to adopt a transparent and participatory 
process of agreement on the actions  to be included in the management plans. 
 
Overall, there is no potential large-scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts likely from the 
project.


2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities 
in the project area:
The social and environmental impacts of the proposed project is deemed to be positive and 
sustainable in the long term. The project is also expected to improve the overall socio-economic 
status of the communities, including youth and women, as a result of the potential opportunities 
via employment creation and livelihood activities.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse 
impacts.
No alternatives have been considered, predominantly as the fisheries sector, after tourism, is the 
main source of livelihood and income generation in the Maldives and the proposed project 
activities will provide the most environmentally sound management options of the sector in 
comparison to current practices.

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
An Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) in lieu of an overall project-
specific Environmental Assessment (EA) and a Social Assessment (SA) has been prepared as 
details of all specific sites and design of the project➢❨ s physical interventions are not known. A 
standalone EA has already been prepared for the quality assurance, quarantine and disease control 
research laboratory, which is a front runner intervention and is annexed to the ESMF and disclosed 
accordingly.  The ESMF outlines detailed guidelines of measures for environmental and social risk 
mitigation and institutional arrangements for conducting environmental and social assessment, 
instruction to the preparation of Environmental and Social Assessments (ESIAs), Environmental 
and Social Management Plans (ESMPs), and other such measures as well as implementation and 
monitoring. 
 
All interventions will be subject to an environmental and social screening with the objective to: (a) 
determine the anticipated environmental and social impacts, risks and opportunities of sub-project; 
and (ii) determine if the anticipated impacts and public concerns warrant further analysis, and if so 
to recommend the appropriate type and extent of Environmental and Social Assessments needed as 
per the criteria set in the ESMF. The ESMF also provides the screening and selection criteria for 
household-level mariculture out-grower farms. 
 
The ESMF takes the applicable safeguard policies into account as well as the national 
environmental requirements and World Bank environmental Health and Safety Guidelines, which 
serves as a guide to the level of environmental and social analysis and mitigation required for all 
interventions supported by the project that will have any potential to cause negative environmental 
and social impacts; and thereby ensure compliance with the World Bank➢❨ s safeguard policies 
and the relevant national regulations during implementation.  
 
The implementing agency of the project, the MoFA, has not led implementation of any World 
Bank-financed project the recent years. Capacity within MoFA to manage environmental and 
social risks within a project setting is be limited. Therefore, in the Project Management Unit 
(PMU) set up for implementation of this project, staffing includes an Environmental and Social 
Officer with relevant technical and sectoral expertise to take up the role of environmental and 
social coordinator.  S/he will report to the Project Director and will work closely with the assigned 
PMU team, the Ministry of Environment and Energy, the Island Councils, the Environmental 
Protection Agency, and will be responsible for ensuring the overall implementation of the ESMF. 


S/he will liaise with other agencies, contractors and consultants at the activity levels to implement 
the required mitigation and management measures. The E&S Coordinator will be responsible for 
monitoring and evaluation of implementation of the environmental and social management plans, 
and will prepare regular reports on compliance and status of performance indicators. The Island 
Councils will be the first level of contact for any grievance/feedback for the community, and the 
E&S Coordinator will work closely with the Island Councils to redress any grievance. The E&S 
Coordinator will lead to orient PMU and MoFA staff, consultants and contractors on the ESMF 
and on operationalization of the ESMF for each of the project activities. 
 
The project will provide training in environmental and social management to improve institutional 
capacity. The cost for monitoring and supervising the implementation of environmental and social 
project regulations have been integrated into the overall project investment cost. In addition, the 
project will also provide capacity building to potential operators of out grower farms on 
maintaining a good mariculture environment, and mitigating and managing potential 
environmental impacts during the operation.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure 
on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The key stakeholders included fisherpersons, fishing vessel-owners, fisherpersons➢❨  
associations, exporters and transporters involved in export of capture tuna and reef fishes, and 
relevant government officials. The MoFA organized elaborate discussions and consultations with 
these key stakeholder groups during November 2015 ➢❨  September 2016. The ESMF has been 
developed based on suggestions and recommendations from these key stakeholder groups. The 
project activities do not lead to adverse social or involuntary resettlement impacts, and 
consequently, there is no adversely affected person. The ESMF document was disclosed prior to 
appraisal of the project. Specific consultations at national, atoll and island levels will continue 
during implementation of the project, including during preparation of activity-specific 
environmental and social assessments.

INTRODUCTION AND CONTEXT 

 
A. Country Context 
The Independent State of Samoa (Samoa) is a small remote Pacific Island Country (PIC) with a population of 
approximately 197,000 people1. Samoa consists of two large islands (Upolu and Savai’i), and several smaller islands, it 
has a total land area of approximately 2,830 km2 and an exclusive economic zone of 131,000km2. Samoa is a stable 
democracy with steady growth supported by the tourism and agriculture sectors.  

 
Like many PIC’s, Samoa faces unique challenges to its economic growth, due to its small size, remoteness, high 
exposure to shocks and environmental fragility. Economic growth has picked up in recent years, and in FY2016 real GDP 
expanded by around 7 percent, much faster than originally forecast and a significant acceleration from growth of 
between 1 and 2 percent in the previous two years. Growth in FY16 was driven by tourism arrivals, lower fuel prices, 
and new fish processing facilities, as well as two major sporting events. Over the medium term, real GDP is expected to 
increase at an annual rate of around 2 percent2. However, it’s important to note that frequent natural disasters can 
distort this picture. Samoa was hit by Tropical Cyclone Evan in late 2012 and, according to the Damage and Loss 
Assessment3 caused an estimated US$210 million (30% of annual GDP) in damages and losses, including a loss of 49 
percent in crop and livestock GDP, and 5 percent in fisheries GDP. While Samoa has largely recovered from the effects 
of TC Evan, Category 5 Cyclones have been a 1 in 10-year event for Samoa.  
 
Samoa’s growth is also constrained by the high instances of obesity and noncommunicable diseases. Fifty-four percent 
of Samoa’s population is obese and 25 percent of people smoke and it is predicted that the economic burden of NCDs 
will reach as high as 8.5 percent of GDP by 20404. 
 
Samoa faces persistent challenges in securing prosperity for all and the incidence of hardship remains high. While 
extreme poverty is low, at 0.6 percent, basic needs poverty or ‘hardship’, is at 26.9 percent. Eighty-one percent of 
Samoa’s population live in rural areas and most households are engaged in some form of agricultural activity. While 
strong traditional family and community based safety nets are still effective in preventing extreme hardship, these 
traditional networks cannot manage local or country-wide shocks that affect most of their members, such as natural 
disasters. 

 
B. Sectoral and Institutional Context 
Sectoral context: In Samoa, and across the Pacific, agriculture and coastal fisheries play an important role in meeting 
subsistence needs. The most commonly produced crops are taro, banana and yam, and many households have small-
scale subsistence livestock production. In February 2017, ‘food and live animal’ imports were the top category of 
imports, accounting for 27.5 percent of total imports5, and in 2015, approximately 67 percent of all retail beef and 95 
percent of chicken meat was imported. Low cost and low quality food imports often crowd out domestic production 
and contribute (together with irrelevant food behaviors) significantly to the non-communicable disease crisis 
experienced in the region. On the other hand, fresh fish, particularly tuna, still constitutes one of the largest export 
commodities, accounting for 39 percent of exports in 20166, however in terms of contribution to GDP, fishing 
accounted for only 3.2 percent of nominal GDP in the July to September 2017 quarter.

According to the 2015 Samoa Agriculture Survey, 97 percent of households grow some crops or raise some livestock. 
For most of these households, agriculture is a secondary activity, growing crops for subsistence purposes only. Despite 
this, agriculture in Samoa is becoming more market-oriented; between 2009 and 2015, there was a 5.2 percent 
increase in agriculture households selling ‘some produce’ and a 4.4 percent increase in major crop households 
producing mainly for sale7.  
 
Based on the same survey, 21 percent of all households are engaged in fisheries activities, with the highest rate (37 
percent) in Savaii. Home consumption is the main purpose, representing 70 percent of those households in 2015. As a 
result of destructive fishing practices, near shore fish and fishery products had a steep decline in the early 1990’s, 
however conservation and management plans were put in place and anecdotal evidence suggests the sector is 
gradually recovering.  
 
Samoa’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is the smallest in the Pacific region and tuna longline fishery, particularly 
albacore, is the main offshore fishery. While tuna used to be the country’s largest export earner, recent years have 
seen a decline in the overall tuna catches, with a more than 50 percent reduction between 2009 and 2013.  
Transshipment operations by Taiwanese longliners began in Apia, Samoa in 2010. As of April 2012, there had been 34 
such operations, with 6 occurring in 2012.  Numerous smaller domestic longliners also transship in Samoa with the 
target market being the cannery in neighboring American Samoa. In 2014 Samoa signed onto the Tokelau Arrangement, 
a joint approach to managing the South Pacific Longline Fishery. 
 
Currently only 1 percent of Samoan’s are formally employed in the agriculture and fisheries sector, one third of these 
are women8. While female labor force participation overall increased between 2011 and 2015, paid farm work for 
women is still low, at its lowest comprising only 12 percent in Savai’i9. However, in line with the rest of Samoa, women 
engaged in farm work tend to have higher levels of education than men; in 2015 the percentage of women in farm 
households with tertiary qualifications was double that of men. It is also more likely that an educated farm labor force 
will be open to modern farming techniques and tools10. 

 
Agriculture in Samoa is very vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. Climate change is predicted to 
manifest itself in more frequent and extreme rainfall events, longer dryer spells and drought events, rising sea levels, 
extreme winds, and high air and water temperatures. According the World Bank’s Climate and Disaster Risk Screening 
Tool, this project is likely to face (i) a high level of exposure to climate and disaster hazards, (ii) high impact on physical 
infrastructure and assets as a result of those hazards and (iii) a high level of risk to the outcomes and service delivery of 
the project. More on the results of the Climate and Disaster Risk Screening tool can be found under the ‘Overall Risk’ 
section. 
 
The limited access to: (i) extension and veterinary services for farmers, (ii) markets, and (iii) financing services 
constitute the key bottlenecks to unlocking the agriculture potential in Samoa. Currently only one state Veterinarian 
services the entire country’s livestock needs and there is limited knowledge and available training for farmers wanting 
to try new or innovative practices. New regulations around food labelling and health and safety standards coming into

coconut trees; or more than 20 banana plants; or more than 20 other tree crops. 

effect will also create additional requirements for market access. However, if well accompanied, smallholders farmers 
could also benefit substantially from these. 

 
Institutional context: The Government of Samoa’s Agriculture Sector Plan 2016-2020 provides the framework to guide 
coherent programs and actions from all key stakeholders to achieve the goal of increased food, nutrition and income 
security in Samoa. Under this plan, additional attention is being paid to build the institutional capacity of the Ministry of 
Agriculture and Fisheries (MAF) to manage the sector-wide program. A lack of data was identified as a challenge to 
planning and monitoring in the agriculture sector, so the MAF is working closely with the Samoa Bureau of Statistics to 
strengthen data collection systems, analysis and reporting. 
 
A key outcome in the Plan is to increase the supply and consumption of competitively priced, domestically produced 
food. Fish and Taro are the top two agriculture exports (accounting for 38 and 9 percent of exports respectively in July-
September 2017 quarter). Chicken legs, followed by sugar and mutton were the biggest food imports in 2017 – poultry 
and sheep production therefore present substantial potential for import substitution. Building on the achievements of 
SACEP, the Plan looks to extend and scale up adoption of new technologies, strengthen farm business management 
skills and producer linkages to sustainable and profitable markets. Improving access to productive resources, financial 
services and business skills particularly for women is also key, noting that global experience has shown where women 
have increased access to income generating opportunities and social decision-making empowerment at community 
level, household nutrition improves. 

 
C. Relationship to CPF 
The Regional Partnership Framework (RPF) for FY17 to FY21, which was approved in February 2017, covers nine small 
Pacific Island countries (PIC9), including Samoa. The RPF identifies four areas of focus: (i) fully exploiting the available 
economic opportunities; (ii) enhancing access to employment opportunities; (iii) protecting incomes and livelihoods; 
and (iv) strengthening the enablers of growth and opportunities (macro-economic management, infrastructure and 
addressing knowledge gaps). Alongside this, the Pacific Eight Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD), found very 
important solution areas for Samoa include increasing incomes from agriculture and coastal fishing, preventing 
noncommunicable diseases and strengthening disaster risk preparedness.  
 
The proposed Samoa Agriculture and Fisheries Productivity and Marketing Project (SAFPROM) generally supports both 
the RPF focus areas and the Samoa-specific solution areas in the SCD. More commercially-viable farming practices and 
better access to markets will make use of economic opportunities available to most Samoans, and increase incomes for 
those involved; providing more climate-resilient crops, education and farming infrastructure will protect incomes and 
livelihoods in the face of natural disasters and a changing climate, and; promoting locally produced food will support a 
healthy diet and less dependence on food imports.  
 
The FY2017 to FY2020 Strategy for the Development of Samoa highlights increased agricultural production as a priority 
area for Samoa, which the Samoa Agriculture and Marketing Project will also contribute to. The project is also aligned 
to the Government of Samoa’s Agriculture Sector Plan 2016-2020, aimed at increasing the food, nutrition and income 
security in Samoa. 
 
The SAFPROM will also allow Samoa to join the Pacific Islands Regional Oceanoscape Program (PROP). The PROP 
Program was developed as a Series of Projects (SOP) to be implemented in three phases, each six years’ in duration. 
Phase 1 began in 2014 and is being implemented with four countries (Federated States of Micronesia, Republic of 
Marshall Islands, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu) and one regional institution, the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency 
(FFA). The Phase I country projects all share the same Regional Program PDO and Results Framework. They also reflect 

the same component design drawing on a pre-set menu of investment activities. By allowing Samoa to join the PROP, 
this project meets key criteria for utilizing the regional International Development Association (IDA) funds. The program 
(i) involves three or more countries; (ii) has benefits, economic, social and environmental, that spill over country 
boundaries (tuna / pelagic fishes’ stocks and fisheries management); (iii) requires coordination with regional bodies 
(SPC and FFA) and with other countries in the region; and (iv) provides a platform for a high level of policy 
harmonization among countries. 
 
As the PROP Program expands into Phase II with Tonga and Samoa operations, it has been decided that the regional 
project with FFA will not incorporate these new countries in Phases II and III, as it was found that the regional 
implementation approach is not the optimal model with which to secure regional support and coordination of the 
national projects.  Rather, a soft technical assistance model bilaterally to each of the four main regional fisheries 
agencies11 will be employed during Phase II of PROP to ensure that each of these agencies pro-actively engage in 
supporting the national projects to strengthen their commitment and collaboration toward shared management of 
their oceanic and coastal fisheries resources.

PROJECT CONTEXT 

 
A. Concept 
 
1. Description 
The Samoa Agriculture Competitiveness Enhancement Project (P115351) is currently in its last year, closing 31 
December 2018, and has achieved significant accomplishments for Samoan farmers, as well as relevant government 
departments. Based on SACEP’s successes, the government of Samoa would like to build on these achievements and 
take advantage of the opportunities presented.  
Through its objectives of increasing crops and livestock productivity and access to market increase as well as improving 
the management of targeted fisheries, this project may contribute to: (i) import substitution and increase the supply 
and consumption of domestically produced food; (ii) boost exports of some commodities, and (iii) strengthen resilience 
of farming households to climate change and climate-induced disasters (cyclones, heavy rains, prolonged dry seasons).  
 
It is proposed that SAFPROM will have four components.  
Component 1: Creating an enabling environment for increased productivity and access to markets for target farming 
and fishing households. This will include: 

a. Institutional capacity building activities in the MAF as well as current and potential cooperatives and 

associations. Activities will be based on a needs assessment and a capacity building action plan. The project 

will also support the establishment of an Agriculture Sector Coordination Division within the MAF for 

project management. This component will also help reviewing the regulatory and policy framework and 

update it if needed. A special focus will be looked at national standards that affect the capacity of Samoan 

agriculture products to reach specific high value markets. 

b. Development and improvement of infrastructure and equipment of public good nature. On the model of 

SACEP (with the Static and Mobile Slaughtering Units and the Tissue Culture Laboratory), this sub-

component will support the development of feasibility studies, work and equipment of key collective 

infrastructures that have been identified as bottlenecks for the development of the sector. For instance, in 

Savai’I island, a small veterinary laboratory and a fruits and vegetable Packhouse would help farmers to 

address their animal diseases and packaging concerns. 

 
Component 2: Support to farming and fishing households through a matching grant program (MGP). The design of 
which will be informed through a review of the MGP under SACEP. As per the GoS Concept Note, this financing 
mechanism should expand, not only to increase the number of farmers benefiting, but also to allow farmers’ groups to 
work together in post-harvest handling and agro-processing. It will help establishing alliances between the farmers, 
fishers, their groups and cooperatives and services providers or buyers. This MGP will give priority to sub-projects that 
promote innovative technologies aimed at improving productivity and quality for products for which there is a market 
demand. It will also support climate change mitigation activities through for instance intensification of livestock 
production, pasture management, improved feeding rations and practices using local products; and adaptation by 
promoting inter alia poly-tunnels to protect crops against heavy rains, water collection and small-scale irrigation to 
cope with prolonged dry seasons, etc. – therefore contributing to strengthened resilience to climate-related events. 
 
Regarding coastal fisheries, this component, through the MGP, will provide the opportunity to strengthen the 
community based fisheries management program (CBFMP) that has been implemented since 1995. This could upgrade 
the CBFMP to assess potential development support for participating communities or look at income generating 
activities for local communities. Over 100 villages have joined the program. Other coastal fisheries areas may include 

effective management regimes for the sea cucumber fishery (hatchery production, grow out and possibly processing).  
Post-harvest and value adding for low value fish are key components as community undertakings. 
 
Component 3: Aims to help GoS strengthen management of the region’s long-line tuna fisheries while identifying 
opportunities for sustainably increasing domestic revenues from this shared resource. This component will allow 
Samoa to join the PROP and is proposed to be financed through the following IDA grant resources: US$ 3 million in 
national IDA and US$ 6 million in regional IDA. 
  
Towards this objective, the component will support GoS’ regional and national activities to:  

a. Strengthen its capacity to engage effectively in the Tokelau Arrangement, the Western and Central Pacific 

Fisheries Management Commission (WCPFC) and other regional forums;  

b. Strengthen capacity and establishment of a national observer program 

c. Invest in and implement robust Monitoring, Control and Surveillance (MCS), stock monitoring and fisheries 

management mechanisms and schemes. This includes upgrading Samoa’s Fisheries Information 

Management Systems and skills on MCS, carrying out joint regional patrol operations, boarding inspections, 

data collection, analysis and application; and combating Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing 

d. Develop and implement strategies to enhance the competitiveness of the domestic longline fleet and the 

oversight and value of oceanic fishing activities within their EEZ including enhancing transshipment and 

related services.     

 
Component 4: Contingency Emergency Response Component (Total Cost: US$0): Following an eligible crisis or 
emergency, the government of Samoa may request the Bank to re-allocate project funds to support emergency 
response and reconstruction. This component would draw from the uncommitted grant resources under the project 
from other project components to cover emergency response. These activities would be carried out, as needed to 
ensure continued achievement of the project development objective. This component will only be used in the event that 
an emergency response is required. 
 
    

  SAFEGUARDS 

 
A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 

 
The project would be implemented over a period of five years on Upolu and Savaii islands. Samoa is made up of nine 

islands with four main inhabited islands (Upolu,Savaii, Manono and Apolima) and has a total land area is 2,830 km2. The 
islands are of volcanic origin dominated by olivine basaltic rocks. The area is generally mountainous. 
  
Samoa has a population of approximately 197,000 people, of which 97% are Polynesian. The majority of people live on 

Upolu and Savaii. Settlements and agricultural activity on these islands are concentrated on the coastal plains and rolling 
slopes. 
 
Approximately 60,000 ha or 21% of the total land area is under crops or grazing regimes. Forest cover is approximately 

60%. Samoa’s 12 terrestrial national parks, reserves and community conservation areas are located on Upolu and Savaii. 


The country’s reef area is approximately 10,000 km2 and its exclusive economic zone is approximately 131000 km2. The 
main fishery landing sites in Samoa include Apia (Upolu), Salelologa (Savaii) and Apolima-uta (Upolu) with local 
subsistence landings scattered in coastal villages around inhabited islands . Samoa has three (3) protected marine areas 
(inshore). 
 
As for offshore fishery, Samoa’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is the smallest in the Pacific region and tuna longline 

fishery, particularly albacore, is the main offshore fishery. While tuna used to be the country’s largest export earner, 
recent years have seen a decline in the overall tuna catches, with a more than 50 percent reduction between 2009 and 
2013.  Transshipment operations by Taiwanese longliners began in Apia, Samoa in 2010. As of April 2012, there had been 
34 such operations, with 6 occurring in 2012.  Numerous smaller domestic longliners also transship in Samoa with the 
target market being the cannery in neighboring American Samoa. In 2014 Samoa signed onto the Tokelau Arrangement, a 
joint approach to managing the South Pacific Longline Fishery. 
 
B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 

 
The current World Bank financed Samoa Agriculture Competitiveness Enhancement Project (SACEP) has addressed 

safeguards' capacity constraints within MAF through a Coordination group (PCG) which includes an environmental and 
social (E&S) officer. For SAFPROM, E&S capacity within MAF is expected to be further strengthened with the 
establishment of a dedicated Agriculture Sector Coordination Division (ASCD) including a senior E&S specialist, to 
effectively coordinate and management agriculture sector activities, including environmental and social safeguards. This 
unit will be supported by a Centralized Technical Services and Support Unit (CTSSU) within the MOF which will also 
include an E&S Advisor. Her/his role will be to build capacity of E&S specialists within the line ministries, including the 
ASCD, and advise these teams on complex issues on an ad hoc basis.

D. Policies that might apply 

 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

The project would finance a number of small-scale, 
household-based farming (i.e. livestock development 
and crop development) and community fisheries 
production/marketing subprojects through a small 
grants scheme. Negative environmental and social 
impacts associated with these activities are expected 
to be minor, localized and temporary primarily 
because of their small-scale and 
household/community focus. 
 
The project would support the development and 
improvement of collective infrastructure and/or 
equipment (i.e. small veterinary laboratory, 
renovation of a local fish market or a fruits and 
vegetable pack-house). These small to medium-scale 
investments have the potential to cause some minor 
adverse environmental and social impacts however 
these are readily managed through standard 
mitigation measures. 
 
The project would finance the development and 
implementation of strategies to enhance the 
competitiveness of the domestic longline tuna fleet 
and the value of oceanic fishing activities within the 
Samoa’s EEZ including enhancing transshipment and 
related services.  
  
An Environmental and Social Management Framework 
(ESMF) is proposed as the safeguards instrument given 
that the specific locations of the investments are not 
known and these will be determined through the grant 
process. The ESMF will incorporate the requirements 
of the World Group’s Environmental, Health and 
Safety Guidelines (EHSGs) and industry specific 
guidelines for agribusiness, food production and 
pesticides management. 
 
The project also includes a Contingency Emergency 
Response Component to support emerency activities 
that ensure continued achievement of the project 
development objective. The ESMF will outline the 
approach and principles for managing potential E&S 
impacts and risks of the CERC including ascreening 
process in accordance with the World Bank’s Rapid 
Response to Crises and Emergencies: Procedural 
Guidelines. 

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 Yes 

For agriculture and livestock, the project will not 
finance any activities that significantly convert or 
degrade any protected areas or natural habitats as the 
screening procedures in the ESMF will exclude all 
subprojects with these impacts. 
The project will support enhanced management of 
coastal and ocean fisheries/ecosystems. While 
proposed activities are expected to enhance positive 
and sustainable returns to these important habitats, 
the ESMF will contain measures to properly manage 
the risk of any unforeseen adverse environmental 
impact on natural habitats, including critical natural 
habitats, as well as measures to enhance positive 
environmental impacts. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 Yes 

For agriculture (crops and livestock), the policy will not 
finance activities that impact on the health and quality 
of forests. 
For fisheries, the project may support marine 
ecosystem conservation activities (i.e. mangroves 
conservation). 
The ESMF will contain measures to properly manage 
the risk of any unforeseen adverse environmental 
impacts of these activities, as well as measures to 
enhance positive environmental impacts. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

The client will review and update the current SACEP 
Integrated Pest Management (IPM) following the 
standards and requirements set forth in OP4.09 and 
the World Group’s Environmental, Health and Safety 
Guidelines (EHSGs) for agribusiness and food 
production. The project will include measures to 
strengthen the institutional capacity for implementing 
IPM in project areas. This will include a stronger focus 
on health and safety. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 No 

The project will not finance any activities that will have 
impacts on physical cultural resources; screening and 
chance find procedures will be included in the ESMF to 
exclude all subprojects with these impacts. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 No 
The ethnic structure in Samoa is predominantly ethnic 
Samoan (92.6%) with a minority of Europeans and 
biracial European/Polynesian. 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

At present, no involuntary land acquisition is expected 
under the project. The majority of sub-projects will be 
undertaken on customary land with the voluntary 
participation of grants scheme recipient landowners. 
The only exception will be the siting of collective 
infrastructure facilities which will be either on 
Government-owned land or land secured via voluntary 
land donation. A Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) 
will be prepared to address these potential scenarios. 
In fishery, certain activities may involve the restriction 
of access to natural resources and/or marine 
protected areas which local people may depend upon 
for their livelihood. A Process Framework will be 
developed in compliance with OP4.12 requirements to 
address these potential issues.  

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 No 
The project will not finance any dams as defined under 
OP 4.37. 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

No 
The project does not impact or relate to any known 
international waterways as defined under the policy. 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No 
The project is not located in any known disputed areas 
as defined under the policy. 

 
E. Safeguard Preparation Plan  
 
Tentative target date for preparing the Appraisal Stage PID/ISDS 
 
Aug 15, 2018 
 
Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed. The specific studies and 
their timing should be specified in the Appraisal Stage PID/ISDS 
 
As soon as the GoS will access the Project preparation Facility, the recruitment of an E&S specialist and a consultant to 

develop both the ESMF and the PMP. It is therefore expected that the safeguards documents will be ready by mid-August 
to inform the Appraisal stage ISDS.

B.   Introduction and Context

Country Context
Over the past decade, Kosovo➢❨ s overall economic growth has been generally positive, 
averaging about 4-5 percent annually, driven mostly by massive donor-funded reconstruction 
efforts as well as remittances from its diaspora. The economy has demonstrated a considerable 
degree of resilience, with principal macro fiscal and financial indicators reflecting that the country 
has performed considerably better than any of its neighbors in the Western Balkans over the past 
decade. Kosovo is a potential EU candidate country and economic reforms are largely driven by 
the prospect of eventual EU accession. 
 
Despite the positive trend in growth and relatively stable and resilient economy, Kosovo remains 
one of the poorest countries in Europe. As of 2011, approximately 30 percent of its population of 
1.8 million lived below the national poverty line of ➢❪¬1.72 a day and about 10.2 percent were 
living in extreme poverty on less than ➢❪¬1.20 day. Unemployment is widespread, estimated at 
about 30 percent in 2013, the highest in South Eastern Europe. Unemployment among women is 
higher, estimated at 38.8 percent. Demographically, Kosovo is Europe➢❨ s youngest country, 
where the average age is estimated at 26 years.  Unemployment among the youth is especially 
high, estimated at 61.0 percent in 2014. 
 
The main driver of Kosovo➢❨ s economic growth has been consumption, fueled by remittances 
rather than income earned domestically. The steady consumption demand has been met mainly by 
imports given the country➢❨ s narrow, undiversified, and uncompetitive production base.  There 
is little export-orientation and imports remain large.  The current growth model based on large 
financial inflows is unsustainable and the main challenge for the country remains the 
establishment of conditions conducive to promoting self-sustained growth founded on increased 
domestic productivity and export competitiveness, within the framework of reducing high 
unemployment, improving human capital and building physical infrastructure. 
 
Kosovo➢❨ s location, EU membership prospects and free market access to the EU and Central 
European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) countries offer strong opportunities for sustained and 
rapid overall development. The government is committed to instituting reforms to promote 
sustainable economic development and is working to put in place the policies, institutions and 
investments that will help unleash the country➢❨ s growth and export potential. In this context, 
the National Development Strategy 2015-2020, adopted in January 2016, emphasizes four priority 
pillars: (a) human capital and employment; (b) good governance and rule of law; (c) competitive 
industries; and (d) infrastructure development.
Sectoral and institutional Context
Agriculture plays a significant role in Kosovo➢❨ s economy.  It is an important contributor to 
GDP, accounting for about 11.4 percent of GDP in 2014 (second only after wholesale and retail 
trade). Over 62 percent of the country➢❨ s population lives in rural areas and depends, directly or 
indirectly, on agriculture for its livelihood. The sector is the largest private employer, accounting 
for about 35 percent of total employment, although primarily on an informal basis.  Poverty in 
rural areas is especially high and over 40 percent of the rural population is unemployed. The lack 
of job perspective, especially among the rural young population is putting a strain on social 
cohesion and encouraging out-migration. Often, agriculture serves as a safety net for much of the 
population. 



Page 3 of 14

 
Despite a steady growth in the sector since independence, Kosovo is the largest importer of food 
per capita in Europe. The country is highly dependent on imports to meet its food demands and 
the export/import ratio has been steadily increasing over the past decade.  In 2011, the value of 
imports of agricultural products was approximately ➢❪¬561.4 million while the value of exports 
was ➢❪¬26.2 million. Exports of agricultural products thus generated revenues to pay for only 4.6 
per cent of the cost of importing such products. Agricultural products account for about 10 
percent of all imports; of this, 30 percent comprises food products. 
 
This is primarily because the sector faces several diverse and inter-related challenges that prevent 
it from meeting its productive potential and hinder commercialization. Before the 1990s, Kosovo 
was largely food self-sufficient with large quantities of agricultural products exported to the 
region. However, after the war, this trend was reversed so that today, agriculture is largely 
subsistent/semi-subsistent in nature. The sector is characterized by small, fragmented land 
holdings, with average land holding size ranging between 1.5 and 2.0 ha, often spread across an 
average of seven smaller plots. Lack of and/or limited access to, inter alia, modern technologies, 
good quality inputs, irrigation, post-harvest management and processing infrastructure, credit, and 
markets pose serious challenges to the development of the sector.  In its current state, agriculture 
attracts limited private investments which effectively inhibit commercialization of the sector and 
the realization of socio-economic gains thereof. 
 
Two areas that offer good opportunities for the development of Kosovo➢❨ s agricultural sector 
include the horticulture and livestock subsectors. Horticulture and livestock farming are 
traditional economic activities in Kosovo, representing a rural cultural identity and there is a 
strong preference among the farming communities to remain engaged in these subsectors for their 
livelihood. Over the past decade, demand for high value horticulture products has surged more 
than any other food category and there is a strong consumer preference for locally grown fruits 
and vegetables, both for fresh consumption and processing. Livestock farming is predominant in 
the mountainous and remote areas of Kosovo where it often serves as the primary source of rural 
livelihood. With increased productivity and production  there is good potential for: (i) promoting 
import substitution; (ii) boosting exports, especially to EU and CEFTA countries; (iii) generating 
employment in rural areas; (iv) creating economic opportunities for women in agriculture 
production and especially value-added processing activities; and (v) providing opportunities for 
young farmers to be gainfully employed in these remunerative value chains. 
 
To harness the potential of these subsectors, especially the horticulture subsector, there is a 
critical need for improving irrigation delivery and services. Rainfall patterns show high variability 
in Kosovo and there is a crucial need for supplementary irrigation, especially during drier spells. 
For fruits and vegetables, irrigation is essential for increasing yields and ensuring quality and 
timely production. It is expected that with irrigation small farmers would move to more high-
value crops and specialized markets, and away from near-subsistence agriculture. 
 
Ageing irrigation infrastructure and lack of maintenance are reducing the level of irrigation use 
and impacting development of agriculture.  Most of the irrigation schemes were built in the 1970s 
and are showing signs of ageing. Moreover, the war of the 1990s damaged or destroyed large 
sections of country➢❨ s irrigation infrastructure. This coupled with expansion of urban and 
industrial areas in recent years has sharply reduced actual irrigable area and jeopardized existing 
irrigation investments. The area equipped for irrigation fell from approximately 71,000 ha before 



Page 4 of 14

the war to approximately 43,900 ha in 2014.  The area of irrigation use is also far lower than in 
the past. Between 2006 and 2012, the average area irrigated was only about 12,000 ha - 4,000 ha 
in small schemes and 8,000 ha within the areas serviced by the country➢❨ s three regional 
irrigation companies in Kosovo: Iber-Lepenc, Radoniqi-Dukagjini and Drini i Bardhe. 
 
Recognizing the significant role of agriculture in Kosovo➢❨ s overall economic development, the 
government is undertaking critical measures to re-vitalize the sector. The objectives of the 
National Agricultural and Rural Development Plan (NARDP 2014-2020 are to undertake actions 
to overcome bottlenecks holding back sustainable rural development in the country and align 
Kosovo➢❨ s rural sector with the axes of the EU Instrument for Pre-accession for Rural 
Development (IPARD). The NARDP lays out several measures for implementation support over 
the next five years, including inter alia, investments in the physical assets of agricultural holdings 
as well as processing and marketing of agricultural and fishery products; agri-environmental 
measures and organic farming; farm diversification and business development; improvements in 
training, advisory services and vocational training; land consolidation; and  irrigation.  On the 
institutional front, the government is building the capacity of important institutional structures, 
such as the Managing Authority and Paying Agency, for improved performance of the agriculture 
sector as well as to approximate their functioning with EU requirements. These efforts are being 
carried out with assistance from several donors, including EU, DANIDA, Suisse Interco-
operation, USAID, Austrian Development Agency, GIZ and the World Bank (through the 
ongoing IDA-financed Agriculture and Rural Development Project).

C.  Proposed Development Objective(s)

Original Project Development Objective(s) - Parent
The development objective of the project is to assist the Recipient to promote competitiveness 
and growth in the livestock and horticulture sub-sectors over the next decade through 
implementation of selected measures of its agricultural strategy and institutionaldevelopment.

Proposed Project Development Objective(s) - Additional Financing
The development objective of the project is to improve productivity of and access to markets by 
project beneficiaries in the horticulture and livestock subsectors of Kosovo and strengthen 
institutional capacity of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Rural Development.

Key Results 
The PDO-level Results Indicators comprise the following: (i) increased yields of key crops 
supported by the project ➢❨  tons/ha; (ii) increased yields of milk production per animal on 
livestock farms supported by the project ➢❨  liters/cow; (iiiu) increased sale of milk to processing 
companies; (iv) increased sales of horticultural products from farmers supported by aggregators; 
(v) increased number of farmers adopting improved agricultural technologies; (vi) preparation of 
Rural Development Grant Program (RDGP) sub-measures for investment support in line with 
EU-IPARD Guidelines

D.  Project Description

The Additional Financing, a US$22.0 million IDA credit, to be implemented over four years, 
would support the following activities: 
 
Component 1: Transferring Knowledge to the Rural Sector.  The AF will continue support for the 



Page 5 of 14

following sub-components: (a) Rural Advisory Service (RAS) Contracts under which training 
would be provided to potential applicants for the Rural Development Grant Program (RDGP) as 
well as to municipal advisors to assist the farming community in the preparation of such grant 
proposals as well as to national extension staff on technical topics; (b) Regional Knowledge 
Exchange under which the project will support the organization of study tours/visits to countries 
in the region to enable farmers and processors in the horticulture and livestock subsectors to learn 
and benefit from the knowledge and experiences of other agri-food producers and processors in 
the region; and (c) Institutional Strengthening of Rural Advisory Services. The AF will continue 
to support the municipal advisory service centers in delivering effective services to the rural 
community through the provision of training, equipment and select operating costs. 
 
Component 2: Enhancing Investments to Promote Sustainable Rural Development. The AF will 
support the following activities: 
(a) Rural Development Grant Program (RDGP). RDGP support will be provided to farmers and 
processors in the livestock subsector.  As under KARDP, the RDGP will be implemented at the 
national level ➢❨  for potential beneficiaries in all municipalities of Kosovo.  The Call for 
Proposals would be open to all farmers and processors residing on the territory of Kosovo. 
Implementation of RDGP would follow the same processes and procedures as under the ongoing 
project, including extra points for women applicants and additional co-financing for beneficiaries 
(both men and women) under the age of 40 as well as for climate friendly agricultural practices.    
 
(b) Promoting Development of the Horticulture Subsector. The objective of this component is to 
promote the development of the horticulture subsector by strengthening backward and forward 
linkages in the value chain of the subsector. The aim is to improve productivity, quality, value 
addition, and ma rket linkages within the subsector to enhance its competitiveness towards 
increased exports and import substitution as well as job creation, improved beneficiary incomes 
and increased economic opportunities for women and youth in the rural sector.  It will target 
support to small holder farmers that dominate the rural landscape and provide them opportunities 
for assured markets and  improved livelihoods while assisting the commercial and semi-
commercial agro-enterprises to reach both domestic and export markets, create jobs and improve 
incomes.  
 
The entry point for project support will be the Aggregators, i.e. private Collection Centers (CCs) 
and Agro-processors, handling or procuring horticultural produce.  The project will provide 
matching grants to qualifying Aggregators, who will: (i) promote and strengthen backward 
integration strategies through the provision of supply contracts and extension services to small-
holder farmers, thereby guaranteeing farmers markets for their produce as well as enabling them 
to enhance their productivity while improving quality (including meeting Global GAP 
certification requirements); and (ii) exploit the value addition potential of the sector through 
improved postharvest management by increasing their capacity for handling and processing.  
Thus the project will enable Aggregators to increase the intake of fresh produce from farmers 
(upstream) and increase their supply of fresh produce and processed products to domestic and 
export markets (downstream).  By introducing upgrades in the value chain - quality checks, 
packaging, labeling, etc, the project will reorient firms towards more lucrative export markets. 
 
Potential aggregators will be invited to prepare business plans and submit applications to enhance 
and expand their operations.  Funding for selected subprojects would be allocated through a 
competitive bidding process. The maximum size of the grant would be Ã¢➢❨ Â¬200,000.  The 



Page 6 of 14

submitted business plans will be reviewed, evaluated and scored against clearly defined criteria 
by an independent Evaluation Committee. Eligibility criteria and detailed arrangements for 
implementation of the matching grants will be elaborated in the Horticulture Development Grant 
Manual. 
 
(s) Institutional Capacity Building. The AF will continue to support capacity building of the 
Managing Authority and Paying Agency through the provision of training, personnel and 
equipment as needed. Project support will assist in approximating their functioning to EU 
requirements and contribute to their efforts towards EU accreditation.   The project will also 
support capacity building within the Kosovo Institute of Agriculture (KIA) to enhance its ability 
to promote food safety and quality standards in the livestock and horticulture subsectors of 
Kosovo through the provision of select equipment to strengthen capacity of the food testing 
laboratory. 
 
Component 3: Support for Irrigation. The AF would support rehabilitation works in the Radoniqi-
Dukagjini Irrigation Scheme, located in an area of high agricultural productivity.  Horticulture is 
the dominant economic activity in the region and with improved irrigation delivery and services 
there is a high likelihood of improved productivity of high value crops. Specific rehabilitation 
investments in the scheme will focus on, inter alia, lining and repair of main canal sections, 
replacement of moving parts; pipes, where necessary, aqueduct crossing on the Drini river, and 
the restoration of irrigation delivery in two blocks, namely the Janosh scheme in the upstream part 
of the system; as well as the Doblibare scheme which is currently dysfunctional. Minor dam 
safety actions (non-structural), as identified by the dam safety assessments, will be supported as 
well. Modernization will include selective automation of scheme monitoring to increase water and 
energy use efficiency. A technical study is underway to further specify the technical requirements 
and prepare bidding documents for scheme construction works as well as identify equipment and 
spare part requirements. 
 
In providing rehabilitation support to the scheme, the project will take a broader modernization 
approach and integrate managerial upgrading with the technical rehabilitation to improve both 
resource utilization and water delivery service to users, optimizing resource utilization and 
ensuring institutional and financial sustainability. This includes the support for a Management 
Information System, SCADA for improved operations, support for maintaining a strategic supply 
of spare parts and maintenance equipment; harmonization of planning and budgeting with 
municipal plans as well as water users➢❨  demands. 
 
Component 4: Project Management, Coordination, Monitoring and Evaluation. The existing 
Project Implementation Unit (PIU) within MAFRD will be responsible for the daily management, 
administration and coordination of the project's activities in accordance with Bank requirements, 
including procurement, financial management, monitoring and evaluation, and audits.  Its 
capacity would be enhanced through the hiring of an irrigation specialist who will be responsible 
for the implementation of the irrigation activity as well as additional short-term technical 
specialists as needed.

II. Implementation
Institutional and Implementation Arrangements
The project will be implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Rural Development 
(MAFRD).  A dedicated Project Implementation Unit, headed by the General Secretary, has been 
established under the ongoing KARDP for overall management of the project, including the fiduciary 
(procurement, financial management), monitoring, evaluation, training and administration 
requirements as well as coordination with donors and other government units.  The Rural 
Development Grant Program (RDGP) will be implemented by the Managing Authority (MA) and 
Paying Agency (PA). The  MA is responsible for identifying the measures for support under the 
RDGP and prepares the procedures for implementation of the selected RDGP sub-measures.  
Towards this, it establishes Working Groups with representation from the private sector and civil 
society.  The PA is in charge of administering the RDGP, including the selection, awarding, 
monitoring and disbursement processes for the sub-projects.

III. Safeguard Policies that might apply

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional)
Environmental 
Assessment OP/BP 
4.01

Yes Potential environmental impacts are anticipated under 
Component 2: Enhancing Investments to Promote Sustainable 
Rural Development and Component 3: Support for Irrigation. 
The major portion of Component 2 remains the provision of 



Page 8 of 14

grants which were also administered under the original project. 
The grants were awarded based on a screening criteria set forth 
in the ESMF prepared for the project in October 2010 and 
subsequently revised in 2015. This revision solely dealt with 
changes in the Kosovo environmental legislation and did not in 
any form alter the overall screening procedure within the 
ESMF. The screening criteria as set forth in the ESMF helps to 
screen out project activities corresponding to a category A, and 
to provide adequate due diligence on a case-by-case basis for 
the rural grants. The ESMF had undergone a slight revision in 
January 2017, where the irrigation activities have also been 
added in the project description and small changes were made 
to ensure that all activities even beyond grants are covered 
through the process in the ESMF. The screening and due 
diligence mechanisms remain the same as within the original 
ESMF from 2010.  
The approach outlined in the ESMF from January 2017 will 
apply to the rural grants, matching grants, irrigation rehab and 
any activity that would be proposed to be financed within the 
project or the subsequent AFs. Furthermore, any strategic and 
planning documents to be produced under Component 3(b) 
will also incorporate adequate safeguards requirements within 
the Terms of Reference for any proposed study or plan.  
The environmental impacts associated with the grants program 
and irrigation rehab should be readily mitigated through sound 
construction practices (dust and noise, waste management, 
material sourcing) while the operational impacts can be 
mitigated through environmentally friendly farming 
approaches (manure management, waste disposal, emissions 
from food processing facilities, improved water resource use).  
Under Component 3, rehabilitation of the Radoniqi irrigation 
scheme is foreseen which would lead to better management of 
water resources. This activity will potentially cause minor 
construction related impacts (noise, dust, waste generation).   
A full and robust ESMP will be prepared to address risks and 
impacts of implementation of this scheme, including assessing 
impacts to other water users. 
➢❨❫

Natural Habitats OP/
BP 4.04

No There are no implications on natural habitats foreseen.

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No There are no implications on forested areas foreseen.
Pest Management OP 
4.09

Yes Due to the fact that the project would more than likely lead to 
increased agricultural production, it is safe to assume that there 
would be an increased need for pest management. As such, an 
Integrated Pest Management Plan was part of the original 
ESMF (2010) andalso the revised ESMF (2015 and 2017).

Physical Cultural 
Resources OP/BP 
4.11

No There are no activities involving physical / cultural resources 
foreseen.

Indigenous Peoples 
OP/BP 4.10

No There are no implications for indigenous people.

Involuntary 
Resettlement OP/BP 
4.12

No This safeguards will not be triggered because the potential 
works proposed for the scheme rehabilitation are as follows: 
 
(i) Lining and repair of main canal sections, replacement 
of parts such as valves, etc.   
(ii) rehabilitation of of irrigation delivery in two secondary 
sub-schemes  
(iii) minor works related to dam safety and the Drini river 
aqueduct 
 
Given the nature of rehabilitation works, there will be no need 
for land take although there might be some crop damages for a 
temporary period of time while the works are ongoing. The 
protocol defined in the ESMF addresses the crop damage 
compensation which will be operationalized with concrete 
ESMPs .

Safety of Dams OP/
BP 4.37

Yes Although the project will not build any dams, the Radoniqi 
Irrigation scheme depends upon the existing Radoniqi Dam for 
its effective functioning as the scheme draws its raw water 
directly from the Radoniqi reservoir controlled by a 61 meter 
high clay-core embankment dam. Several  Dam Safety 
Assessments have been carried out in the recent past for 
Radoniqi Dam, including in 2000, 2002, and 2006 under the 
WB supported Pilot Water Supply Project, and most recently 
in 2012 by the Water Task Force as part of a countrywide Dam 
Safety Review. While none of these reviews raise any concerns 
on imminent dam safety they make recommendations for 
operation and maintenance procedures and safety-related 
measures that are required to ensure an acceptable standard of 
safety. More precisely, this includes the need for critical 
documentation and information on dam safety, including 
geotechnical information, an update on and improvement of 
status of control instruments (inclinometers and piezometers 
are reported as largely dysfunctional) and electrical 
installations. Also, it is observed that there is no dam safety 
(monitoring) plan, although a letter from the dam operator 
states that geodetic measurements have been carried out to 
some extent over the past years. Most of the recommendations 
have not been fully implemented since. The project proposes to 
adopt a composite of the 2005 and 2012 recommendations, to 
be confirmed by a dam safety panel to be established, and to 



Page 10 of 14

finance those under the project. The following activities are 
envisaged to be included under the program: updated safety 
analysis, including full geodetic survey, rehabilitation of dam 
safety instrumentation and an emergency preparedness plan.

Projects on 
International 
Waterways OP/BP 
7.50

Yes Component 3 includes works on rehabilitation of the Radoniqi 
irrigation scheme, which is part of the trans-boundary Drini 
river basin. However, considering that the works will focus on 
better use and management of the existing irrigation scheme 
the team does not foresee any issues on water quality or 
quantity to downstream users. As such, an Exception to 
Notification was granted on December 16, 2016 by ECA VP.

Projects in Disputed 
Areas OP/BP 7.60

No The project will not be implemented in any disputed areas.

IV. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify 

and describe any potential large scale,  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
Potential environmental impacts are anticipated under Component 2: Enhancing Investments to 
Promote Sustainable Rural Development and Component 3: Support for Irrigation. The major 
portion of Component 2 remains the provision of grants which were also administered under the 
original project.  The grants were awarded based on a screening criteria set forth in the ESMF 
prepared for the project in October 2010 and subsequently revised in 2015. This revision solely 
dealt with changes in the Kosovo environmental legislation and did not in any form alter the 
overall screening procedure within the ESMF. The screening criteria as set forth in the ESMF 
helps to screen out project activities corresponding to a category A, and to provide adequate due 
diligence on a case-by-case basis for the rural grants. The ESMF had undergone a slight revision 
in January 2017, where the irrigation activities have also been added in the project description and 
small changes were made to ensure that all activities even beyond grants are covered through the 
process in the ESMF. The screening and due diligence mechanisms remain the same as within the 
original ESMF from 2010.  
The approach outlined in the ESMF from January 2017 will apply to the rural grants, matching 
grants, irrigation rehab and any activity that would be proposed to be financed within the project 
or the subsequent AFs. Furthermore, any strategic and planning documents to be produced under 
Component 3(b) will also incorporate adequate safeguards requirements within the Terms of 
Reference for any proposed study or plan.  
The environmental impacts associated with the grants program and irrigation rehab should be 
readily mitigated through sound construction practices (dust and noise, waste management, 
material sourcing) while the operational impacts can be mitigated through environmentally 
friendly farming approaches (manure management, waste disposal, emissions from food 
processing facilities, improved water resource use).  
Under Component 3 rehabilitation of the Radoniqi irrigation scheme is foreseen which would lead 
to better management of water resources. This activity will potentially cause minor construction 
related impacts already described above that can be mitigated through a site-specific ESMP, while 
additional concerns include dam safety issues and also the potential for impacts on international 
waterways as the reservoir and the scheme are located within the Drini river basin. 
The overall project would lead to an increase in agricultural practices therefore having 



Page 11 of 14

implications on pest management, which should apply and follow the Integrated Pest Management 
Plan as prepared under the original ESMF.  There are no social safeguard related issues. The 
works proposed are rehabilitation of existing schemes. Rehabilitation of lining of open main canal 
and secondary pressurized (piped) schemes where necessary in two sections. There will be no need 
for neither land take nor establishment of right of way. Crop damages because of the rehabilitation 
works will be addressed in ESMFS and related ESMPS 
The Terms of Reference for Component 3(b): Strategy and Investment Framework for the 
Irrigation Sector, will incorporate safeguards requirements to ensure that there is due diligence of 
all potential safeguards aspects under the propsoed Strategy/Investment Framework.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities 
in the project area:
There are no long term or indirect impacts associated with the project, beyond the potential 
increase in agricultural production and therefore implications on pest management, where the  
Integrated Pest Management Plan as prepared under the original ESMF should apply.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse 
impacts.
There are no project alternatives considered. The screening mechanism for the grants would allow 
to either accept or deny a sub-project based on their associated impacts.

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
The Borrower has applied the ESMF screening in the later grant calls, while some issues remained 
in the first call and the due diligence was carried out by an independent consultant retroactively. 
The borrower has also provided educational trainings and seminars on ESMF compliance and 
sound environmental practices in 2014. The Borrower has a dedicated M&E staff that also 
provides support to the implementation of the ESMF, and as required can hire an external 
consultant to be engaged in the implementation of the ESMF policies. The site-specific ESMP for 
the Radoniqi irrigation scheme will more than likely be carried out by a company or consultant 
outside the Borrower's team and will try to streamline the WB requirements and those of the 
Kosovo environmental legislation into one process. As for the grants, one of the requirements is 
that no grant is awarded without the environmental and social due diligence in place. This 
requirement is strictly supervised by all of the PIU and also by the World Bank team.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure 
on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The key stakeholders include representatives of the Project Implementation Unit and the MAFRD, 
as well as the members of the local communities where projects will take place. As such, the 
ESMF was subject to public consultations and disclosure in 2010 (as documented in the original 
ESMF) while each of the subsequent ESMPs prepared for each specific project was subject to 
disclosure and public consultations. For small scale projects public consultations were replaced by 
consent forms signed by all of the neighbors. The revised ESMF (as of January 2017) will be 
disclosed through the MAFRD website and Bank's Infoshop prior to the Appraisal of the AF.

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 

 
1. Lao PDR has achieved good progress in economic growth and poverty reduction over the past decade. Average 
growth of the gross domestic product (GDP) in the past decade was around 8 percent per annum. Poverty declined from 
41.4 percent in 2002/03 to 28.8 percent in 2012/13. With a GDP per capita of around US$1,600 in 2014, Lao PDR has 
become a lower-middle income country.  
 
2. Despite impressive macroeconomic achievements, poverty still remains high, especially in rural areas and 
among ethnic groups. Over 80 percent of the poor are concentrated in rural areas. About 40 percent of Mon Khmer and 
Hmong ethnic groups are poor, compared to 15 percent of Lao-Tai people, and ethnic groups account for about two thirds 
of people having no access to formal education. Stunting is also pronounced among ethnic groups.   
 
3. In many rural areas of the country, a high prevalence of food insecurity and malnutrition is still a major problem. 
Rice shortage often takes place for about 3-4 months per year. Prevalent farming systems are largely subsistent and 
generally lack diversification. Although the country is able to achieve self-sufficiency in rice at the national level in the 
normal year, there are still challenges in addressing food security due to the instability of annual production resulted from 
poor farming practices, ineffective water management, and frequent natural disasters (i.e. floods and droughts). 
 

Sectoral and Institutional Context 
 
4. Agriculture is an important sector in Lao PDR, but it is currently underperforming. The sector employs two-thirds 
of the country’s labor force, but generates only 22 percent of the GDP. In the last decade, agricultural growth averaged 
3.7 percent, which is less than half of the overall GDP growth. Agricultural farming is largely subsistent, producing one 
crop a year, mainly paddy with low productivity. Currently, irrigated agricultural land accounts for less than 15 percent of 
cultivated land and the remaining 85 percent is rain-fed. Recently, there have been emerging signs of agricultural 
commercialization and diversification (i.e. crop rotation or aquaculture with rice cultivation in low land areas; commercial 
production of maize in Xayabury province, and vegetables in Vientiane province). In the bigger context, however, these 
developments are still relatively scattered and small. 
 
5. Lao PDR’s agriculture sector is constrained by subsistent farming and small scale production with low level of 
commercialization, limited processing capacity, underdeveloped supporting infrastructure, and weak public services. 
Value chains of rice, maize, and vegetables are currently underdeveloped. There are good opportunities and potentials 
for improving their performance substantially through improving farm productivity and enhancing value chains. While the 
former could be realized by adopting quality seed/ farm inputs, improved farming technologies, upgrades of irrigation and 
improved water management, improved extension services/applied research, enhanced farming mechanization, 
improved harvest/postharvest facilities, and better farming diversification/crop rotation, the latter could be achieved by 
improved regulatory framework to facilitate trade and monitor quality standards, market analysis/research, 
transportation/ logistics, strategic support to agribusinesses, contract farming, and product branding and marketing. The 
recently completed project “Engaging the Private Sector to Develop the Lao Rice Industry” (EMRIP) demonstrated the 
readiness of the growing number of rice mills to modernize their facilities, engage in contract farming and develop 
marketing strategies.  

 
6. There are concerns related to the quality and sustainability of agricultural growth. Rice is the most important 
crop in the agriculture sector of Lao PDR. Rice production dominates agricultural land use, occupying nearly 56 percent of 


the total harvested area of all crops. More than 80 percent of the Lao rice crop consists of various types of glutinous rice. 
Maize, which constitutes about 12 percent of the harvested area, is the next most important crop. No other single crop or 
category of crops takes up more than around 5 percent of the cultivated land. In terms of the tonnage of crops produced 
at the national level, rice represents 81 percent of total weight of crops produced. Lack of diversification and heavily 
reliance on rice while there is an increasingly fierce competition in global rice markets are the key challenges to 
competiveness and sustainability of the agricultural growth of Lao PDR in the future. 
 
7. Addressing the risks and shortcomings of the sector will require re-organization of agricultural production and 
greater commercialization to support strategic value chains. According to the findings of the Project Identification 
Mission jointly carried out by Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) and the World Bank in November 2016, three 
strategic value chains were identified, which include: (i) rice value chains in the selected low land provinces; (ii) maize 
value chains in Xayabury province; and (iii) vegetables value chains in Vientiane province and possibly Vientiane Capital. 
These value chains are currently operating far below their potentials due to: (1) weak agriculture knowledge and 
information system (i.e. weak research and extension and private sector linkages, inadequate/weak delivery of extension 
and training services, use of poor quality seeds, lack of agricultural diversification); (2) poor production infrastructure (i.e. 
lack/degraded irrigation canals, poor maintenance of irrigation infrastructure, poor feeder roads to facilitate in-scheme 
mechanization); (3) inadequate mechanization facilities and equipment (i.e. lack of mechanization for harvesting and post-
harvest drying and processing, lack of  equipment and facilities for quality testing and storage); (4) lack of access to finance 
(i.e. underdeveloped banking sector, low capacity of rice mills to prepare business plans and secure loans); (5) inadequate 
enabling environment (i.e. constraints to new business entry/ business licensing, quality control and certification, public 
services to promote trade); and (6) insecure agricultural land tenure (i.e. risks of conversion of agricultural land to other 
uses, reduced incentives to invest and manage land by farmers). These constraints not only result in low farm productivity 
but also are generic causes for the poor performance of the agriculture sector and slow process of agricultural 
commercialization. 

 
8. The Government has recognized the need to promote a substantial shift in the agriculture sector from 
subsistent farming to sustainable commercial agriculture following cluster development and value chain approaches. 
On November 18, 2016, the Government through Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) sent an Official Letter to the 
World Bank requesting the support on agricultural commercialization in order to improve the sector’s performance 
especially along the rice value chains. Yet, there is also an increasing attention of the Government to other crops such a 
maize, horticulture, beans and pulses, and aquaculture, to increase diversification and farm incomes, as well as to improve 
food security and reduce malnutrition. 
 

Relationship to CPF 
 

9. The proposed project is aligned with the National Agriculture Sector Plan to 2020 and Strategy to 2025, in which 
improving the commercialization and competiveness of the agriculture sector are the top priorities. The proposed 
project also supports several objectives of the Eighth National Socio-Economic Development Plan (NSEDP), namely 
Outcome 2.2 “Food security ensured and incidence of malnutrition reduced” and Outcome 3.3 “Reducing the instability 
of agricultural production caused by impacts of natural disasters.”  
 
10. The proposed project is consistent with the Systematic Country Diagnostic (2016), which placed an increase in 
agricultural productivity to support incomes among the top priorities to reduce poverty and boost shared prosperity in 
Lao PDR, and with the Country Partnership Framework (CPF) 2017-2021. It contributes to achieving its Objective 1.2 
“Making it easier to do business and create jobs” under the Focus Area 1 “Supporting Inclusive Growth” and Objective 2.1 
“Reducing the prevalence of malnutrition” under the Focus Area 2 “Investing in People.”     


 
11. The proposed project is closely aligned with the twin goals of ending extreme poverty and boosting shared 
prosperity and with the global Sustainable Development Goals, including Zero Hunger (Goal 2) and Climate Action (Goal 
13).   The project would directly provide benefits to local farmers in four provinces, namely Xayabury (those associated 
with maize value chains), Vientiane Province (vegetables value chains), and Bolykhamxay and Khammouane Provinces and 
Vientiane Capital (rice value chains). Most farmers in these provinces are practicing subsistent agriculture with low/ 
unstable productivity and low incomes. Generally speaking, rural farmers among poor groups in Lao PDR and some of 
them are living under extreme poverty. 
 
C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  
 

12. The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to increase commercialization of selected value chains in the project 
areas. 
 
Key Results (From PCN) 

 
13. The proposed PDO-level results indicators are:  
 

(i) Number of project beneficiaries (men and women; core indicator);  

(ii) An increase in productivity from those farmers adopting new technologies; 

(iii) An increase in the sale volumes (percentage) from those farmers adopting new technologies; 

(iv) An increase in the quality of the produce sold to agribusinesses through production alliances. 
 
D. Concept Description 

 
14. The proposed Agriculture Commercialization Project (ACP) seeks to enhance the competitiveness and 
sustainability of Lao PDR’s agriculture sector through technical and financial support to increase in agricultural productivity 
and commercialization in selected strategic value chains. The project would focus on: (i) the geographical areas with high 
agricultural development potentials; (ii) the farming systems with high potentials for commercialization (i.e. paddy, maize, 
vegetables); (iii) promotion of good agricultural practices and climate smart agricultural technologies and farming system 
diversification to enhance food and nutritional security; (iv) building capacity for farmers’ organisations, agribusinesses, 
public and private service providers; and (v) building on and developing synergies with other government/donor programs.  
 
15. Proposed project areas: In line with the above strategy, the project would select Provinces and Districts with: (i) 
high potentials for agricultural production (farm land and production volume); (ii) high potentials for commercialization 
and value chain development; (iii) availability of basic public infrastructure (i.e. irrigation, roads,  etc.); (iv) public services 
in place to support commercialization and diversification; and (v) availability of agribusinesses interested in inclusive value 
chain development. The list of target provinces is provisionally set as Vientiane capital, Vientiane province, Bolikhamxay, 
Khammouane, and Xayabury. The Provinces will be confirmed and districts will be identified before pre-appraisal mission. 
Three selected value chains could be initially selected for project preparation purposes – namely high value commercial 
rice (not subsistence), maize, and vegetables -- while allowing flexibility to add other, high-value crops during the life of 
the project. 

 
16. It is envisage that the Project would have three components: (A) Enhancing Productivity of Farming Systems; (B) 
Support for Improved Value Chains; and (C) Project Management. 

17. Component A: Enhancing Productivity of Farming Systems: This component would aim at enhancing productivity 
of farming systems and it would include the following activities:  

 
(i) Production organization and promotion of the use of good quality seeds;  
(ii) Research and extension to improve farming practices and farm machinery to promote good and 

sustainable agricultural production, diversification and commercialization;  

(iii) Upgrades of existing irrigation infrastructure and improvement of water management practices; 

(iv) Establishment and capacity building for farmer groups and their members; and  

(v) Mapping, demarcation, and registration of irrigation land/systems in the project area on a block basis (not 
for individual plots).  

 
18. Component B: Strengthening Agricultural Value Chains. This component would aim at strengthening and 
leveraging private sector investments in selected food value chains, and it would include the following activities:  
 

(i) Provision of matching grants to farmer groups and their members to promote investments in harvesting 
machines, drying and storage facilities to reduce pre/postharvest losses; 

(ii) Provision of matching grants and capacity building assistance to agribusinesses to strengthen their role in 
driving the value chain development; 

(iii) Upgrades of feeder access to production areas and farms;  

(iv) Training and consulting support to farmer groups and their members to build their management skills, 
business development and marketing of farm produce through adopting contract farming, value addition 
and product branding;  

(v) Support MAF, Ministry of Industry and Commerce (MOIC), their research institutes and technical agencies 
in conducting relevant market research, agricultural policy analyses, and improving intelligence and 
management skills; and  

(vi) Improving the enabling environment through strengthening capacity for quality control and standards 
certification (i.e. seeds, produce, mills, etc.) including improved inspection services, test kits and 
laboratory capacity to certify for clean and safe foods. 

 
19. Component C: Project Management. This component would provide equipment and incremental operating costs 
for project monitoring, financial management, and procurement activities, ensure compliance with the safeguards, 
support the short and long-term technical assistance to the project management team in selected areas, and support 
analysis and dissemination of findings related to the effectiveness and challenges associated with the different 
institutional and technical models being applied or piloted under the project.  
 
20. The project would establish and support linkages with ongoing and future interventions by other donors including 
ADB, IFC, NGOs, and government projects/programs. For instance, farmer groups and agribusinesses which received 
previous supports from the Netherlands Development Organization SNV’s Enhancing Milled Rice Production in Lao PDR 
(EMRIP) will be eligible for further support from this project in order to be more effective and efficient. The farmer groups 
and agribusinesses participating in this project would be well positioned to graduate and become potential clients of IFC 
in the future. This proposed project would seek to create complementary and enhance synergy of existing 
projects/programs in the areas. 


  SAFEGUARDS 

 
A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 

 
The list of target provinces is provisionally set as Vientiane capital, Vientiane province, Bolikhamxay, Khammouane, and 

Xayabury. The Provinces will be confirmed and districts within identified before pre-appraisal mission.   
 
Component A (Enhancing Productivity of Farming Systems) would include production promotion of the use of good 

quality seeds, research and extension to improve farming practices and farm machinery to promote sustainable 
agricultural production, diversification and commercialization, upgrades of existing irrigation infrastructure and 
improvement of water management practices. Component B (Support for Improved Value Chains) would strengthen and 
leverage private sector investments in selected food chains. Component (Project Management) would support project 
management including monitoring and evaluation, financial management and procurement to ensure compliance with 
the fiduciary safeguards requirements. 
 
The project’s overall impacts are expected to be positive. Some negative impacts are envisaged to be limited, localized, 

manageable and reversible. It is anticipated that the following World Bank safeguard policies will be triggered: 
Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01), Pest Management (OP 4.09), Indigenous Peoples (OP/BP 4.10), Involuntary 
Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12), Safety of Dams (OP/BP 4.37), and International Water Ways (for irrigation rehabilitation). At 
present, there is insufficient information to determined if Natural Habitats (OP/BP 4.04) and Physical Culture Resources 
(OP/BP 4.11) are triggered, hence it is classed as TBD. Mapping, demarcation, and registration of irrigation land/systems 
are not expected to cause changes in land use types and land ownership as they will be carried out a block basis (not for 
individual plots). Forced child labor and labor influx are not anticipated from the project. The project would comply with 
the three gender tags proposed by the World Bank Standards. This is to ensure that the project will address gender in 
terms of (i) analysis; (ii) action; and (iii) monitoring and evaluation framework. During project preparation, the project will 
develop specific/tailored measures to enhance equal access/opportunities for women to benefit from the matching 
grants and other project activities. 
 

 
B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 

 
The project will be executed though the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) with its provincial and district offices 

(PAFOS and DAFOs) in collaboration with Provincial Industry and Commerce Offices (PICOs) to be responsible for actual 
implementation of day-to-day activities. The capacity of MAF is assessed to be adequate as they had extensive experience 
in managing and implementing donor-funding projects, including those from the WBG namely Agriculture Development 
Project (ADP), 2004-2008, Rice Productivity Improvement Project (RPIP), 2009-2012 and Lao Upland Food Security 
Improvement Project (LUFSIP), 2010-2014. Some of PAFOs and DAFO staff had have previous experience with the World 
Bank-financed projects but some are new especially to safeguard policies. To mitigate residual risks, technical assistance 
will be recruited and in place to provide specific technical capacity for the implementing agencies involved in safeguard 
preparation and implementation. A staff from MAF and each of PAFOs and DAFOs will be appointed as focal points for 
safeguards. These safeguard focal staff will be responsible for impact assessment, consultation, and preparation of 
safeguard instruments, implementation and compliance monitoring and reporting with technical support from the 
consultants. Safeguard training and assistance will be also provided by the Bank safeguard specialists and the National 

University of Laos which delivers a safeguard training program supported through the ongoing Bank-financed Lao 
Environmental and Social Project II (LENSII). 
 
C. Environmental and Social Safeguards Specialists on the Team 

 
 

 
D. Policies that might apply 

 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

The project will finance irrigation and drainage 
refurbishment and upgrades and water management 
practices. Investments in harvested machines and 
storage and training, and equipment provision.  
 
The envisaged investments are typical to similar 
agriculture development projects and are not 
expected to have adverse and unprecedented 
environmental and social impacts. Implementation of 
irrigation and drainage infrastructure and land 
improvements investments on farmer fields under 
Component 1 are mainly rehabilitation by their nature 
and not expected to have significant negative 
environment and social impacts.  
 
Given that the scope and targets of the project are still 
to be determined during the project preparation, an 
Environmental and Social Management Framework 
(ESMF) will be developed and applied by the project. 
ESMF will provide policy provisions, principles and 
process to address the environmental and social 
impacts. The policy framework will describe 
procedures for impact assessment, consultation, 
preparation of subsequent safeguard instruments and 
implementation arrangement. 

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 TBD 

It is expected that the project is only limited to areas 
of land already utilized for agriculture. NH will not 
likely be triggered as it is not anticipated at this stage. 
The project will have a ‘chance finds’ mechanism built 
into the ESMF to address the potential issues on NH. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No 

Forestry is not triggered as it is envisage that no 
project activities will take place on forest areas. The 
project would apply a screening process to eliminate 
subprojects which will impact on forests or involve 
forests in the early planning stage. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

The project will develop a Pest Management Plan in 
line with Lao legal regulations and World Bank Policies 
on pesticide uses. A negative list of chemicals will form 
be included. The Pest Management Plan will be the 
part of the ESMF. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 TBD 

The project may impact on physical cultural resources 
although it is expected to be limited to areas of land 
already utilized for agriculture. The project will have a 
‘chance finds’ mechanism built into the ESMF to 
address the potential issues on PCR. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 Yes 

Target beneficiaries and project areas will be identified 
during project preparation. It is likely that the project 
will operate in areas where there is a presence of 
ethnic groups, belonging to Mon-Khmer and Hmong- 
Hmong – lu Mien ethno-linguistic families, that meet 
the four characteristics specified as defining criteria 
for indigenous people in the World Bank Policy on 
Indigenous Peoples (OP/BP4.10). The project would 
conduct a Social Assessment to inform the preparation 
of the Ethnic Group Policy Framework (EGPF) to 
ensure that free, prior and informed consultations 
would be conducted with affected ethnic groups 
leading to their broad community support, and that 
they receive project benefits in a culturally 
appropriate manner. The EGPF will be prepared as a 
standalone document in line with OP 4.10 
requirements, and will be finalized before the project 
appraisal. 
 
Due attention will be given to ensure that ethnic 
groups do not suffer adverse impacts and that they 
receive culturally compatible social and economic 
benefits. Necessary steps and procedures will be 
included to ensure that the cultures of the multi-
ethnic society are respected and that gender 
dimension are integrated at all levels and cycles of 
project implementation. A feedback and grievance 
resolution mechanism will be developed and applied 
under the project to provide affected ethnic groups a 
legitimate platform for monitoring and reporting on 
the safeguard policy compliance as well as on project 
implementation. 
 
The project will provide training to its staff, 
consultants and their partners on the EGPF to ensure 
that they are aware of and able to comply the policy 

requirements. Details of due diligence procedures will 
be described in the EGPF. 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

Under Component A of the project: Enhancing 
Productivity of Farming Systems aiming at enhancing 
productivity of farming systems, minor land 
acquisition are envisaged from the rehabilitation of 
existing irrigation schemes. The civil works may 
involve expansion of intake, local reservoirs and 
irrigation canals.  These potential impacts can be 
avoided or minimized through proper design, impact 
assessment, consultation and application of mitigation 
measures. Given that the irrigation subprojects and 
areas to be covered are still unknown and to be 
identified during the project preparation, a 
Compensation and Resettlement Policy Framework 
(CRPF) will be developed and applied by the project 
which is in compliance with OP/BP 4.12 requirements.  
The CRPF will complement the EGPF and ESMF, 
especially in terms of implementation arrangements.  
If land or asset loss are unavoidable, the principles and 
procedures described in the RPF will be applied to 
address negative impacts.  Project staff, consultants 
and its partners will be provided with training and 
support to enable them to comply the policy 
requirements. 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 Yes 

Although the project does not plan to include 
construction/rehabilitation of dams, it may include 
small scale irrigations which use or rely on dams. The 
project will prepare safeguard documents to comply 
with OP/BP 4.37 requirements. 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

Yes 

The policy is triggered as the proposed project 
investments are located in areas that are part of the 
Mekong River Basin. However, the project targets 
rehabilitation and improvements of existing irrigation 
systems and the rehabilitation works will not involve 
any adverse impacts on the quality and quantity of 
waters in the Mekong River. The team will prepare for 
a notification process for downstream riparian nation 
states. 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No The project will not be active in disputed areas. 

 
E. Safeguard Preparation Plan  
 
Tentative target date for preparing the Appraisal Stage PID/ISDS

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 
 

Moldova is a landlocked country between Romania to the west and Ukraine to the north, east and south; the country 

has a surface area of 33,840 km2, and is home to 3.6 million people. Moldova’s rich soils and mild climate are ideal 

for farming, and agriculture has traditionally been a key sector in Moldova’s economic structure. The sector 

represented about 13 percent of Moldova GDP in 2014 with a value of about 14.5 billion MDL (about US$1.05 

billion). Agriculture employs nearly a third (28 percent) of the country’s population, and agro-food exports account for 

roughly 50 percent of the country’s total exports. In spite of its large size and significant contribution to the economy, 

the average agricultural sector growth rate performance has been low at 3.6 percent per annum over the last 10 years, 

mainly due to the sector’s vulnerability to the weather. 


In the context of overall economic growth, Moldova has made significant progress in reducing poverty and boosting 

shared prosperity. The economy was growing at 5 percent annually after 2000, and the national poverty rate (below $5 

per day) dropped from 68 to 11.4 percent between 2000 and 2014. Public and private transfers, namely pensions and 

remittances, as well as labor markets had an important role in reducing poverty. The Moldovan economy, however, 

moved into recession in 2015 (-0.5 percent growth in GDP) because of weaker external flows, large-scale banks fraud, 

and a drought. Economic troubles in Russia and Ukraine, together with Russia’s restrictions on agro-food imports from 

Moldova sharply reduced remittances from and halved Moldova’s exports to Russia. Further, a banking crisis brought 

on by massive fraud in three banks has lowered confidence in the banking sector, leading to significant interest rates 

and reduced credit to the private sector. The monetary and fiscal resolution of the three insolvent banks (12 percent of 

GDP) has led to higher public debt and lower foreign exchange reserves, damaged business confidence and reduced 

macroeconomic buffers to sustain economic shocks. 

 

Political instability became more marked between 2013 and 2015, manifesting itself as frequent changes of governing 

coalitions. There were seven prime ministers or acting prime ministers and three periods without a Government 

between September 2014 and January 2016. The November 2015 Public Opinion Barometer (bi-annual poll measuring 

political, social and economic sentiment) showed that 88 percent of Moldovans thought that the country was moving in 

the wrong direction. Corruption and governance indicators have also worsened markedly. Moldova fell from the 30th 

to the 20th percentile for Control of Corruption between 2012 and 2014 (2015 World Governance Indicators). The 

Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey shows a fourfold increase in the percentage of firms that 

rate the bribing of both officials and members of parliament during 2005-13 as negatively impacting the business 

environment. 

 

Moldova remains one of the poorest countries in Europe. Poverty is largely a rural phenomenon as rural national 

poverty stands at 19 percent compared to 5 percent for urban areas. With 57 percent of the population living in rural 

areas, 84 percent of the poor are concentrated there. Those in rural areas, poor and non-poor, rely more on agriculture 

and remittances for income sources than their urban counterparts who derive more income from non-agricultural 

employment. Therefore, rural areas felt the shock of the 2007 drought much more than urban areas, with poverty ($5 

per day) increasing from 31 percent in 2007 to a peak of 36 percent in 2009. Stocks of agricultural products vanished 

in many rural households, and prices and expenditure in households’ budgets for food and energy rapidly grew. A 

severe summer drought in 2015, along with lower remittances and higher inflation, has further pushed the poverty rate 

up to 41.9 percent. Climate change impacts, if not properly managed, could undermine progress made in poverty 

reduction, and adversely impact food security and economic growth in vulnerable rural areas.  

 
Sectoral and Institutional Context 
 

Despite being landlocked and therefore having no exposure to sea-level rise, the ND-GAIN  methodology ranks 

Moldova as the most climate vulnerable country in Europe, based on a range of social and economic indicators. 

Temperature and rainfall have increased in Moldova over the last century. Climate models predict future mean 

temperature rises exceeding 20 by mid-century, and a slight increase or significant decline in precipitation, depending 

on region. Extreme climatic events and other climate-related challenges are expected to worsen in the future, with 

important implications for economic growth, and especially for the rural poor, who are more dependent on natural 

resources and more vulnerable to climate-related shocks. 

 

In 2014, the Government of Moldova, through the Ministry of Environment and with support of UNDP and the 



Government of Austria, developed and approved a National Climate Change Adaptation Strategy, reviewing climate 

change vulnerabilities in the six sectors considered most vulnerable, agriculture, water resources, forestry, human 

health, energy and infrastructure. The strategy included an initial action plan to 2020, at an estimated budget of 

US$155 million, based on institutional and investment activities recommended within each sector. More recently, the 

Bank has supported the Government to carry out a more systematic analysis of the costs of inaction on within each of 

these sectors, and the potential volumes and cost-benefit of physical investments for climate adaptation. Given the 

importance of the sector, a parallel climate-smart agriculture profile was prepared through collaboration with CIAT. 

The studies identified key current investment needs in warning and response systems to extreme climate events, in 

resilient land management through improved agricultural practices and forestry, and in water resources management, 

and findings are summarized below (see annex 3 for more detail). 

 

Agriculture: For most crops, yields in Moldova are around a quarter to a third lower than other Eastern European 

countries. Only around 1% of land is irrigated, and droughts occur every few years, and results in estimated annualized 

costs of around $20 million. The most severe droughts, such as that of 2007, have significant impacts on GDP and 

food security. Crop losses are also incurred from flooding, late frosts, hail and windstorms. Climate change is expected 

to reduce the productivity of most current crops by 10-30%, as well as increasing the frequency and intensity of most 

extreme events, and presenting new pest and disease challenges. Annual crops will be more severely impacted than 

perennials, with typical conditions for fruit orchard and vineyards potentially even improving under climate change, 

but recent trends have seen an increase in annual cropping over perennials due to a lack of investment in rejuvenating 

orchards and vineyards when they reach the end of their productive lives. 

 

With rural finance only available at high interest rates, lack of investment is a general problem in the sector. Around 

43% of agricultural land and 80% of pasture land (which is mostly communally managed under local government 

authorities) is degraded to some degree, which makes the land even more vulnerable to climate variability and change. 

The productivity of pasture land has been estimated at 20-50% of its potential. The annual opportunity cost of inaction 

in the agriculture and livestock sectors is estimated to be around $240 - $480 million at present and to rise significantly 

over coming decades. Scaling up adoption of irrigation and a range of other climate-smart and sustainable agricultural 

technologies will be critical to the productivity and resilience of the sector. 

 

Forests: Moldova has the lowest forest cover in Europe at only 11.4 percent. Forests tend to occur in hilly areas with 

the majority of them located in the central part of Moldova, slightly less in the north and even fewer in the south. Tree 

species are mainly broad leafed - oak, ash, hornbeam, black locust and poplar being the most significant. Moldovan 

forests are already fragmented and stressed, and climate-related changes in species growth and composition are being 

observed. Climate change is expected to reduce the productivity of natural forests and change pathology patterns. 

Annual opportunity costs of inaction are estimated to be around $40 million, and to increase marginally over coming 

decades. Areas for immediate interventions are ecological reconstruction of the present forest estate and the expansion 

of forest vegetation, including the creation of new forest shelter belts, which play an important role in protecting crops 

from high winds, desiccation and uneven snow cover. 

 

Water Resources: Most of Moldovan territory lies between two main rivers (the Nistru and Prut) which originate 

outside its territory, but surface water resources are limited in much of the area in between. About 65 percent of the 

population use water abstracted from groundwater supplies. Utilization of water resources is already much lower than 

during Soviet times. Only around 6% of the previous area is currently under functional irrigation, and irrigation and 

potable water supply from ground water is a problem within many rural areas owing to decreased water level and its 

quality. Even with the potential for slightly increased rainfall in some areas, overall water availability is expected to 

decrease with climate change due to the combined changes in precipitation and temperature. Despite low levels of 

current use, total water availability is expected to fall below total demand within a couple of decades, as demand grows 

but supply falls, and Moldova is among countries predicted to have high water stress in 2040. The most populated and 

economically important regions are the most vulnerable to expected climate change, and some regions are already 

facing water shortages. Addressing deficits in these regions will be critical for supporting a sustainable economic 

recovery. The costs of water shortages could be measured in the hundreds of millions or billions of US$ by the 2040s, 

and investments in improving the efficiency of water usage and additional storage will be needed to avert them. The 

current project would make its contribution reducing water deficit for farmers by providing access to irrigation 

schemes, by promoting better and more adapted to climate changes agricultural practices, as well as by conducting 

large-scale information dissemination and demonstrational activities in this regard. 

 

Climate knowledge and emergency response: Moldova suffers from a range of natural disasters, most of which are 

weather related. Current annualized costs of flooding are estimated to be around $60 million, and to increase to several 

times that over coming decades as flood frequency and the volume of assets at risk increase. The World Bank has 

already invested in disaster response management through the Disaster and Climate Risk Management Project, 

DCRMP (2010-16; US$12 million), which is assessed to have had a significant effect on reducing economic losses. 

Nevertheless, recent hail and rain storms (June 2016) showed that the country is not as well prepared for natural 

hazards as it aims to be. In particular, and as recently highlighted by the Prime Minister, local delivery and translation 

of early warning to early action, as well as effective response, need further strengthening. This requires not only 

bolstering of sub-national command structures and facilities/equipment, but also ensuring that local first responders, 

authorities, public services and businesses are better prepared.  

 
Relationship to CPF 
 

The proposed project is fully consistent with and anticipated in the FY14-17 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) that 

was approved on August 9, 2013. Specifically, the project combines two operations anticipated in the CPS - on 

sustainable forest management and climate adaptation - contributing to the third pillar on “promoting a green, clean 

and resilient Moldova.” Through the proposed project, the Bank will support the country in identifying and 

implementing interventions for improved environmental practices and natural resource management, and greater 

adaptation to the impact of climate change. The project also aims at ensuring that poverty reduction and shared 

prosperity are delivered in an environmentally sustainable manner, while also reducing the vulnerability of rural 

households, which represent a disproportionately high share of the bottom 40 percent and largely rely on self-produced 

foods, to the vagaries of extreme weather events. As described in the CPS, the project will assist in improving under-

developed weather mitigation instruments as part of adaptation efforts, which leave the rural population, farmers in 

particular, highly vulnerable to adverse weather events, thus compromising their food supply. All these efforts are 

expected to support the Bank’s major emphasis on increasing resilience to climate related risks and disasters.  

 
 

C. Proposed Development Objective(s)        
 
The PDO is to enhance adoption of climate-smart agriculture and forestry practices in targeted landscapes and 
strengthen national disaster management systems. 

 

Key Results (From PCN) 
 
- Area of agricultural land with increased productivity; 

- Number of farmers adopting new agricultural management practices promoted by the project; 

- Area of degraded land restored (of which forest, of which pasture); 

- Number/% of at risk population covered by effective early warning and response systems); 

- Direct beneficiaries (of which female, of which poor).  

 
D. Concept Description 

 
The emerging findings of the Climate Adaptation Technical Assistance show that there are substantial needs for (i) pro-

poor and complementary adaptation investments across a range of sustainable land and water management activities and 

(ii) cross-cutting climate information and emergency response. Accordingly, the Moldova Climate Adaptation & Forestry 

Project (CAFP) is proposed to focus on a mutually reinforcing set of investments that help to address several key 

adaptation issues and target the most vulnerable through: 

 

i. An integrated approach to supporting resilient rural landscapes through investments in on-farm irrigation and other 

adaptation activities, and forest-based restoration of degraded lands. 

 

ii. Strengthening of climate knowledge and disaster-risk management systems to improve understanding of climate 

impacts, and preparedness and response mechanisms, that will benefit a range of sectors. 

 

Project structure and key activities: 

 

Component 1: Resilient rural landscapes [$32 million indicative] 

 

Rural productivity in Moldova is lower than regional standards, and agriculture, livestock and forest systems are 

vulnerable to climate pressures. Only around 6% of the area covered by soviet-era schemes and less than 1% of 

Moldova’s arable land is under functional irrigation, and crops are vulnerable to flooding, late frosts, hail, windstorms and 

snow accumulations, as well as droughts. Many forests and pasture lands are degraded, and faced with intensifying 

climate-related threats such as fire and pests/disease. Particularly lands managed by local public authorities are degraded  

due to weak management capacity of the LPAs. Improving the management of these systems in unison is mutually 

reinforcing as it will support diversified rural incomes (thereby increasing resilience to individual climate shocks) as well 

as reducing vulnerability and increasing productivity through synergistic ecological services- e.g. the role that forests play 

in sheltering fields and protecting soil and water sources. 

 

The component would rely on investments in the following complementary activities within one or more target 

landscapes. 

 

Subcomponent 1.1: Support to the Agricultural Sector [$10 million indicative] 

 

The project would support the up-scaling of activities that have been previously tested through donor-supported pilot 

projects and have demonstrated successful mitigation and adaptation measures with potential for larger scale 

interventions. A number of resilience practices have been tested, generating locally-tuned models, farmer experience, and 

implementation-service delivery capacity has been created. stimulated emulation by the neighboring farmers. Discussions 

with producers confirm that these programs have been well-received and that there is a degree of emulation by 

neighboring farmers, but there is still considerable scope and need for upscaling. 

 

While on-going analysis indicates that access to irrigation represents the highest-return option for increased resilience of 

Moldovan agricultural production systems, the project will not focus on the rehabilitation of large-scale irrigation systems. 

These are not likely to be feasible in the context of the existing financing envelope for the project and current institutional 

constraints in the sector. Instead, the project would focus on building upon the results of the Millennium Challenge 

Corporation’s institutional and investment efforts in the rehabilitation of 10 large irrigation schemes, to provide further 

capacity building and/or investment resources to emerging water users associations/farmer groups for the sustainable use 

and expanded up-take of irrigation services. 

 

The project will provide financing for:   

 

a) Upscaling adoption of irrigation through assisting groups of farmers to access existing large-scale pumped systems 

rehabilitated by MCA, and by providing access to small-scale irrigation in the hinterlands through investments in shared 

equipment and infrastructure (e.g. rehabilitation of existing and construction of new water harvesting ponds). Both 

potential categories are likely to be located in the central and southern regions of the country. The potential ‘ready’ 

demand is assumed at around 15 percent of the potentially equipped irrigated area i.e., 30 000 hectares @ 15% = 4500 

hectares. The irrigated areas are used mostly for high value vegetable crops (tomato; cucumbers; onions; peppers; 
eggplants, etc.) and orchards. Based on the previous experience in the country the proposed activities do not 

cause any risks and impacts related to child and forced labor. 
 

b) Upscaling demonstration activities on climate smart agriculture technologies: i.e. integrated climate resilient practices 

and investments such as drip irrigation, greenhouses, minimum and no-till agriculture, UV/hail nets, etc. The project 

would aim to support around 100 producers, leading to at least 200 demonstration events and to around 3000 knowledge 

beneficiaries. 

 

c) Extension and knowledge dissemination on lower-cost on-farm adaptation practices: multi-cropping, inter-cropping, 

silage, climate smart herd management, introduction to organic farming, etc. The project would aim to support 

compilation of existing knowledge into publications and practical guidelines, with more on-hands delivery of knowledge 

to around 1000 farmers in dedicated workshops. 

 

The project would support the upscaling investments mentioned in (a) and (b) above with matching grant financing. 

Matching grants would not exceed 30% of the overall cost for any particular climate smart investment, as well as be under 

US$50,000, and would be provided on a competitive basis (in transparently held calls of proposals), against clearly 

established eligibility and performance implementation criteria, including a public good element, such as associative 

collaboration between farmers and/or a public demonstration element. Demonstration investments will be subject to 

commitments for inclusion in a demonstration plot circuit and allowing access by agri-consultants and interested farmers. 

 

Support for these activities is likely to be delivered to local communities and farmers through the country’s National Rural 

Development Agency (ACSA) for the proliferation of climate smart agriculture practices and technologies (through 

demonstration plots, farmer schools and climate-informed extension), and through the involvement of ACSA and of the 

Millennium Challenge Account Unit for irrigation activities. The spatial focus of these interventions, given the relatively 

uniform levels of vulnerability of agricultural production systems throughout the country, is likely to be widespread and 

responsive to local demand and proactivity, but the menu of interventions would be fine-tuned to local agro-climatic 

conditions. 

 

Subcomponent 1.2: Forest and pasture management [indicative US$22 million indicative] 

 

In forest and pasture land management, project activities will aim at supporting ecological reconstruction, new forest belts 

and riparian buffers and restoration of degraded land. The precise selection of activities will be conditioned on progress on 

institutional restructuring in the forest sector. 


Specific activities are in line with national forestry plans and could include: 

 

Institutional strengthening ($0.5 million) to support the implementation of the Forest Institutional Reform Strategy of 

Moldova (FIRSM, prepared in 2012 with support from ENPI-FLEG I program) through building capacity (equipment, 

enhancing professional and institutional capacity, etc.). 

 

Ecological reconstruction and improving the genetic diversity of state forests ($12 million) are high priorities. The aim is 

to consolidate existing forest resources by focusing mainly on the Central region where most forests are concentrated and 

to a lesser extent in the South. The project would support ecological reconstruction in an area of 5,000 to 10,000 ha 

depending on the intensity of presumed intervention ($9.5 million).This includes investments in the forest agency 

Moldsilva’s afforestation capacity along with financing forest reconstruction activities such as sanitary cuttings and 

selective cutting/clearing of nonnative species, as well as afforestation activities. For all areas proposed for ecological 

reconstruction a specialized design institute/agency will design a concrete scheme for such activities which will be 

preliminary reviewed and approved by the State Ecological Inspectorate in order to avoid any potential impacts on critical 

or important natural habitats with high biodiversity values. This will be done during the initial stage of project 

implementation and before contracting implementing agencies for these activities. 

 

Provision of appropriate seeds and seedlings material to support regeneration of native forests (mainly comprising oak 

species) would be addressed by investment in the National Centre for Forest Genetics and Seeds (NCFGS) under 

Moldsilva. Native seedling production would be enhanced through investments in irrigation and capacity for containerized 

seedlings production at the NCFGS ($2.5 million). Knowledge gaps in ecological reconstruction of forests would be 

addressed through a training program on the ecological reconstruction for the Moldsilva staff ($0.25 million). 

 

Agricultural shelterbelts, riparian buffers and afforestation on Local Public Authorities’ land ($6.5 million). This would 

include reconstruction of degraded shelterbelts on 1,000 ha ($0.75 million), creation of new forest belts on 1,000 ha ($1.5 

million) and riparian buffers on 1,000 ha ($1.5 million), as well as afforestation of around 1,500 ha of degraded land ($3.0 

million). These interventions would mainly target land owned by Local Public Authorities (LPAs). 

 

Improved management of LPA forests and pastures ($4 million) would increase the capacity of LPAs for managing 

communal land resources (mainly forests and pastures) in a participatory, planned and integrated way. This will support 

management planning for all forests that belong to LPAs but which do not have management plans yet (appr. 40,000 ha). 

The project would also support rehabilitation of degraded communal land, through improved pasture (and livestock) 

management, and silvo-pastoral approaches. 

 

Feasibility of activities on state lands currently managed by Moldsilva depend on if and when the FIRSM is implemented. 

The reforms are expected to be launched in fall 2016. If, however, they are delayed, more project resources will be 

allocated to management of locally administered lands. This alternative allocation of investments is represented in the 

table below. 

 

Private landowners have not yet been active in re/afforestation or production of e.g. for wood energy. This is due to 

fragmentation of private land ownership (average private property is about 1.2 ha) and due to very few degraded lands 

being privately owned. If feasible, the project may look at options (e.g. incentives or extension services) to promote wood 

production on private lands. 

 

Component 2: Disaster preparedness [$15 million indicative] Strengthened disaster management systems are needed to 

support a wide range of sectors with risk management planning and response to extreme hydrometeorological events. The 

Emergency Situations and Civil Protection Service (ESCPS) of the Minister of Internal Affairs has identified three 

priority investment areas that the project will seek to support, building on advances achieved during the DCRMP: 

 
(i) Establishment of two regional Emergency Command Centers. The DCRMP successfully established a modern national 

Emergency Command Center (ECC) in Chisinau. DCRMP’s scoping and feasibility studies indicated that to deliver 

effective management of emergency situations and preparedness across the country, two regional ECCs are also needed in 

the north and south of the country, in Balti and Cahul respectively. The project will therefore complete the national 

integrated risk management technical strategy by establishing the two regional ECCs. This will ensure better quality of 

services nationally at the local level, improve efficiency of support for remote locations, better support tactical field 

operations, and increase redundancy for critical ESCPS infrastructure. Cost is estimated at US$4 million, to be 

implemented over 5 years. 

 

(ii) Improving preparedness and emergency response capacity. Much of the equipment that ESCPS deploys to respond to 

climate and disaster emergencies is outdated and inefficient. For example, 90% of fire response equipment, which is used 

to manage both property and wildfires, is over 20 years old. Older equipment is also not compliant with modern 

environmental management approaches, often leading to negative environmental impacts during deployment. The project 

will therefore improve ESCPS’ preparedness and response capacity through investments in modern equipment, including 

but not limited to fire and rescue vehicles, extreme winter conditions access capacity, temporary flood management 

modules, electricity and heat generation, and equipment to support preparedness activities during non-crisis times. Base 

cost is estimated at US$3 million to be implemented over 3 years, scalable depending on financing availability. 

 

(iii) Establishment of a national training center. Currently Moldova does not have a national training center properly 

equipped for capacity building in theoretical and practical management of emergency situations. This prevents the state 

institutions, local public institutions of level I and II, the private sector and the public to effectively understand and 

manage disaster risk. Such a national training center would help ensure state and public preparedness for disaster and 

climate risks, improving risk management and awareness. The project will establish an ESCPS national training center, 

equipped for capacity building in both theoretical disaster risk management and practical training through simulations of 

emergency situations. The center will train ESCPS staff and first responders, as well as local leaders/authorities, managers 

of critical infrastructure (hospitals, schools, etc.), private sector leaders and the public. A location has already been 

identified and secured, with the cost estimated at US$5 million to be implemented over 5 years. 

 

Component 3: Providing immediate response to an eligible crisis or emergency as needed. A zero-budget contingent 

emergency response component (CERC) will enable funds to be rapidly reallocated to disaster response in the event of an 

eligible climate-related incident during the lifetime of the project. A crisis or emergency is defined for CERC eligibility in 

the same way as it is defined in World Bank OP/BP 10.00: an event that has caused or is likely to imminently cause a 

major adverse economic and/or social impact associated with crises or disasters due, in the case of this project, to 

hydrometeorological hazards. While the World Bank provides the Immediate Response Mechanism (IRM) to consolidate 

CERCs across national IDA projects for potentially larger multi-sectoral response financing, the preference is currently 

for a standalone CERC limited to funds under this project. Global experience has shown that standalone CERCs are more 

flexible and quicker to trigger ex-post. An IRM would require restructuring of existing projects to add CERCs to them. 

The Republic of Moldova would need to adopt a CERC Operations Manuals (OM), describing the actions to be taken 

when a crisis or emergency occurs, as well as the monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements of the emergency 

response. 

 

Component 4: Project coordination and management [$3.5 million indicative] 

This component will support knowledge and project monitoring systems, as well as overall project administration, 

including coordination across implementing agencies. As a member of the Intergovernmental Board on Climate Services 

(IBCS), Moldova has endorsed the Global Framework for Climate Services (GFCS). The GFCS strives to develop and 

incorporate science-based climate information and prediction into planning, policy and practice through close partnership 

between providers and users of climate information. The GFCS Partner Advisory Committee (PAC) has identified 

Moldova as one of six pilot countries. While through separate mechanisms the Bank and other development partners aim 

to support overall pursuit of GFCS at the national level, the project will provide technical assistance to strengthen the 


production and use of climate information as a tool for coordination and management within certain sectors: 

 

(i) Climate information services. The State Hydrometeorological Service (SHS) carries a national mandate to deliver 

information services specifically on weather, climate and water hazards. However considering complementary ongoing 

and planned support from the Bank and other development partners, the project will not directly invest in SHS. The 

project will provide technical assistance to support future climate investment, including: 

 

a. Supporting institutional reform processes (including vision, strategy, restructuring, etc) of Apele Moldovei (or any 

successor water resources management agency), informed by modelling of climate-related water resources challenges and 

investment needs, and analysis of constraints to irrigation development, for example land fragmentation and markets, rural 

finance, drought compensation, moral hazard and crop insurance. Costing approximately US$1 million, this will lay the 

basis for potential future irrigation (and storage) investments. (including potentially as a basis for discussion of future 

World Bank financing). 

 

b. Facility/challenge fund for additional analytical/modelling work on climate impacts, for example health effects, 

analysis of crop potentials, etc., estimated to cost US$1 million. 

 

(ii) Overall project administration. Includes coordination across implementing agencies and project monitoring systems, 

expected to cost approximately US$1.5 million. 

 
 

  SAFEGUARDS 

 
A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)       

 
While the project activities will be implemented country wide, the main focus of the sub-component 1.a and 1.b will be 
implemented in the most vulnerable Southern part of the country which is one of the most affected by climatic 
changes region. The proposed activities would not generate any significant environmental and social risks as no major 
civil works or large scale ecological reconstruction activities in the forests will be supported. Some adverse 
environmental impacts might occur during afforestation activities which might affect the biological diversity and 
existing natural habitats, as well as some environmental risks and issues related to construction of the regional 
Emergency Command Centers and of the Emergency Training Center (solid waste management; air and water 
pollution; labor safety). 

 
B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies       

 
The project activities will be coordinated by an inter-ministerial steering committee chaired by the State Minister. The 
Ministries of Environment (MoE), and of Agriculture and Water Resources, Moldsilva, State Hydro-meteorological 
Service, and Department of Emergency Situations will be part of the steering committee, and will be implementing the 
some components of the project. 
 
Fiduciary arrangements, incl. safeguards, will be managed by the Project Management Team (PMT) in MoE. The PMT 
supported implementation of the Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs), and is currently supporting implementation of 
the Disaster and Climate Risk Management Project. These projects have financed, to a large extent, similar activities as 
the proposed project, in particular agricultural climate adaptation. The PMT staff has substantial experience in 
implementing environmental and social safeguards and the PMT EA capacity have been qualified as satisfactory. In the 

last AMs for the Disaster and Climate Risk Project the project environmental management is satisfactory. Civil works 
were in compliance with the EMP and EMP Checklists for hydro-meteorological stations and for Department for 
Emergency Situations Command Center. The PIU has integrated environmental clauses in the bidding and contract 
documents. The EMP environmental requirements are followed and there were no complaints from the HS and DESCP, 
or supervising Engineers. All construction and refurbishing activities are reported as being consistent with national 
environmental and construction requirements and permits. Under the pilot activities for the consolidation of the 
agricultural sector’s resilience to adverse weather effects the PIU has assessed from environmental point of view all 
selected grants and checked if they have relevant environmental permits and authorization, including approvals from 
environmental inspectorate.  It is expected the matching grant program of the Project will be implemented via Agency 
for Interventions and Payments in Agriculture (AIPA)  which has also experience in conducting environmental screening 
and assessment of the grants. Analysis of AIPA’s EA capacities and if needed, capacity building activities, will be done 
during the project design phase. 
 
For the project implementation the PMT will hire safeguards specialist responsible for both environmental and social 
safeguards; if needed, WB Environmental Specialist will provide adequate on the job training.

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

The proposed project activities (production of forest 
reproductive material for climate resilience; 
ecological reconstruction of priority degraded forests; 
rehabilitation and establishment of shelter belts to 
protect fields and riparian buffers to protect water 
bodies; afforestation of degraded land; community-
based pasture management; matching grant facility 
which would support investments in drainage of 
waterlogged areas, in irrigation infrastructure 
rehabilitation and modernization, in on-farm water-
harvesting structures and efficient small-scale 
irrigation, anti-hail net systems, agroforestry, soil and 
water conservation techniques; improving emergency 
prevention and preparedness training by constructing 
a training and/or two regional Emergency Command 
Centers; etc.) might generate a series of various 
environmental and social impacts related to the 
following: (a) biodiversity degradation; (b) increased 
pollution of ground and surface waters due to soil 
erosion; (c) health and environmental risks due to 
inappropriate pesticides handling; and (d) noise, dust, 
Air and water pollution, health hazards and labor 
safety issues during the civil works; etc. The 
anticipated social impacts of such activities include 
issues around (a) labor and working conditions, (b) 
information disclosure and stakeholder engagement, 
(c) community health and safety, (d) land acquisition, 
physical and economic displacement, lost access to 
natural resources. All of identified adverse impacts 
are expected to be typical for afforestation, 
agricultural production and irrigation activities as well 
as for small scale construction/rehabilitation works, 
temporary by nature and site specific and can be 
easily mitigated by applying best agro-forestry and 
construction practices or relevant mitigation 
measures.  
To address these impacts the client will prepare an 
Environmental and Social Assessment Framework 
which will guide the project activities and matching 
grants EA once identified. The ESMF would be 
targeted at specifying the set of mitigation, 
monitoring measures, timeframes and institutional 
responsibility measures to be taken during the 
project activities and matching grants to eliminate 
adverse environmental and social impacts, offset, or 
reduce them to acceptable levels. The documents 
should cover the following: rules and procedures for 
environmental screening; guidance for conducting 
activities/matching grants EIA and/or preparing 
simple EMPs as well as the EMP Checklist; possible 
mitigation measures for different proposed activities 
and matching grants to be supported by the project; 
requirements for monitoring and supervision of 
implementing of EIA/EMPs requirements. The ESMF 
will also provide a brief assessment of the associated 
to the project recently rehabilitated under the US 
“Compact Program” large irrigation pumping stations 
and schemes, in particular in terms of their 
compliance with the WB OPs. The project will require 
a framework for public consultation and information 
disclosure identifying all relevant, affected and 
interested stakeholders and will develop inclusive 
and meaningful ways of their involvement in the 
project design and implementation. This Public 
Consultation and Information Disclosure Plan or 
Stakeholder Engagement Plan will contain a section 
planning for continuous engagement, outreach to 


communities and stakeholder and information 
disclosure with respect to the project timelines and 
implementation. The PCID or SEP will be designed to 
reach out for both male and female audiences and 
provide opportunities for them to voice their opinion, 
concerns or comments about the project and its 
implementation. 

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 TBD 

At this stage of project design it is not known if this 
OP will be triggered. The NHs might be triggered first 
of all in the case of implementing ecological 
reconstruction activities. If the project will support 
such activities then the ESMF will provide detailed 
guidance for EA of such activities and areas. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 Yes 

While the project will not support any commercial 
wood harvesting this OP is triggered as the project 
will support afforestation activities along with the 
forest reconstruction activities in the degraded 
forests.  In order to make sure the project activities 
will not affect natural habitats and biodiversity 
conservation the ESMF will specify the rules and 
procedure for environmental screening and 
assessment of land plots given for afforestation or for 
creating forest shelterbelts as well as of the degraded 
forests selected for reconstruction activities. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

While the project will not finance purchasing and/or 
application of pesticides, it might support purchasing 
special equipment and would provide training on pest 
management in the forestry sector and thus the 
project triggers this OP. To address these issues the 
ESMF will include measures to raise awareness and 
educate foresters regarding safe pesticide handling 
and use of Integrated Pest Management to enhance 
sustainability and reduce human and environmental 
exposure to pesticides. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 No 
The project will be implemented on agricultural lands 
and in forest areas and will not generate impacts on 
PCRs. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 No N/A for Moldova 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

The OP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement is also 
triggered. Although it is expected all 
activities/subproject will be implemented on public 
lands, in some cases the proposed activities might 
affect private households or restrict access of the 
local population to the afforested lands or to 
pastures to be improved. To address the involuntary 
resettlement issues including impacts on livelihoods 



on protected lands, and   restriction to access to 
natural resources, the client will prepare separate 
Resettlement Policy Framework that also includes a 
Process Framework.  For that the client will conduct a 
Social Impact Assessment (SIA) and a Gender 
Assessment that, based on what will be designed the 
RPF. 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 No N/A 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

Yes 

The proposed upscaling irrigation through assisting 
groups of farmers to access existing large-scale 
pumped systems rehabilitated by MCA, and by 
providing access to small-scale irrigation in the 
hinterlands through investments in shared 
equipment and infrastructure (e.g. rehabilitation of 
existing and construction of new water harvesting 
ponds) will not change the volume of 
extraction/discharge water or quality of water of the 
Prut and Dniester Rivers (which are international 
rivers) and its tributaries, but rather will lead to more 
efficient irrigation and drainage. Based on that the 
project team will seek a waiver from VP on not 
required notification of riparian parties. 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No N/A

Decision 
 

Following the Corporate Review, the decision was taken to proceed with appraisal and negotiations. 
   
 
 
 

B. Introduction and Context  
 
Moldova’s recent macro-economic performance has been characterized by consumption-led growth and low fiscal 



deficits. In 2016-17, GDP growth resumed reaching 4.5 percent on account of strong agricultural output and robust 
private consumption growth largely driven by remittances and public and private wage increases. At the same time, 
credit growth remains negative reflecting the limited pass-through of the monetary policy stance to commercial 
interest rates and tighter prudential standards in the banking sector.  The fiscal deficit is estimated to reach 0.8 
percent in 2017, lower than the deficit forecasted at budget stage and public debt remains sustainable under 
different stress-test scenarios. In 2018, growth is expected to remain robust and reach 3.8 percent but to moderate 
over the medium term. The inflation rate is expected to re-enter the target corridor due to base effects and lower 
regulated prices. Fiscal deficits are projected to remain under control.  
 
In a context of slowing growth over the medium term, addressing the structural impediments to efficient public and 
private sector governance is paramount for igniting new sources of growth. As a large share of the population is 
already living and working abroad, and the attachment of subsequent-generation migrants to Moldova declines along 
time, Moldova needs to search for new drivers of growth reliant on higher private sector investments and in this 
context, remove barriers to private sector access to and use of resources. Moreover, governance challenges undermine 
the efficiency of public resource use and constrain competition among businesses.  

 
 
 

Relationship to CPF 
 

In line with the World Bank FY18-21 Country Partnership Framework and the Moldova National Development 
Strategy, the proposed Economic Governance Development Policy Operation (EGDPO) supports Moldova’s transition 
towards a more sustainable and inclusive growth model. It builds on the progress achieved under the previous DPO by 
supporting actions to enhance the transparency of the banking sector and recent analytical work, which identifies 
strengthening the rule of law and the accountability of economic institutions as one of the top three constraints that are 
holding back economic growth and prosperity in the country.  
 
C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  

 

This operation supports reforms to strengthen economic governance in Moldova linked to the management of fiscal 

risks (Pillar A) and private sector development (Pillar B).  

D. Program Description   
 

This stand-alone Economic Governance Development Policy Operation (EGDPO) supports reforms to reduced fiscal risks 

and level the playing field for private sector development. The authorities are committed to restore investors’ and 

citizen’s trust in the integrity of the public sector by developing transparent and stable economic institutions and 

improving equity in access and use of resources. Reforms under the first pillar focus on reducing fiscal risks by reforming 

the pensions system, strengthening tax collection form tobacco taxation, pre-empting potential conflicts of interest of 

high level officials, and improving the reliability of SOEs and municipal enterprises’ financial information.    Reforms under 

the second pillar aim at removing bottlenecks in obtaining licenses, authorizations, and certificates and in accessing key 

agriculture inputs (seeds, seedlings, fertilizers, and pesticides), and at improving the governance regime in the banking 

and energy sector.  

 


E. Implementation  
 

The Ministry of Finance will steer the administration of this operation, as the main body responsible for financial aid 

coordination and management. The Ministry of Finance has recently assumed this role and will be responsible for the 

supervision for the monitoring of progress in the policy areas supported by the operation.  

 
F.  Poverty and Social Impacts and Environment Aspects 
 

The operation is not expected to have adverse impacts along poverty, social, gender or environmental dimensions. 
Some of prior actions could have positive impacts on poverty and equity. The pension and tax related reforms promote 
social sustainability, reduce privileges that do not benefit large segments of population, especially poor, and incentivize 
healthier lifestyle. The pension reform and higher tobacco taxation contribute to the reduction of gender gaps in income 
and non-communicable diseases.  
 
G.  Risks and Mitigation 
 
Risks to the program implementation are moderate to substantial. Macro, sector strategies and technical design risks 
are considered substantial and are partially mitigated by the reforms supported by this operation, the recent record of 
Moldova’s prudent fiscal policy, the IMF program which serves as a macro-fiscal stability anchor, and the technical 
assistance (TA) provided by the World Bank Group (WBG) which will help continue the reform agenda.

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 
 
Montenegro, a small, upper middle-income country, gained its independence in 2006 and is making big strides 
towards negotiating its accession to the European Union (EU). With a population of only 0.6 million, and a 
Gross National Income (GNI) per capita of US$7,320, Montenegro is the smallest country in the Western 
Balkans. It started negotiations with the EU in June 2012 and strives to join by 2020 ahead of the other countries 
in the Western Balkans. Of the 35 negotiations chapters, three have been provisionally closed and twenty-four 
have been opened. Good progress towards EU alignment has been made in areas such as free movements of 
goods, agriculture and rural development, food safety, veterinary and phytosanitary policy, energy, employment 
and social policy, regional policy and preparation for structural instruments. In the latest Progress Report on 
Montenegro (November 2016), the European Commission (EC) notes that the country is at early stages of 
preparation regarding budgetary and financial provisions, environment and climate change, and more needs to 
be done to improve competitiveness, as well as economic and monetary policy. Strengthening the 
administrative capacity for ensuring the application of the acquis communautaire remains a substantial 
challenge for Montenegro. 

 

Montenegro has followed a steady path of economic growth, but not without challenges. The economic boom, 
from 2000 to 2008, was triggered by a large inflow of capital that stimulated aggregate demand, led to a steady 
increase in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth, and a fall in the unemployment rate. During the boom, there 
was a steady decline in the percentage of households below the poverty line and an increase in the income of 
households in the bottom 40 percent, most of them in rural areas. After experiencing a double-dip recession due 
to the 2008 global financial and the 2012 Eurozone debt crises, Montenegro’s economy slowed down to 1.8 
percent in 2014 and recovered to 2.5 percent in 2016, continuing its recovery path (with 3.2 percent in 2017) 
due to investments in road infrastructure and robust tourism activity. However, the unemployment rate remains 
high at 17.3 percent in early 2017. Large fiscal deficit and growing fiscal debt have prompted the Government of 
Montenegro to adopt a set of fiscal consolidation measures aimed at reducing public spending.   

 

Montenegro’s overarching development goal is to achieve smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. Montenegro’s 
development plan is outlined in three separate, but complimentary strategies: the EU Accession Program 2014-2018, 
the Montenegro Development Directions (MDD) 2015-2018, and the Montenegro Economic Reform Program (ERP) 
2016-2018. Montenegro’s EU Accession Program was adopted in December 2013 and represents the main strategic 
document regarding European integration. It focuses on measures required for completing alignment with the acquis 
communautaire. The MDD, aligned with the Europe 2020 strategy, was adopted by the Government in July 2015. The 
MDD identifies four driving sectors, namely tourism, energy, agriculture and rural development, and manufacturing,

finalizing the document. 

 


towards achieving the objective of “smart, sustainable and inclusive growth.” The ERP complements these efforts by 
tightening fiscal spending and reducing public debt. 
 
Sectoral and Institutional Context 
 
Agriculture is an important sector for the economic development of Montenegro. In this predominantly 
mountainous country, agricultural land represents 38 percent of total land area, two thirds of which is covered 
by pastures. Agriculture and food production play an important role in the economy, contributing 12 percent of 
GDP (with the primary sector contributing 10 percent, and agro-food processing and fisheries contributing 
around two percent). With agricultural exports increasing by around four percent annually during the last eight 
years, agricultural imports have been increasing much faster (around 16 percent annually) leading to the 
worsening of agricultural trade deficit from US$166 million in 2005 to quadrupling by 2014.  

 

Agriculture contributes to income and job creation, but much of it is not accounted for. Agriculture is the 
largest economic activity in rural Montenegro; close to 50,000 families (roughly a quarter of the country’s 
population), with an average holding of 4.5 hectares, derive their income partly or entirely from agriculture. 
Despite its small size, the agro-climate and landscape varies dramatically from the north to the south and coastal 
areas of Montenegro. Olive and citrus fruit production dominate in the coastal region; early vegetable 
production and vineyards - in the center and in proximity of the larger agglomerations of Nikšić and Podgorica; 
and, extensive livestock production - in the north. According to MONSTAT, in 2010 there were 2,347 people 
formally employed in agriculture. Yet according to the 2010 Agricultural Census, the equivalent of 46,473 Annual 
Work Units were employed in agriculture, suggesting that only around five percent of agricultural employment is 
formal.  

 

Montenegro agriculture is characterized by constraints similar to those that prevail in Southeast Europe. 
Among them: (i) inability of agricultural producers to adopt modern technologies due to limited access to 
finance; (ii) small average farm size and an incomplete land use planning; (iii) slow uptake in development of 
aggregators that could improve collecting, storage, packaging and marketing of produce; and (iv) the effects of 
climate change, especially increased weather-related natural disasters such as droughts and floods that have a 
major negative impact on productivity, water supply and land erosion. 

 

With an extensive coastline, the fisheries sector of Montenegro has an enormous potential that has not yet 
been capitalized on. The fisheries sector has not yet developed to its full potential. According to recent stock 
assessments, marine living resources are currently under-exploited by the domestic fleet, which could safely 
increase in size. Today Montenegro is a net importer of fish products. In 2014, for example, 3,316 tons of 
fisheries products were imported into Montenegro, of which 2,000 tons of fresh, frozen and fileted products, 
whereas a mere 11 tons of fisheries products were exported. With current marine catch estimated at around 
900 tons a year, Montenegro has the potential to substantially increase its production to meet domestic 
demand (leading to an ultimate phase-out of imports), a large share of which will be absorbed by the growing 
tourism sector. The capacity of the fisheries sector, however, is currently constrained by outdated equipment, 
lack of adequate infrastructure (landing sites and dedicated access in existing ports) and an underdeveloped 
value chain.   

 

The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) has a cross-cutting mandate that covers not only 
agriculture, rural development, and the food system, but also encompasses water, forestry and fisheries. 



While the focus of the past 10 years has primarily been on agricultural production and to a lesser extent on food 
safety, the Ministry recognizes the need to strengthen the performance of other sub-sectors, i.e. food safety and 
fisheries, for which little policy orientation or support has been provided. The MARD has recently taken 
important steps to address this matter by adopting legislation that provides a new framework for food safety 
and establishes the Administration for Food Safety, Veterinary and Phytosanitary Affairs (AFSVPA). Further, it 
has functionally separated the Directorate for Agriculture and Fisheries into two Directorates to focus on 
supporting each sub-sector individually.  

 

Agriculture is an important sector in the EU accession agenda of Montenegro. Montenegro has made 
significant progress in establishing the required institutions and systems, and has developed capacity to 
implement the EU Instrument for Pre-Accession and Assistance for Rural Development (IPARD). However, 
further work is required as the country has committed to align its national agricultural policy to the Common 
Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the EU by the date of accession. To this end, the country is required to have all the 
necessary systems in place in order to manage and receive funding from the EU and to make payments to 
Montenegrin beneficiaries in accordance with EU rules and procedures. An Integrated Administration and 
Control System (IACS), along with other tools, are necessary for the efficient utilization and monitoring of 
support funds, and for the harmonization of the national direct payment measures with those currently 
implemented in the EU. EU membership brings important benefits to the country both at the macro and micro 
levels. It has been found to increase GDP per capita by approximately 12 percent. Trade liberalization has 
increased the flow of goods and services and has put competitiveness at the forefront of market integration. In 
agriculture, EU membership unlocks significant assistance and direct payments to farmers under the EU’s CAP, 
yet it also imposes stricter food safety and other trade-related requirements to agricultural production. 
 

Montenegro is making good progress towards alignment to EU food safety legislation.  A number of rulebooks, 
decrees and bylaws have been adopted. A new AFSVPA has been established under the oversight of the MARD, 
which also incorporates inspection services that previously operated autonomously. Several advances have been 
made in veterinary policy. The Animal Identification and Registration system, which already included large and 
small ruminants, was extended to pigs, and it has been completed. The multiannual program for the eradication 
of rabies has continued and routine monitoring and testing of ruminants for transmissible spongiform 
encephalopathies (TSEs) are being introduced. The implementing legislation on food safety rules was adopted in 
various fields but enforcement remains a challenge mainly due to shortage of human and material resources. As 
the country moves towards EU accession, the MARD would need to continue improving its administrative 
capacity, in particular for inspection services and laboratories, as well as upgrading food safety establishments. 

 

Montenegro’s preparations for the fisheries sector are at an early stage, but important progress has been 
made. The country’s Fisheries Strategy of 2015-2020 provides an overall guidance for the development of the 
Montenegrin sector and its administration in line with the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), including steps 
required to fully align and harmonize the national fisheries policy with the EU acquis communautaire. Steps 
must be taken to inform fishermen, traders and processors about the requirements they will face prior to and 
upon accession of Montenegro to the EU. The strategy identifies some of the sub-sector’s key areas for potential 
growth, including improved resource exploitation and connecting production from capture fisheries to the 
tourism sector and processing, thus ultimately increasing the added value of fish products. To reach this 
potential, adequate support will be required to increase fisheries production – including number of boats, 
improvement of fisheries coastal infrastructure, and enhancement of the control and surveillance system to 
address illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing. It is important to note that after EU accession, 


production capacity will be capped because of overall EU policy for the preservation of marine living resources. 
As a new EU member, Montenegro’s vessel capacity will be frozen as to the date of entry, without possibility of 
future expansion of the fleet.  

 

Since the early stages of Montenegro’s EU accession process, the EC and the World Bank (WB) have closely 
coordinated their activities to support Montenegro’s authorities and the agricultural sector towards unlocking 
access to the IPARD. Funded by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the 
Global Environment Facility (GEF), the Montenegro Institutional Development and Agriculture Strengthening 
Project (MIDAS) was launched in July 2009

1
 and has made important contributions to compliance with the IPARD 

requirements. The country’s authorities have put considerable efforts into setting up the required legal and 
institutional framework to meet EU pre-accession requirements. To this end, the MIDAS project has contributed 
towards (i) the establishment and capacity building of the Directorate for Rural Development (future Managing 
Authority) and preparation of the IPARD 2014-2020 Program and of the Code of Good Agricultural Practices; (ii) 
the establishment of the Directorate for Payments (future Paying Agency), including setting up its infrastructure 
that meets accreditation’s requirements, and establishment of the Farm Registry and of the Reference Price 
Database; (iii) provision of grants to agriculture holdings to promote their development and modernization 
along with familiarization of both farmers and Montenegrin authorities with the IPARD rules and principles; and 
(iv) enhancing food safety through investments in the national reference laboratories (Veterinary Lab and 
Institute of Marine Biology), as well as building and equipping the first Border Inspection Post (BIP) in Bar and 
strengthening the sector’s legal and regulatory framework.  
 

Montenegro received the EU’s “Entrustment of budget implementation tasks for EU IPARD funds.” 
Specifically, the entrustment was received in October 2017 for Measure 1 (Investments in physical assets of 
agricultural holdings) and Measure 3 (Investments in physical assets concerning processing and marketing of 
agricultural and fishery products) of the IPARD II Program. To this end, Montenegro’s IPARD II Program for 2014-
2020 (approved by the EU and adopted by the Government of Montenegro in September 2015) is conceived as a 
multi-annual development program for rural areas and proposes seven measures to be co-financed by EU and 
implemented by the Government, for which the Sectoral Agreement between Montenegro and the EU has been 
signed and ratified.  

 

Montenegro has opened negotiations with the EU on Chapter 11 (Agriculture and Rural Development) in 
December 2016, while negotiations for Chapter 12 (Food Safety), and Chapter 13 (Fisheries) were opened in 
June 2016. The opening benchmarks for these chapters have all been met and negotiations positions adopted by 
the Montenegrin Government. MIDAS activities have actively contributed in supporting the country in reaching 
the EU pre-accession negotiation opening benchmarks for Chapters 11 and 12. In this context, the MARD has 
requested the Bank to continue its support to the Ministry with meeting the closing benchmarks of these two 
chapters and provide additional support towards meeting the closing benchmarks for Chapter 13.

Key Results 
 
 
D. Project Description  
 

The project will include the following components: 
 

Component 1: Strengthening MARD agriculture, rural development and fisheries program (EUR20 million). 

The component will: (i) increase and diversify income generation opportunities for productive units, and 

contribute to the creation of jobs, and (ii) support Montenegro for meeting Chapter 11 closing benchmarks. 

The grant program is expected to address most of the constraints faced by the country’s agricultural sector, 

including: (i) enabling access to finance to grant beneficiaries to adopt modern technologies; (ii) development 

of aggregators to improve collection, storage, packaging and marketing of produce; and (iii) implementation of 

agro-environmental measures to improve resilience to climatic pressures. 

 

Sub-component 1.1: Increasing and diversifying income opportunities through grants for agriculture, rural 

development and fisheries. This sub-component will support the development of agriculture, rural 

development and fisheries through the provision of grants. The design of the grant program will follow the 

implementation experience gained through the MIDAS project, where “the learning by doing” approach has 

been successfully tested with the core principle of IPARD. Investments are pre-financed by the beneficiaries, 

with reimbursement received upon successful completion and on-spot verification of the investment, and 

according to the share of support to total cost of investment (normally between 50 and 65 percent of the total 

investment); four-eye principle both for administrative control and on-spot control, coordination with 

Technical Bodies as appointed for verification of compliance with relevant national legislation. 

 

The grant program will be targeted at: (i) piloting further IPARD-like measures, including farm diversification 
and on-farm processing, that have not been previously implemented in order to develop the capacity of both 
institutions and beneficiaries while stimulating economic growth in rural areas; (ii) implementing direct 
support for rural development measures, including agro-environment measures, that will support MARD’s 
policy objectives towards harmonization with the CAP; (iii) support to production and processing 
associations/collections centers (including for milk, fruit and vegetables, etc.); and (iv) fisheries grants to 
enhance the capacity of the sector in preparation for the implementation of the European Maritime Fisheries 
Fund. The grant program is expected to leverage private sector investment and beneficiaries’ contribution, as 
well complement public sector investment in the modernization of the fisheries sector under Component 3. 
Detailed criteria, procedures, and related safeguards requirements of the grant program will be described in 
the Grant Operational Manual (GOM), satisfactory to the Bank, which will be prepared during project 
implementation prior to each call. 
 

Sub-component 1.2: Strengthening the MARD toward fulfilling EU accession requirements.  This sub-

component will provide investments to strengthen the DfP (future Paying Agency) management capacity 

through the development of the IACS components required for the management and control of payments to 

productive units, as well as the implementation of the European Agriculture Guarantee Fund, functionality of 



which constitute one of the closing benchmark of Chapter 11. The project will support the development of 

several modules necessary for the operational system of integrated controls, strengthen the regional offices 

for Advisory Services, and build the Paying Agency system at the regional level, which will be part of the final 

structure of a fully functional Paying Agency.  For logistical and accessibility purposes, the two services could 

be hosted in the same building but in different offices, however, the roles and responsibilities of the Advisory 

Services and Paying Agency will be well defined and fully separated from each other. To this end the project 

will finance refurbishing and equipping of existing offices, and purchasing the required hardware and software 

infrastructure. The project will also strengthen capacity of the DfRD, DfA, and DfP through provision of 

technical assistance (TA), training and study tours to assist with the policy design towards the EU CAP, and to 

assist with the design required to finalize the IACS and its various applications.  

 

Component 2: Support for the Food Safety, Veterinary and Phytosanitary Services (EUR3 million). This 

component will develop capacity for food safety, veterinary and phytosanitary services as part of the creation 

of an integrated food quality system which is consistent with EU requirements. Promoting safer agricultural 

products, including the prevention and control of animal and plant diseases are essential for improving the 

competitiveness of Montenegro’s agricultural production both domestically and abroad. It will also help 

producers to introduce cross-compliance requirements to receive IPARD funds. This component will support: 

(i) the establishment of an official, comprehensive control system for the safe disposal and/or processing of 

animal by-products (ABPs); (ii) strengthening of the diagnostic capacity of the phytosanitary laboratory; and 

(iii) strengthening of the capacity of the inspection services. The following set of activities will be financed 

under this component: 

 

Sub-component 2.1: Safe management of animal by-products (APBs). The project will support the 

establishment of a comprehensive system for the processing and/or disposal for ABPs which will be identified 

and documented in the National Strategy and Action Plan for the Management of ABPs scheduled to be 

adopted by the MARD in late-2017 or early-2018. Specifically, the project will provide TA for the design of a 

control system for the safe management of ABPs. The design will include a business plan for a disposal facility, 

detailed technical specifications and cost estimates for a housing facility. The project will also support the 

gradual operationalization of the official control system for ABPs along the entire chain (production, 

separation, storage, transport, and disposal and/or processing), including training of inspectors and business 

operators, establishing documented procedures and check lists for the approval of establishments and 

inspection thereof, aligning and completing the legal and regulatory framework in line with the current and 

relevant EU acquis and launching a public information and awareness campaign addressed to the associated 

food production/processing industry.  

 

Sub-component 2.2: Strengthening the diagnostic capacity of the phytosanitary laboratory. The project will 

assist the NRL housed at the Bio-Technical Faculty of the University of Montenegro with construction of new 

laboratory facilities (vertically extending an existing site), procurement of laboratory equipment and fixed 

laboratory furniture to support official controls. The project will also provide targeted TA aiming to ensure 

efficient inter-agency collaboration between the AFSVPA and the NRL by means of a Memorandum of 

Understanding, and pave the way towards accreditation of priority tests and methods as per ISO standard 

17025. 



Sub-component 2.3: Support to inspection services. To enable the inspectors of the unified AFSVPA to 

implement effectively the enhanced official control regime arising from alignment of national legislation with 

EU legislation, and the risk-based annual official control and sampling plan, the project will provide new 

vehicles and equipment for collection, cold storage and transport of samples, IT equipment, protective 

clothing, official uniforms, and other items.  

 

Component 3: Modernization of the Fisheries Sector (EUR6 million).  This component will finance public 

sector investment aimed at achieving two objectives: (i) enhancing the productive capacity of the sector with 

investments in basic infrastructure and equipment that will provide fishermen regulated safe, and sanitary 

landing facilities and access to port, and (ii) strengthening the institutional capacity in the sector to apply the 

CFP upon EU accession, as well as substantially strengthen administrative, inspection, and control capacity. 

This component will finance the following interventions: 

 

Sub-component 3.1: Development of a network of landing sites (both in ports and other locations) with 

enhanced access to auxiliary services. Sub-component. A national coastal urban planning strategy is currently 

being elaborated at various levels of government (both national and local), though it is not expected to be fully 

finalized before 2019. This planning process incorporates the designation of several locations for landing sites, 

including in the country’s six coastal cities, where accommodations can be designed for fishing activities in 

existing ports and in new landing sites to be developed. The port towns of Bar (in the far South of the 

country’s coastline), Herceg Novi (the far North of the country’s coastline) and a network of other sites along 

the coastline will be subject to infrastructure improvements and specific sites for construction and 

reconstruction activities will be identified by the Government. The project will finance TA for the preparation 

of designs and technical specifications required for equipment and infrastructure. The project will also finance 

civil works, including construction of facilities for landing, catch data collection, weighing and access to market 

for landed catches in sites that comply with World Bank norms. In addition, and where appropriate, 

improvements will be made in certain locations for access to water and fuel, and operational support (boat 

and gear maintenance).   

   

Sub-Component 3.2: Capacity Building for the Directorate for Fisheries, and support to Associations of 

Fishermen. The MARD Directorate for Fisheries already benefits from the various regional programs 

supporting the sustainable management of marine living resources. Scientific support is provided mainly by 

the Institute of Marine Biology in Kotor, while the Directorate itself is receiving support in the development of 

rules and regulations pertaining to the sector converging towards the full application of the CFP. The project 

will support training and equipment for fisheries inspectors to enable them to meet EU requirements.  

Significant TA support will be provided to Associations of Fishermen, which will be the direct beneficiaries of 

resources from the European Maritime Fisheries Fund (EMFF) designed mainly to cover the added expenses 

incurred by fishermen in application of CFP rules and regulations.  

 

Component 4: Project Management (EUR1 million). This component will cover the costs for project management 
related to staffing, consultancies, and equipment costs, as well as implementation of the Environmental and Social 
Management Framework (ESMF), monitoring and evaluation of all project activities in line with the Results Framework, 



adequate fiduciary (procurement and financial management), audits and accountability mechanisms for oversight, 
including a grievance redress mechanism.   
 
E. Implementation 
 
Institutional and Implementation Arrangements 
 

The MARD will be the lead Implementing Agency and will have overall responsibility for project management 
and implementation. Following the project implementation structure established under the ongoing MIDAS 
Project, relevant Directorates and Administrations within the MARD will be responsible for the technical 
implementation (i.e. preparing terms of reference and technical specifications, preparing training programs, 
supervising consultants and advisors, participating in procurement evaluation committees, etc.) of project 
activities. Specifically, given the extensive experience on implementation of Bank-funded projects, the General 
Director of the Directorate for Payments (DfP) will be appointed as a Project Coordinator. The Director for 
Rural Development (DfRD) will be responsible for the implementation of Component 1; the Director for the 
AFSVPA will be responsible for the implementation of Component 2; and the General Director of the 
Directorate for Fisheries will oversee Component 3 of the project.  

 

An existing, experienced and well-performing Project Management Team (PMT) established to implement the 
MIDAS Project, will also manage MIDAS2. The PMT is currently housed in the DfP premises, and consists of the 
Project Coordinator (General Director of DfP, civil servant), Project Manager, Civil Engineer, IT specialist and 
Safeguards Specialist. Up to the closing date of the MIDAS Project, i.e. March 30, 2019, the proposed Project 
will continue to be supported by the current PMT staff. Thereafter, sufficient resources will be allocated to 
retain a Project Manager and other staff as required. The project implementation team will also continue to 
rely on a part-time environmental and social specialist, who will take active participation in the screening of 
the grants and direct payments as per the ESMF. The specialist’s tasks will include desk reviews, training and 
guidance of the applicants, and site visits to review compliance with both the World Bank safeguards policies 
and relevant Montenegrin laws. In addition, a Monitoring and Evaluation Specialist and other specialists in the 
field of fisheries and civil engineering will be recruited to support MIDAS2. Details of the above-mentioned 
arrangements will be provided in the Project Operational Manual (POM). 
 

A Project Steering Committee (PSC) will be established and maintained throughout the life of the Project to 
ensure overall coordination and strategic guidance functions. The PSC will be chaired by the Minister of 
Agriculture and Rural Development and will include the Project Coordinator (DfP General Director); General 
Directors of Directorate for Rural Development (DfRD), Directorate for Agriculture (DfA), and Directorate for 
Fisheries (DfF); Director of  the Administration for Food Safety, Veterinary and Phytosanitary Affairs, Advisory 
Services, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Transport and Maritime Affairs, Morsko Dobro, Biotechnical 
Faculty/Phytosanitary Laboratory Director; and representatives of beneficiaries (civil society, local institutions, 
private sector).  

 

Fiduciary responsibilities, including procurement and financial management and disbursement, will be carried 
out by the existing central Technical Services Unit (TSU) under the Ministry of Finance. The TSU will be 
responsible for the preparation of quarterly unaudited financial reports and annual audited financial 
statements. Expenses incurred by the TSU will be financed out of the loan on a pro rata basis with other World 
Bank-financed projects in Montenegro. 


 
 

 
 
 .    
F. Project location and Salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 
 

The project will be implemented throughout Montenegro, including the activities targeting the fisheries 
under Component 3 in the coastal part of Montenegro. The activities on grants and direct payments will 
follow the well established screening procedure from the original MIDAS project, and will help screen out 
activities that may have additional safeguards implications.

SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY 

 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

The project activities on direct payments and grants 
under Component 1 will finance a diverse series of 
activities aimed at improving the agricultural 
practices in country. However, some of these 
activities, as evident from the support provided 
under the original MIDAS project, could have 
environmental impacts and implications. This 
includes, but is not limited to, small scale 
construction of barns, farm facilities, manure 
management platforms, traditional katuni huts, etc. 
The environmental screening procedure has been 
implemented for the original project and will 
continue to be applicable to these activities; the 
procedure has been slightly revised to reflect the 
envisaged project activities including support to the 
fisheries sector, in the form of an ESMF.  
 Furthermore, the ESMF addresses the construction 

and reconstruction activities under Component 3, 
aimed at improving the pier facilities for the 
fisheries.  There are no major environmental impacts 
anticipated at this stage except for the dust and 
noise, material sourcing, and waste management 
with regards to Components 1 and 3. For 
Component 2, the technical assistance provided will 
help establish a sound management system of the 
animal byproducts as a follow on to the strategic 
planning documents to be developed by the client 
towards the end of 2017. These activities will be 
supplemented by adequate due diligence 
documentation prepared based on the final 
management solution of ABPs.  
 

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 No 
The activities will be carried out on already 
established farms on agricultural land and there will 
be no activities involving natural habitats. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No 
There are no activities involving forests foreseen 
under the project. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

The project will support increase and improvement 
in agricultural practices, and may indirectly lead to 
an increase in the pest management practices. The 
project will not support directly purchasing or 
supplying of pest management materials, but the 
project’s ESMF includes a precautionary section on 
PMP. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 No 
There are no activities involving cultural resources 
foreseen under the project. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 No 
There are no activities involving indigenous peoples 
foreseen under the project. 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 No 

The original project triggered the Bank’s Policy OP 
4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement as it was expected 
that the project would finance the construction of 
the Paying Agency building and that land may be 
required to be expropriated for that purpose. The 
Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) document was 
developed, approved and disclosed in November 
2008. However, the implementing Ministry of 
Agriculture and Rural Development decided not to 
construct a new building but rather opted to use the 
existing state-owned building. To date, no land 
acquisition took place under the MIDAS and 
associated IPARD-like grants. As stated in the Grant 
Operational Manual (GOM), only activities that do 



not trigger the application of Bank’s OP 4.12 policy 
on Involuntary Resettlement are eligible for grant 
funding. The Grant scheme support program under 
the proposed project will follow the same eligibility 
criteria which clearly state that the activities which  
may result in displacement of any third party 
formally or informally occupying or using the land on 
which the activity is to be implemented will be 
excluded from financing. Only activities that are 
located on the farmer’s own land or on land for 
which the grant applicant has written consent from 
the owner to use the land will be eligible for funding. 
Additionally, no land acquisition will take place 
under the sub-component on development of the 
landing places (piers) and their auxiliary services in 
the ports of Bar and Herceg Novi as the civil works 
will be carried out in public maritime domain. In 
brief, project will not support any activities which 
might involve involuntary taking of land or physical 
or economic displacement of squatters, scavengers, 
or any other third party formally or informally 
occupying or using the land. 
 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 No 
There are no activities involving dams foreseen 
under the project. 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

No 

The activities under Component 3 aimed at 
supporting and improving the docking facilities for 
fisheries may pose a risk to international waterways, 
i.e. the Adriatic Sea. However, due to the scope of 
works there is very little potential to impact the 
quantity and quality of water to riparians.In 
consultations with LEGEN it was determined that the 
activities are not of such scope or scale that would 
require triggering of this policy. 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No 
 

 
 

KEY SAFEGUARD POLICY ISSUES AND THEIR MANAGEMENT 

 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential 
large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
The potential environmental and social impacts that are foreseen for the activities financed under the project are not 
large scale, significant or irreversible. The activities financed under the project can be broadly grouped into three 

groups, per project components: the grants and direct payments scheme, the support to the fisheries sector through 
small scale infrastructure interventions and the technical assistance towards establishment of a management system 
of animal byproducts (ABPs). The grant scheme activities will be screened using an ESMF and a mechanism established 
under the original MIDAS 1 project. The procedure will screen out activities that correspond to a Category A or that 
trigger additional safeguards policies. For activities that correspond to a World Bank Category B adequate due 
diligence will be prepared. The ESMF also sets up the monitoring and follow up activities that the PMT will undertake. 
The activities supporting the fisheries component will be subject to a Checklist EMP for simple infrastructure works, 
since all of the works anticipated are of a limited scope and to be carried out within the existing marine areas 
designated for reception of the fisheries fleet. Support provided under the animal byproducts Technical Assistance, 
will be supplemented with the adequate environmental and social due dilligence documentation, that would be 
adapted to the final selection of the methods and treatment chosen for safe management of ABPs. 
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area: 
There are no indirect or long term impacts anticipated in the project area due to the project financed activities. All of 
the activities are limited in scope and localized to a given location. 
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts. 
No alternatives have been considered. The ESMF will screen out activities based on the associated impact and 
activities corresponding to a Category A or triggering additional safeguards policies will not be financed. 
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower 
capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The Client has a well established PMT with a part time environmental and social specialist in place. The key staff have 
attended multiple World Bank environmental safeguards trainings and have a good track record along with the 
experience of implementing multiple rounds of grant calls and screening of all received applications. The PMT has 
strong ownership over the screening process and have used each subsequent call to additionally fine-tune the 
screening procedures, and to also conduct environmental awareness raising trainings for all applicants. The Client has 
prepared a revised ESMF coupled with the Checklist EMP for the fisheries component and a precautionary Integrated 
Pest Management Plan and has disclosed this document with the public consultations held on November 10, 2017 in 
Podgorica. 
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, 
with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
The key stakeholders are the project beneficiaries, that is the farmers and agricultural and fisheries workers, along 
with the neighbors and adjacent plots that could be impacted by the supported activities. Additionally, the 
stakeholders that may be involved include the different institutions supporting the development and operations of the 
agricultural sector in country, including government institutions, academia and  non-governmental institutions. The 
client has publically disclosed the ESMF with an announcement made on their website and through the local media for 
the public consultations that were held on November 10, 2017in Podgorica. In addition to the public consultations of 
the ESMF, each of the ESMPs that will be produced under the ESMF procedure will also be subject to public disclosure 
and consultations, as well as the Checklist EMPs for the fisheries infrastructure. Overall, the project has an established 
grieveance redress mechanism where each of the affected parties can communicate directly with the designated 
contact person through established email and telephone contacts.

INTRODUCTION AND CONTEXT 

 
 
 
A. Country Context 
 

The Independent State of Papua New Guinea (PNG) is one of the most culturally diverse countries in the world with over 
800 languages and 1,000 ethnic groups1. It has a total land area of approximately 460,000km2 comprised of 600 islands 
of various sizes, and hosts a remarkably varied number of species and ecosystems. The country is separated into four 
regions – Highlands, Islands, Momase and Southern – and 21 provinces. In 2017, its population was estimated at close to 
8 million2. Of this, over 80 percent live in rural areas and the rest in small urban centers with populations of under 
30,000.    
 
PNG is a relatively stable democracy and had an average GDP growth of 6.85 percent between 2005 and 2010, however 
like other resource-dependent countries, it is feeling the impacts of the fall in global commodity prices, with GDP growth 
estimated at 2.4 percent in 2016 and projected for 2.1 percent in 20173 and real GDP per capita growth in 2016 was 0.3 
percent, down from 10.1 percent in 2014. The country is dominated by two main sectors: the formal, capital-intensive 
mining and energy sector which relies heavily on the country’s rich natural resources and accounts for most of the 
export earnings, and the agriculture sector which, while largely informal, employs an estimated 80 percent of the 
population and accounts for approximately 27 percent of GDP3.  
 
Despite considerable natural wealth and reasonable economic performance over the past decade, PNG’s rural 
population continues to face significant challenges. The disparity between rural and urban living conditions is 
exacerbated by the country’s difficult terrain which increases hardship, poverty, and isolation in rural areas, and limits 
access to basic services, infrastructure and economic markets. Less than 20 percent of rural households have access to 
electricity, 60 percent lack access to safe drinking water, and an estimated 80 percent lack access to improved 
sanitation2.    
 
The 2010 Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) noted that in 2009, approximately 38 percent of the 
population lived below the extreme poverty line of US $1.90 per day, about the same proportion as in 1996.  PNG’s 
Human Development Index (HDI) ranking was 155 in 2010 and improved by one place to 154 in 2015, the second lowest 
in the Pacific2. It has the fourth highest child stunting rate in the world. An estimated 28 percent of children are 
underweight and 5-15 percent are wasted. The highlands region has the highest rates of stunting at 61.5 percent, and 

the island region has the highest wasting and underweight rates at 19 percent and 29.2 percent respectively. The 
economic cost of undernutrition is high, in 2015-2016, it was estimated to have cost the economy 2.81 percent of 
annual GDP (equivalent to US$ 508 million)4.   
 
Gender-based violence (GBV) is widespread in PNG, and the country ranks 158 out of 188 countries in the 2014 Gender 
Inequality Index3. GBV severely affects women’s ability to contribute to the economy, participate in business activities, 
and support family livelihoods. Violence and crime are high along the country’s transport corridors where much of the 
rural population are engaged in agriculture, trade, and the transportation of goods. 
 
PNG’s road network is highly fragmented and poorly maintained with only about 35 percent of national roads sealed2 
and no roads connecting most provinces and ports. PNG’s vulnerability to climate risks and hazards due to climate 
variability and complex geography further exacerbate problems with the transport network resulting in an estimated 75 
percent or more of the road network – national, provincial and district – becoming impassable at some point during the 
year2. The country is subject to both El Niño and La Niña events and both can have significant impacts such as severe 
droughts, landslides and flooding from increased rainfall5. The World Risk Report 2016 ranks PNG 10th, with a risk index 
of 16.43%, due to the country’s high exposure to natural disasters and its high social and economic vulnerability to these 
events6. The February 2018 magnitude 7.5 earthquake and aftershocks affected 544,368 people across five provinces of 
Hela, Southern, Enga, Western and Gulf provinces. In the Southern Highlands and Hela provinces alone, it is estimated to 
have killed over 100 people, displaced 18,200 and left 270,442 people in need of immediate humanitarian assistance. It 
has also left 32% of health facilities closed and, of those that are open, only a third are undamaged7. 
 
B. Sectoral and Institutional Context 
 
Sectoral context:  
PNG is characterized by its diverse agro-ecological environments (highlands, lowlands, islands), favorable climate and 
fertile soils allowing the farming of many different agricultural products, including both cultivation of cash and staple 
crops, as well as livestock production. While PNG’s export economy is presently dominated by minerals (gold and 
copper) and oil, the contribution of agricultural exports in the renewable resources sector is significant, at around 
23.1%. The main agricultural exports of the country include cocoa, coffee, copra, palm oil, rubber, and tea. The 
predominant mode of farming is in smallholder farms of less than 5 ha. Village agriculture, which supports over 80 
percent of the population, remains dominated by subsistence food production. It generates little cash income and is 
characterized by low productivity. Despite good intentions, governments, commodity boards and agencies have 
provided village farmers with little help to raise their productivity in order to improve food and nutrition security, and to 
enable them to participate more effectively in commercial activities. Translation of new knowledge to business and 
commercial opportunities has been lacking for many years. Major crops, except palm oil, have historically been 
marketed by statutory marketing boards. These arrangements as well as measures in the past such as stabilization funds 
for selected commodities (coffee, cocoa, and coconuts) have not been efficient, with over regulation of major 
commodities perhaps impeding agricultural development. In the past, labor-intensive plantation estates of some 50-150 
hectares have grown tree products for export, especially palm oil, coffee, cocoa, coconut, tea, and rubber, but except 
for palm oil, their production share is decreasing to the benefit of smallholder farmers. 
 
Coffee and cocoa are key cash crops. Papua New Guinea is considered a small coffee producer in the international 
market, but the high quality of its coffee and cocoa is recognized and sought after. Nearly 30 and 20 percent of the total 

       
     

labor force in the country is engaged in the production of coffee and cocoa, respectively. The majority of coffee is under 
the production of smallholder farmers with low productivity, and diseconomies of scale, and the main constraint is the 
limited capacity of the country to reliably meet market demand in quantity and quality. The development of coffee and 
cocoa production as an agribusiness for smallholder farmers is limited due to several constraints. These include: high 
transaction costs due to diseconomies of scale, limited market access, lack of access to information and technologies 
due to poor extensions services, poor rural infrastructure, and lack of access to rural finance. 
 
A robust internal fresh food and livestock products market exists. However, value chains are not well developed. 
Livestock production, except for pigs and poultry, remains static or on the decline since the 1970s. Meat consumption in 
PNG on the other hand, has increased steadily over the last two decades, and is predicted to increase at a conservative 
rate of 5% per annum. Increased demand for meat is met by meat imports, and is influenced by population growth rate, 
urbanization, changes in disposable income of citizens, and changes in people’s eating habits. 
 
Agriculture has under-performed. This is due primarily to low productivity, largely reflecting inadequate research and 
development, poor application of technological improvements and lack of scale economies inherent in smallholder 
farming. Other major constraints include inadequate transport and marketing infrastructure facilities, unreliable and 
expensive utilities, poor extension and veterinary services, prevalent crime and lawlessness, and insecurity of land 
ownership and tenure. However, some reasons for hope exist. For instance, the World Bank funded Productive 
Partnerships in Agriculture project (PPAP – P110959) is demonstrating in the coffee and cocoa sectors that the 
productive partnership model can help overcome some of the bottlenecks and facilitate the integration of smallholder 
farmers into effective supply/value-chains and link them to markets, which remains a priority for the Government of 
PNG (GoPNG). In the PPAP model, farmers join a partnership coordinated by a “Lead Partner (LP)” (the private sector in 
70 percent of cases, although sometimes an NGO or academic institution) through paying a small fee (contribution to 
the planned activities). The LP access a grant from the project to purchase tools and seedlings (including innovative 
cocoa clones) to be distributed to farmers, renovate processing facilities or organize training on a broad range of topics; 
technical (coffee or cocoa on-farm good practice), gender, HIV-AIDS, nutrition, etc. This increased proximity between LPs 
and the smallholder farmers has greatly contributed to: (i) increasing their on-farm productivity (over two-fold as of the 
time of writing), and (ii) link them to a potential buyer and therefore the markets.  
 
In December 2014, the World Bank completed a piece of analytical work studying the role of women in the agriculture 
sector in PNG8, notably related to coffee, cocoa and fresh produce. The main finding was that women provide 
substantial labor in both coffee and cocoa cultivation, and they dominate in the fresh produce sectors. More important 
than the amount of labor women provide, analysis of these supply chains indicated that the specific tasks women 
undertake have a direct bearing on the quality of the final product. However, different labor dynamics, gender-specific 
barriers to access key services (extension and financial) and insecurity (violence limiting women’s ability to serve in the 
field as researchers and extension agents) affect this potential outcome. In early 2018, a more specific gender time-use 
study among PPAP farmers9 highlighted that there is an imbalance between men and women’s time-use with possible 
discrimination against women which negatively impacts crop productivity and household welfare. Beside household 
awareness-raising and training on gender dynamics, reducing the domestic work burden for women before they can 
engage in more value-added agricultural activities should be a priority. 
 
Institutional context:  


The GoPNG’s Vision 2050 details the long-term development strategy for PNG.  Launched in 2009, the document sets 
out a vision for transforming the country by 2050 towards a top 50 ranking in the HDI10. It leverages seven strategic 
pillars – human development, wealth creation, environment and climate change, planning, systems and institutions, 
security and international relations, and partnerships with churches – to build this vision and realign the country’s 
economic focus away from the mining and energy sectors which currently dominate development, to new growth 
bases in agriculture, fisheries, forestry, manufacturing and eco-tourism.   
 
Vision 2050 acknowledges both the importance of subsistence agriculture to the rural economy and the cultural lives of 
many, as well as the significant challenges faced by the sector including limited markets, poor infrastructure, ineffective 
extension services, and security and safety concerns.  
 
The previous GoPNG’s National Agriculture Development Plan (NADP) 2007-2016 (currently being updated) recognized 

the importance of the agricultural sector in developing the economic potential of the country, sustaining the basic 

livelihoods of its population, increasing social wellbeing, and providing food security for all. However, its 

implementation has faced several challenges relating to the limited capacity of the Department of Agriculture and 

Livestock (DAL) to enhance implementation performance and monitor progress of outcomes in the sector. 

 
The GoPNG’s Alotau Accord II operationalizes the National Strategy for Responsible and Sustainable Development 
through the Medium-Term Development Plan (MTDP) III reflecting the principles of the PNG Vision 2050 and the PNG 
Development Strategic Plan 2010 - 2030. High on the list of priorities is the adoption of a national population policy 
aimed at accelerating economic growth by using economic stimulus packages in the non-minerals sector (agriculture, 
tourism, fisheries and forestry) to keep pace with a population currently increasing at a growth rate of about 3 percent 
annually.  
 
The government has placed greater emphasis on growing the agriculture sector by giving it greater prominence in its 
2018 budget allocation. To emphasize this commitment, the government held the first ever National Agriculture 
Summit in November 2017 to exchange experiences on successful models. The key priorities from the summit are to: (i) 
grow the economy; (ii) promote import substitution; (iii) promote more accessible and affordable credit; and (iv) place 
greater focus on institutional strengthening. 
 
C. Relationship to CPF 
 

The 2017 PNG Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) is under preparation and is scheduled for Board approval in early 
May 2018. The SCD recognizes the World Bank Group’s long-standing history of support to the agriculture sector in PNG, 
currently led by the Productive Partnerships in Agriculture Project (PPAP). Since 2011, the PPAP has been providing 
support to smallholder coffee and cocoa farmers with the aim of improving their livelihoods. Important lessons have 
emerged from the implementation of the PPAP which could assist the SCD to identify opportunities for inclusive growth 
in the agriculture sector in PNG, and support the World Bank Group’s twin goals of ending extreme poverty and boosting 
shared prosperity. The third Pillar of the draft SCD (Enabling private sector development for inclusive job creation and 
growth) recognizes the central role played by agriculture in providing opportunities for inclusive growth and bolstering 
food security. The SCD recommends an “extension of PPAP-type programs to more districts and regions and more crop-
types” – which is exactly what the PACD intends to do. 

PROPOSED PDO/RESULTS 

    

 
A. Proposed Development Objective(s) 
 

To increase the productivity and access to markets of target smallholder farmers and small and medium enterprises 
(SMEs) for selected agricultural value-chains, in selected economic corridors.  

 
B. Key Results 
 

Progress will be measured against the following PDO-level indicators: 
 

(a) Increased farm yields of crops and livestock in target value-chains 

(b) Increased volume of sale of selected value-chains at both farm gate and processing SMEs levels

A detailed results framework will be developed during preparation. Specific gender and citizen engagement indicators 
will be added in this results framework.  
 

PROJECT CONTEXT 

 
A. Concept 
 
1. Description 

 
The Productive Partnerships in Agriculture Project (PPAP P110959 + PPAP AF P146003) is scheduled to close on June 30, 
2019 and has delivered significant benefits to PNG’s cocoa and coffee sector farmers. In order to build on and 
consolidate PPAP’s achievements, the PNG Agriculture Commercialization and Diversification Project (PACD) would 
continue to support the cocoa and coffee sectors, and may also add the following commodities: small livestock, spices, 
rubber and coconuts. The additional commodities to be supported under the new project will be narrowed down to 2 
or 3 commodities based on criteria, including level of preparedness of the value-chain and possible return on 
investments11. Further stock-taking will be required during the project preparation, including, if the need is identified, 
specific value-chain analysis to help the decision-making process. DAL has already started this work which should be 
completed prior to pre-Appraisal. The FAO Investment Center will support the DAL and the WB Task Team in this stock-
taking exercise and commodity final selection. 
 
Beneficiaries: GoPNG’s emphasis is on agriculture to accelerate economic growth and generate revenues, this may 
require a targeted approach towards farmers willing to move from subsistence to semi-commercial or commercial 
farming (therefore being less inclusive than in the case of PPAP). However, the smallholder farmers remain the primary 
direct beneficiaries of the new project, together with the groups and cooperatives formed by those better-off and 
willing to address common issues collectively. While building on PPAP, considerations around the possibility of looking 
at a complementary window targeting more progressive farmers and those who are ready to take risks and form more 

                                            
11 Agreed criteria comprise: (i) competitiveness and existence of a market justifying good return on investments, (ii) availability of technical advisory and 
extension services for these specific commodities, whether of public or private origin, (iii) tradition of integrating the selected commodities in cocoa and 
coffee farming system, as a diversification strategy, (iv) importance of women participation in the specific commodities, (v) share of the value-chains’ 
income remaining with the smallholder producers, (vi) size of the population involved or benefiting from the selected commodities, and (vii) commitment 
of different level of Government (including Provincial and District) to it. 

commercial alliances under a common set of constraints and opportunities will be explored. Additional direct 
beneficiaries will be SMEs (mainly micro- and small private enterprises) involved in agri-business activities (storage, 
processing, marketing, inputs supply). DAL and Commodities Board staff will also benefit from capacity building 
interventions. 
  
Regarding the geographical scope, the MTDP identifies ten “Economic Corridors” for priority services delivery, defining 
zones for development of public transport and utilities network, social services and integration of economic plans 
including agriculture. The PACD will align its geographical scope to this GoPNG strategy and support some of these 
economic corridors, based on transparent selection criteria to be defined during preparation. 
 
The PNG Agriculture Commercialization and Diversification Project (PACD) -  interventions will be delivered through five 
components:  

 
Component 1: Institutional capacity building 
The project will address institutional capacity gaps at (i) the central level - DAL, statutory bodies in charge of 
commodities targeted under the project (Cocoa Board, Coffee Industry Corporation, Spices Industry Board, the 
Livestock Development Corporation (LDC) and the Rubber Board – list to be confirmed as per commodities selected 
under the project) and links with the private sector – and, (ii) the decentralized level – provincial and district capacity to 
deliver services: extension, advisory and veterinary services, access to inputs. Research needs may also be included and 
will depend on further discussion during preparation.  
  
This first component will also support the GoPNG in reviewing and, if required, reforming their policy and regulatory 
framework, notably on climate-smart agriculture, extension and veterinary services, quality standards and food safety. 
 
Component 2: Infrastructure networks and logistics 
The infrastructure network, including roads and storage/processing facilities, remains a major bottleneck to farmers’ 
capacity to access markets. This project should contribute to its improvement, with a focus on infrastructure that has a 
public good nature and is essential to the selected value chains. Examples of such infrastructure include feeder roads, 
municipality-managed small-scale slaughterhouses (ensuring better food safety and waste management / pollution 
reduction) or laboratories (for safety and quality tests). As per the PPAP model, feeder roads will be designed and 
constructed to be resistant to heavy rains occurring during the rainy season: they will be slightly curved, include large 
concrete gutters on the side and small log-bridges on water stream sites – therefore adapted to heavy rains which are 
increasing and longer-lasting due to climate change. 
 
Component 3: Productive Partnership-like interventions 
Integrating smallholder farmers into effective supply/value-chains and linking them to markets remains a priority for 
the GoPNG. For this, the Productive Partnerships’ model implemented under the PPAP has been successful and should 
be a strong building block to scale-up. However, additional focus should be put on approaches that promote the 
establishment and capacity building of farmers’ cooperatives that will strengthen the sustainability of the model, 
among other lessons learned.  
 
This component will promote access to services and markets by facilitating the establishment of Productive 
Partnerships, and their access to finance (Matching Grants; involvement of financial institutions) that could finance 
small collective infrastructure (e.g. small storage and processing facilities like community-managed cocoa 
fermenteries), and the introduction of innovative technologies, notably on climate smart agriculture (agro-forestry, 

water collection and micro-irrigation, drought resistance varieties, intensification of small livestock production such as 
poultry and pigs, and bio-digesters). This will be done through establishing two windows for financing:  

(i) one focusing on on-farm productivity (garden regeneration, innovative technologies, etc.) and more inclusive 

regarding smallholder farmers willing/unwilling to join partnerships – this window will expand on the PPAP 

model where a Lead Partner (often from the private sector) can aggregate smallholder farmers and channel 

support to them (advisory services, training, inputs); and  

(ii) one focusing on value-addition and marketing of products, and targeting better-off farmers willing to address a 

common issue (storage, agro-processing, marketing, access to inputs, etc.) collectively through groups and 

cooperatives who become the recipient of the funds. 

 
Component 4: Project Management and Monitoring and Evaluation:  
This activity would support all PCU activities required to manage IDA funds, procure IDA-funded goods and services, 
conduct project M&E including Iterative Beneficiary Monitoring (IBM),12 and comply with safeguard mitigation 
measures.  It would provide training and equipment to modernize DAL operations (computer hardware and software, 
office furniture, vehicles, and so on) at the central level and in the field as needed for project activities. It would also 
support the development and implementation of a communications strategy, as well as general awareness and 
sensitization campaigns about project activities. 
 
Component 5: Contingency Emergency Response Component (Total Cost: US$0):  

Following an eligible crisis or emergency, the government of PNG may request the Bank to re-allocate project funds to 
support emergency response and reconstruction. This component would draw from the uncommitted grant resources 
under the project from other project components to cover an emergency response. These activities would be carried 
out, as needed, to ensure continued achievement of the project development objective. This component will only be 
used in the event that an emergency response is required. 
 
    

  SAFEGUARDS 

 
A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 

 
Target provinces and districts are yet to be confirmed. The project is likely to support core coca production areas in the 

province of East New Britain, the autonomous Region of Bougainville (tropical island regions) and East Sepik (Momase 
Region), and coffee production areas in the provinces of Eastern Highlands, Western Highlands and Simbu (highlands 
regions). The project may expand its geographical coverage with potential support in the livestock, spices, rubber and 
coconut sectors in the same areas.  
PNG is characterized by diverse agricultural and ecological environments, tropical climate and fertile soils. Physical 

characteristics vary considerably between regions and will be described once project location and sectors are confirmed. 
 
B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 

 
The project will be implemented by the Department of Agriculture and Livestock (DAL - lead agency) through a Project 

                                            
12 This activity would monitor beneficiaries of the project starting at the beginning of the implementation with the objective to improve project 
efficiency and increase beneficiary satisfaction and beneficiary engagement. IBM collects information on project implementation, even in insecure 
settings. It is light, low-cost, and rapidly complements project supervision. The approach is problem-oriented and provides feedback to project 
teams through different iterations with the aim of catalyzing improvements in project implementation. IBM collects data directly from beneficiaries 
but keeps data collection efforts to a minimum by relying on few research questions and small samples. 



Coordination Unit (PCU), with specific Project Management Units (PMUs) established for each selected commodity. The 
Department of Works (DOW) will be designated responsibility for infrastructure networks and logistics activities related 
to rural feeder (not paved) roads. 
 
Capacity for implementing safeguard policies is currently weak in each of these agencies. The DAL lacks specific 

safeguard resources. The current World Bank financed PPAP has addressed safeguard capacity constraints within the 
cocoa and coffee PMUs however capacity remains limited and confined to these sub-sectors. DOW has an Environmental 
Management Unit (EMU) however this unit is under-resourced and relatively inexperienced. To address these constraints, 
the PACD will establish a core safeguards team consisting of senior environmental and social specialists within the PCU to 
ensure the effective implementation of safeguard policies across all project activities. The PACD will also finance 
additional environmental and social specialists within DOW to oversee safeguard requirements for project infrastructure 
network and logistic activities related to rural roads. 
 

 
C. Environmental and Social Safeguards Specialists on the Team 

 
Thomas John Callander, Social Safeguards Specialist 
Nicholas John Valentine, Environmental Safeguards Specialist 
Nathalie Suzanna Noella Staelens, Environmental Safeguards Specialist 

 
D. Policies that might apply 

 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

The project is proposed as Category B. The proposed 
investments are small-scale and potential adverse 
impacts can be managed. There are no potential large-
scale, significant or irreversible impacts associated 
with the project. 
 
The project will finance small collective infrastructure 
for partnerships (Component 3) including innovative 
technologies, notably on climate smart agriculture 
(agro-forestry, water collection and micro-irrigation, 
drought resistance varieties, intensification of small 
livestock production (poultry, pigs) and bio-digesters) 
that have the potential for positive impacts on the 
environment. Negative environmental and social 
impacts associated with these activities are expected 
to be minor, localized and temporary primarily 
because of their small-scale and 
household/community focus. 
 
The project will invest in infrastructure networks to 
improve access to market (Component 2). This will 
involve the rehabilitation of feeder roads and the 
development of small-scale community infrastructure

(e.g. small-scale slaughter house and laboratories). 
These small-scale investments have the potential to 
cause some minor adverse environmental and social 
impacts however these are readily managed through 
standard mitigation measures. 
 
An Environmental and Social Management Framework 
(ESMF) is proposed as the safeguards instrument given 
that the specific locations of the investments are not 
known and these will be determined through the 
partnership/grant process. The ESMF will incorporate 
the requirements of the World Group’s 
Environmental, Health and Safety Guidelines (EHSGs) 
and industry specific guidelines for agribusiness, food 
production and pesticides management. 
 
The project also includes a Contingency Emergency 
Response Component to support emergency activities 
that ensure continued achievement of the project 
development objective. The ESMF will outline the 
approach and principles for managing potential E&S 
impacts and risks of the CERC including a screening 
process in accordance with the World Bank’s Rapid 
Response to Crises and Emergencies: Procedural 
Guidelines. 

Performance Standards for Private Sector 
Activities OP/BP 4.03 

No  

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 No 

The project will not finance any activities that 
significantly convert or degrade any protected areas or 
natural habitats as the screening procedures in the 
ESMF will exclude all subprojects with these impacts. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 Yes 

Potential project target sectors including cocoa, spices 
and rubber are frequently associated with agro-
forestry in PNG, often in a positive way. No adverse 
impacts on forests are anticipated. The ESMF will 
contain measures to properly manage the risk of any 
unforeseen adverse environmental impacts of these 
activities. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

The project will support the sustainable use of 
chemical fertilizers and pesticides within an holistic 
farm management model and integrated pest 
management approach. The client will review and 
update the current PPAP Integrated Pest Management 
(IPM) following the standards and requirements set 
forth in OP4.09 and the World Group’s Environmental, 
Health and Safety Guidelines (EHSGs) for agribusiness 


and food production. The project will include 
measures to strengthen the institutional capacity for 
implementing IPM in project areas. This will include a 
stronger focus on health and safety. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 No 

The project will not finance any activities that will have 
impacts on physical cultural resources. Screening and 
chance find procedures will be included in the ESMF to 
exclude all subprojects with these impacts. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 Yes 

The project is likely to be located in areas where 
Indigenous Peoples are the sole or the overwhelming 
majority of direct project beneficiaries. Accordingly, a 
separate Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework 
(IPPF) is not proposed. Rather, in accordance with the 
provisions of OP 4.10, the elements of an IPPF is 
included in the overall project design.  
 
The ESMF will outline steps for ensuring free and prior 
informed consultation are undertaken and broad 
community support is achieved for each Partnership 
and Infrastructure activity under Components 2 and 3 
respectively. This will include a Beneficiaries 
Partnership Framework and Consultation Guidelines. 
 
A Social Assessment will be conducted across target 
sectors/provinces during project preparation to inform 
project design and will include consultations with 
farming communities, local level government 
representatives, grower associations and 
cooperatives, youth and women’s groups, extension 
workers, the private sector, and other relevant 
stakeholders. 
. 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

At present, no involuntary land acquisition is expected 
under the project. The majority of sub-projects will be 
undertaken on customary land with the voluntary 
participation of grants scheme recipient landowners. 
The only exception will be the siting of collective 
infrastructure facilities which will be either on 
Government-owned land or land secured via voluntary 
land donation. A Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) 
will be prepared to address these potential scenarios. 
The RFP will include a voluntary land donation 
protocol to ensure that this approach is properly used, 
verified and documented. 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 No 
The project will not finance any dams as defined under 
OP 4.37. 


Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

No 
The project does not impact or relate to any known 
international waterways as defined under the policy. 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No 
The project is not located in any known disputed areas 
as defined under the policy. 

 
E. Safeguard Preparation Plan  
 
Tentative target date for preparing the Appraisal Stage PID/ISDS 
 
Aug 31, 2018 
 
Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed. The specific studies and 
their timing should be specified in the Appraisal Stage PID/ISDS 
 
The PPAP PCU is in charge of coordinating the preparation of the proposed PACD. Safeguards specialists working for the 

PPAP, together with the support of external safeguards consultants, will conduct the social assessment and consultations 
across target sectors/provinces to inform project design and the preparation of ESMF and RFP. 
 
A Project preparation Advance (PPA) will be processed once the Concept Note is approved and the procurement process 

for these consultants will start after. Therefore, first drafts of these studies are not expected before end of August 2018.

 Country and Sector Background 

Moldova has experienced rapid growth and poverty reduction over the past decade, 

although deterioration in external conditions and increased governance challenges since 

2014 have led to slower growth. Since the early 2000s, the economy has expanded by an 

average of 5 percent a year. Poverty declined substantially to 11 percent in 2014 from 26 

percent in 2007 (using the national poverty line) and from much higher levels earlier in the 

decade. Consumption growth among the bottom 40 percent of the population w as consistently 

higher than average consumption growth. Since 2014, however, external conditions have 

deteriorated significantly with the slowdown in the European Union (EU) and the Russian 

Federation on which Moldova is dependent for trade and remittances. This, together with a 

series of summer droughts and increased governance challenges, particularly in the financial 

sector, have resulted in slower growth in Moldova. The economy contracted by 0.5 percent in 

2015 and public and guaranteed debt increased to 46.6 percent of gross domestic product 

(GDP) from 38.2 percent a year earlier. A rebound in agriculture, in 2016, together with recent 

reforms are helping Moldova respond to adversity. Growth is projected to improve modestly to 

2.2 percent in 2016. 

Progress in poverty reduction has been driven largely by remittances and pensions, with 

the reform program supported by DPO-2 taking initial steps toward addressing the 

medium-term challenge of shifting toward greater sustainability. Remittances have made a 

significant contribution to domestic income, which has fueled private consumption and, 

together with exports, driven economic growth. Remittances, mainly going to rural areas where 

many of the poor are, have also contributed to poverty reduction and the welfa re improvement 

of the bottom 40. Pensions have also played an important role in raising incomes among the 
population, although mainly in urban areas. At the same time, employment has declined, led by 

falling labor force participation rates among both men and women which have reached very 

low levels compared to other countries. This declining labor supply is largely explained by a 

combination of greater emigration flows, the segment of the inactive labor force who have 

future migration plans, and informal workers who drop out of the labor force, all symptoms of 

low labor demand and limited availability of productive jobs. In fact, the lack of jobs and the 

wage differential with richer neighboring countries continue to motivate emigration. Going 

forward, the reforms to improve the business climate, enhance financial sector stability, and 

improve expenditure efficiency should help Moldova move toward a more sustainable model 

of growth and poverty reduction driven by private sector job creation. 

European integration has anchored the government’s policy reform agenda since 2009, 

but political instability and governance challenges have slowed the pace of reform.  
Negotiations between Moldova and the EU on an Association Agreement and a Deep and 

Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement began in 2010 and were concluded on June 27, 2014, 

with the signing of both documents. Visa-free access for Moldovan citizens travelling to the 

Schengen area went into effect in April 2014. However, periodic breakdowns in pro -European 

coalitions made progress uneven. Governance challenges have continued to take the center 

stage, as exemplified by the banking fraud revealed in 2014 that involved the loss of the 

equivalent of over 10 percent of the country’s GDP. After a period of short -lived governments, 

the Government of Mr. Filip was appointed in January 2016, dedicating policy efforts on 

stabilizing the macroeconomic situation, increasing transparency, and addressing identified 

weaknesses in the financial sector. 

The proposed operation supports the efforts of the Moldovan authorities to address key 

constraints to inclusive and sustainable growth by consolidating reform efforts in three 

areas. Accordingly, the proposed operation is built around three pillars, which are also the 

program development objectives. The first pillar of the operation seeks to strengthen the 

regulatory framework to improve predictability of the business environment, fac ilitate 

competition, and reduce regulatory compliance costs. The second pillar aims at strengthening 

financial sector stability, promoting transparency of shareholding, and easing conditions for 

access to finance. The third pillar, focusing on the quality of public spending, seeks to improve 

the public investment management (PIM) framework, make investment subsidies in agriculture 

more efficient and equitable, and improve the coverage of well-targeted social assistance 

programs. The reform program builds on strong complementarity with other World Bank 

Group instruments in Moldova, including investment projects and analytical and advisory 

activities. In addition, although not a formal continuation of the previous program, the first two 

pillars of this series support the implementation of select laws supported by the 

Competitiveness DPO (approved in FY2013). 

 Operation Objectives 

The proposed DPL series supports the Government of Moldova's to improve the business 

climate, promote financial sector stability and development, and improve the equity and 

efficiency of public expenditure. The proposed operation is the second in a planned 

programmatic series of two single-tranche operations supporting key policy and institutional 

reforms with three development objectives: 



 Pillar A: Strengthen the regulatory framework to improve predictability of the business 
environment, facilitate competition and reduce regulatory compliance costs. 

 Pillar B: Strengthen financial sector stability, promote transparency of shareholding and ease 
conditions for access to finance. 

 Pillar C: Improve the public investment management framework, make investment subsidies 
in agriculture more efficient and equitable and improve the coverage of well-targeted social 

assistance programs. 

The Pillar A seeks to improve the business environment facing Moldovan companies and 

farms. Supported measures aim to reduce the burden of regulatory and compliance costs of state 

inspections and to enhance competition and to set up an institutional mechanism for information 

collection on all state aid to increase transparency on how state aid is granted and contribute to a 

more efficient use of state budget resources. 

The objective of the Pillar B is to support the Moldovan authorities to build a more 

sustainable, resilient, and transparent financial sector that can prudently expand access 

to financial services. The policy actions address priority reforms in the areas of the corporate 

shares registry, the integrity of shareholders’ ownership rights, corporate gover nance 

standards, shareholder transparency, and proper supervision by NBM and NCFM. Reforms 

under this pillar are also aimed at enhancing access to finance, which continues to constrain 

private sector development, especially for SMEs and entrepreneurs. 

Pillar C focuses on improving the public investment management framework, making 

investment subsidies in agriculture more efficient and equitable and improving the 

coverage of well-targeted social assistance programs. Existing inefficiencies and inequities 

in the allocation and implementation of public investment resources, including in the 

agriculture sector, and the erosion of coverage in well-targeted social assistance programs 

reduce the effectiveness of public spending for reaching national strategic objec tives, poverty 

reduction and promoting shared prosperity. Transforming the economy will require significant 

upgrades in infrastructure through public investments. Moreover, adequate appraisal of 

investment projects ensures cost effectiveness. Agricultural support to small or individual 

farmers is still modest, and does not reflect their current and potential role in high -value 

agricultural production. 

 Rationale for Bank Involvement 

This operation (second in a programmatic series of two) supports efforts of the 

Government to improve the business climate, promote financial sector stability and 

development, and improve the equity and efficiency of public expenditure, and is aligned 

with the National Development Strategy “Moldova 2020” (NDS). The three pillars of the 

operation directly support three of the eight national priorities in the NDS: “improving the 

business climate” (supported by Pillar A), “reducing financing costs” (supported by Pillar B), 

and “ensuring competitiveness of agro-food products” (supported by Pillar A and C). In 

addition, improving the public investment management framework is expected to contribute to 

efficiency of public spending, and ultimately, to growth. Increasing the coverage of well -

targeted social assistance programs is expected to contribute to poverty reduction and to 

increase shared prosperity, while maintaining fiscal sustainability. The reforms supported in 

this DPL series are informed by substantial technical assistance and analytical work. This 



includes both recently completed and ongoing activities, with strong collaboration with other 

development partners. 

This operation is a key component of the CPS for FY14-17. The CPS discussed by the 

Board in September 2013 includes three pillars: (i) Increasing competitiveness; (ii) En hancing 

human capital and minimizing social risks; (iii) Promoting a green, clean, and resilient 

Moldova. The DPO operation will directly support the first pillar of the CPS, improving 

economic competitiveness. It will also contribute to the second pillar (minimizing social risks) 

by strengthening the efficiency of the social assistance system. In addition, reforms aiming at 

making public expenditure more efficient and equitable support the cross -cutting governance 

theme of the CPS.

 Institutional and Implementation Arrangements 

The reform program supported by this operation builds on strong complementarily with 

other World Bank Group instruments in Moldova, including investment projects and 

analytical and advisory activities. The operation is complemented in each area by technical 

assistance and investment lending. TA in investment climate reform and competition policy 

has strongly informed the policy reforms in these areas. On the investment side, the 

Competitiveness Enhancement Project II, complements the DPO series with Regulatory 

Reform, SME Development and Access to Finance components. The World Bank Group’s 

Competition Policy Team provided technical assistance to the Competition Council to help 

implement the state aid registry. Reforms in the financial sector are also supported by the 

programmatic technical assistance. Reforms in public investment management are supported 

by technical assistance under the programmatic Public Expenditure Review and the Trust Fund 

for Strengthening Public Investment Management. In social assistance, the DPO complements 

the on-going Strengthening the Effectiveness of the Social Safety Net results-based SIL.  

 Risks and Risk Mitigation 

The overall risks to this operation are substantial. Key risks are: (i) political and 

governance; (ii) macroeconomic; (iii) sector policies and institutions and (iv) institutional 

capacity for implementation and sustainability. The overall risk rating level of the proposed 

DPO is substantial. To partially mitigate these risks, the Bank team has consulted with 

Parliamentarians as many proposed policy measures require parliamentary passage. In 

addition, the policy actions across all three pillars of this operation help increase transparency 

and promote good governance. Finally, development partners, including the International 

Monetary Fund and the European Commission remain engaged in policy dialogue, technical 

assistance, awareness campaigns and financing (including three-year IMF EEF program  

 Poverty and Social Impacts (PSI) and Environmental Aspects 

The policies and reforms supported by the operation are expected to have positive 

distributional and gender impacts and thus help reduce poverty and promote shared 



prosperity. Pillar C will make fiscal policy more equitable and efficient and therefore have a 

direct effect on poverty reduction and the promotion of shared prosperity. Pillars A and B will 

contribute to the twin goals indirectly by helping provide opportunities for business growth, 

supporting fair and transparent institutions and improving the functioning of financial markets, 

thereby enabling higher growth. No measure is expected to have negative distributional or 

gender impacts. Measures under pillar A are expected to promote employment growth in 

sectors that have a high share of women’s employment such as agriculture (which accounts for 

27.3 percent of women’s employment) and services, where the largest share of employed 

women works. 

Among the measures expected to have a direct positive impact on poverty, the measures 

to increase the inclusion of small farms in the agriculture support program are expected 

to be pro-poor and to contribute to strengthen the livelihoods of the rural poor.  According 

to the 2011 agricultural census overall most corporate subsidy recipients are large farms, with 

30 percent of all corporate farms receiving subsidies against 7 percent of individual farms. For 

both individual and corporate farms, the share of subsidy recipients is slightly lower among 

female-headed than male-headed farms. Redirecting resources to small farmers is the more 

important considering the high incidence of poverty in rural areas vis a vis urban ones (14.5 

percent versus 1 percent in big cities and 5.7 percent in small towns), and the particularly high 

incidence of poverty among farmers and agricultural workers (12.5 and 13.9 percent 

respectively).  

The measures aimed at facilitating the use of movable collateral, based on international 

experience, can be expected to benefit smaller firms in the service sector which have 

limited fixed assets, and therefore have a positive (if small) distributional impact.  The 

cogency of the constraints faced by smaller firms in accessing credit is illustrated by the 20 13 

Enterprise Survey which indicates that over a third of firms with fewer than 20 employees, and 

in particular those managed by women, that applied for a loan were rejected. To the extent that 

these measures extent to agricultural enterprises the poverty reducing impact of these measures 

will be amplified (about 6.5 percent of the poor lives in households engaged in entrepreneurial 

activities outside of agriculture, but the share rises to 23 percent when agriculture is included). 

The parametric changes in the Ajutor Social social assistance program of last resort have 

explicit positive pro-poor and gender impact. Indeed, the rationale for the changes is to stop 

the erosion of the potential beneficiary base of the program. By directly supporting the income 

of a significant proportion of the poorest households in the country, these measures were 

estimated to reduce poverty by as much as 0.5 percentage points, with additional 

improvements in the livelihoods of the poor not captured by a decrease in poverty incidence  

(but in lower depth and severity of poverty). The proposed policy action is not expected to 

substantially modify the gender incidence of these programs, but as 57 percent of adult 

recipients of Ajutor social in 2015 were women, this measure is expected to have a positive 

gender impact.  

The withdrawal of the licenses from BEM, Banca Sociala, and Unibank and their 

liquidation has affected negatively the workers who lost their jobs and were not absorbed 

by other banks. The country’s regime of severance packages (growing with years of tenure in 

the job so that for example it would provide 9.6 weeks of salary for those employed for one 

year, and 18.6 weeks of salary for those with 10 years of tenure) was applied to cushion the 

shock on those who lost their job. Given wage levels in the banking sector (almost twice as 



high as the average for the economy) those severance packages were quite generous (the 

equivalent of 6.3 times the poverty line for those with one year of tenure in the job and of 27 

times the poverty line for those with ten years of tenure). In addition, because of their higher 

than average wages, workers in this group were not among the most poor and vulnerable (in 

2015 only 9 percent of workers in the financial sector were among the bottom 40 percent). 

Finally, there is at least anecdotal evidence that several employees from the banks that were 

liquidated were reabsorbed elsewhere in the sector. Other negative impacts of the bank 

liquidations, such as the losses for the depositors were fully compensated for during the 

liquidation process. 

The DPO environmental assessment (EA) and of the proposed priority actions shows most 

of them are either neutral or beneficial for the environment (see Annex 4). Measures in 

Pillar C to improve the public investment management framework and make investment 

subsidies in agriculture more efficient and equitable would eventually lead to better natural 

resource management, promotion of organic agriculture, energy efficiency and climate change 

adaptation technologies. Existing EA legal and administrative frameworks in the country is 

overall well developed and in compliance with good international practices. The PIM regulation 

requires environmental assessment for projects, and as such would help mitigate the potential 

environmental impacts.

B. Introduction and Context 

 
Country Context 

 
Albania has experienced rapid growth since 1990, rising into the ranks of middle-income countries in 2008. 
It emerged from the collapse of isolationist communism in the early 1990s as one of the poorest countries in 
Europe but since then has experienced a growth of nearly 6 percent per year. The rapid pace of growth helped 
the country narrow the per capita income gap with the rest of Europe from 18 percent of average European 
Union (EU) incomes in 1998 to 30 percent by 2012, and this fueled aspirations to join the EU. Growth 
successfully halved poverty from 25.2 percent in 2002 to 12.5 percent in 2008. However, the global and euro 
area crises in 2008 brought Albania's growth to a near standstill by 2012, and the country is struggling to 
recover, particularly given its historic ties to Europe’s poorer performing economies. The aftermath of the 
crisis presented an increase of the poverty rate, to around 14 percent in 2015, particularly in urban and coastal 
areas, along with rising unemployment affecting mostly youth and women. 

Recently, economic activity has picked up and the near-term economic outlook for Albania is positive. 
Economic growth is expected to accelerate to 3.8 percent in 2017 (from 3.4 percent in 2016 and 2.2 in 2015), 
supported by private investment and consumption. Investment is mostly linked to two large foreign direct 
investment-financed energy projects (the Trans Adriatic Pipeline and the Devoll hydropower plant), and 
consumption is supported by job creation and the easing of credit conditions. Net exports were helped by 
tourism and a recovering commodity market. Growth is projected to moderate to an average of 3.6 percent 
for 2018–2019 with completion of the two large energy projects and no other large projects planned.  

The Government remains committed to making deep structural reforms. Over the past years, the 
Government implemented a range of reforms, including improvements in Public Financial Management (PFM) 
(clearance of arrears, tax reforms), mitigation of fiscal risks from pensions and the energy sector, reduction of 
nonperforming loans, and improvements in doing business. Results were positive: growth picked up, the fiscal 
deficit declined, and the public debt started to fall. This provided a window of opportunity for advancing 
ongoing structural and fiscal reforms, to reduce macroeconomic risks and better support long-term growth. 

Albania applied for EU membership in 2009 and became an official candidate for accession in June 2014. 
This entails strong commitments in the transport sector, which manifest themselves in signing, with the 
European Commission, the Memorandum of Understanding for the Core Network creating the South East 
Europe Transport Observatory (SEETO)1 and in signing the Transport Community Treaty in July of this year. 
The treaty will help the Western Balkan countries align their national transport laws with those of the EU. 

 
Sectoral and Institutional Context 

 
Roads and highways are the predominant mode of land transport in Albania and provide essential 
connectivity for freight and personal mobility. Roads are one of the highest value public assets, estimated at 
about US$6 billion. The overall length of Albania’s road network is about 15,000 km; 4,000 km of national 

                                                           
1 The main aim of SEETO is “to promote cooperation on the development of the main and ancillary infrastructure on the South East 
Europe Core Regional Transport Network and to promote and enhance local capacity.” 


roads; and 11,000 km of regional, local, and urban roads.2 The Ministry of Infrastructure and Energy (MoIE), 
formerly the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure, is responsible for the policy and regulatory framework 
and technical standards. The Albania Road Authority (ARA) is responsible for managing the national road 
network and the municipalities are responsible for managing the regional and local roads. The Albania 
Development Fund (ADF) was established in 1993 with support from the World Bank, to implement regional 
and local roads projects mainly financed by international development partners.   

In 2015, Albania implemented significant administrative and territorial reforms consolidating 372 
communes and municipalities into 61 municipalities to increase the cost efficiency of local units so that they 
can provide better services. The new municipalities consolidated the responsibilities from the previous levels 
of local government—municipalities, communes, and regional councils—each of which was administering 
road networks within their jurisdiction, respectively, within city/town boundaries, within commune 
boundaries, and regional roads in regional council areas. Within the current regional and local road network, 
the function comprises (a) regional roads that connect groups of villages to the national road network or with 
main administrative centers of a municipality and (b) local roads that provide transport links between villages 
and farms. 

The infrastructure planning and prioritization process still has some way to go to provide transparent and 
economically efficient outcomes. With support from the World Bank, progress has been made by the 
Government in developing Medium-term Budget Plans (MTBPs) 2015–2017 to prioritize higher impact new 
investments. A framework that is more aligned with the budget realities is slowly emerging and more fiscal 
discipline is applied at all levels to avoid accumulation of arrears in the road sector. Under the proposed 
Regional and Local Roads Connectivity Project (RLRCP), a rigorous prioritization approach has been formulated 
for the selection of project roads which target investments that complement productive sectors of the 
economy and particularly in agriculture and tourism. This process provides an example for investment 
prioritization, transparency, and governance at a local level. 

Maintenance of the road network has been systematically underfunded, undermining the sustainability of 
the sector. The ongoing Results-based Road Maintenance and Safety Project (RRMSP) is addressing highest 
priority maintenance needs of 4,000 km of national roads while the proposed RLRCP will support the asset 
management of regional and local roads under the control of municipalities. 

The regional and local network is in bad condition overall, with more than 50 percent of network 
categorized in poor condition, 30 percent in fair condition, and less than 20 percent in good and very good 
condition. Some sections are impassable for parts of the year, thus restricting access to essential public 
services of health and education, as well as to economic centers. As of 2016, the maintenance expenditures 
for regional and local roads was allocated at approximately 300 Euro per km per year,3 which is extremely 
low and can only cover the routine maintenance, with no allowance for periodic maintenance or 
improvements. Investments and maintenance of regional and local roads are financed by local taxes 
combined with unconditional grant transfer from the central government. The poor condition of roads is a 
manifestation of the weaknesses in the municipalities planning, implementation and/or monitoring 
capacities.    

The Government of Albania (GoA) has taken large strides in improving conditions of the regional and local 
         

road network in the past decade but more work is necessary. ADF implemented a Rural Road Program, during 
the period 2008–2016, with World Bank support which crowded in US$386 million in financing from IFIs. The 
program improved1,200 km of rural roads in 12 regions and 61 municipalities which improved the mobility of 
over 2 million people. The World Bank’s engagement through the Secondary and Local Roads Project (SLRP), 
from 2008 to 2013, was evaluated as highly satisfactory which is an important milestone. The program was 
indeed highly successful, exceeding its developmental and implementation outcomes while recognizing there 
is still room to consolidate the e network improvements in a sustainable manner to enable growth in the 
agricultural and tourism sectors. 

The existing condition of regional and local road network is not able to serve the emerging tourism industry4 
and hinders the development of the agricultural sector.5 Over the past few years, the GoA has developed key 
strategic instruments including the National Territorial Development Strategy and the Coastal Management 
Strategy that provide a vision for the development of Albania over the next 15 years (2015–2030). These 
strategies highlighted a number of challenges which include improved road connectivity and the need to 
invest in municipal capacity to improve tourism destination management. The on-going Integrated Urban and 
Tourism Development Project is addressing these issues in the South of Albania while the proposed RLRCP will 
support improved access to tourism development areas in the project road areas of Albania. 

In October 2014, the GoA approved the five-year Strategy for Rural and Agriculture Development, drawing 
upon the strategic planning approach used by the EU under its Common Agriculture Policy 2014–2020. One 
of the obstacles pointed out by the strategy is lack of market access for agricultural products through an 
appropriate network of national, regional, and local roads. Considering that in Albania the agri-food industry 
is responsible (directly and indirectly) for almost half the economy-wide jobs, improving market access 
through better road connectivity is critical for the development of the country. It is also important for 
productive inclusion of women, who represent half of those employed in the sector (the highest share of 
participation of women in agriculture in the Western Balkans) and 80 percent of informal employment in the 
sector.  

Road safety remains a major social and public health issue in Albania. Although the number of accidents has 
dropped in recent years, Albania still compares unfavorably with countries in the region or EU member states, 
with the World Health Organization estimated 15.1 fatalities per 100,000 population—while it is 11.9 in 
Montenegro, 9.1 in Greece, 7.7 in Serbia, 4.3 in Germany, 5.1 in France, and 2.9 in the United Kingdom.6 In 
response, the GoA aims to reduce the number of fatalities by 50 percent in 2020, in comparison to 2009.7 The 
GoA has increased its attention to road safety reforms, including the adoption of the Road Safety Strategy and 
Action Plan in 2011 and adoption of mandatory Road Safety audit8 for all new roads. The RRMSP is 
strengthening the capacity of the Inter-Ministerial Road Safety Council, introducing road safety audit training 

                                                           
4 Tourism is a significant contributor to the Albanian economy, with 8.4 percent of total GDP in 2016, and is forecasted to rise to 10.8 
percent by 2027. Its contribution to employment is also significant, directly supporting 85,500 jobs (7.7 percent of total 
employment) in 2016, and is estimated to grow to 120,000 jobs (10.1 percent of total employment) by 2025.  
5 Agriculture is the single largest contributor to GDP in the country (22 percent in 2015) and the largest employer (41 percent in 
2015). Agricultural productivity and the competitiveness of the sector are adversely affected by the fragmented and subsistence-
oriented supply base, poor enforcement of food safety standards, infrastructure deficiencies, including poor transport networks and 
access to markets and tourism hubs, among others.

accreditation courses, supporting media campaigns, and enhancing the Accident Information System. The 
RLRCP will build on these reforms and address road safety through improvements to regional and local road 
infrastructure. 

Better links from the regional and local road network to the national road network will complement 
envisioned improvements in the country’s trade and transport facilitation competitiveness which are being 
supported under the separate proposed Regional Trade and Transport Facilitation Project. Improved feeder 
and distribution links from the regional and local road network to the national network together will reduce 
cost of trade and transport, lower the cost of importing and exporting for goods and services including 
agriculture and tourism.  These two areas will be the focus of the proposed RLRCP. 

A major emergent issue affecting sustainability of the road sector is the road network vulnerability to 
climate changes and natural disasters. Floods in recent years have increasingly affected the infrastructure 
and consequently the access of population and farmers to markets which have been substantially disrupted. 
A World Bank-executed Technical Assistance (TA) funded by the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and 
Recovery (GFDRR) is starting to address the issue of vulnerability of the road network and how to improve 
road asset management. Implementation of the TA outcome will be implemented as one of the components 
of the proposed RLRCP. 

In recent years, several IFIs have supported road sector investments and reforms in Albania. Several IFIs 
including the World Bank, European Commission, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development 
(EBRD), European Investment Bank (EIB), and Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW) are the main partners 
supporting the GoA including: (i) improvement of planning and budgeting process, (ii) introducing better 
management practices to avoid future arrears, (iii) deepening ARA reforms , and (iv) providing financing for 
priority projects. Bilateral partners including the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), Deutsche 
Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), Agence Francaise de Developpement (AFD) and the 
Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) are involved in supporting the new municipalities to 
capacity building, asset and resource management under their administration with a focus on water supply 
and sanitation, solid waste, and municipal financing. The proposed RLRCP presents an opportunity to develop 
an overall investment and policy framework for the regional and local roads sector that can be supported 
through the joint efforts of different development partners. In this context, the EBRD is currently in discussions 
with GoA to match the World Bank financing with a further US$50 million loan for a parallel operation. 

Gender gap. Gender gaps in construction and transport sectors, where less than 5 percent and 17 percent of 
all employed respectively, are women, are very substantial. Therefore, promoting women’s economic 
opportunities as part of the efforts to reverse poverty trends and boost shared prosperity are part of the 
project objectives. A separate TA funded by the State and Peace Building Fund (SPBF) administered by the 
World Bank will be looking into opportunities in this regard. The results from this TA will be implemented 
through the proposed RLRCP. 

C. Proposed Development Objective(s)

D. Project Description  

 
The Albania RLRCP is expected to be financed by an IBRD loan of US$50 million. The RLRCP will focus on the 
role that improved roads can play in enabling connectivity driven economic gains, particularly in the 
agricultural and tourism sectors, both key drivers of growth and employment in Albania. More specifically, 
the proposed RLRCP will support tourism development through improving road access to existing and 
potential tourism destinations and providing quality tourism-friendly amenities (for example, parking lot for 
tourist bus, viewpoints) and signage along the roads in the project areas. It will also support the integration 
of agricultural producers to agri-food value chains and market participation, particularly for women who make 
up the majority of the workforce in agriculture. 

To achieve these overarching goals and set an example for investment prioritization at the municipal level, 
a rigorous prioritization approach has been formulated in the RLRCP road selection. The selection of project 
roads was done through a two-step prioritization process including the development of a long list of 1,400 km 
candidate roads based on consultations between the ADF and 61 municipalities and a short list of 200 km 
candidate roads using multi-criteria analysis, considering tourism destinations, agriculture potential, 
beneficiary population, and economic efficiency indicators. The selection process reflects the priority from 
the municipalities as well as the GoA’s vision on rural roads investments that support tourism and agriculture. 
This approach also allows for easy scale-up to a program for the GoA, municipalities, and other developmental 
partners to implement. 

The RLRCP will include capacity building TA in support of the municipalities to improve management of road 
assets and strengthen links between roads, improved agricultural market access, and tourism development 
plans where they exist. The RLRCP is designed to address the sustainability of road maintenance at the 
municipal level which is a significant challenge following the transfer of local and regional road assets to the 
municipal level. The RLRCP is also designed to address road safety issues in regional and secondary roads in 
the selected municipalities to provide safer and sustainable infrastructure. 

In addition, the project will implement action plans on ways to promote climate resilience and women’s 
economic opportunities in regional and local roads in Albania as follows:  

• Climate Resilient Road Assets for Albania: Albania’s vulnerability to climate change and natural 
disasters, for example, flooding, landslides, and earthquakes, within the road sector, is being analyzed 
under a separate Technical Assistance and its outcome will inform the prioritization of investment to 



provide more sustainable and resilient road assets. The TA outcomes will be incorporated into the 
RLRCP designs of specific road sections.  Improved regional and local roads at time provide an 
alternative to the national road network critical links during extreme weather events. The TA will also 
include recommendations to adjust the design standards for regional and local roads and apply them 
to the project roads. 

• Promoting Woman’s Employment in Road Sector in Albania: the capacity of local stakeholders to 
reach out and increase women’s inclusion and participation in road maintenance programs is being 
analyzed under a separate TA. The outcome will consider policy options to provide support to 
contractors that explore opportunities to promote women’s employment in high skilled jobs in their 
respective workforce.  The focus will be on more and better jobs.  
 

The project will finance the following components. 

Component 1. Accessibility Improvement (Total cost US$47.03 million; IBRD US$47.03 million) 

This component will finance the rehabilitation of regional and local roads; consultancy service for designs, civil 
works supervision, and technical and road safety audits; and road safety initiatives.  

• Subcomponent 1.1. Climate resilient road rehabilitation works (Total cost US$45.83 million). This 
subcomponent will finance the rehabilitation of about 50 km of regional and local roads within 5 to 6 
municipalities. The roads will be designed according to Albanian standards with particular attention to their 
climate resilience (such as to flooding and landslides) given the vulnerability of the network. As a first-year 
program, three project roads in three municipalities, totaling 40 km, have been selected based on further 
surveys and a rigorous multi-criteria analysis on the short-listed 200 km of roads. The remaining roads will be 
identified and prioritized during implementation. Where roads serve tourism areas or pass through urban 
areas, attention will be given to footpaths, bicycle paths, safety improvements, orientation signage, and 
aesthetic considerations. In addition, new bike lanes and sidewalks will be build, to encourage the shift to 
cleaner modes of transport. This subcomponent will also finance all necessary designs, civil works supervision, 
and technical and road safety audits, although the designs of the first-year program were already financed by 
the GoA.  

• Subcomponent 1.2. Road Safety Initiatives (Total cost US$1.2 million). This subcomponent will 
consist of identification of potential road safety interventions on regional and local roads that are not included 
in Subcomponent 1.1 but within the project municipalities. Identification efforts shall include both road risk 
mapping using available crash data and a road safety inspection of sections linked to Component 1.1 roads. 
These interventions will address accident blackspots and include traffic calming measures, footpaths, crash 
barriers and junction design. 

Component 2. Capacity Building for Municipalities (Total cost US$0.85 million; IBRD: US$0.85 million) 

This component will build capacity in the project municipalities’ to manage their transport system and road 
assets in a sustainable way and to maximize the impacts of improved accessibility on agricultural production 
and tourism potential. It will develop standard approaches that will be implemented in a few municipalities 
in this project but can subsequently be rolled out more widely. The following activities are envisaged: 

• Subcomponent 2.1. Municipal Transport Capacity Development for all Participating Municipalities 
(Total cost US$0.45 million). This subcomponent will focus on developing municipal systems for road 
maintenance and road planning following the recent transfer of road assets to the municipal level. It will: (i) 
assess municipalities capacity, local planning instruments and processes for road planning and maintenance 
and public transport planning, (ii) develop recommendations for addressing weaknesses, and (iii) provide 
training based on the recommendations. The focus will be on road maintenance and will include support on 
programming, budgeting, sustainable financing for road rehabilitation and maintenance priorities, asset 
management and maintenance execution. Public transport planning will extend to public parking and bus 
terminals, and safety measures. The subcomponent will also finance the preparation of a standard service 
level agreement contract for maintenance between the municipalities and the service provider and will 
provide training to the municipalities on its use.  

• Subcomponent 2.2. Linking Farmers to Markets (Total cost US$0.20 million). This subcomponent will 
support implementation of the recently approved 100 villages program. It will provide technical support for 
linking agricultural producers to local demand, including through local markets and tourism centers. The focus 
will be on production areas adjacent to the road infrastructure supported by the project. The subcomponent 
will provide an assessment of potential activities that could be financed through the grants available under 
the 100 villages program or other development partner programs. Potential activities include  supply chain 
activities for key agricultural products; recommendations for alleviating impediments in connecting roads, 
warehouses, harvesting facilities, regulations; developing collection zones; and promoting “Eat Albania” 
restaurants. This subcomponent will also increase the World Bank’s evidence base for supporting women 
smallholder farmers and women-led agriculture small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to start and/or enhance 
their participation in agri-food value chains in Albania; analyze the barriers that women face in accessing 
markets, in general, but particularly in light of the new business opportunities that the project is hoped to 
deliver; and recommend the ways to address them.9 

• Subcomponent 2.3. Managing for Tourism Growth (Total cost US$0.20 million). As above this 
subcomponent will support implementation of the recently approved 100 villages program. It will provide 
technical support to promote agro-tourism in the project municipalities. The subcomponent will provide an 
assessment of potential activities that could be financed through the grants available under the 100 villages 
program or other development partner programs. The subcomponent will also provide technical support to 
concerned municipalities to plan for this growth and mitigate any possible environmental and social impacts. 
Where appropriate support may also be given to steer public and private investments in tourism related 
infrastructure and services.        

Component 3. Implementation Management Support (Total cost US$2.0 million; IBRD: US$2.0 million) 

This component includes incremental operational cost of the ADF, development and maintenance of 
Geographic Information System (GIS) and prioritization database for regional and local roads, midterm 
evaluation, and capacity-building initiatives for the ADF. It will also include the implementation of a Project 
Impact Assessment to assess the project’s impacts on key social, transport, agriculture, and tourism indicators. 
This is similar to the approach used by ADF in the previous Rural Road Program using financing from the 
development partners and outsourced expertise.    

                                                           
9 The project scope and available budget will likely not allow for addressing most of the recommendations resulting from the gender 
analysis of this subcomponent. Still, in light of the large gender gaps in agriculture and the focus that the CPF rightly puts on them, 
the team considered it important to integrate gender analysis as part of the envisaged study. The recommendations will be provided 
to the client and will also be used to inform the World Bank’s future activities.  

E. Implementation 
 

Institutional and Implementation Arrangements 

The project will be implemented over four years and seven months by the ADF, which has strong experience 
and track record as an implementing agency of road projects financed by the World Bank and other 
development partners since its inception in 1993. A Project Management Team (PMT) will be established 
within the ADF, staffed by its own personnel, which will also coordinate with representatives of the respective 
municipalities. The PMT will manage project activities, such as procurement, social impact assessments, 
safeguard functions, monitoring and evaluation, and so on. When necessary, the project management 
function will be supported by consultants. A budget for such operating costs has been allocated in Component 
3. 

It is recognized that the participation of municipalities is critical during both project preparation and 
implementation. During the project preparation, the ADF has worked very closely with municipalities in the 
prioritization exercise, and several consultations with municipalities and local communities have taken place 
during the preliminary designs of the project roads. Before starting the civil works, an Investment Agreement 
and a Function and Maintenance Agreement will be signed by the municipalities, defining duties that 
municipalities must carry, e.g. maintenance requirement, after the project roads are handed over. The ADF 
will monitor the compliance of these agreements. When procuring and implementing capacity building 
activities, municipalities will provide ADF with inputs to TOR and sign off outputs.  

1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential 
large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
The project has been classified as Category B.  Under Component 1, the project will finance the rehabilitation and/or 
reconstruction within the right-of-way of regional and local roads in selected municipalities. This Component will also 
finance and implement safety works on improving signage, pedestrian crossings, line-marking, etc. of regional and 
local road network.  
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area: 
Additional impacts might be expected due to increased traffic on rehabilitated roads, however the project will under 
Component 1 finance and implement safety works on improving signage, pedestrian crossings, line-marking, etc. of 
regional and local road network. In addition, the rehabilitation works itself financed under the same component will 
also support improving the road safety aspects in project roads, and as such are expected to have long-term positive 
social impacts. 
 
 
 
 
 .    
F. Project location and Salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 
 

The project will finance rehabilitation of priority regional roads across the municipalities. Construction will 
mainly occur within the existing right-of-way, and the estimated cumulative length of project road segments 


is 50 km. Three project roads were selected for implementation in the first year, and are located in Shkoder, 
Pogradec and Fier municipalities. There is no geographical focus for the remaining roads to be financed.

SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY 

 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

The project is categorized as category B and not 
expected to have significant or irreversible 
environmental impacts given the rehabilitative 
nature of works to be financed.  Anticipated civil 
works will primarily entail rehabilitation and 
reconstruction of rural roads.  Potential negative 
environmental impacts may include, but not limited 
to: (i) temporary construction -related effects on 
noise, dust, and air quality; (ii) temporary localized 
water quality impacts resulting from possible 
drainage and sewage pollution; and (iii) temporary 
changes in access to, and the use of, public spaces 
during construction. The exact project locations are 
still not known as the prioritization of rural roads is 
still ongoing. For that reason, preparation of 
Environmental and Social Framework (ESMF) is 
proposed prior to appraisal. ESMF is prepared to 
facilitate screening, assessment, and management of 
environmental and social issues for activities to be 
taken up by the project in subsequent years. The 
ESMF ensures preparation of appropriate and World 
Bank safeguard policy-compliant safeguard 
instruments during project implementation. 

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 Yes 

Some of the rehabilitation works are envisaged in 
nature protected areas and natural habitats. For that 
reason, the ESMF defines procedures for identifying 
and managing subprojects affecting natural habitats. 
No new construction will be allowed in nature 


protected sites, or significant natural habitats, but 
only rehabilitation of the existing roads. In addition, 
no activities will be allowed in or in proximity of 
critical habitats. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No The project will not have any impacts on forests 

Pest Management OP 4.09 No 

The project is not expected to trigger pest 
management policy. The investments will not 
promote or increase the use of the pesticide. 
Although the project will finance solely roads 
rehabilitation, the ESMF provides guidance for use of 
herbicides for roads maintenance. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 No 

The project is not expected to trigger OP 4.11. The 
investments will be focused on rehabilitation of 
existing roads. Nevertheless, due to the countries 
cultural richness, during the earthworks chance finds 
might be possible. For that reason, ESMF includes 
provisions on chance finds and required 
practices.For each such subproject, the ESIA and 
ESMP will be prepared, prior reviewed by the World 
Bank environmental specialist, and 
cleared/consulted with the Albanian Agency for 
Protected areas (or relevant environmental 
authorities). 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 No Not relevant 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

The project will finance rehabilitation and 
reconstruction of rural roads. Roads connecting 
villages with the regional centers, touristic/cultural 
sites and agricultural fields. Given the linear nature 
of the works the land-take impacts will be minor and 
linear, adjacent to the existing road. Thus there will 
be small land taken. Displacement of households or 
businesses is not expected either, nor any impact on 
livelihoods. Given that the project is a rehabilitation 
of existing roads, there will be no need for access 
roads, thus it is not expected to address associated 
land-take cases. To address the social safeguards 
instrument, the borrower will prepare Resettlement 
Policy Framework (RPF) that will guide the land take 
activities during the whole cycle of the project 
implementation. If for any sub-project it is expected 
that the footprint will be known during the 
preparation phase of the project then the borrower 
will prepare site specific abbreviated or full fledge 
(depending of the impact) Resettlement Action Plan. 

 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 No Not relevant 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

No 
The project activities will not have impact on 
international waterways 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No Not relevant 

 
 

KEY SAFEGUARD POLICY ISSUES AND THEIR MANAGEMENT 

 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential 
large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
The project has been classified as Category B.  Under Component 1, the project will finance the rehabilitation and/or 
reconstruction within the right-of-way of regional and local roads in selected municipalities and short new segments 
only where they present natural continuation / connection. Under the same component, the project will also finance 
and implement safety works on improving signage, pedestrian crossings, line-marking, etc. of regional and local road 
network. This implies that the project will possibly have some adverse environmental impacts; however, these would 
be site specific and would not be significant nor long-term. For the project to remain category B, ESMF defines 
following environmental criteria for eligible subprojects: a) category A sub projects will not be financed; b) for sub 
projects in nature protected sites, or significant natural habitats, only rehabilitation of the roads would be allowed and 
no new construction. No activities would be allowed in or in proximity of critical habitats; c) New construction should 
be limited and allowed only in some specific cases for example where segments are missing or alignment of a section 
that is currently particularly difficult of dangerous; d) The construction, reconstruction or rehabilitation of roads on 
existing right of way would be allowed only in form of one or two lane roads. 
Some of the rehabilitation works are envisaged in the nature protected areas and natural habitats. For that reason, 
the ESMF defines procedures for identification and managing subprojects affecting natural habitats. No new 
construction would be allowed in nature protected sites, or significant natural habitats, but only rehabilitation of the 
existing roads. In addition, no activities would be allowed in or in proximity of critical habitats. For each of such sub 
projects ESIA and ESMP would be prepared, priory reviewed by WB environmental specialist and cleared / consulted 
with the Albanian Agency for Protected areas (or relevant Environmental Authorities). For all supported TA activities, 
the TORs for these activities should include environmental and social considerations in line with the triggered 
safeguards operational policies. 
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area: 
Additional impacts might be expected due to increased traffic on rehabilitated roads, however the project will under 
Component 1 finance and implement safety works on improving signage, pedestrian crossings, line-marking, etc. of 
regional and local road network. In addition, the rehabilitation works itself will also support improving the road safety 
aspects in project roads, and as such are expected to have long-term positive social impacts. 
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts. 
As the project will finance mainly rehabilitation of existing roads, no major alternatives were, nor will be considered. 
Some alternatives will be taken in consideration during design when considering roads width and possible new 
connections. All those alternatives will be examined in site specific environmental due diligence documents prepared 
during project implementation. The ESMF screening procedure will help guide the Client in ensuring that the site-

specific impacts are mitigated, that no additional safeguards policies are triggered and that no category-A works are 
financed 
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower 
capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The Albanian Development Fund (ADF) will be implementing the project. ADF has experience in managing 
environmental and social impacts of World Bank-financed infrastructure investments and other infrastructure projects 
financed by international finance institutions. The ADF project team includes experienced environmental and social 
specialists.  
To comply, the ADF prepared an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) as well as Resettlement 
Policy Framework, satisfactory to the Bank, to guide the overall project as the exact subproject locations are still not 
known or are currently being assessed. The purpose of this ESMF is to guide the Environmental and Social Assessment 
process, i.e. to facilitate screening, assessment, and management of environmental and social issues for activities to 
be taken up by the project in subsequent years. Environmental due diligence documents envisaged by ESMF include: 
ESIA, ESMPs and ESMP checklists. In addition to ESMF, the Borrower prepared a sample Environmental and Social 
Impact Assessment (ESIA) for Fier-Seman road rehabilitation. 
The Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) was prepared parallel with the Environmental and Social Framework 
(ESMF)/ The documents were disclosed on the December 22th and the consultation held on January 4th . 
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, 
with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
Major stakeholders are ADF and municipalities in which the projects will be implemented. ESMF documents was 
disclosed and publicly consulted prior to appraisal. ESMF with the call for public consultation was disclosed on the ADF 
website on December 22, 2017 and major municipalities participating in a project (paper or electronic) for two weeks. 
The ESIA for Fier-Seman road was disclosed on ADF website and in Fier municipality on January 5, 2018. In addition to 
the public call, the government and relevant non-governmental organizations were invited through official invitations 
sent out by the ADF. Public consultation meetings were held in Tirana (January 4, 2018r) and Fier (January 15, 2018). 
The Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) was disclosed and consulted parallel with the Environmental and Social 
Framework (ESMF) 
The similar procedure will be followed for site specific ESMPs during project implementation as defined by the ESMF. 
All due diligence documents will be disclosed on the ADF websites respectively, and hardcopy will be available at their 
premises as well in participating municipalities for at least two weeks following public consultation as per ESMF.

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 

 
1. Following years of recession and slow growth, the Serbian economy expanded by 1.8 percent, on average, over 
the previous three years (2015–2017), while a stronger growth of 3.5 percent was estimated for 2018. Over the previous 
three years, growth started to recover on the back of higher investment (average annual growth of 8.3 percent) and strong 
growth of exports (up 10.7 percent annually in real terms). Consumption recovered as well, but at a slower pace (at 1 
percent annually in real terms). Growth of the industry and services sectors contributed most to the overall growth of the 
economy over the previous three years, while agriculture had a negative contribution to growth in 2015 and 2017. For 
2018, growth was broad-based with all three major sectors growing faster than last year. As a result, the growth in 2018 
reached 4.2 percent. The medium-term growth projections depend crucially on deeper and timelier structural reforms 
and progress with European Union (EU) accession. 
 
2. The Government of Serbia (GOS) has implemented a successful fiscal adjustment but economic vulnerabilities 
remain. In 2014, the GOS adopted an ambitious fiscal consolidation and structural reform program supported by the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. In the short term, the program focused on the control of 
aggregate wage and pension expenditures, improvements in tax administration, and reductions in subsidies to state 
owned enterprises. The implementation of these measures led to the reduction of budget deficits in 2015–2016 and 
budget surplus of 1.2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2017 and 0.5 percent of GDP in 2018, underpinned by 
strong revenue collection and lower than planned public spending ensuing, among others, from the interest payment 
savings and under-execution of public investment. As a result of prudent fiscal policies, public debt continues to decline 
and stood at 54.3 percent of GDP (at the end of December 2018), and is expected to continue declining during 2019, albeit 
at a slower pace. However, the country remains vulnerable to spillovers from regional developments and market volatility, 
thus ensuring fiscal sustainability and supporting private sector development, growth, and formal employment are 
important for Serbia’s economic performance in the long term. 
 
3. Over this same period, the prospects for accession to the EU provided an impetus for a broad spectrum of 
reforms. In November 2007, Serbia initiated a Stabilization and Association Agreement with the EU. In 2012, it was granted 
an EU candidate status. Since the formal start of the accession negotiations in 2014, progress has evolved largely following 
its predicted trajectory. As of December 2018, Serbia opened 16 out of 35 chapters of the EU’s Acquis Communautaire, of 
which two are provisionally closed. 
 
4. Regional disparities of living standards are evident. There is a high degree of variability of living standards within 
the country, with 25 percent of the population of Serbia (close to 1.8 million people) being at risk of poverty. Municipalities 
in the Southern and Eastern part of Serbia have high poverty incidence as compared to the rest of the country, with risk 
of poverty rates ranging between 13 and 63 percent within these regions. Better understanding of these geographic 
disparities can help the Government of Serbia design and target policies and programs to support growth, jobs, poverty 
reduction and social inclusion.   
 

Sectoral and Institutional Context1 
 
5. Agriculture plays an important role in the economy of Serbia. Agriculture is the third largest sector, accounting 
for around 6 percent of GDP and 19 percent of formal employment, and the most important export sector, representing 
23 percent of total exports. The impressive growth of exports of both primary and processed food products provides 
evidence of the competitiveness of Serbian production in international markets and of significant potential to further 
leverage the sector’s growth to create jobs and income. From 2005 to 2016, the country’s exports of primary food and 
beverage products increased 148 percent and of processed food products increased 83 percent. In 2016, Serbia 
accumulated an agricultural trade surplus of US$650 million in primary products and of US$525 million in processed food 
and beverage products. 
 
6. Agriculture is undergoing a process of structural transformation towards a modern agri-food system. Primary 
agriculture, an important source of income and employment in the past, has diminished its contribution to the rapidly 
diversifying economy of Serbia. The declining share of primary agriculture in GDP and employment signals a process of 
transformation that provides ample opportunities for developing a modern, dynamic and more competitive agri-food 
system, able to generate better jobs up and downstream and improve income and livelihoods in the rural space. 
Improvements in labor and land productivity have contributed towards the expansion of agricultural output in Serbia. This 
is important as it leads to an increase in the supply of raw materials at lower costs to agri-processors, which in turn 
supports a much larger scale of operation, promotes horizontal integration, and reduces overall costs, all factors that 
increase the competitiveness of the whole agri-food system, as the country prepares for EU accession. Improving 
productivity is more than just raising yields and decreasing costs; it is also about raising food quality, moving into higher 
value products by using improved technology and practices2. 
 
7. Sector growth is geographically differentiated and narrow based in terms of composition of production. Growth 
patterns in agriculture are influenced by regional disparities in sector performance and composition, with a positive sector 
growth in the Northwestern parts of the country and contraction of production in Southeastern Serbia. The autonomous 
province of Vojvodina, in the North, is the key driver of agricultural output in Serbia, with 43 percent contribution to 
national agricultural GDP (in 2014) with large scale production of commodities. Between 2003 and 2013, crop output in 
Serbia expanded, mainly due to increased production in Vojvodina, as the other three regions recorded only a marginal 
expansion or even a decline (South and East Serbia). Livestock output declined over the same period, with all regions, 
except Vojvodina, recording contraction rates between 24 percent (Sumadija and West Serbia) and 33 percent (South and 
East Serbia). In the same period, livestock output in Vojvodina increased by around 13 percent.  
 
8. Despite regional comparative advantages, structural factors underpin the regional disparities. There are 
important structural limitations to agriculture in Serbia - very small and fragmented land holdings, ageing and declining 
farm labor force, low efficiency and productivity, low use of technology, high labor intensity, low financial liquidity and 
capital availability for investment (especially for smallholders) and outdated production management practices. Despite 
all of these, economic opportunities exist in rural areas. Cereals, vegetable oils and edible fruit have historically driven 
growth of agricultural production and exports, with Vojvodina’s larger producers benefiting the most. Only one percent 
of the farms in Serbia have 50 hectares or more of land and most of them are in Vojvodina3, while farmers who own less

Development in Serbia” by Garry Christensen (2016) as well as from a recently completed Agriculture Public Expenditure Review by Demetris 
Psaltopoulos and Svetlana Edmeades.

land.  



than 5 hectares of land account for 78 percent of all holdings and 25 percent of the total cultivated area in Serbia and are 
concentrated in the South and East Serbia.  
 
9. Broadening the scope for sector growth to include small and medium scale producers may be key to sector 
transformation. Although fragmented farm structures are often perceived as a challenge to scale economies and 
competitiveness, with high transaction costs preventing the many small producers from engaging in markets, in the case 
of Serbia, recent public expenditure analysis shows that smallholders4 are the most technically efficient producers in the 
country and hence, supporting their development can improve sector growth. Hence, consolidation at the product level, 
through aggregation and economic clusters, may hold the key to development, enabling the specialization of small 
efficient units and their integration into broader value chains. Middle size farms, which are often seen as the drivers of 
growth in the sector, are found to be the worst performers in terms of technical efficiency in Serbia, posing a question on 
the adequacy of the enabling environment for their agricultural development. These producer segments also specialize in 
agricultural products that are not scale intensive yet can hold important value proposition and drive the generation of 
jobs and growth in rural areas. Improving the enabling environment to support the productive inclusion of small and 
medium scale producers can drive the process of structural transformation of agri-food systems in Serbia.  
 
10. Rethinking and redirecting policy instruments and incentives can increase the speed of sector transformation. 
Agricultural budget support has been aligned with the EU budget support framework, and a Directorate for Agrarian 
Payments has been established to administer national direct payments (subsidies) and rural development investments 
(both national and EU Instrument for Pre-Accession and Assistance for Rural Development (IPARD) grants). Subsidies and 
transfers dominate agricultural spending (2011-2017) and, on average, account for 82 percent of sector expenditure. They 
are found to negatively affect sector productivity and efficiency and are thought to contribute towards freezing the current 
dual farm structure. Emphasis on area and headage payments5 reduce the incentives to increase productivity, preserve 
farm structures dominated by smaller farms and do not contribute to the acceleration of the structural transformation 
process6. Further, coupled output subsidies distort the allocation of productive resources. When the above are combined 
with the low (at least until 2017) level of funds dedicated to rural development, including the provision of public goods 
(agricultural infrastructure, R&D, advisory services, etc.), it creates a policy framework which constrains farm restructuring 
and the potential of smaller and medium-sized farms, that currently dominate Serbian agriculture, to increase their size, 
modernize production systems, benefit from expanding markets and contribute to a competitive agri-food sector and to 
a vibrant rural economy. 
 
11. Despite ample EU resources, productive investments, through rural development grants, are underutilized. 
IPARD funds in the amount of EUR230 million (including national co-financing) have been allocated to Serbia for the 
programming period of 2014-2020 in annual instalments. Serbia has received accreditation for 2 of the 11 IPARD 
measures7. Although the scope of these measures is broad, actual number of beneficiaries is limited, with most small and 
medium scale producers not being able to take advantage of this productive support due to the complex application 
process and the requirement for upfront financing. A key constraint in the uptake of IPARD grant support is the complexity 
of the application process, due to the numerous requirements which applicants often can’t fulfill, added to limited capacity 
in the Directorate for Agrarian Payments for review and approval. In addition, a limiting factor is the requirement of an 
upfront payment of the full grant amount by the applicant, which assumes availability of financial resources, with 

                                            
4 In the context of Serbia, small producers are those with an economic size of up to 8,000 euros; medium producers are those with an economic size 
between 8,000 and 25,000 euros. 
5 Criticized for not relying on objective and valid baseline indicators, as well as the poor definition of eligibility criteria (Bogdanov et al., 2017) 
6 It is noted that leased agricultural land is excluded from farm support (Bogdanov, 2016). 
7 Accredited measures in 2018 are Investments in Physical Assets of Agricultural Holdings and Investments in Physical Assets for Processing and 
Marketing of Agriculture and Fisheries Products; 2 more are planned for accreditation in 2019 - Farm diversification and business development and 
Technical assistance; and 2 additional ones for 2020 – LIDER program for local development and organic production.  



reimbursement of 50 percent after all investment criteria have been fulfilled, ex post. This requirement alone makes IPARD 
grants difficult to access for the majority of small and medium scale producers in Serbia. 
 
12. National program resources can shift the sector equilibrium from low productivity to high value for small and 
medium scale producers in Serbia and encourage convergence of the National and EU programs over time. For rural 
development grants, boundaries are established between eligible beneficiaries of the national rural development program 
and those eligible to apply for IPARD support, based on either size or production potential. All producers not eligible for 
IPARD support, are eligible for national program support. Reaching out with national investment funds to the small and 
medium producers of Serbia, especially in the South and Southeast of Serbia, can improve these producers’ productive 
inclusion and competitiveness, and enable them to actively participate in the process of structural transformation of 
agriculture in Serbia and preparing them for EU accession.  
 
13. Improving financial inclusion for productive investments can stimulate broader private sector participation. 
While around two thirds of adults in rural areas in Serbia have accounts with financial institutions, only 14% of them have 
loans to operate, start or expand farm and small business activities. Most medium and larger farmers and medium/larger 
SMEs have access to finance as banks have the right expertise, systems and products to serve these agricultural segments 
profitably. However, smaller farmers have very limited access to bank financing and mostly rely on off takers and input 
suppliers to finance their inputs. This type of value chain financing does not cover longer term funding for equipment, 
machinery and is currently decreasing as these players try to re-focus on their core business. The long-term goal is the 
development of efficient, competitive markets, producing to EU standards which requires better inclusion of small-scale 
producers (among them women and youth) in modern supply chains, an increase in investments in machinery, equipment 
and knowledge as well as the modernization of processing and marketing. For this to be achieved, however, public funds 
are not sufficient resources and bank financing can play a catalyst role in the further development and competitiveness 
of the sector. 
 
14. A combination of targeted public incentives and private financing can improve sector productivity and 
competitiveness. A policy mix that focuses on the improvement of competitiveness and value addition capacity of the 
agri-food system in Serbia can have important sectoral and economy-wide growth effects by inducing positive spillovers 
to other economic sectors and contributing to employment, poverty reduction and economic prosperity of rural areas. 
The public expenditure analysis has shown that direct payments do not promote technical efficiency and productivity 
growth and slow down the structural transformation in Serbian agriculture. Reducing the direct payments envelope and 
significantly increasing the rural development one (including advisory and farm extension services and R&D) is therefore 
paramount for improving the performance of the sector. To enable that, a different set of financial mechanisms may be 
required, to enable small and medium scale producers to access finance and participate in productive decisions, such as 
matching grants8 and public guarantee funds that reduce the risk to producers and other financial institutions, hence 
stimulating financial and productive inclusion. At present, small farmers do not have financial records, do not have 
business plans, they find bank requirements challenging and, most importantly, they lack collateral. Matching grants and 
technical assistance (TA) can create the conditions for banks to finance investments of farmers that are not their typical 
clients. Matching grants can create the required equity for the banks and TA can ensure bankability of the business plan 

                                            
8 Matching grants are an instrument aimed at promoting private sector development which has been used extensively over the past years, in 
particular for agriculture development. A matching grant is defined as a one-off, non-reimbursable transfer to project beneficiaries, for a specific 
purpose, based on the condition that the recipient makes a contribution for the same purpose. These grants can be used for a variety of activities 
including technical assistance, investment in assets or financing of working capital. Total grant financing dedicated to agriculture reaches 650 million 
USD or almost twice the volume of those outside of agriculture. In addition, the proportion of matching grants projects supporting agriculture has 
significantly increased in the 2000s. Recent interest for this instrument to support agriculture might be due to growing concerns about other forms 
of support which distort financial markets such as interest rate subsidies, as well to the compatibility of such agricultural subsidies with World Trade 
Organization requirements.  




and prepare the client to approach the bank. Finally, if commercial banks require additional safeguards for their 
investments, they will be able to access credit guarantees to be soon provided by the Development Credit Authority 
(USAID Guarantee Program) and European Investment Fund (EIF) including risk sharing through a new IFC project. 
 
15. Greater resilience to climate and market risks can further boost the overall sector performance. The reliance on 
agricultural commodities increases Serbia’s exposure to price volatility, which added to the increasing number of extreme 
climatic events in Serbia (droughts and floods) further exacerbates agricultural growth volatility. Projected increases in 
temperatures and declines in precipitation will affect rainfed crops, which dominate Serbian agriculture. Production is 
concentrated in the north (Vojvodina), where crops are vulnerable to decreasing precipitation and increasing 
temperatures, primarily during the summer growing season. Rainfed maize may decline by as much as 58 percent due to 
reduced rainfall and higher temperatures in summer. Increases in temperature have already brought about increases in 
fungal diseases and pests that reduce crop production. Cereals and fruits are the most important agricultural products in 
terms of production area and economic output; fruit production is particularly vulnerable to spring frost, hail, extremely 
low winter temperatures, low precipitation and/or heavy rainfall events9. Hence, diversifying the sector base has 
important climate mitigation (reducing risks) and climate adaption (improving resilience) implications for the country.  
 
16. As Serbia advances in the process of sector transformation and alignment to EU acquis, the effectiveness of 
public service delivery becomes critical to improving sector performance. Serbia has committed to align its national 
agricultural policy to the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the EU by the date of accession. To this end, the country is 
required to have all the necessary systems in place to manage and receive funds from the EU and to make payments to 
beneficiaries in Serbia in accordance with EU rules and procedures. An Integrated Administration and Control System 
(IACS), along with other tools, are necessary for the efficient utilization and monitoring of support funds. Systems for 
monitoring results (and not only expenditures) will also be required by the reformed CAP, starting in 2020. EU membership 
unlocks significant financial assistance to farmers under the EU’s CAP, yet it also imposes stricter food safety and other 
trade-related requirements to agricultural production. Enhancements in digital approaches can improve targeting, 
efficiency of spending, food safety monitoring, as well as support the governance structure of the sector.  The innovation 
environment in Serbia would need to be strengthened and uptake of emerging digital technologies by farmers improved 
to help lower transaction costs and facilitate information access about best farming practices, inputs, prices, access to 
credit and markets. This will improve transparency, reduce innovation hurdles and support an enabling environment for 
productive and financial inclusion of agricultural producers in Serbia. 
 

Relationship to CPF 
 
17. The proposed project is consistent with the Serbia Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for the period of FY16-
20. While the SCD identified agriculture as a priority sector for the twin goals, the CPF did not originally envisage an 
operation because of counterpart readiness. However, engagement with a new team at the MAFWM demonstrates a new 
strategic drive and opportunity to make an impact. Therefore, as part of the program update permitted under the PLR, 
the Bank decided to re-engage in this sector. Through productive investments targeting small and medium scale producers 
and strengthening the information systems of the agricultural sector, the project aims at increasing sector 
competitiveness, while providing economic opportunities in rural areas, as the country moves closer to EU membership. 
The Performance and Learning Review (PLR) of the CPF identifies agriculture as one of the high priorities for the 
Government with an important dimension of shared prosperity. The project is also aligned with the strategic goals of the 
National Agricultural and Rural Development (NARD) strategy for 2014-2024: i) growth of production and income stability; 
ii) growth of competitiveness with adjustments to domestic and foreign markets requirements and technical-technological 


promotion of the sector; iii) sustainable management of resources and environment protection; iv) promotion of quality 
of life in rural areas and poverty reduction; v) efficient management of public policies and promotion of institutional 
framework for development of agriculture and rural development. 
 
 
C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  

 
18. To improve access to markets and information systems for agricultural producers in Serbia.  
 
This will be achieved through a) improving productivity of small and medium scale farmers by strengthening advisory 
and technical support; b) supporting market access of small and medium scale farmers (including finance and business 
planning capacity); c) improving government systems to strengthen the enabling environment for all agricultural 
producers (including capacity building for the Ministry, information systems, data platform). 
 
Key Results (From PCN) 
 

19. The project will achieve the following results: 
 

(i) Productivity10: Increase in gross value added per utilized agricultural area 
 

(ii) Competitiveness11: Increase in the share of production sold by project beneficiaries 
 

(iii) Financial inclusion12: Number of beneficiaries accessing commercial bank loans for their productive 
investments (disaggregated by gender)  
 

(iv) Use of information systems13: Number of unique users of the integrated information platform (disaggregated 
by gender) 

 
D. Concept Description 

 
A. Concept 
 
20. Scope: The project will support the Government of Serbia with the implementation of the National Agriculture 
and Rural Development Program. This will complement Serbia’s on-going efforts to align its national programs to the EU 
CAP programs. In particular, the project will provide financial and technical support to all productive investments in 
agriculture in Serbia through the national rural development program14 and will not participate in the financing of direct 
payments (subsidies). This delimits the scope of project interventions outside of all IPARD measures that the country has 
been accredited for or plans to be accredited for and puts it in the center of national rural development program.  
 

                                            
10 Improved on-farm productivity (use of better management practices, climate smart agriculture, etc.) 
11 Improved linkages between producers and buyers/markets (volume, quality and uniformity of production, value and volume of sales, market 
segmentation strategies, etc.; building entrepreneurial capacity of the production units) 
12 Improved access to finance to drive the process of value-addition on and off-farm (enable investments in equipment, small infrastructure, technical 
assistance, and other services that improve the competitiveness of the production units) 
13 Improved information systems for decision making at the level of the Ministry of Agriculture Forestry and Water Management (MAFWM) and 
information flow with agricultural producers 
14 In 2018, the program received 8,000 applications from small and medium scale producers.  

21. Beneficiaries: Small and medium scale agricultural production units (including producers, producer groups, 
agribusinesses/agro-processors that can provide direct link to smallholder farmers) that have or can have commercial 
focus and are not covered by accredited IPARD measures. Although large producers will not be directly targeted, the 
project will also benefit them with the enabling environment it will create through the improvements in information 
systems and the financial services provided. Small and medium size producers are defined by the economic size of holding 
expressed in euros of standard output. For the purposes of this project and the context of Serbia, small producers are 
those with an economic size of up to 8,000 euros; medium producers are those with an economic size between 8,000 and 
25,000 euros. 
 

 
Description 
 
22. The project activities are structured into three Components. Component 1 will focus on improving the productive 
and entrepreneurial capacity of small and medium farmers by supporting business and financial planning for productive 
investments, as well as supporting market access and strengthening sector competitiveness. Component 2 will focus on 
improving the capacity of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management (MAFWM) to provide core public 
goods for improving sector performance. This includes establishing and information system aligned with EU CAP 
requirements to enable evidence-based policy making and monitoring of results, enhance market information for 
stakeholders and build capacity for regulatory roles aligned with EU CAP. Component 3 will focus on project management. 
 
23. By addressing sector needs at the level of producers (Component 1) and the MAFWM (Component 2), the project 
will support a broader policy reform process in the agriculture sector through: i) improved targeting of policy instruments 
to different typologies of producers, ii) strengthened enabling environment for investment for small and medium 
agricultural producers, by improving the delivery of services to these productive segments (advisory, financial, 
information, etc.), iii) improving the monitoring of public resources and their utilization, as well as sector performance. It 
is expected that this will bring about a significant shift in the utilization of public resources in agriculture from subsidies 
(direct payments) to rural development investments.  
 
 
Component 1: Improving the value-added of agriculture (US$35 million) 
 
24. The objective of this component is to improve the economic performance of small and medium agricultural 
producers in Serbia on- and off-farm. The component will support the building of entrepreneurial capacity of agricultural 
producers through the integration of production decisions with market requirements and technical and financial services. 
Activities will focus on improving land and labor productivity, broaden access to productive assets, technology, 
information, and credit, diversification of agricultural products, and access to markets, including traceability and 
differentiation strategies. Unlocking agricultural finance for productive investments, strengthening productive and 
entrepreneurial capacity of producers, developing short value chains and market linkages will stimulate economic 
activities in rural areas and can lead to the creation of jobs. It will also create capacity for better absorption of IPARD funds 
for improving the rural development of Serbia, while also strengthening alignment to EU CAP. 
 
25. The component is structured into two sub-components: (i) Improving entrepreneurial capacity – focusing on 
capacity building activities required to formulate business plans, investment decisions and financial support, from public 
and private sources; (ii) Improving productivity and competitiveness – comprising investments in equipment and technical 
assistance to support their implementation. The detailed description of the sub-components is provided below.  
 



Sub-component 1.1: Improving productive and entrepreneurial capacity (US$5 million) 
 
26. This sub-component will focus on technical assistance to producers, producer groups and agri-businesses for the 
formulation of business plans that normally bundle three key elements: i) investment in equipment, ii) working capital, 
and iii) technical assitance for productivity improvement and entrepreneurial capacity. The sub-component will finance 
the preparation and implementation of business plans for proposed investments, including: (i) business skills and 
organizational training for small-scale producers; (ii) preparation of subprojects, including information on financial cash 
flow as per bank requirements, including the formulation of matching grants15 for capital investments in equipment, 
machinery, processing units16, packaging, storage, etc., (iii) specific technical studies and consultancies that would 
contribute to the implementation and the execution of approved business plans; (iv) a communication strategy designed 
to raise awareness of and stimulate participation of the SME agribusinesses in the project; (v) support banks with 
developing methodologies suitable for assessing credit for the types of investments and beneficiaries of the project.  
 
27. The scope of the business plan will depend on the capacity of producers and the complexity of the sought 
investment. Activities will take place on- and off-farm. To enable greater participation of potential beneficiaries, emphasis 
will be placed on improving the entrepreneurial capacity of producers by providing technical assistance and seed capital 
for analysis of investment options. The business plans will also include public good/ compliance elemtns (environemntal 
and social aspects, food dafety compliance, etc.). Strict eligibility criteria will be set forth to enable the participation of 
small and medium producers. The selection and eligibility criteria and the governance and management aspects of the 
matching grants will be detailed in a Grant Operational Manual to be formulated during project prepration.  
 
Sub-component 1.2: Improving productivity and competitiveness (US$30 million) 
 
28. This sub-component will focus on improving the productivity and competitiveness of project beneficiaries through 
specific investments, as defined in the business plans and implemented through matching grants (defined in Component 
1). The total cost of the business plan depends on the type of investment, the amount of working capital and the scope of 
the technical assistance. This cost also varies by the productive activity and the typology of the producers. For example, 
in Montenegro (under the MIDAS project), the total cost for agricultural producers ranges between 10,000 and 70,000 
euros, while for agricultural processors it ranges between 50,000 and 250,000 euros. In Kosovo, the range for producers 
ranges between 10,000 and 100,000 euros, while for processors it is between 30,000 and 400,000 euros. The project will 
finance only a share of this cost (through a marching grant of typically 50%), as a one time incentive to leverage private 
investment, including own resources and/or credit. 
 
29. The sub-component will finance i) the use of good environmental and agricultural practices to improve on-farm 
productivity, ii) in on-farm inputs and equipment required for the optimizatoin of production and/or diversification, as 
well as technical advice for the use inputs, technologies, alternatives, etc., iii) support digital agriculture approaches to 
improve productivity on-farm and enhance linkages between producers and markets, iv) support compliance with food 
safety standards, traceability, geographic denomination of origin and other market-related activities as part of the 
improvement of the competitive position of beneficiaries; v) carry out market demand assessments to identify differential 
market potential for products; vi) support beneficiary participation in trade fairs and other events; vii) support the 
commercialization of agricultural products by improving access to medium-term finance, providing start-up capital for 

                                            
15 There is a strong public good argument for using matching grants – stimulate cross compliance (improving enviornmental outcomes), stimulate 
use of innovations, new technologies, development of skills, modernization, horizontal integration, financial inclusion. Through the project, capacity 
for the use of matching grants will be improved in the sector, which can lead to a consecutive better absorption of IPARD grants. 
16 Under IPARD grants, investment grants for processing facilities is only provided for new structures; national rural development program can provide 
investments for rehabilitation and upgrade of existent facilities.  



     

small- and medium-sized farms involved in productive partnerships, and by ensuring the availability of financing for value 
chain support. Considering the high risk of lending to small producers, the project will support the enabling environment 
for de-risking by working with existent public credit guarantee funds. There are various guarantee schemes applicable to 
Serbian agriculture and, in particular, the EIF and DCA17, which the project seeks to leverage as a risk mitigating mechanism 
for crowing-in private investment through lending by commercial banks.  
 
 
Component 2: Improving the capacity of MAFWM to support modern agriculture (US$10 million) 
 
30. The objective of this component is to improve capacity of MAFWM and related agencies to facilitate the enabling 
environment for improved sector performance through evidence-based policy making and provision of public goods, such 
as information systems and open data platforms. A digital platform for decision making18 will benefit all agricultural 
producers of Serbia, whether they apply for support through IPARD or national program or don’t. A unique registry 
system19 would be required to support decision making and to also support pension reform efforts in the country.   
 
Sub-component 2.1: Improving information systems 
 
31. This sub-component will support the Ministry of Agriculture Forestry and Water Management (MAFWM) to 
modernize its information systems and strengthen its decision-making capacity, through the improvement of hardware, 
software and human capacity for information support to the sector. Modernizing the information systems is critical in the 
process of alignment to EU CAP, including sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) delivery and monitoring, advisory information, 
land parceling (LPIS), paying agency data management, etc. In addition, the project will support a digital producer 
identification card (“one card”) to enable the better monitoring of the access to resources, support services and 
information by all farmers in the country. The project will finance the following: i) technical assistance to improve the 
coordination within and across existing information systems across Directorates and enhance delivery of information for 
decision making at different levels; ii) acquisition of hardware and software to improve the scope, functionality and 
compatibility of information systems and establish digital data collection and processing of current paper-based processes. 
 
32. The project will also assist the Ministry of Agriculture Forestry and Water Management (MAFWM) with technical 
assistance to develop capacity to assess the demand, structure, and modalities for agricultural Guarantee agency in Serbia, 
similar to these in other neighboring and EU countries, with the potential of establishing in the medium term such a 
guarantee agency (state-owned or PPP). Options to capitalize the guarantees would also be part of the assessment. 
 
 
Sub-component 2.2: Open data platform 
 
33. This sub-component will establish an open, public information platform where key information is accessible to all 
agriculture stakeholders. The project will finance the software, hardware and technical assistance required for the set-up 

                                            
17 Two public donor guarantee schemes with agricultural windows are expected to be available in early 2020 – European Investment Fund (EIF) 
(backed by EU funding) and the DCA (guarantee facility of USAID), still under negotiations with MAFWM – and can be tapped on by commercial banks 
in the first couple of years of project implementation. IFC is already engaged with the EIF. Although a public guarantee fund exists in Serbia (the 
Serbian Development Fund, SDF), it is weak and does not cater to agriculture. Hence, a capacity building (through a TA) activity may be warranted 
under the project to provide guidance on future needs by the public sector for unlocking private investment in agriculture. 
18 A PHRD grant on strengthening M&E capacity of MAFWM, implemented in parallel to this project, will support this platform thro ugh capacity 
building within the Ministry and technical assistance, as needed. 
19 For example, only farm household applying for IPARD grants are registered in the national farm registry (around 335,000), excluding a large number 
of agricultural producers. 


and functionality of the platform. Access to important production and market information, including weather variables, 
prices of key products, etc. is critical for on and off-farm decisions. This platform can also be a support system for advisory 
services in Serbia and can link to digital approaches on farm, ensuring a two-way communication on plan and animal 
health, and other risks that can constrain agricultural competitiveness. Maintaining the content and enabling public access 
to this platform is a key role that the Ministry can play in the enabling environment for agricultural sector transformation.  
 
34. A digital information platform can play an important role for the spatial tracking and connectivity of production 
and market demand, thus contributing to improved positioning of products, sales and overall competitiveness. In addition, 
by including weather and climate information modeling, the project could contribute to early warning systems, helping 
producers to better prepare and adapt to changing climatic conditions. The project will use existing digital agriculture tools 
and will collaborate with private sector IT companies for finetuning electronic delivery mechanisms for monitoring 
production, access to technical information, traceability of goods and identification of market opportunities.  
 
Component 3: Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation (US$5 million) 
 
35. This component will support the establishment of a project management team (PMT) in the Directorate of 
Agrarian Payments (DAP) and capacity needs related to project implementation, as well as project monitoring, including 
a comprehensive baseline, mid-term review and a final impact assessment of project investments.

Summary of Screening of Environmental and Social Risks and Impacts 

 
The project is classified as Moderate Risk taking in account the low risk nature of the interventions, the limitations on 
implementation capacity, the application of environmentally friendly practices and new technologies, and the difficulty 
of enforcing workers’ rights in multiple SME agribusinesses. No adverse impacts such as involuntary land acquisition, 
impacts on community health and safety, on cultural heritage, are expected. Some of the project funded activities may 
include support to small scale community agriculture that is undertaken within areas under some level of environmental 
protection. The project will introduce new technologies and support improvement of technical knowledge and skills of 
beneficiaries on, amongst other, water and energy efficiency, pollution prevention and best practice use of herbicides 
and pesticides. The project’s anticipated social impacts are predominantly positive, such as increased income and 
employment in the agricultural sector as well as protection from climate related economic losses for farmers through the 
introduction of an early warning system. As labor informality is prevalent in the agricultural sector, the Borrower will 
prepare Labor Management Procedures to manage risks related to workers’ rights in project supported agribusinesses. 
The environmental and social screening criteria developed for the agricultural grant schemes and the credit guarantee 
fund will screen for relevant risks and apply mitigation hierarchy.

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 
 

1. Nepal is an under-developed country located in the Himalayan region, with harsh mountain 
topography except for its southern part consisting of a narrow strip of flat land called the Terai region.  The 
economy is largely agrarian-based, with low labor productivity.  The shares of agriculture, services and 
industry in GDP are around 32, 50 and 18 percent, respectively.  The per-capita GDP/yr is around US$700 
(FY16) with 24% of the population below the poverty line.   Nepal experienced its slowest growth in 14 years 
in FY2016.   Real GDP growth, which slowed to 2.7 percent in FY2015 because of a devastating earthquake, 
was further dragged down to 0.6 percent in FY2016 due to the sluggish post-earthquake reconstruction 
activities and the disruption in cross-border trade. 
 
2. The weak economic growth of the past two years has setback the steady reduction in poverty. 
Poverty headcount rate is estimated at 11.8 percent in FY2015, down from 15 percent in FY2010, but is 
projected to increase slightly to 11.9 percent in FY2016, measured at the $1.90 a day line. A contributing 
factor has been the higher inflation. Based on a simulation exercise, other things being equal, a 2 
percentage points increase in overall inflation would raise poverty headcount rate by 0.8 percentage point 
(measured at $1.90), pushing approximately 225,000 people back into poverty. 

 
 

Sectoral and Institutional Context 
 

Agriculture, despite being the mainstay of the rural economy, suffers low productivity in the crop sector  
 
3. Agriculture is the mainstay of the rural economy and a source of income for the majority of Nepali 
with 66 percent of the population engaged in agriculture (small farmers constitute 80 percent of the rural 
population), a 32 percent contribution to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (Central Bureau of Statistics, 
FY16), and 50 percent contribution to exports earning.  
 

4. Despite this importance of the agricultural sector, the level of income from agriculture is low by the 
regional and international standards, particularly for the major cereal crops (lower than their potential yield 
by at least 50 percent).   Thus, agriculture in Nepal has not made substantial contribution to improving the 
living standards during the past decades.   
 
5. Nepal’s rural population comprises mainly smallholder farmers and about 80 percent of the rural 
population aged fifteen and above is engaged in agriculture.  The unavailability of sustainable livelihood 
opportunities in the rural areas has led to a large-scale exodus of the population to the cities and more 
recently to the Gulf region.  The absence of able-bodied farm labor, continuation of traditional irrigation 
practice, and limited exposure to modern agriculture practices, have led to reduced farm production.  
Existing farmers are generally unable to benefit from existing modern technologies and inputs. 
 
6. The pressing priority is thus to improve agricultural productivity and foster diversification towards 


high-value products to secure food security for a growing population and to improve rural incomes. 
 
Public investment in improving irrigation is becoming paramount for transforming the agriculture sector  
 
7. The frail mountain terrain limits the agricultural potential area to 2.641 million hectares (ha), of which 
1.77 million ha has irrigation potential.  Irrigation systems in Nepal fall under four distinct categories: (1) 
traditional farmer-managed irrigation systems (FMIS) developed and managed by the communities; (2) a 
range of small to large-scale surface systems developed with full or partial support from the government; (3) 
government-developed tube-well irrigation schemes; and (4) individually-owned and operated tube wells 
and pumps, mostly utilizing shallow aquifers, streams, ponds, and dug wells.  
 
8. At present, the total irrigated area stands at 1.39 million ha of which only 42% has year-round 
irrigation.  There is limited new land that can be brought under farming as most of the economically-suitable 
lands for agriculture have already been exploited, mainly because of the substantial increase in Nepal’s 
population in the past century, with the exception of some potential horizontal expansion in newly-irrigated 
lands of around 0.35 million ha through investing in inter-basin transfers (see government policy below). 
Thus the largest potential for increasing production is by providing better agricultural inputs and assuring 
irrigation to the already-existing cultivated land, namely, a “vertical expansion”.  Modern agricultural 
practices require crop diversification, high-yielding varieties, improved fertilization, and reliable year-round 
irrigation.    
 
9. Of the aforementioned improvements, improving irrigation is critical to agriculture both during the 
monsoon season to overcome the periods of dry spells as well as during the dry season when rainfall is 
negligible.  Agriculture is becoming even more vulnerable to water due to the erratic monsoon rain.  Even 
when recently precipitation during the monsoon has reached 90 to 110 percent of its long-term average 
after two years of low rainfall, farmers get unreliable rainfall with both droughts and intense rainfall/floods 
often occurring in same season.  Thus, transforming the agriculture sector requires upgrading the irrigation 
systems to regulate the irrigation supply.  Only by mobilizing public funding to invest in effective irrigation 
systems, farmers could then focus on the complementary inter-farm/farm-level investments such as 
improving agricultural techniques and inputs and cropping intensity, thus leading to transforming farming to 
more profitable levels. 
 
Government Irrigation Policy and Irrigation Development Program.   
 
10. The Government of Nepal (GoN) has thus recognized the lack of intensive cropping, inadequate 
supply and use of basic agricultural inputs such as fertilizer and improved seeds, and problems with 
deteriorated and inefficient irrigation systems.  
 
11. The Agriculture Perspective Plan (APP) assigns the first priority to accelerating agricultural growth 
through concentrated investment in irrigation. Also one of the key management goals of the APP is to 
expand farmer ownership and operation of irrigation schemes as irrigation is vital to the national 
agricultural production and economic transformation.   


Basic Tenets of Irrigation Policy 2013

 
12. The Department of Irrigation (DoI) is the lead agency in Nepal tasked with developing and improving 
irrigation infrastructure.  The primary effort of DoI has been to design and implement irrigation 
infrastructure to provide irrigation to potential new areas and also to intervene in existing schemes to 
improve their irrigation efficiency and sustainability. 
 
13. The GoN’s strategy for irrigation development and management is reflected in the Water Resources 
Strategy (2002), National Water Plan (2005), Irrigation Development Vision and Action Plan (2006), and 
recently, the Irrigation Policy (2013

1
, Figure below).   The main vision described in these documents is to 

integrate agriculture and irrigation development in order to realize the full benefits from investment in 
irrigation and provide sustainable services to the agriculture sector through well-operating irrigation 
facilities, based on local resources mobilization through a partnership of the users and the government. 
There is an emphasis on: (i) provision of year-round irrigation services to increase the productivity of 
irrigated agriculture and extending the cropping seasons; (ii) the need for a service-oriented management 
approach as a means for providing more reliable and flexible water services to farmers; and (iii) the 
progressive shifting of operation and maintenance (O&M) costs to water users to enhance efficiency, equity, 
and sustainability.   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14. As GoN internalized the concept of year-round irrigation through its Nepal Water Resource Strategy 
(2002) and National Water Plan (2005), the DoI aimed to provide year-round irrigation to vast potential 
areas to boost crop production, leading to food self-sufficiency, employment generation and poverty

reduction.  There are four themes under this DoI goal:  
a) Rehabilitation of existing FMISs;   

b) Design and construction of new irrigation schemes (including the ongoing MoRJKIP and its proposed 
phase 2);   

c) Improve the agency-managed large-scale irrigation projects and handover their management to 
beneficiary farmers (the so called, Irrigation Management Transfer (IMT)), either fully or below the main-
canal level; and  

d) Expand the irrigation area horizontally through investing in “inter-basin water transfers”. 

15. The Tables below reflect some of the DoI target indicators for the next five years, in incremental areas 
and crop yields.

New irrigation schemes   
 
16. The DoI is entrusted with the planning, design and implementation of medium to large-size irrigation 
projects mostly in the hills and Terai region. The Rani-Jamara-Kulariaya Irrigation Project (IP), Mahakali III, 
Babai IP, Sikta IP, Bagmati IP are examples of such large-size undertakings.  The development/modernization 


of medium to small schemes (below 300 ha in hills and below 2,000 ha in Terai) are implemented by the 
Medium Irrigation Project (MIP) and the Non-Conventional Irrigation Technology Project (NITP).  At present, 
the MIP has about 250 new irrigation projects in the pipeline with a combined cultivable command area 
(CCA) of approximately 37,000 ha and the NITP has in the pipeline about 732 small new projects especially 
in the hills/mountains with combined CCA of about 8,450 ha.  The DoI intends to continue the development 
of feasible new irrigation schemes in the future.  In addition, the DoI has started the use of solar energy to 
pump blue water to adjoining river terraces for irrigation.  This activity has already been initiated along the 
Bheri corridor and is under consideration for the Babai river, and the DoI intends to expand its use to all 
feasible areas.    
 
17. The Rani Jamara Kularia scheme (the ongoing Bank-financed Phase 1 and the proposed Phase 2) is 
amongst the largest schemes in the entire country under the category of new schemes, and it benefits one 
of the poorest areas in the Tarai in south west of the Karnali river basin.    

 
Farmer Organizations and Participatory Irrigation Management (or “Joint Participatory Management”, JPM) 
18. Nepal has a long tradition of farmer-managed irrigation systems (FMISs) in the hills, mountains, and 
the Terai.  The FMISs cover about 70 percent of the 1.2 million ha of land with some form of irrigation 
infrastructure in the country. The hill FMISs are generally small in size compared to the FMISs in the medium 
to large irrigation systems in the Terai.  A strong sense of ownership and hierarchical management system 
exists in the FMISs.  They often exist in some form of Water Users Associations/Groups (WUA/WUG), tasked 
with operation and maintenance (O&M) of the schemes, most of which is done through labor contribution.    
 
19. However, improving irrigation services in the existing FMIS schemes requires a combination of 
“hardware” and “software” solutions.  The former involves rehabilitating and modernizing existing irrigation 
and drainage infrastructure to improve reliability of supply and expand the system of secondary and tertiary 
canals.   The latter requires the development of more efficient mechanisms for managing the irrigation 
systems down to the field level, through a clear delineation of responsibilities between the government and 
the WUAs in charge of delivering irrigation services to farmers.  There is also a need to pool funding through 
government and users contributions for O&M and asset replacement over time. 

 
 

Relationship to CPF 
 

20. The proposed project is consistent with the Nepal Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY 2014–18 to 
support poverty reduction and shared prosperity in Nepal. The proposed project is aligned with the Pilar 2 of CPS 
– Increasing Inclusive Growth and Opportunities for Shared Prosperity. The proposed project aims to improve 
agriculture and water productivities through modernizing or rehabilitating the lower-order irrigation 
infrastructure, strengthening WUA, and implementing a comprehensive agricultural improvement program (CPS 
Outcome 2.1).  
 
21.  In line with the CPF, the Bank has been engaged in the irrigation and WRM sector through two lending 
projects, namely: (1) Irrigation and WRM Project, which is a collaboration of the Agriculture and Water Global 
Practices (IWRMP, IDA US$114m, closing in June 2018, targets 26,808 hectares); and (2) Modernization of Rani-



Jamara-Kulariya Irrigation Scheme-Phase 1 (MoRJKIP, IDA US$40m, due to close in September 2017, targets 
14,300 hectares).    The Performance and Learning Review (PLR) of the CPS, conducted in October 2016, has 
indicated that by FY2018 the IWRMP and MoRJKP would increase the area under improved irrigation services by 
a total of 50,000 hectares, and would improve the end-users satisfaction with the performance of the WUAs 
from around 5% to 40%. 
 

 
 
C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  

 
22.  The project development objectives are to improve the irrigation service and to strengthen farmer organizations 
in the irrigated areas of the Rani Jamara Kulariya Irrigation Scheme. 
 

Key Results (From PCN) 

 
PDO indicators:  

 
1. Area provided with new/improved irrigation or drainage services (a Corporate Result Indicator): in hectares. 

2. Farmers reached with agricultural assets or services (a Corporate Result Indicator): in number, with the 
number of females as a supplemental indicator.   

 
D. Concept Description 

 

23.    The proposed operation will focus on modernization of the lower-order irrigation system (sub-branches, 
tertiary canals and water courses) so that irrigation water can reach farmer fields with the optimal flows, 
continuation of the WUA/WUG support program, implementation of a comprehensive agricultural improvement 
program, and support to the river-basin planning process. 
 
24.    The proposed operation is a second phase of the ongoing IDA-supported MoRJKIP.  The ongoing project 
focuses on modernization of the higher-order irrigation infrastructure (intakes, feeder and branch canals, 
including related flood protection), enhancing the capacity of WUAs to operate and maintain the improved/new 
irrigation infrastructure, and preparation and initiation of an agricultural development program.  The MoRJKIP is 
on track toward meeting the PDO.    
 
24.       The proposed phase 2 is very essential in complementing the ongoing phase 1, because of two inter-
related necessities:  
 
1. First, below the main/conveyance system introduced by phase 1, without phase 2 the irrigation distribution 

and application efficiencies would continue to be low compared to the global/regional norms.  Farmers apply 
as much as 2-3 litre/second/ha (the irrigation “hydro-module”) compared to an optimal level of around 1 
litre/second/hectare.  The lack of bulk inter-seasonal water storage needs to be compensated by completing 
the modernization of the system down to the farm level, in order to optimize canal storage and irrigation 
scheduling, thus optimize the root-zone moisture across the crop-growth stages. 

2. Second, the WUAs function is not supposed to stop at the main-system level.  There is a need to utilize the 

immense potential for JPM in the Rani-Jamara-Kulariya community, building on the creation and 
empowerment of WUAs attained under the phase 1, so that the WUAs can also have a major role in the 
O&M of the irrigation subsystem down to the farm level.   
  

20. The envisaged project components are as follows:    
 
Component 1, Scheme Modernization (US$58 million, mainly civil works): will support the construction and 
modernization of the lower-order irrigation infrastructure, including the sub-branch canals, tertiary canals, and 
water courses. The activities will include design and execution of irrigation and drainage subsystems below the 
Branch Canals and down to the Field Outlet levels, including not only the irrigation subsystems but also related 
river-training and flood-protection works, collector and tertiary drains, and control structures. 
 

Component 2, Agricultural Production Support and Strengthening Water Users Associations/Groups 
(WUAs/WUGs) (US$6 million): will support: (i) strengthening WUAs/WUGs to assume responsibility for 
management, operation, and maintenance of the modernized system; and (ii) carrying out a series of 
agriculture-based activities in the project area to internalize the gains made in phase 1 and to increase and 
sustain agricultural production through the promotion of water-smart improved farming practices, crop 
diversification, post-harvest support, farmer training through demonstrations and farmer field schools, and 
other adaptive processes. Thus the second phase will adopt value-chain-based approach to support 
agricultural activities.   
 
Component 3, Project Management (US$1 million, including goods, technical assistance and capacity 
building): will support activities to ensure effective project management, including fiduciary and safeguards 
management and monitoring and evaluation. 

 
 

 
 
    

  SAFEGUARDS 

 

A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 
 
Located in the Kailali District of the Far Western Development Region, the proposed project will cover eight Village Deve 

lopment Committees (VDC) and Tikapur Municipality. Tikapur Municipality is the main market center in the project area. 
The existing Rani Jamara and Kulariya Irrigation scheme consists of three independent traditional irrigation systems 
constructed, operated and managed by the indigenous Tharu community.  The ethnic composition of the project area 
includes Tharus as the dominant group (48 percent) followed by Chhetri (17 percent), Dalit (15 percent), Brahmin (10 
percent) and others (7 percent).  There are three water users associations and one central committee (federation) that 
has representations of the three WUAs. 
The proposed project is in the Terai (plain) area of Nepal. There are community and state forests in and around the 

project area. Nearest protected area is the Bardiya National Park, which is located across the source river Karnali, in the 
east of the project area. The target area is the 14,300 ha of the Rani, Jamara and Kulariya command area.  Under the 
ongoing phase 1 which focused on the river/ main system level, the Natural Habitats (OP/BP 4.04) has been triggered 
because the Karnali River has protected and endangered aquatic species, including the Gangetic Dolphin, Marsh Mugger, 
and Gharial Crocodile.    Also, the Karnali River corridor (forests) is a wildlife movement route for especially elephant, 
tiger, and rhino.  As some of the phase 1 works have been aligned along the fringes of forest areas, the OP/BP 4.36 on 
Forests was triggered and issues were addressed as part of the Environmental Management Plan.  An Environmental 
Assessment (EA) of the Phase 2 will be commissioned to identify, assess and recommend measures for avoidance, 
minimization, and mitigation of potential adverse environmental impacts as well as to enhance positive impacts related to 
component 1 and component 2 of the project.   
 
The scheme abstracts water from the Karnali River, a major left-bank tributary of the Ganges River. The Karnali River has 

its source in China and flows through Western Nepal into India (where it is called Ghaghara River before it joins the 
Ganges). The Karnali River is thus an international waterway for purposes of OP 7.50.  Due to uncontrolled diversion of 
the Karnali River water into the main canals there is typically excessive water entry, while there is no control of the water. 
The scheme in its current state has very low water use efficiency and large water losses through seepage and water 
logging.  The proposed phase 2 will complement phase 1 in helping to reduce water abstraction from the Karnali River, by 
over 40 percent of the current water abstraction.  There upon, an exception to the notification requirement under OP 
7.50 has been received from South Asia‟ s Regional Vice President on February 24, 2011. A Strategic Environmental and 
Social Assessment (SESA) of the proposed River Basin Management Plan (RBM) will be carried out during implementation. 
 
B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 

 
The DoI is currently implementing MoRJKIP - Phase 1.  During the preparation of the ongoing MoRJKIP – phase 1, Social 

Assessment (SA) and Environmental Assessment (EA) were carried out, based on which DoI prepared Social Impact 
Management Framework (SIMF) and Environmental Management Plan (EMP) to manage social and environmental 
safeguard issues.  The SIMF prepared under Phase 1 includes a policy framework for land acquisition and resettlement, 
along with Vulnerable Community Development Framework, Gender and Social Inclusion Framework to ensure that the 
benefits from the project reaches the indigenous people, vulnerable people, women and other disadvantaged groups.  A 
Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) for the feeder canal was prepared and implemented.  Under Phase 1, private land was 
not affected but a few private structures were affected.  An Indigenous and Vulnerable Community Development Plan 
(IVCDP) was also prepared.  To manage social and environmental safeguard activities, a Senior Sociologist and 
Environmental Specialist have been appointed under Phase 1, yet he started work in a late stage of the project.  The DoI 
have acquired familiarity and experience with Bank’s social and environmental safeguard requirements through the 
ongoing MoRJKIP- Phase 1.  The recent safeguard rating under Phase 1 is moderately satisfactory. Besides the safeguard 

specialist recruited under the project, a Local Environmental Monitoring Committee (LEMC) was formed. LEMC 



consisted of representatives from environmental stakeholders in the area such as Bardia National Park, community forest 
users group, district forest and NGO, played positive roles in monitoring and providing advices / guidance with regard to 

environmental management. However, late recruitment of environmental specialists and turnover of the specialist was 
one of the weak points. The absence of specialist service/ support during initial stage and later as well has affected the 
timely support, monitoring, reporting, and implementing the mitigation activities as well as timely coordination with local 

stakeholders, and regularity of the LEMC meetings and awareness activities.   
 
The proposed project, Phase 2, will build on these existing frameworks and their implementation experience to comply 

with the safeguard policies.  The command area is defined, main canal and branch canal have been modernized in the 
Phase I.  An EA will be conducted for the new proposed system and EMP will be drafted accordingly to address 
environmental issues. The proposed project will intervene in the sub-system and inter-farm areas which are closer to 
privately-owned assets and livelihood. However, technical design of the project is yet to be performed, thus the specific 
nature and scale of the social impacts would be known later amid the pre-appraisal stage. Hence, social management 
framework is proposed. Gaps identified and lessons learnt during the implementation of RJKIP Phase I will be considered 
while revising the existing Social Management Framework.

Drona Raj Ghimire, Jun Zeng, Rekha Shreesh 

 
D. Policies that might apply 

 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

Same as phase 1. As the project scope under 
Component 1 and Component 2 includes physical 
construction activities, and agricultural production 
support, potential adverse impacts on the natural 
environment and human health and safety are likely. 
Command area is defined and main and branch canals 
are existing (modernized in Phase I).  Hence, EA and 
EMP will be prepared for the modernization and 
agricultural production activities. EA and EMP, inter 
alia, will cover issues related to labour and labour 
camps, and EHS issues (following World Bank Groups’ 
EHS Guidelines).   

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 Yes 

Was triggered in phase 1 due to working on the main 
system. Karnali and Mohana Rivers are known to have 
important aquatic species (Gangetic Dolphin, Marsh 
Mugger, and Gharial crocodile). Occasional movement 
of wildlife has been reported in the adjoining forests. 
During project preparation, impacts on natural habitat 
and biodiversity will be assessed and appropriate 


mitigations as part of EA and EMP, (or if necessary, 
Stand-alone Biodiversity Management Plan) will be 
prepared.  

Forests OP/BP 4.36 Yes 

Was triggered in phase 1 due to working on the main 
system. There are community forests adjoining the 
project command area. Some sections of the main/ 
feeder canal constructed in the Phase I was located in 
the community forests.  In the Phase II, sub-branch 
canals, tertiary canals, inter-farm water courses are 
the main construction works.  These structure are 
away from the forest areas.  Hence, there is less 
chance of adverse impacts on forest. However, during 
preparation of the project, each activity will be 
reviewed to see if the project has potential to cause 
loss or degradation (the health and quality) of forest. 
EA will assess potential impacts and propose 
mitigations, if necessary. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

 
Emphasis of Phase II, under Component 2, is to 

increase and sustain agricultural production by 
carrying out a series of agriculture-based 
activities, adopting value-chain-based approach. 
This may lead to introduction of pesticides or 
increased use of pesticides. During project 
preparation, this will be reviewed thoroughly and 
the EA / EMP will have measures, such as 
Integrated Pest Management, to mitigate adverse 
impacts (or if necessary, separate Pest 
Management Plan will be prepared).    

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 TBD 
This was not triggered in the Phase 1.  The ESIA will 
confirm if the project will affect PCR. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 Yes 

The RJKIP project will be implemented in an area with 
Indigenous ethnic minorities. Tharus, indigenous to 
the area, are in a majority (48 percent) followed by 
other indigenous groups from the hill. The project 
areas are also comprised of other vulnerable groups 
such as Dalits, women-headed households.   
SIMF will comprise a Vulnerable Community 
Development Framework (VCDF) and Gender and 
Social Inclusion Framework to guide planning 
approaches on indigenous peoples (and vulnerable 
groups) and interventions under the project. SA and 
VCDP will be prepared for project locations known by 
appraisal while VCDF will be the guiding document for 
the remaining works.  


Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

Major issues of land acquisition are unlikely.  However, 
the upgrading works may require small plots of land 
and have impacts on structures requiring relocation.  
Policy framework for land acquisition and 
resettlement will be included as a part of SIMF will 
provide a legal framework on involuntary 
resettlement. If project locations are known by 
appraisal, SA and RAP will be prepared. In other 
remaining works, where project location is not fixed, 
policy framework will be the guiding document in 
preparation of RAP. RAP will include among others 
entitlement matrix, communication strategy and GRM. 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 No 
Same as phase 1. Project does not include 
construction of dam, neither depends on existing dam. 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

Yes 

Was triggered with phase 1 as it focused on works on 
the river and main system.  In phase 2, works on the 
sub-system and inter-farm level are not expected to 
cause any appreciable transboundary water impact.  
The system modernization is expected to reduce water 
abstraction (the hydro-module is currently as high as 3 
liter/sec/hectare) thus will not impact the water 
flowing downstream.  Through a similar rationale 
under phase 1 an exception to the notification 
requirement under OP 7.50 was received from South 
Asia‟ s Regional Vice President on February 24, 2011.  

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No There is no disputed area.

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 

 
1. India’s growth remains robust but has moderated from prior high levels in the past fiscal year (FY18/19).  After 
growing at 7.2 percent in FY17/18, economic growth slowed to 6.8 percent in FY 18/19, with quarterly growth falling to 
5.8 percent (y-o-y) in Q4. Growth remains broad-based, but the impact of accelerating industrial growth was 
counterbalanced by decelerations in services and agriculture growth, on the production side. On the demand side, 
consumption has been bolstered by public spending, but investment growth has decelerated.  In FY18/19, the current 
account deficit is estimated to have reached 2.6 percent of GDP but a strong rebound in foreign investment over the 
second half of the year allowed foreign reserves to remain at a comfortable level of US$411.9 billion, as of end-March 
2019 (equivalent to about 9.7 months of imports). Going forward, output growth is projected to recover and stabilize at 
around 7.5 percent, thanks primarily to resilient private consumption, but also to a rise in exports of goods and services 
and a gradual recovery in investment. The current account deficit is projected to narrow to 1.9 percent of GDP in 
FY19/20 but external headwinds—in the form of re-escalating trade tensions and elevated oil prices – could put pressure 
on the balance of payments. 
 
2. Since the 2000s, India has made remarkable progress in reducing absolute poverty. Between FY2011/12 and 
2015, poverty declined from 21.6 to an estimated 13.4 percent at the international poverty line (2011 PPP US$ 1.90 per 
person per day), continuing the earlier trend of robust reduction in poverty. Aided by robust economic growth, more 
than 90 million people escaped extreme poverty and improved their living standards during this period. Despite this 
success, poverty remains widespread in India. In 2015, with the latest estimates, 176 million Indians were living in 
extreme poverty while 659 million, or half the population, were below the higher poverty line commonly used for lower 
middle-income countries (2011 PPP US$ 3.20 per person per day). Recent trends in the construction sector and rural 
wages, a major source of employment for the poorer households, suggest that the pace of poverty eradication may have 
moderated. 
 
3. India is the world’s third largest emitter of greenhouse gasses (GHGs) and is highly vulnerable to climate 
change. It has ratified the Paris Agreement (COP21) and is committed to “enhancing adaptive capacity, strengthening 
resilience, and reducing vulnerability to climate change”. India’s federal intended national determined contributions 

(INDC) commits to reduce the energy intensity of GDP from one-third and to increase the share of renewable energy 
(including from hydro generation). It also commits India to expand its existing carbon sink by 2.5 – 3.0 billion mt of 
carbon dioxide. Large areas of India are likely to be under water stress: 54 percent of the country’s area is subject to 
high or extremely high water stress, and almost 600 million face disruptions from surface water supply disruptions. 
Punjab and Haryana – major rice and wheat producing states – are particularly affected. More than half of the country’s 
groundwater wells are dropping, 16 percent by more than one meter per year.1 With shared water resources and given 
the region’s complex history, the region could see escalating tensions over water use in the future. 
 

Sectoral and Institutional Context 
 
4. Himachal Pradesh (HP) is a Special Category state in the Himalayan mountains. Special Category status is 
afforded due to inter alia: (i) mountainous terrain; (ii) low population density (123 per km2); (iii) significant population of 
scheduled tribes; (iv) HP’s strategic location bordering neighboring countries; (v) it’s ‘backward’ status in terms of 
economic development and infrastructure; and (v) non-viable nature of the state’s financial situation (the fiscal deficit for 
FY2019/20 is projected to be 4.4 percent of the state’s GDP). With an altitude ranging from 350 meters above mean sea 
level [msl] to 6,975 msl, much of the state’s area is sloping, with inclines of between 0.5 – 70 percent. Land with a slope 
of up to 40 percent is already typically under agricultural production; in some areas farming is practiced on even steeper 
gradients of 60 – 70 percent. Of a total of 3,243 Gram Panchayats (GPs) in HP, 551 (or 17 percent) have been declared 
‘backward’ status and therefore subject to special programs from the Government. Scheduled tribes are scattered 
throughout the state with concentrations in Kinnaur and Lahaul and Spiti, and parts of Chamba amounting to 6 percent of 
the total population of which 32 percent are located in Scheduled Areas of the State; there is also a considerable scheduled 
caste population of 25 percent. Himachal Pradesh is among India’s leading States on gender equality and social 
development. It has the highest female labor force participation rate in the country2, even though it has declined since 
2005. Much of the state’s female workforce participation is driven by women’s self-employment in agriculture, still the 
mainstay of the state’s largely rural economy. Women’s higher participation in agriculture, horticulture, and livestock 
sectors is socially and culturally embedded in the state, largely due to traditional out-migration of men for jobs that leaves 
the women behind to provide labor and supervisory inputs to pre-harvest and post-harvest activities. However, their 
access to ag-tech & climate resilient technologies, markets and finance, as well as to skills and entrepreneurship 
opportunities remains limited. Non-farm jobs for rural women remain limited. New opportunities in agribusiness are 
important to reverse the decline in women’s participation in agriculture.  
 
5. HP has a particular role to play in contributing to India’s INDC commitments. Its topography and available water 
resources are well suited to hydro generation with an installed capacity of 3,421 MW controlled jointly by the GoHP (8 
percent) and GoI (92 percent), against an estimated potential of over 27,000 MW. Only 14 percent of India’s total 
generation is from hydro, of which 8 percent is from HP.3 Meeting the INDC commitments on reducing the carbon intensity 
of India’s energy generation will depend on further exploitation of hydro in states like HP.  Improved watershed and 
catchment area management upstream of hydro reservoirs can reduce operational costs from siltation and water turbidity  
. Similarly, HP enjoys around 1.126 million ha of forest cover, representing 25 percent of the land area in the state and 1.5 
percent of India’s total forest cover of 70.827 million ha.4 Although currently a small share of the overall area, HP has 
substantial potential to further expand forest cover (including through increased density) and therefore will play a major 
role in contributing to the national commitments on carbon sequestration.  

         

 
6. The Government of Himachal Pradesh (GoHP) is already well experienced in management of its natural 
resources as a driver for development but recognizes the need to increase the quality and sustainable use of these 
resources. Over two-thirds of the total land area in the state is formally categorized as forest land, of which, 46 percent 
supports coniferous and broadleaved forests while the remaining 54 percent includes high altitude areas above the tree 
line, snow peaks, alpine pastures, and river beds. The state has zoned 23 percent of the legally classified forest area as 
protected areas (5 national parks, 26 wildlife sanctuaries and 3 conservation reserves) and HPFD manages these to protect 
biodiversity and promote ecotourism. These forests provide catchment areas for 5 major river basins. Despite 
considerable investments to date in catchment treatment and afforestation, forest quality (measured as canopy density) 
remains poor in HP. The gross area of forests is increasing due to better law enforcement, afforestation to offset forests 
cleared for development, and the partial lifting of the felling ban in 2018, which allowed for selective felling of older trees 
and subsequent regeneration. However, the quality of forests has not improved over the past six decades due to several 
factors, including poor afforestation techniques, lack of maintenance, incorrect site/plant selection, and uncontrolled 
grazing and fires.  The state has enjoyed significant success in agricultural development in particular fruit production and 
as a major source of off-season vegetables exported to other parts of India. Fruit production exceeds 600,000mt of which 
three-quarters is apples) while over 1.8 million mt of vegetables are produced annually. However, the majority of 
agricultural land (85 percent) remains under rain-fed agriculture and the land under irrigation reports a low intensity of 
137 percent (i.e. only one-third is used for more than one crops a year). Given changing weather patterns already observed 
(annual and monsoon rains declining by 2.26mm and 2.85mm per year respectively; mean annual temperature increasing 
on 0.02 degrees Celsius per year) progress could be easily reversed unless the state invests in adaptation strategies to 
increase resilience. 

 
7. Natural resource management (NRM) therefore remains pivotal to the state’s long-term economic and social 
development, especially in the context of climate change. A profile of climate smart agriculture (CSA) in the state, 
commissioned as part of project preparatory tasks highlighted critical aspects of both the mitigation and adaptation 
agenda in the state: 

 

• Mitigation: Agriculture is a minor source of the state’s GHG emissions, constituting only 1.8 percent (164,000mt 
of CO2 equivalent) of the total. Of these, 90 percent are attributable to rice cultivation over 43,450 ha of area; 
crop residue burning adds a further 8 percent and enteric fermentation contributes less than 2 percent. 
 

• Adaptation: There are many examples of CSA technologies already being deployed in cereals, horticulture, 
vegetable and livestock sectors. However, observed adoption rates are typically less than 30 percent, meaning 
there is considerable scope for scaling these up throughout the state. Adoption rates in the horticulture and 
higher-value vegetable sectors are typically higher. This is because the financial incentives are stronger but also 
because the farmer endowments that drive past diversification out of cereals are the same as those that make 
adoption easier. CSA technologies are not scale neutral, they are risky, and there are significant up-front 
investment costs. Integrating CSA technologies more thoroughly into the existing Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK; i.e. 
research and extension) system is essential.  
 

simultaneously both the direct cause and the victims of degradation. Supporting GPs to lead community-based 
development has and will continue to be a key tenet of the GoHP’s approach moving forward. 
 
9. GoHP has a clear and relevant vision for its NRM sector. First, it seeks to continue its impressive trajectory of 
rural transformation by raising agricultural productivity, strengthening market linkages and diversifying production 
patterns to increase agricultural value addition, while maintaining biodiversity and ensuring sustainable land and water 
use. Second, GoHP recognizes its role as custodian of a unique landscape with a special set of critical natural resource 
endowments that provide critical environmental services not only for its own population but for other states and indeed 
globally. Therefore, it recognizes the importance of reconciling the imperative of delivering results in terms of continued 
development for its population without undermining its natural resource base.  
 
10. The project addresses several elements of outstanding agendas in the realm of NRM, forestry and agriculture. 
A review of ex poste assessments (implementation completion reports and project or thematic evaluations) reports a 
positive track record of past interventions that have delivered on their project objectives, although considerable effort is 
required to achieve the necessary outcomes. This is in part a question of scale – past interventions have been necessarily 
focused – whereas in other aspects additional transformation and innovation is required. Notable innovations include the 
greater role of GPs in taking responsibility for, and managing investments in, sustainable landscape management and the 
development of CSA practices and their integration into existing farmer extension systems. Other innovations include the 
successful application for climate change financing and achievements in diversification into higher value market-oriented 
fruit and vegetable production, leveraging HP’s position as a major off-season producer serving distant Indian markets. 
The major challenges moving forward are to further scale-up these successes by utilizing Bank support to address specific 
institutional and technical constraints for doing so – i.e. not just the financing of scale-up which can in principle be deferred 
to GoHP’s own resources. 



 
The World Bank  
Integrated Project for Source Sustainability and climate Resilient Rain-fed Agriculture in Himachal Pradesh 
(P165129) 

 
 

Relationship to CPF 

 
11. The World Bank Group’s Country Partnership Framework (CPF) juxtaposed: (i) India’s development priorities as 
outlined in its FY2017-19 action agenda as well as national missions and programs; (ii) the assessment of India’s challenges 
in sustaining progress towards the twin goals as set out in the Bank’s Strategic Country Diagnostic (SCD); (iii) the WBG’s 
comparative advantage in the country; and (iv) lessons derived from decades of WBG engagement in India. The CPF 
identified three substantive areas: (i) promoting resource efficient growth; (ii) enhancing competitiveness and enabling 
job creation, and (iii) investing in human capital. In addition to these focus areas, the CPF also set out four operating 
modalities. These are: (i) leveraging the private sector; (ii) strengthening public sector institutions; (iii) engaging a Federal 
India; and (iv) promoting a “Lighthouse India” that connects practical know-how for the benefit of India and the wider 
world. 

 
12. The project is consistent with the CPF by delivering outcomes for resource efficient growth in targeted GPs in HP 
and in enhancing competitiveness of farmers and related agribusinesses in selected value chains. It also seeks to 
strengthen public sector institutions while leveraging the private sector and will contribute significantly to Lighthouse 
India by demonstrating approaches in challenging agro-ecological conditions of wider interest across the Himalayan range. 

 


     

C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  
 
13. To increase the sustainable use of water resources in Himachal Pradesh by improving upstream watershed 
management and increasing agricultural water productivity in selected Gram Panchayats 
 
Key Results (From PCN) 

 
14. Proposed PDO-level indicators are as follows: 

• Increased sustainability of perennial water sources in targeted watersheds 

• Selected upland areas managed in accordance with site-specific management plans 

• Increased agricultural water productivity among participating farmers 

• A more institutionally integrated approach to multi-sectoral watershed-level decision making 

• Increased adoption of climate-smart technologies among participating farmers 
 
 
D. Concept Description 

 
15. The overarching problem statement the project seeks to address is that HP is facing increased demand for, and 
reduced supply of, water resources and therefore needs to manage these better if it is to maintain its economic growth 
without jeopardizing continued downstream supply to the grain basket of Punjab.  HP’s population increased 13 percent 
over the decade 2001 – 2011 with an ever-greater share now residing in urban areas. Niti Aayog reports5 that half of all 
springs are now dry or seasonal. Addressing this challenge requires progress under three pillars: 

 

• Sustainable land and water resource management; 
 

• Improved agricultural productivity and value addition; and 
 

• Institutional capacity of GoHP to sustainably manage watersheds and resource use trade-offs and to effectively 
deliver environmental services. 

 
16. Each element contributes to the overall theory of change that underpins the proposed project design, as follows 
and summarized in the Figure below: 

 

• Land and water management: Current land use practices in upstream watersheds is resulting in excessive soil 
erosion and degradation, rain-water run-off and depleted rates of recharge of critical aquifers. Soil run-off results 
in reduced natural soil fertility (with a resulting loss on productivity or additional costs for replacement of 
inorganic fertilizers) and reservoir and intake sedimentation with the consequent loss of hydro generation 
capacity and damage to turbines, and/ or reduced availability of stored water for drinking or irrigation. This is 
compounded by retreating glacial sources and changes in rainfall patterns linked with climate change. 
 

• Existing agricultural productivity remains low – both in terms of physical yields (mt/ha) and value (Rs/ha). The 
use of irrigation is extremely limited across the state, with surface irrigation predominating and more limited use 
of the drop or sprinkler systems required for higher value crops, which can lead to substantial increases in water

productivity. The absence of irrigation remains a binding constraint on farmers’ ability to increase incomes (and 
therefore undermines the policy objective of doubling farmer incomes) and renders them vulnerable to climatic 
shocks; a situation that is becoming increasingly precarious with climate change. 
 

• The GoHP lacks robust institutional mechanisms for making trade-offs and investments to ensure sustainability 
of environmental services into the future. It cannot properly evaluate relative values of competing uses for the 
states’ natural resources, especially in terms of the states’ overall management of environmental services. There 
is an absence of underlying analytical foundation for such trade-offs to be evaluated, and no formal structures to 
facilitate integrated decision-making. Moreover, fragmentation amongst ministries and agencies means that any 
investments in upstream watersheds are typically insufficient and/ or inconsistent and therefore not adequate or 
efficiently delivered. 

 
Figure 2: Summary of the Theory of Change 
 

 
 
17. The project will deploy institutional and technical solutions to address these challenges. These are explained in 
more detail below with each proposed project component corresponding to the constraints thereby completing the 
project’s theory of change. 
 
Component 1: Sustainable Land and Water Resource Management 

 
18. This component promotes participatory and sustainable land and water management through financing the 
planning and implementation of investments in selected catchments based on the Sutlej Basin Comprehensive CAT 
(CCAT) plan, and micro-catchment plans in other river basins. For each of these, range-level site-specific management 
plans (SSMP) will be prepared to specify detailed activities by location. The main implementers and beneficiaries will be 



HP Forest Department (HPFD) staff and relevant community organizations, particularly Joint Forest Management 
Committees (JFMCs). The component will include a combination of TA, investments, and partnerships with other agencies 
and will lead to improved forest cover (and hence carbon capture), increased water and sediment regulation, reduced 
erosion, and improved community participation in and benefits from forest management.  

 
Subcomponent 1A: Improved planning for participatory and sustainable land and water management 
 
19. Subcomponent 1A will strengthen landscape planning. Specifically, it will: (a) review progress and revise the 
existing Sutlej Basin CCAT plan; (b) prepare micro-catchment plans in other project river basins; (c) support additional 
diagnostic studies, designs, and assessments; and (d) develop SSMPs through a participatory process led jointly by the 
HPDD and JFMCs. The CCAT plan review will identify the most cost-effective interventions implemented to date and 
propose revisions to plan investments and locations based on new hydrological and sediment load modeling. The CCAT 
plan review will include the design and implementation of a comprehensive M&E system for CCAT plan investments 
initially across the Sutlej Basin and later replicated in other project catchment areas and will include measurement of 
water flows and sediment loads to refine the hydrological models and ensure that investments maximize silt retention 
and surface water absorption. 

 
Subcomponent 1B: Implementation of participatory and sustainable land and water management investments 
 
20. This subcomponent will finance the implementation of activities identified in the SSMPs will contribute to 
improved forest cover and quality (including carbon emission reductions and sequestration), as well as improved water 
and sediment regulation. Activities supported by this subcomponent include, but are not limited to, the following areas: 

 

• Soil and water conservation measures. Vegetative measures, such as af/re-forestation, grass seeding, grass turfs, 
brushwood, live hedges, and spurs, as well as mechanical measures, such as check dams, drop structures, crate 
wire spur structures, bunds and water harvesting, and drainage line treatments, like gully plugging.  
 

• Development of high-quality seed stands. Establishment of a geo-referenced seed production system; 
construction of a centralized seed center to process, treat, store, and test seed; and construction of a climate-
controlled seed bank.  
 

• Nursery development. Provision of machinery and equipment to produce the additional seedlings. 
 

• Forest management. Planting and management of trees in open and medium density forests and slopes vulnerable 
to soil erosion and protection of plantations 
 

• Pasture management. Introduction of rotational grazing, delineation of forest areas for the supply of fodder, and 
the introduction of voluntary systems to prevent livestock from grazing in young forest. 
 

• Forest fire prevention and suppression. Organization of community fire protection groups; provision of locally-
appropriate firefighting equipment to the HPFD offices and participating communities; and training of 
communities on controlled burning, and the collection and use of pine needles. 

 
 
 


     

Component 2: Improved Agricultural Productivity and Value Addition 
 
21. This component would support interventions in downstream areas where the primary (existing or potential) 
water use is for irrigation in agriculture. It would seek to augment the use of irrigation as a principle strategy for shifting 
from low-value cereal production to higher-value fruit and vegetable production but would do so with a focus on 
increasing water productivity so as to maximize the financial returns to water use. Key interventions include infrastructure 
to increase high-productivity water utilization (drip and sprinkler irrigation plus the necessary primary and secondary 
distribution systems) 
 
Subcomponent 2A: Increasing value addition through improving water productivity  
 
22. Subcomponent 2A will support investments in the provision of water by investing in primary and secondary 
distribution infrastructure and matching grants for the purchase of on-farm equipment for drip and sprinkler (i.e. high-
tech) irrigation technology. It will support decentralized water infrastructure development under the Pradhan Mantri 
Krishi Sinchai Yojana (PMKSY) based on robust micro-watershed plans across clusters of GPs in locations. By focusing on 
water productivity rather than water availability it will only invest in increasing water utilization in GPs where: (i) upstream 
investments in source sustainability are being implemented under Component 1; and (ii) where productivity of subsequent 
use will be maximized thereby ensuring ‘more crop for the (incremental) drop’. 
 
Subcomponent 2B: Adoption of Climate Smart Technologies and Diversification into High-Value Crops 
 
23. This component supports the adoption of climate smart agriculture (CSA) practices for existing cropping 
patterns in beneficiary GPs and also facilitates farmers to diversify into high-value crops, either in conjunction with 
high-tech irrigation equipment. The project will leverage HP’s agricultural research and extension system and existing 
Government-backed interventions to expand the adoption of contemporary CSA practices among participating farmers. 
CSA practices will apply to both existing cropping patterns and to new higher-value crops. Where the evidence of what 
constitutes CSA practices in these new crops is limited, the project will collaborate with the research institutions to 
strengthen the evidence base. This component will leverage and support the Government’s own KVK farmer extension 
system and their Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY; now known as the Remunerative Approach for Agriculture and Allied 
Sector Rejuvenation). By focusing on the market, and in conjunction with Subcomponent 2C, the approach adopted here 
will take a value chain perspective with competitiveness at the fore.  
 
24. This sub-component will also support greater use of Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFPs) as part of the 
diversification agenda, and as a mechanism for incentivizing community participation in sustainable land and water 
management. This will create alternative livelihood opportunities, by removing barriers to investment in NTFP value 
chains, and increase local incomes from sustainable production and increased value addition. This sub-component targets 
NTFP collectors, often women, and producers interested in cultivation of NTFPs (medicinal, aromatic plants) and other 
high-value commodities identified for value chain development. Alignment with the relevant line departments (e.g., 
agriculture, horticulture, and animal husbandry) will be ensured. In addition to improving local livelihoods, the proposed 
activities will reduce pressure on watersheds and contribute to increased carbon sequestration and storage and reduced 
erosion. Strengthening NTFP value chains and institutions with a focus on women, will enhance livelihood diversification 
and improve communities’ resilience to climate change. 

 
25. There is potential for securing climate change finance for on-farm and/ or community investments in 
reforestation and/ or economic trees. HP successfully secured the first ever Clean Development Mechanism subproject 



in project under the Kyoto Protocol was registered with the UNFCCC in March, 2011. This was implemented in 11 
watershed divisions and covering 140 GPs it generated carbon credits trough reforestation activities supported under the 
MHWDP. A scoping assessment supported by the World Bank has identified significant potential for similar carbon 
financing via Indian private sector conglomerates seeking to invest in carbon offsets for their industrial enterprises as well 
as for corporate social responsibility (CSR) motivations.  
 
Subcomponent 2C: Support to farmer groups linked to agri-business clusters 
 
26. This component will promote agribusiness clusters among several GPs in high-potential areas already 
benefitting from project interventions under Component 2. Fostering value addition, agribusiness and agro-industry 
clusters requires coordinated planning and investments by a range of departments. The key objective is typically to 
aggregate production to internalize economies of scale and provide sufficient volume to meet the minimum efficient scale 
of agro-processors hereby stimulating private investment by agribusinesses and promoting value addition. There may be 
other efficiencies for instance in waste treatment and the clustering of ancillary businesses. The project will seek to 
aggregate via clusters in collaboration with farmer organizations (which will also be strengthen under the project). This 
component will coordinate such investments to promote clusters which will connect groups of beneficiary farmers, via 
their respective farmers’ associations, to agribusiness to facilitate processing and value addition.  
 
27. Interventions will include technical assistance to farmers’ groups and prospective agribusinesses as well as 
some (likely modest) infrastructure provision to locate participating agribusinesses. This will fall short of ‘agro-business 
park’ models but could include specific locations for the establishment of agro-businesses close to the producing areas 
and including last-mile infrastructure as well as facilities for storage, packaging and waste management. 
 
Component 3: Institutional capacity building for integrated watershed management and making policy trade-offs. 
 
28. The objective of this component is two-fold: first, is to support a more comprehensive and holist approach to 
managing the state’s water resources recognizing competing uses both within HP and downstream in other states in 
particular Punjab; second to facilitate a better alignment of institutional mandates for IWM and strengthen the HPFD’s 
institutional structure and capacity for improved forest service delivery. It will be implemented through a combination of 
TA and investments.  
 
Subcomponent 3A: Improving the governance structure for integrated watershed management 
 
29. Through the convening power of the HPFD and its role in managing watersheds, this subcomponent will provide 
TA to support improving integrated watershed management (IWM). The subcomponent will support an IWM 
institutional assessment to (a) identify the institutions that affect water supply, quality, use, and management and their 
roles, responsibilities, and mandates; (b) conduct a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats analysis of the 
current institutional framework and highlight any overlaps and/or gaps that undermine IWM; (c) identify opportunities 
for institutional coordination and synergy; and (d) build consensus on the need for reform and develop the goals and 
vision for institutional collaboration, a time-bound action plan, and an implementation road map. The results of this 
assessment are expected to inform the GoHP on the necessary longer-term reforms to the relevant state institutions that 
will result in effective interagency cooperation and, ultimately, IWM.  
 
Subcomponent 3B: Institutional reform and strengthening of the Himachal Pradesh Forest Department 
 


30. This subcomponent will support the institutional development of HPFD. It will provide TA and investments to (a) 
conduct a functional review of forest institutions (FRFI) that will produce a vision, goal, and time-bound action plan for 
change; (b) implement an initial set of prioritized HPFD institutional reforms; and (c) strengthen the HPFD’s capacity to 
deliver its core mandates. This subcomponent will also support an initial set of prioritized institutional governance reforms 
through TA and investments. These reforms include the (a) development and implementation of a comprehensive HPFD 
IT and knowledge strategy that integrates all relevant applications on a common geospatial platform and allows for 
watershed-level planning;6 (b) development and implementation of a comprehensive HPFD monitoring and evaluation 
(M&E) system; (c) establishment of a centralized staff performance monitoring system; and (d) development of regulatory 
and management standards for pastures. Finally, this subcomponent will finance training and capacity-building activities 
based on a comprehensive training plan. The trainings will cover diverse subjects and will be designed with a climate 
change lens to build climate resilience.7 Training will include all project participants. 
 
Subcomponent 3C: Improve water resource coordination and decision making at the macro-level 

 
31. This subcomponent will operationalize some of the opportunities for institutional coordination and increasing 
synergy between the different institutions involved with water resource management, identified in subcomponent 3A. 
Coordination. Successfully managing watersheds and water supply/use, both the upland and downstream areas, will 
require managing tradeoffs between the different treatments, uses and beneficiaries. There are a great number of 
stakeholders involved, including numerous state departments (e.g. HPFD, Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, Horticulture, 
Irrigation and Public Health etc.), individuals and the private sector, donor supported projects, NGOs, local governments, 
and local communities. This component will set up a high-level decision-making process (based on improved data collected 
by the project), in a transparent and participatory process to provide strategic guidance and to manage the trade-offs 
necessary to ensure sustainability.  
 
Component 4: Project Management. 

 
32. This component would support the project management function including key staff and operational costs. The 
precise nature of the project management entity is to be determined (see below) although at least in the medium-term 
financing will be required for staff on secondment from other Departments and externally recruited staff in areas with 
skillsets outside the current bureaucratic endowment. A key example is agribusiness for which few existing staff of 
Departments have the required expertise. It would also support the project monitoring and evaluation functions as well 
as grievance redress apparatus, and project communications and outreach including the contribution to Lighthouse India 
by which project lessons can be shared with other states. 
 
33. The component would also support a robust evaluation of impact. The team will consider options for statistically 
robust evaluative techniques (randomized control treatment GPs; discontinuity methodologies utilizing similar treatment 
and control GPs etc.) as a foundation for project evaluation. 

 
Information and Communication Technology 

 
34. The project would specifically seek innovations in information and communication technology (ICT) in all 
aspects of the project (building on experience in other agricultural projects in HP and across India). ICT and geospatial 

                                            
6 The preparation of the IT strategy will include the analysis of the most appropriate disruptive technologies. 
7 The subjects will include management of seed stands, nursery management, range management, forest protection, community 
mobilization, and institutional development. 


analysis would be utilized to inform project planning and implementation and a web-based GIS platform will be established 
to report progress, and to allow stakeholders to report implementation concerns. Furthermore, there are opportunities 
for ICT-based tools to quickly assess soil type (for optimum fertilizer application) which when used offer direct benefits to 
farmers while also helping construct a detailed soil map of the state. Remote monitoring systems can provide real-time 
data on weather, water flows and turbidity and can play important roles in weather-related risk mitigation, irrigation 
scheme-level and farm management decision-making and in project monitoring. The use of blockchain technology is 
increasingly being deployed to facilitate traceability of fresh produce in agricultural value chains and will be encouraged 
by the project. Greater use of cell phone-based market information systems can increase market efficiency and empower 
farmers to supply more remunerative markets and to negotiate higher prices. 
 
Proposed Project Locations 

 
35. Project locations will be identified based on a robust and objective set of criteria. The primary criteria will be to 
identify (i) high priority micro-watersheds that are in urgent need of remedial steps to maintain their perennial water 
sources and then to overlay these with (ii) locations with high potential as agricultural and agribusiness clusters. Once 
these areas are identified, further criteria will be to select specific GPs recognizing the need for a qualitative approach. It 
is expected that in total around 900 GPs will be included. 
 
36. The project will be applied in all districts of HP with the exception of the two high mountain districts of Kinnaur 
and Lahul and Spiti. There are seven main river basins in HP and in principle the project could select micro-watersheds 
within any basin. However, a modified approach will reflect those basins for which activities similar to those proposed in 
Component 1 are already being supported by other Development Partners (DPs) (for instance, KfW supported HP Forest 
Eco-System Climate Proofing Project in Kangra and Chamba Districts and the JICA supported Project for Improvement of 
Himachal Pradesh Forest Ecosystems Management and Livelihoods in Bilaspur, Shimla, Mandi, Kullu, Kinnaur and Lahul 
and Spiti Districts). In such cases, this project would collaborate closely with those interventions, gap-filling Component 1 
where necessary and focusing more on delivery of Component 2. 

 
37. The project will also consider the merits of structured phasing. For instance, one option would be to defer 
interventions in Sutlej basin until the Comprehensive Catchment Area Treatment (CCAT) plan revision is completed as this 
would help better target the resulting investments under Components 1 and 2. Conversely, there may be proposed project 
areas which are already high priority with an underlying analytical foundation for the rapid delivery of interventions under 
Components 1 and 2 (perhaps those in areas supported by KfW and/ or JICA projects).

Summary of Screening of Environmental and Social Risks and Impacts 

 
The project will undertake measures to improve the state of water resources in Himachal Pradesh towards ensuring 
sustainability and climate resilience in the agriculture sector. It will achieve this through interventions across the areas of 



natural resource management, forestry and agriculture. In particular the project will: i) promote participatory and 
sustainable land and water management through strengthened landscape planning and ii) implement NRM activities 
from the plans such as soil and water conservation measures like check dams, bio-engineering structures, etc, 
development of high quality seed stands, nursery development, forest and pasture management and forest fire 
prevention and suppression; iii) provide water through primary and secondary distribution infrastructure and matching 
grants for the purchase of on-farm equipment for drip and sprinkler irrigation technology; iv) support the adoption of 
Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) practices for existing cropping patterns and facilitate diversification into high value 
crops; v) strengthen NTFP value chains; vi) promote agribusiness clusters including technical assistance to farmers groups 
and infrastructure provision to facilitate storage, packaging, waste management as well as last-mile linkages and vii) 
undertake institutional capacity building for integrated watershed management and making policy trade-offs focusing on 
the Himachal Pradesh Forest Department (HPFD). 
The environmental risk rating of the project is ‘Moderate’. Overall, the impacts of the project financed activities on forest 
cover and quality, water and sediment regulation, water use efficiency and carbon sequestration are expected to be 
positive.keeping in view the proposed activities envisaged at this stage of the project, it is understood that “no adverse 
impacts to critical habitats are expected.” Because activities will be outside critical natural habitats or any activities that 
would impacts on critical habitats will not be financed. No adverse impacts to critical habitats or cultural heritage are 
expected. The risk seems to be moderate. 
Potential for adverse social impacts come from i) infrastructure (aggregation, processing, soil and water conservation, 
water distribution, pasture and nursery development); and ii) access and use restrictions related to natural resource 
management, NTFP value chains and forest fire prevention interventions. Other potential social risks are exclusion of 
small and marginal farmers, nomadic tribes, scheduled castes and scheduled tribes from project institutions and benefits 
that relate to on farm irrigation inputs, seeds and other improved farming inputs and training. Community level conflicts 
could also arise from water sharing infrastructure and systems, any land use restrictions mentioned above.While most 
interventions are likely to be small scale, and the impacts are not expected to be significant, the capacity of the borrower 
to implement and manage the above social risks as well as those related to labor, community health and safety and 
sustained stakeholder engagement raises the risk profile to moderate.

Concept Review 
Decision

Track II - The review did authorize the preparation to continue

I. Introduction and Context
Country Context
India is a lower middle-income country with per-capita GDP of US$ 1,499 (2013).  From 2001 to 
2011, India’s economy performed well, with sustained annual GDP growth of 8%.  High rates of 
investment and savings contributed to this growth, as did strong exports. Yet more than 400 million 
people in India still subsist on less than US$ 1.25/day.  India faces challenges in reducing extreme 
poverty, curbing high malnutrition and achieving shared prosperity.  The Government of India has 
emphasized increased farm productivity as fundamental to India’s poverty reduction and growth 
strategy. Building relevant skills sets has been a persistent challenge across the economy.  
Educational institutions, particularly at the tertiary level, are critical to accelerate India’s emergence 

in global markets, yet teaching is poorly linked with labor market demand, research and 
development, thereby producing graduates with limited problem-solving skills.

Sectoral and Institutional Context
Agriculture in India employs 52% of the labor force and is the main source of livelihood for 80% of 
the rural poor, but contributes only 14% to GDP and 10% to total exports. Women constitute about 
60% of the economically active population in agriculture and livestock. The Green Revolution in 
the late 1960s and 1970s, with investment in new seeds, production technologies, cultivation 
methods and irrigation practices, improved agricultural productivity and made India food-secure.  
Where the Green Revolution flourished – Haryana and Punjab – are today among the higher income 
states in the country.  However, agricultural productivity growth declined in the 1990s, rebounded 
in the 2000s, and today still remains low. Moreover, this growth has been largely price driven and 
heavily reliant on inputs rather than efficiency gains.  
 
At current Total Factor Productivity (TFP) growth, India’s domestic agricultural output will meet 
59% of the country’s 2030 projected food demand (GAP Report 2014).  Agricultural higher 
education can be the engine for increasing productivity through better skilled technicians, 
innovative research and extension linked to technologies and practices, common under the Land 
Grant model.  A 2014 Bank agricultural sector study argues that while India doubled investment in 
agricultural research and extension (0.4% of AgGDP in 1981 to 0.96% in 2011), the quality of 
innovation has suffered along with institutional capacity to adapt and remain relevant.  
Reawakening the “research-education-extension nexus” intrinsic to the Land Grant model can 
propel India’s agricultural innovation, farmers’ technology adoption and agriculture’s overall 
transformation.  In Brazil, for example, the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education 
Personnel (CAPES) and the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development 
(CNPq) have worked together to build and maintain high-quality faculty in universities nationwide. 
 
The National Agricultural Education System comprises 56 State Agricultural Universities (SAUs), 
one Central Agricultural University, and four Research Institutes with deemed-to-be university 
status.    The first SAU – G. B. Pant University of Agriculture and Technology, Pantanagar – was 
established in 1960 based on the US Land Grant model emphasizing the integration of research, 
education and extension.  Under the Indian Constitution, statutory control of agriculture (including 
agricultural education) lies with the respective State Governments while the Union Government 
coordinates and sets educational standards. In 1996, the Indian Council of Agricultural Research 
(ICAR) began voluntary SAU accreditation to establish norms and quality standards for agricultural 
higher education.  ICAR continues its financial support to SAUs for accreditation; to date, ICAR 
has accredited 43 SAUs.   
 
The face of Indian agriculture has changed.  Women producers must participate in and benefit from 
agricultural research, education, and extension. There is also growing private sector demand for 
skilled labor in all aspects of agriculture, particularly high-value agro-industry, food processing, and 
specialized knowledge-intensive areas such as water efficiency, food safety, and trade.  A 2014 
assessment of human resource requirements shows an annual deficit of 14,000 in satisfying the 
demand for degree holders in agricultural and allied sciences.   A 2010 National Academy of 
Agriculture Research Management study found a jobs deficit of 50% in agriculture and allied 
sciences relative to the anticipated demand in 2020.   SAUs must adapt to the rapidly changing 
agricultural sector and its increasing knowledge intensity, and prepare the high-quality human 
resources essential for any technology and innovation system to succeed.   



 
Yet the once-impressive SAUs established during the Green Revolution have become less effective 
and less relevant in stimulating transformative change in Indian agriculture. The research-education-
extension synergy — strong in earlier years — has waned substantially and academic inbreeding 
has stunted teaching curricula, eroded faculty quality and weakened research and extension 
outcomes.  As a result, the SAU system is not attracting high-quality students to equip the next 
generation of talent to lead India’s agricultural growth, principally in the private sector. 
ICAR has taken the lead in analyzing the challenges facing agricultural higher education in India.  
This has led to an ambitious reform agenda for SAUs, spelled out in the 2013 Bhubaneshwar 
Declaration, emphasizing: (a) transparent governance; (b) financial and academic autonomy; (c) 
adequate and consistent funding; (d) standards and accreditation; (e) public-private partnerships; (f) 
revamped teaching curricula and methodologies; and (g) international cooperation.   Several 
challenges confront SAUs, among these: 
 
• Poor governance: Vice-chancellors tend to be political appointees and often have little role 
in setting budget priorities or allocations.  Overall accountability is weak and not linked to desired 
academic outcomes. 
• High faculty vacancy rates and pervasive academic inbreeding: Some 56% of SAU faculty 
positions are vacant, with minimal recent recruitment, leading to heavy workloads, poor teaching 
performance and scarce time available for research or extension. Limited contacts with national or 
international centers of excellence and weak linkages with industry, farms and the private sector 
have led to academic stagnation, at a time when competitiveness requires more such interaction. 
There are few incentives to spur faculty productivity in teaching, research or extension. 
• Disconnect between agricultural education and employment: The private sector generates 
nearly one-half of agricultural employment, yet curricula remain focused on the shrinking 
opportunities in the public sector. Importantly, curricula lack a problem-solving orientation. SAUs 
must strengthen job-driven programs, including entrepreneurship-focused courses, to build avenues 
for off-farm work and facilitate technology transfer from lab-to-land.  
• Capital development and financial management:   Salaries comprise up to 90% of SAUs’ 
budgets, funding is almost entirely sourced from the public sector and has not kept pace with 
increasing student admissions.  In contrast, Michigan State University, a model for Indian SAUs, 
sources 10% of its annual budget from public funds. SAUs must begin to raise their own resources 
through fee-based/market-oriented programs, sales of proprietary seed/planting material, 
consultancies and capital development initiatives. 
• Meeting globalization: Greater infusion of frontier science subjects (e.g., biotechnology, 
nanotechnology, precision and climate-resilient agriculture, information and communication 
technology), good trade practices, ethics of intellectual property rights and genetically modified 
crops, and market intelligence have become critical to promote efficiency, awareness, equity, and 
competitiveness in agriculture as India strives to cement its role as a global player in agriculture. 
• Forging service market development: Staffing of Agricultural Technology Management 
Agencies (ATMAs) and Krishi Vigyan Kendras-KVKs (Agriculture Science Centers) and other 
professional private and public agricultural service providers will require business and technical 
skills to meet the knowledge demanded by farmers, particularly women.  
 
The World Bank and ICAR have a long and fruitful collaboration, most recently through the 
National Agricultural Innovation Project (NAIP), National Agricultural Technology Project (NATP) 
and sector work.  The current ICAR reform priorities require further refinement and focus, and 
ICAR has requested World Bank support as a knowledge adjunct to the proposed project. 

The challenges faced by SAUs mirror those faced in general by higher education in India.  The 
needs of the agricultural sector resonate with other sectors, i.e., highly trained workforce and 
relevant cutting-edge research.  The Bank’s Agriculture and Education Global Practices are 
collaborating on the proposed project to ensure that the SAU reform process benefits from 
innovations in both sectors across India and internationally.  Through strategic priority interventions 
at the Central and State levels, the proposed project would have far-reaching and long-term impacts 
on agricultural higher education in India.  The project would also incorporate disbursement-linked 
Indicators (DLIs) to build time-bound financial incentives for SAUs and ICAR in pursuit of the 
proposed reform agenda.

Relationship to CAS
The proposed project supports the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2013-17 and addresses the 
three engagement areas of integration, transformation and inclusion. These engagement areas 
foresee increased agricultural productivity and also support quality improvements of higher 
education to create a more skilled workforce that continuously improves the productivity of key 
sectors, including agriculture.   Further, by working with SAUs in low-income states, the proposed 
project supports the CPS strategy of improving their economic performance.  
 
The proposed project is a multi-Global Practice collaboration (Agriculture and Education) and is 
expected to support activities and results directly related to cross-cutting strategic areas of climate 
change, jobs, gender and public-private partnerships.

II. Proposed Development Objective(s)
Proposed Development Objective(s) (From PCN)
The project development objective is to increase educational relevance and quality in selected State 
Agricultural Universities. 
 
Equity, especially gender and caste-based equity, is a cross-cutting theme of the proposed project 
and would be tracked through the key performance indicators.

Key Results (From PCN)
The following key performance indicators are proposed: 
 
1. Percentage change in SAU faculty scientific effectiveness as measured by h-index [quality]; 
2. Percentage change in level and source(s) of SAU revenue [quality]; 
3. Increased awareness and uptake of locally-relevant agricultural research [relevance];  
4. Increased student retention rates, disaggregated by gender and SC/ST [quality, relevance 
and equity]; and  
5. Increased satisfaction rates of students, farmers and agribusinesses with SAU curricula and 
service provision [quality and relevance].

III. Preliminary Description
Concept Description
The proposed project addresses strategic reforms in agricultural higher education at the state level 
(targeting SAUs) and the central level (focused on ICAR).  Selected SAUs would pilot a range of 
innovations in education, research and extension under diverse settings.   In so doing, these SAUs 


will test options to create 21st century educational institutions to successfully meet the current and 
future challenges facing India’s agricultural sector. These institutions will attract a diverse cadre of 
high-quality students, train them with labor-market relevant skills, nurture research talent and 
ensure knowledge flows between lab and land. The second set of reforms will empower ICAR by 
strengthening its capacity to provide strategic support to SAUs nationwide.     
 
The project would likely consist of three components: 
 
Component 1 – Support to State Agricultural Universities – addresses the need to raise educational 
quality and relevance in SAUs and create knowledge and technology hubs for priority themes in 
support of agricultural transformation.  The component, which would absorb most of project 
finance, would have two sub-components: 
 
Sub-component 1a – Investments toward 21st Century State Agricultural Universities – would 
target reform-ready SAUs and States (applying verifiable criteria) and support Institutional 
Development Plans (IDPs), developed through multi-stakeholder processes, that undertake key 
governance reforms, finance new and refurbished research and teaching facilities, curricula and 
faculty development, training for administrators, strengthening locally relevant research, student 
placement and technical assistance. Supported IDPs would also emphasize universities’ exploring of 
alternative income streams, such as: tuition; alumni contributions; competitively-selected research 
projects; patents; joint ventures; extension services; consultancy services; and special courses for 
mid-career professionals. These diverse activities would not only generate own financial resources 
for SAUs, but also link them to the national and global knowledge economy, thereby further 
enhancing their relevance.  By focusing on income-earning capacity, SAUs would also create 
openings for sustained private sector participation.  Suitable twinning arrangements with foreign 
universities would also be explored, as would innovative pilots for research dissemination and 
mechanisms for internal revenue generation.  
 
Sub-component 1b – Investments in Centers for Advanced Agricultural Science and Technology – 
would support SAUs in establishing interdisciplinary centers for teaching, research and extension on 
critical agriculture and rural development topics (e.g., agricultural adaptation to climate change; 
land and water use efficiency, scalable technology and mechanization, agro-industry, agro-
entrepreneurship).  Multi-stakeholder consultations would inform the selection of geographic 
locations and core themes under the sub-component.  The sub-component would finance research 
and teaching equipment, faculty and scientist development fellowships, scholarships, and costs 
associated with twinning arrangements with similar centers outside and within India. 
 
Component 2 – Investments in ICAR for Leadership in Agricultural Higher Education – would: (a)  
empower ICAR by financing its own internal reforms to enhance its effectiveness in coordinating, 
guiding and managing agricultural research and education nationwide; and (b) support ICAR in its 
interactions with SAUs and key stakeholders nationwide through interventions that increase the 
quality and relevance of agricultural education.   The component would have two sub-components: 
 
Sub-component 2a – Investments in ICAR to support excellence in SAUs – would leverage ICAR’s 
comparative advantage in assessing systemic challenges ac ross all SAUs and incubating solutions.  
Among the interventions financed would be: (a) digital information systems for SAU data collection 
and analysis to improve quality metrics in agricultural higher education; (b) an improved curricula 
review process to tighten its relevance in today’s dynamic job market; (c) enhanced methods to 



consolidate and disseminate global best-practices (e.g., benchmarking) in agricultural higher 
education; and (d) institutionalization of stakeholder and advisory inputs to better inform research, 
education and extension across the SAU system.          
Subcomponent 2b – ICAR innovation grants to SAUs – would be open to all SAUs nationwide and  
support interventions that would include: (a) quality assurance (e.g., accreditation); (b) next-
generation management information and financial management systems to increase transparency 
and administrative efficiency; (c) campus student placement offices to facilitate stronger linkages 
between academics and future employment opportunities; (d) theme-based competitive grants to 
students, faculty and academic departments to promote inter-state and international collaboration, 
including matching funds from the private sector; and (e) needs-based equipment, training and 
technical assistance.  
 
Component 3 – Project Management and Learning – would support ICAR’s project management, 
primarily through its Education Division, to administer, supervise, monitor and evaluate overall 
project implementation.  The component would also support the formation of an external advisory 
board to guide ICAR throughout project implementation.

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 

 
1. Over the past two decades, Cambodia has undergone a significant transition, reaching lower middle-
income economy by raising its per capita income from USD 250 in 1995 to an estimated USD 1,230 in 2017. Driven 
by garment exports and tourism, Cambodia has sustained an average growth rate of 7.7% between 1995-2018, 
ranking sixth in the world1, among the fastest-growing economies in the world and has achieved impressive gains in 
poverty reduction. As global demand peaks in 2018, economic growth is estimated to have reached 7.5%, compared 
to 7% in 2017. Growth is expected to remain robust over the medium term. Growth was accompanied by a significant 
decline in poverty incidence, which dropped from 47 percent in 2007 to about 13 percent in 2013 thanks largely to 
high agriculture commodity prices globally as well as strong job creation in manufacturing and services. Around 3.6 
million jobs in industry and services were created over the past two decades. Cambodia’s growth has been pro-poor. 
The percentage of Cambodians living under the national poverty line fell from 47.8 percent in 2007 to 13.5 percent 
in 2014, according to official estimates. The Gini coefficient declined to 0.30 in 2014 from 0.34 in 2009. Cambodia 
has made significant progress in attaining the Millennium Development Goals. Since 1990, the country has more than 
halved extreme poverty and maternal mortality, achieved nearly universal primary education enrollment, and made 
significant progress in combating HIV/AIDS. Poverty reduction was particularly dramatic from 2007 to 2009, when 
poverty declined by 25 percentage points and 3.3 million people escaped poverty, owing in large part to an expansion 
of cultivated area and high international food prices which benefited both farmers and agriculture workers. 

2. Among the main drivers of growth have been exports of goods and services and foreign capital inflows. 
Since opening its economy to international trade and capital flows in 1992, Cambodia has become one of the East 
Asian countries most open to trade and foreign investment. Exports of goods and services grew at an average of 18 
percent during 1994-2017, with Cambodia ranking 4th in the world in exports during that period. Notably, its export 

                                            
1 World Development Indicators. Four countries that experienced a recession during this period are excluded.  


 

success is driven by a few products, with final garments and footwear accounting for nearly three-quarters of total 
exports and has been facilitated by preferential access to key markets. Cambodia is also among the top countries in 
the world in terms of attracting foreign direct investment (FDI), which has facilitated entry into some global value 
chains (GVCs).  
 
3. With an aspiration to become an upper middle-income country by 2030, Cambodia needs to strengthen 
its existing drivers, which are weakening, while building new drivers of growth. The end of the commodity super-
cycle, coupled with adverse weather shocks, have resulted in a sharp slowdown in agriculture growth. Meanwhile, 
Cambodia’s labor-intensive, export-oriented garment and tourism sectors are facing rising wages and greater 
competition from abroad. There is evidence that all merchandise export growth, tourist arrivals, as well as FDI into 
manufacturing have slowed during 2013-2017.  Moreover, the EU is considering the suspension of preferential 
market access for Cambodian exports under the Everything-but-Arms (EBA) scheme, which could mean tariffs of 
about 12 percent for Cambodian garment exports, threatening sector competitiveness. 

 
Sectoral and Institutional Context 

 
4. Growth has also been driven by the country’s rich and diverse natural capital, which supports the 
livelihoods of millions of Cambodians. Agriculture, which depends heavily on natural resources and ecosystem 
services, contributed 27% of the annual gross domestic product (GDP) in 2018. More than five million people depend 
on agriculture and fisheries, to supplement their income and support their food security, and 88 percent of the 
population still relies on traditional biomass for cooking. Cambodians are also the largest consumers of freshwater 
fish per capita, with fish and other aquatic resources contributing to 37 percent of total protein consumption. 
Tourism, another engine of economic growth, is also becoming increasingly dependent on natural resources and 
environment. 
 
5. Going forward, Cambodia may not be able to rely on the same factors that drove strong growth and 
poverty reduction over the past two decades. In the case of agriculture, the outlook for commodity prices is not 
positive, and Cambodia’s scope for further gains in cultivated area is more limited nowadays, especially considering 
the need for environmental sustainability. Risks posed by the degradation of natural resources could affect economic 
sustainability. It is crucial to maintain and develop natural resources while strengthening climate resilience. Low 
prices for agricultural commodities along with rising salaries will require improvements in productivity to remain 
competitive. Given the continued importance of the agricultural sector to growth and poverty reduction, Cambodia 
will need to foster a gradual transformation of the sector through intensification, diversification, and value addition. 
The public sector could facilitate expanded irrigation, knowledge, and technology adoption in collaboration with the 
private sector and strategies of quality differentiation by enhancing systems for managing quality and food safety 
and introducing an overall coherent approach to ‘brand’ Cambodian food and agriculture.  
 
6. The benefits of economic growth and the reduction of poverty has not been shared equitably among 
Cambodian citizens. Disparities in income and access to opportunities remain, particularly in rural communities. 
Rural communities which are still heavily relying on land, forests, and other natural resources for their livelihoods are 
still faced with widespread poverty in rural Cambodia.  Landlessness and access to natural resources remains a 
problem. 
7. Inequality in ownership and/or access to productive assets such as land is a major concern because it 
implies the likelihood of a trend to growing inequality of production, income and consumption in the future. In the 
absence of dramatic expansion of off-farm employment or livelihood opportunities to absorb landless labor, the 

concentration of land in fewer hands implies a growing gap in the opportunities available to different types of 
households.  
 
8. Key reforms are needed for Cambodia to sustain pro-poor growth, foster country’s competitiveness, 
sustainably manage natural resource wealth and improve access to and quality of public services. Cambodia 
continues to have a serios infrastructure gap and would benefit from greater connectivity and investing in rural and 
urban infrastructure is essential.  
 
9. The Royal Government of Cambodia is making growing efforts to address landlessness and tenure 
insecurity, including increasing Indigenous Communal Land Titling (ICLT). Commune-based and national Social Land 
Concession projects, both Government and donor funded have been established, addressing rural poverty and 
providing a social safety net or retirement benefit for demobilized soldiers. Where accompanied by adequate 
infrastructure and service provision, these projects have shown to be able to provide sustainable livelihoods. 
However, needs (and demands) of landless and tenure-insecure population groups and the challenges in addressing 
them remain significant. Landlessness and poverty remaining an issue in rural areas. 
 
10. Under the original LASED and the second phase LASED II projects, participatory planning of agriculture 
and livelihood activities has progressively led to the adoption of good practices in agriculture production in the 
land recipient communities. 5,000ha of agricultural land are newly under perennial or annual crops, on 3,000ha 
beneficiaries apply improved production technologies that help raising incomes and protect natural resources.    
Accompanying investments in infrastructure, including the planned and ongoing support to small-scale irrigation 
schemes, have further increased sustainability of agriculture-based livelihoods, making sure products and production 
processes respond to market demands and are resilient to the short and long-term climate changes affecting the 
areas. At the same time, road linkages to and from the SLC areas benefit not only the direct land recipients but many 
more stakeholders that travel to and from the area, providing new business opportunities, decreasing transaction 
costs, and stimulating economic and social exchange.  A new, third phase and project would expand and extend 
activities and benefits to new target groups in new provinces.  
 

Relationship to CPF 
 

11. The Project supports the achievement of the World Bank’s twin goals to end extreme poverty and promote 
shared prosperity through its emphasis on expanding the benefits of poverty-targeted land distribution and 
infrastructure and service provision, as well as reduce climate risk vulnerability to a broader segment of the poor and 
marginalized population in rural areas.  The Project is also consistent with, and part of the World Bank Group’s Country 
Partnership Framework (CPF) for Cambodia 2019-2023 which received Board approval in May 2019.  Furthermore, it 
supports the objectives in the government’s Rectangular Strategy IV (RS4), particularly the objectives of poverty 
reduction, agriculture development, diversification and commercialization, and improving rural infrastructure and 
services. The project supports the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 1 on eradicating extreme 
poverty and SDG 2 on preventing hunger and improving nutrition. 

 
C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  

 
12. The project development objective is to help improve target beneficiaries' access to agriculture resources 
and selected infrastructure and social services in project communities.  

Key Results (From PCN) 


13. The key results that the Project would achieve include: 

 

• Tenure security for formerly landless or land-poor, and other marginalized groups or individuals, i.e. 
indigenous communities. 
Achievements would be measured by the number of registered land rights (including titles) and the area 
(ha) that was provided to beneficiaries.  

• Infrastructure and service provision in the project areas, benefitting not only the direct target group but 
supporting broader area development. 
Achievements would be measured by the number of people that live along newly built or upgraded 
roads and who benefit from improved connectivity and market access. 

• Sustainable, agriculture-based livelihood development for individuals and groups in the project 
communities. 
Achievements would be measured by increased incomes from farming, and improved food security (and 
nutrition) amongst the target beneficiary families.  

 
14. With a potentially nation-wide coverage, implementation will focus on the existing LASED provinces, plus 
the Northeastern Provinces of Mondulkiri, Rattanakiri, Stung Treng and Preah Vihear.  A total of 30-40 project sites 
(sub-projects) would be included, covering a total of approximately 10,000 -15,000 direct beneficiary households.  
Benefits from improved infrastructure availability and usage will accrue to a broader beneficiary group in the project 
areas. 

D. Concept Description 
 

Component 1: Social Land Concession (SLC) and Indigenous Communal Land Titling (ICLT) Investment 
Planning and Prioritization (approx. US$20million) 

 
15. This would continue support for: (a) participatory preparation and updating of SLC or ICLT plans for the new, 
and where necessary also existing sites, respectively; (b) identification, prioritization and planning of appropriate 
technology and infrastructure investments, including the collection of project baseline data at additional sites, and 
responding to increased monitoring requirements; and (c) processing of individual SLC land titles for eligible land 
recipients in the existing sites. Additional and adjusted activities would include (d) facilitating incorporation of climate 
smart/climate change resilience considerations, and where appropriate specific NRM protection in new and or 
existing land use plans for project areas; and (e) processing of communal land titles in areas where the project sites 
include indigenous communities with respective demands. 

Component 2: Land Preparation and Infrastructure Development (approx. US$50million) 
 
16. This would support the settling-in requirements as well as the required land preparation and prioritized 
infrastructure investments at new project sites. These include the: (a) provision of settling-in assistance to newly-
installed land recipients; (b) provision of initial land preparation assistance including a first cover crop; and (c) 
provision of productive/economic and social community infrastructure investments such as rural roads, small-scale 
irrigation systems, water supply and sanitation facilities, school buildings, teachers’ houses, health posts and 
community centers, among others. Based on the experiences in existing SLC areas and responding to the significant 
infrastructure gaps in rural areas expected to be encountered at the proposed new project areas, it is expected that 

the Project’s largest investments would be provided for rural climate resilient roads, with benefits of those expanding 
beyond the direct beneficiaries, including entire communes and areas.  With the substantial increase in project area, 
the absolute amount for infrastructure investments will be considerably larger than under LASED II.  The second 
largest item for project investments concerns water infrastructures, both for climate change resilient small-scale 
irrigation schemes or water reservoirs and for provision of safe water supply and sanitation.  

Component 3: Agriculture and Livelihood Development (approx. US$20million) 
 
17. This would primarily support the improvement of climate-change resilient agricultural production systems, 
livelihoods and food security of new land recipients, including facilitation and provision of support services and 
technical assistance. These would include support for: (a) community organizing and development; (b) provision of 
agricultural service and extension support following a pluralistic service provider approach; (c) establishment of 
farmer-managed demonstration plots and model farms; (d) establishment and/or strengthening of farmers 
organization, agriculture cooperatives, production and marketing groups and other community interest groups; and 
(e) provision of community fund to strengthen successful local initiatives. Agriculture and livelihood support would 
be adjusted, where applicable, to the specific sociocultural and biophysical environments of new project areas, in 
particular in IP areas. Promotion of nutrition-sensitive agriculture will be part of the training curricula prepared and 
implemented by MAFF and PDAFF.  Adaptation and expansion of existing MAFF materials on nutrition-sensitive 
agriculture production will be part of the support.  

18. The Project will build on the experiences with LASED interventions, which highlight the need of strong 
agriculture development support to quickly integrate farming systems into the local and wider economy, 
strengthening agriculture-based livelihoods and provide quick returns and strong incentives to land recipients.  
Taking into consideration that additional project locations under the Project will include areas in provinces with 
important natural habitats, the Project will incorporate in its agriculture and livelihood development plans activities 
for protecting private, communal and public lands.  Where applicable, community forestry activities will be supported 
alongside private agriculture activities.   

19. An additional focus of agriculture and livelihood development under LASED III will be a specific response to 
climate change challenges.  In order to (further) strengthen the resilience of agriculture and food systems in the 
existing and new sites under the Project, responses to short- and long-term climate changes will be an integral part 
of support.  This will particularly include irrigation and water management support, integrating site specific planning 
into ongoing or prospective broader area development approaches.  

Component 4: Project Management, Coordination and M&E (approx. US$10million) 
 

20. This component would support adjusted project administration and coordination activities. It would ensure 
in particular the timely and transparent flow of funds, procurement, auditing and reporting. It would also support 
project implementing entities at all levels (including the new provinces and new communes) to establish (where 
needed) and strengthen their fiduciary, administrative and reporting capacities. Clear assignments for procurement 
and FM responsibilities of each IA will guide effective an efficient implementation. Ministry of Land Management 
Urban Planning and Construction (MLMUPC) will be the executing agency, with participation from the Ministry of 
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF), National Committee for Sub-National Democratic and Development 
Secretariat (NCDDS) as implementing agencies for this proposed project.  They will carry out procurement activities 
at national level for their respective activities in the components and sub-components, respectively.  Communes and 
communities will carry out procurement activities at the sub-national levels if and as applicable.  

21. Specific attention and support would also be provided to adapt and strengthen the Project’s M&E system, 
and further expand and enhance the Project and SLC/ICLT-related management information system as input to the 
site planning and prioritization. Support would include technical assistance, training, incremental operating costs, 
vehicles and equipment, among others.

Summary of Screening of Environmental and Social Risks and Impacts 

 
The overall environmental and social risk classification is high. The screening of risks and impacts is based on discussion 
with the task team, consultations and observations undertaken during a mission, secondary data, and specialist 
experience with LASED II. 
 
The project will support the process for SLC and ICLT, establishment of sustainable infrastructure and livelihood systems 
including land preparation, provision of social and economic infrastructure, agriculture support and livelihood 
development. Restrictions on access to land and natural and cultural resources resulting from these activities may impact 
on nature-based livelihoods and tenure of vulnerable or marginal households and communities where decisions may not 
be managed in a participatory manner. While the project aims to deliver a range of benefits including economic 
development and community livelihood opportunities, project activities have the potential to generate significant social 
impacts, direct and indirect, due to the range of activities related to land consolidation, indigenous community lands, 
agriculture and infrastructure. The scale of the proposed activities, across sensitive locations (indigenous areas) and new 
focus on ICLT presents risks related to collective registration of indigenous communities’ lands.  
 
Nine of the standards have be screened as relevant. Standard ESS9 on Financial Intermediaries is not considered 
relevant. 
 
The implementing agencies have good competency in implementing projects in accordance with national requirements 
and World Bank Safeguards Policies but have less familiarity with and experience in delivering projects in line with the 
Environmental and Social Framework. Prior to project appraisal an Environmental and Social Commitment Plan (ESCP) 
will be prepared which will take into account the need to ensure budget, staffing and operational arrangements for 
project environmental and social risk management. For new sites involving indigenous communities as sole beneficiaries, 
to understand and address project related risks and impacts, a social assessment will be prepared prior to appraisal to 
inform project design and project level social risk management framework, also to be prepared prior to appraisal. The 
assessment will inform revisions to existing social risk management frameworks and plans, including on stakeholder 
engagement, at both project and community level.

I. Introduction and Context
Country Context
Background. China's success in reducing extreme poverty during the economic reform period 
(1978?2014) is widely recognized. Over the last three decades, China has lifted over 750 million 
people out of poverty, which represents 89 percent of global poverty reduction during that period. 
World Bank estimates show that the number of absolute poor (that is, those people consuming less 
than $1.25 per day in PPP terms) in China declined from 84 percent in 1981 to 6.3 percent in 2011. 
Based on different poverty lines, official government estimates confirm a similar sharp decline in 
poverty over these years, and the number of the people who lived on less than US$2 per day was 
approximately 367 million or 27.2 percent of the total population. Using China's rural poverty line 
of annual per capital net income below CNY 2,300 (2010 constant process and which is slightly 
above the 1.25US$/day in PPP terms), the number of poor people living in rural areas declined to 
70.2 million in 2014. This represents continued decline of rural poverty from 17.2 percent in 2010 
to 8.5 percent in 2013. 

 
Economic growth has been a key driver for poverty reduction in China. From 1981 to 2011, real 
GDP per capita grew at average annual rate of 9.1 percent. The relationship between annualized 
GDP growth and poverty reduction during this period suggests that poverty headcount index 
(measured by US$ 1.25 per capita PPP line) fell annually by 0.99 percentage points for each 
percentage point increase of the GDP per capita. Improvements in access to public services, such as 
education and health, has been another driver of poverty reduction. All levels of education, 
employment in non-agricultural activities, and migration have been identified as critical forces 
driving poverty reduction. 
 
Geographically, the remaining pockets of poverty, including chronic poverty, are largely 
concentrated in rural areas, especially in mountainous and remote areas in western provinces of 
China with ethnic minorities. These areas are usually characterized by challenging natural 
environment with water scarcity, low soil fertility and poor endowment with natural resources. The 
Government has classified 14 zones (crossing provincial boundaries) as the focus for its poverty 
alleviation efforts. The 14 zones contain 680 nationally designated poverty counties which benefit 
from special financial support under the government??s rural poverty alleviation programs. Majority 
of these poverty counties are concentrated in mountainous areas of central and western China and 
among ethnic minority and other disadvantaged groups, including people with disabilities and 
elderly.

Sectoral and Institutional Context
Guangxi ranks the fifth province in the nation in terms of the absolute poor numbers.  Out of its 
total population of 52.4 million in 2013 there were 6.3 million poor people Guangxi which gives 
poverty incidence rate of 14.9 percent.  Majority of these poor live in rural areas and over 80 
percent of the poor people are from ethnic minority groups. Some 17.1 million people belong to 
various ethnic minority groups, making it a largest ethnic minority population in China. The 
province has 28 national level designated poverty counties and it is a recipient of a significant 
portion of national poverty reduction funds from the central government. In 2013, the net income 
per capita in these counties remained 59.6 percent of the national average.  The main causes of the 
poverty are low levels of human capital (poor education attainment levels and lack of skills needed 
to participate in modern economy) in particular in mountainous rural areas; poor natural resources 
base and limited infrastructure (roads, water and electricity). 
 
China has seen a rapid growth in the number of farmer cooperatives since the Law on Specialized 
Farmer Cooperatives promulgated in 2006. In March 2015 there were about 1.3 million specialized 
cooperatives in China. In some of the proposed project counties, formally registered cooperatives 
were almost non-existent before 2009. Their numbers are now growing rapidly and cooperatives are 
allowing both enhanced presence of the agribusiness sector and small entrepreneur initiatives. 
However, while most cooperatives are now recognized as economic entities, they are often small-
scale and lack management skills. The project is expected to benefit from the national legal 
framework for farmer cooperatives, which is expected to be updated in 2015.

Relationship to CAS
The proposed project is consistent with the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), approved in 2012.  
The project would support the CPS's strategic theme two: promoting more inclusive development, 
by geographically focusing on lagging regions and small towns and by supporting policies and 
demonstration projects that address inequalities. It would contribute to the CPS outcome 2.3: 


enhancing opportunities in rural areas and small towns, by piloting new ways to boost rural incomes 
and reduce poverty under the umbrella of the new Poverty Reduction for China's Rural Areas 
Strategy (2011-2020) and by promoting inclusive innovation to decrease disparities.

II. Proposed Development Objective(s)
Proposed Development Objective(s) (From PCN)
The proposed PDO is to increase income opportunities for rural households in selected poverty 
counties of Guangxi.

Key Results (From PCN)
The achievement of the PDO would be measured by: (a) the number of project beneficiaries joining 
a new organizational arrangement decomposed by poverty levels and gender; and (b) the number of 
project supported cooperatives making profit.

III. Preliminary Description
Concept Description
Project Area: The proposed project areas are located in the rural areas of the Dian Gui Mountain 
Degraded Area. Within this area 10project counties under the two cities of Baise and Hechi are 
proposed. These include: Tiandong, Tianlin, Leye, Donglan, Bama, Fengshan, Dahua, and Pingguo 
County, and Yizhou City. All of the selected counties/city are characterized by a particular high 
level of poverty combined with poor natural resource conditions, difficulties in water management, 
limited availability of farm land,low levels of technology and a high percentage of ethnic minorities. 
 
Proposed Project Components: The proposed project would consist of the following four 
components with a preliminary cost estimate of US$182 million including a Bank loan of US$100 
million and counterpart funding of about US$82 million equivalent implemented over five years: 
 
a) Component 1: Improvement of Pro-Poor Value Chains. The component aims to address 
market failures in the development of agricultural and non-agricultural rural value chains and key 
industries with a particular focus on linking poor rural households with higher value markets. The 
component would finance the Cooperative Development Fund (CDF), which would provide grant 
financing to newly or existing cooperatives. It would also aim to establish Competitive Grant Fund 
for Enterprises which would provide matching grants to finance enterprise investments in order to 
demonstrate linkages and benefit sharing with poor farmers/households.  
 
b) Component 2: Improving Public Infrastructure and Services. The component would support 
the establishment and strengthening of public infrastructure and service systems in support of value 
chain/key industry development under the Component 1. It would provide financing for rural 
infrastructure such as rural roads, small-scale irrigation and drainage infrastructure, small water 
storage facilities, land levelling, IT infrastructure, public market facilities, etc. The component 
would also support public services, such as product certification, developing and registration of 
local/regional brands, branding and protection of ethnic minority product features, market and 
production risk management as well as strategic product marketing and promotion.  
 
c) Component 3: Enhancing Investments in Poor Areas. The component would improve and 
facilitate investments in poor areas by existing and new entrepreneurs and business entities such as 
Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), migrant returnees, or cooperatives through establishing 



business incubation centers and risk management instruments.  
 
d) Component 4: Project Management and M&E. The component would strengthen and 
develop the administrative and technical capacity of staff of the Project Management Offices. It 
would aim to establish a monitoring and evaluation and impact evaluation system

I. Project Context
Country Context
Myanmar is the largest country in mainland Southeast Asia with a land area of about 654,000 
square km. It is located between Bangladesh, China, India, Lao PDR, and Thailand, with more than 
2,800 miles of coastline. It is also one of the poorest countries in East Asia, with an estimated 
poverty headcount between 26 and 37 percent, depending on the methodology used, among its 
population of around 52 million. The new government which took in office in March 2011 has 
introduced sweeping political and economic reforms. Myanmar is now embarking on a triple 
transition: from an authoritarian military system to democratic governance; from a centrally 
directed economy to a market-based economy; and from 60 years of conflict to peace in the border 
areas. From a strategic point of view, agriculture is of central importance for achieving the twin 
goals of ending extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity in Myanmar. The sector accounts 
for about 36 percent of the GDP, which is largest share of GDP among ASEAN members. Rice 
production constitutes about 30 percent of agricultural GDP and covers 70 percent of cultivated 
land. The sector generates about 53 percent of total employment and is source of livelihoods for 
about 70 percent of population who live in rural areas. The poverty headcount, which ranges from 
26 to 37 percent depending on methodologies, is highest in upland areas, but in absolute terms most 

rural poor live in the Dry Zone (34 percent), followed by the Delta region (25 percent), according to 
the Systematic Country Diagnostic carried out by the World Bank Group in 2014. In the lowland 
areas of the Delta and the Dry Zones where population densities are highest, poverty is associated 
with landlessness or limited farmland holdings. The rural poor in these areas depend primarily on 
farm income generation and on-farm seasonal and other informal labor opportunities. Among the 
rural households who own land persistent poverty stems from a combination of low productivity of 
farming systems and high vulnerability of these systems to adverse weather events, especially 
drought in areas featuring limited or unreliable access to irrigation services. The government places 
high priority on the development of the agriculture sector and sees it as the basis for food security, 
poverty reduction, job creation, and export promotion.

  

Sectoral and institutional Context
Myanmar has a favorable agricultural potential. It has abundant water resources -- 20,870 m3 per 
person compared to the Asia-wide average of 3,948 m3 per person -- and relatively abundant 
agricultural land, which translates into the highest agricultural land per worker in the East Asia and 
Pacific (EAP) region of about 1.1 ha/worker, compared to 0.8 ha/worker in Thailand and Cambodia 
and less than half of Myanmar figure in Vietnam and Indonesia). According to the Myanmar 
Census of Agriculture (2010), the average farm area is 2.6 hectares, which is the second largest in 
EAP after Thailand (3.1 ha) (and about five times of that prevailing in Vietnam’s Mekong Delta 
region). Finally, it has diverse agro-ecological conditions which would allow it to produce a wide 
range of temperate, sub-tropical and tropical crops. The current agricultural productivity is 
constrained by under-supply of public services (extension, basic education), low levels of 
technology adaption and farm mechanization, insecure irrigation water supply, limited access to 
affordable credit suitable for agricultural production cycles, and rising labor costs that have trapped 
farmers in poverty even within double cropping systems in irrigated areas. There is a lack of an 
overarching and clear agricultural sector strategy in Myanmar to guide public sector and donor 
spending programs. The effectiveness of current public spending programs is also affected by the 
nature of agricultural services provided to smallholders. Too often, public goods and services 
provided to farmers, such as irrigation and extension, are supply driven with little consideration of 
farmer interests.  For example, farmers’ crop choices could be sometimes restricted by local 
authorities at regional and district level who make decisions on water allocations. The limited 
extension services are often focused on the promotion a single crop rather than helping farmers to 
overcome problems they are facing in their farming systems, such as soil infertility and fertilizer 
use, pest management, increasing labor cost, etc. At the same time, farmers’ incentives to invest in 
better water, soil and crop management technologies may be constrained by their lack of security on 
water and land use rights, as well as issues related to the underdeveloped marketing systems and 
high volatility of agricultural prices. Many irrigation schemes function below their potential 
because of inappropriate operation of reservoirs and a lack of responsive irrigation system 
management.  For example, while about 2 million hectares are equipped with irrigation and 
drainage infrastructure, a second crop is being grown on only about 28 percent of this area 
(2011/12). This may reflect both technical deficiencies as well as uncertainties farmers are facing in 
marketing their crops. While primary irrigation structures (dams, canals) seem in general in good 
shape there are problems in getting water to farmer fields. With improved management and a 
change in cropping patterns, including to non-rice crops, it is possible to expand the cropping areas 
and cropping intensity. This may necessitate minor structural alterations to the irrigation schemes to 
improve drainage and, for some fields, to which improves in-field drainage through land leveling. 
However, improving irrigation management is not sufficient to increase farm incomes. This is 

because farmers often do not possess the necessary agronomic technologies and skills to take 
advantage of an improved access to irrigation. The current public extension system is under-
resourced and extension personnel rarely visit farmers to provide advice on the correct fertilizers 
rates to use improved technologies such as improved seeds. There is also some reluctance by 
farmers to change from growing rice to more water efficient crops, such as legumes and sesame. 
This may be partly caused by the rigidity of irrigation systems which does not offer enough 
flexibility in on-field water delivery and thus result in a lack of control over water levels on 
individual farm plots. The general under-capitalization of smallholder farming systems in Myanmar 
caused by decades of public under-investment and policy inefficiency fuels the risk of a vicious 
cycle of declining terms of trade. The development of smallholder agriculture in Myanmar thus 
requires significant public investments in institutional development, technology generation and 
dissemination, rural infrastructure, and human capital for years to come.  The Ministry of 
Agriculture and Irrigation (MOAI) has made significant investments in irrigation infrastructure bet 
ween the 1980s and 2000s which can serve as platform for development of smallholder farming 
systems. Many of these schemes host large numbers of smallholders who have the potential to 
respond to public investments under a supportive environment. These schemes would offer good 
opportunities for landscape-based rural development approaches that address agricultural, natural 
resource management, and social development goals.

II. Proposed Development Objectives
The Project Development Objective is to increase crop yields and cropping intensity in the selected 
existing irrigation sites in Bago East, Nay Pyi Taw, Mandalay, and Sagaing regions.

V. Implementation
The MOAI will be the implementing agency of the project. The Project will be governed at the 
Union level by the National Project Steering Committee (NPSC) and at the township level by the 
Township Agricultural Coordination Committees (ACC). The project will be managed by the 
Project Management Unit (PMU) which will be integrated within the existing structures of 
Department of Irrigation (ID). The PMU will be located in Nay Pyi Taw in MOAI headquarters. 
PMU would be responsible for day-to-day management and coordination of the project. It will be 
responsible for the project financial management and procurement functions.  It will ensure that 
annual work plans are prepared, budgeted and implemented in a timely manner, and that 
management of project funds is in line with the provisions of the project’s eligibility guidelines. The 
PMU will be responsible for management of the Designated Accounts; disbursement of project 
funds and replenishment of the project bank accounts and preparing and submitting withdrawal 
applications; and consolidation of annual work plans, budget planning, arrange for project annual 
audit, project reporting and M&E.  
 
Implementation of the project activities will be carried out by five technical departments 
(Department of Irrigation/ID, Department of Agriculture/DOA, Department of Agricultural 
Research/DAR, Agricultural Mechanization Department/AMD, and Settlements and Land Records 
Department/SLRD) through their central, regional, district and township level structures. ID will be 
the lead agency for the implementation of the Component 1, with technical inputs from SLRD and 
AMD, and DOA would be the lead agency for Component 2, with technical inputs from DAR and 
AMD. The implementation of filed activities will be done by respective township level staff with the 
supervision and technical backstopping from the team of central/regional/district level Subject 
Matter Specialists (SMS). The implementing departments are responsible for the initiation of the 
procurement activities as per work plan, provision of technical specifications and TORs to PMU and 
serve as members of the evaluation committee; accounting for funds on their respective Operating 
Accounts and at district level accounts and provision of financial information to PMU for the 
compilation of the financial documents; and preparation of the annual work plans of their respective 
sub-components and activities, and provision of information and indicators for the PMU for the 


consolidated project reporting. The ACCs are township level structural coordination bodies, which 
are responsible for the coordination of crop planning and extension activities, and makes irrigation 
water allocation and distribution decisions. The main function of the ACC under the project would 
be to provide a platform for joint (MOAI-farmer) planning and monitoring of project activities in 
targeted irrigation schemes. Implementation of the project activities at the township level will be 
done by the Project Implementation Committees, which is a sub-committee under ACC, and it 
includes township level staff of the implementing MOAI departments.

Decision

I. Project Context
Country Context
In spite of Vietnam’s impressive achievements in poverty reduction – poverty declined from 58 
percent in 1993 to 14 percent in 2010 according to official statistics, and to 20 percent according to 
GSO-WB – poverty remains high at 60 percent in the West Northern Mountains Region and at 38 
percent in the East Northern Mountains Region (GSO-WB methodology). Limited access to basic 
services, markets, and financial, land, and information resources are the most important constraints 
for the poor in the Northern Mountains. Addressing these constraints is hampered by weaknesses in 
institutional capacity and public sector management: Vietnam has moved from a highly centralized, 
hierarchical, central planning system, to one where many decisions are decentralized. However, 
capacity building at the local level has not kept pace with decentralization. A five-year (national) 
Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP 2011-2015) which responds directly to these 
development challenges was approved by the National Assembly in November, 2011.

  

Sectoral and institutional Context


Poverty is increasingly concentrated among Vietnam’s ethnic minority populations. While ethnic 
minorities account for only 15 percent of the country’s population, they make up for half of the 
poor in Vietnam and have experienced a much slower pace of poverty reduction compared to the 
majority of Vietnam’s population. Poverty among ethnic minorities remains at 66 percent.   Most of 
these ethnic minority groups live in highland or upland areas, in particular in the North-West and 
North-East as well as in the Central Highland regions. The Northern Mountains region has the 
highest rate of poverty and is home to almost one-third of Vietnam’s poor. 
 
Improvements in both the delivery and accessibility of basic public services in the Northern 
Mountains region are especially needed to reach the twin goals of eliminating poverty and fostering 
shared prosperity in Vietnam. Over the last fifteen years, the GoV has launched a number of 
programs through the Ministry of Labor, Invalids, and Social Affairs (MoLISA), the MPI, the 
Committee for Ethnic Minority Affairs (CEMA), the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural 
Development (MARD) and other line Ministries to address this poverty challenge. Among others, 
these include: (a) the Program for Socio-Economic Development in Communes Facing Extreme 
Hardship in Ethnic Minority and Mountainous Areas (referred to as P135) to finance the commune 
and inter-commune level infrastructures and strengthen planning and implementation capacity; (b) a 
follow-up program (P135-2) designed to reduce poverty among disadvantaged groups; and (c) 
Program 30-A (Support for Fast and Sustainable Poverty Reduction in Poor Districts)  financing the 
development plans for the 62 poorest districts in the country. More recently, the GoV decided to (a) 
continue the series of poverty programs with the newly launched P135-3 under the CEMA; and (b) 
launch a New Rural Area Program (NRAP) under the MARD. In total, Vietnam currently has 16 
different NTPs implemented through various ministries. The consequence of this evolution is a 
degree of institutional fragmentation (and resulting contestation) across major Government 
agencies. 
 
The World Bank has supported Vietnam’s poverty alleviation efforts through two community-
driven development (CDD) operations – the Community Based Rural Infrastructure Project 
(CBRIP) and the Northern Mountains Poverty Reduction Project (NMPRP-1) – which introduced 
participatory approaches and promoted decision making at the commune level; three Development 
Policy Credits (DPCs); and the ongoing CDD operation (NMPRP-2) which focused on 
infrastructure support, livelihood activities, market linkages and further devolution of investment 
ownership to communities. There is evidence that the positive lessons from the Bank’s support are 
being mainstreamed leading to a wider menu of community projects, a stronger focus on 
participatory planning, transparency, devolution of decision making, and institutional capacity 
building at the local level.  
 
In spite of the positive results of various poverty programs, both the GoV and donor agencies are 
concerned about the inefficiencies, administrative requirements and associated costs resulting from 
the high level of fragmentation in Vietnam’s poverty alleviation efforts. Although a clear consensus 
on the consolidation of poverty programs has not yet emerged, various GoV stakeholders at the 
national and provincial levels, as well as donor agencies are taking initiatives to address this 
situation. These efforts focus on (a) the consolidation of existing poverty programs and NTPs in 
possibly two overarching national poverty programs;  and (b) the integration of the planning efforts 
at the local level in one common SEDP.       
 
Alignment with Government Strategy. The NMPRP-2 supports the Government’s Resolution 80/



Page 3 of 6

NQ-CP on Direction of Sustainable Poverty Reduction which aims at accelerating poverty 
reduction in the poorest districts, communes and villages of the country, by setting poverty 
reduction targets of 4 percent per annum over the 2011 – 2020 period (compared to a national target 
of 2 percent) and by prioritizing the mobilization of resources and support to these areas.  
 
The GoV is moving towards medium term planning (3 years planning cycle with a multi-year 
budget allocation rather than annual budgeting as is currently the case). Fully implemented, this will 
give more predictability, flexibility, and discretion to the commune level to plan their investment 
priorities in a more integrated manner. The GoV is also moving towards greater consolidation of its 
various poverty alleviation efforts. The SEDP approach developed under the NMPRP-2 fits very 
well both in this medium-term planning context and in the efforts to integrate various NTPs.

II. Proposed Development Objectives
A. Current Project Development Objectives – Parent
The development objective for the proposed project is to Enhance the living standards of the project 
beneficiaries by improving: (i) their access to productive infrastructures; (ii) the productive and 
institutional capacity of local governments and communities; and (iii) market linkages and business 
innovations. The key outcome indicators to assess achievement of the PDO are as follows:  
 # At least 60% of the project beneficiaries report satisfaction on the selection, design, and 
implementation of project activities.  
 # The project beneficiaries report an improvement in on- and off- farm income of at least 10% over 
the life of the project.

B. Proposed Project Development Objectives – Additional Financing (AF)
The AF focuses on institutionalizing and mainstreaming the socio-economic development planning 
approach in the broader planning and budget allocation processes in the project area. The PDO will, 
therefore, be revised to capture this important element of the AF.  
 
Project Development Objective for the AF is revised to read: The Project Development Objective 
(PDO) is to enhance the living standards of the Project Beneficiaries by improving: (i) their access 
to productive infrastructure; (ii) the productive and institutional capacity of local governments and 
communities; (iii) commune integrated investment planning and (iv) market linkages and business 
innovations.

B. Introduction and Context 

 
Country Context  

1. Ukraine’s economic growth has been uneven since the country’s independence in 1991 and has been 
impacted by both external factors, such as the global financial crisis of 2008, and the internal conflict that 
began in 2014.  During the 2000-2007 period, Ukraine sustained high annual growth rates of 7 percent on 
average. Capital inflows surged, and credit growth boomed, fueled by the external borrowing of commercial 
banks. This enabled an expansionary fiscal policy that resulted in the accumulation of a structural deficit. Growth 
was almost entirely driven by favorable external conditions, but was not supported by structural reforms. With 
the onset of the global financial crisis, the Ukrainian economy contracted rapidly. During 2008‐2013, growth 
was negative and averaged ‐0.7 percent annually. The Maidan Revolution of 2013/2014, the events in Crimea 
in March 2014, and the armed conflict in the east of the country since 2014 resulted in a continued severe 
recession, and the economy contracted by 16 percent during 2014-2015. The Government of Ukraine (GoU) 
subsequently undertook a series of fiscal and business environment-related reforms that helped stabilize the 
economy. Economic growth has resumed, albeit at a modest rate: gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 2.3 
percent in 2016, 2.5 percent in 2017, 3.3 percent in 2018, and 3.5 percent in the first half of 2019.1 

 
2. Poverty rates vary across the country as fiscal and conflict-related pressures amplify traditional factors 
of vulnerability. Ukraine is characterized by significant regional disparities, and the benefits of past economic 
growth have not been shared evenly. Poverty remains higher in rural areas (8.5 versus 5.1 percent), where local 
communities face challenges such as poor living conditions, outdated infrastructure, and limited public services 
provision. Inflows of internally displaced persons (IDPs) due to the conflict have put an additional strain on local 
resources and services in host communities. Reversing the trend of increasing poverty rates and promoting 
shared prosperity remain significant development challenges that require Ukraine to capitalize on the drivers of 
growth through structural, policy, and investment reforms and the development of human capital. 

 
3. The conflict in Eastern Ukraine has impacted the lives and livelihoods of over five million Ukrainians 
through damage to infrastructure, interruption of markets and services, restrictions of movement, loss of 
employment, and psychosocial impacts. To date, over 13,000 people have been killed and 2.7 million persons 
displaced, including over 1.3 million internally displaced. Despite the extension of the ceasefire agreement in 
February 2015 (Minsk II), the security situation remains volatile, with daily hostilities occurring along the contact 


line separating Government-Controlled Areas (GCAs) and Non-Governmental Controlled areas (NGCAs) in 
Eastern Ukraine. 

  
4. The conflict has severely impacted socioeconomic activity in Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland of 
Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts. Prior to the conflict, these areas (referred to as “the Donbas”) accounted for 12.5 
percent of Ukraine’s population and generated 15.7 percent of the country’s total GDP and a quarter of its 
exports. Because of the conflict, an estimated 70 percent of enterprises in the Donbas have reported decreased 
investment and revenues, disrupted trade relationships, lack of demand for products, and shrinking 
workforces.2 A World Bank survey of the socioeconomic impacts of the conflict in 2017 highlighted the welfare 
and socioeconomic challenges facing IDPs, veterans, and host communities.3  

 
5. Since taking office in May 2019, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has made outreach and 
development support to Eastern Ukraine a key policy priority, emphasizing socioeconomic integration of the 
region. This policy shift represents a window of opportunity for the World Bank to support the GoU in promoting 
the recovery and development of conflict-affected areas. Luhansk Oblast GCAs are proposed as the geographic 
focus for initial World Bank investment because of their acute lack of connectivity and economic opportunity 
compared to other areas of Eastern Ukraine, to complement and leverage other international partner funding 
more heavily concentrated in Donetsk Oblast, and to promote economic recovery of the region through a focus 
on agricultural development in line with the Bank’s broader support for Ukraine’s land and agricultural sector 
reform agenda as a future engine of economic growth.4  

 
Sectoral and Institutional Context 

 
6. Economic impacts of the conflict have been among the most acute in Luhansk Oblast. With the division 
into GCAs and NGCAs, the oblast’s rural and agricultural north was severed from its industrialized and more 
urbanized south. Out of a pre-conflict population of 1.5 million people, Luhansk GCAs now have an estimated 
population of 692,000 people. Twenty-two of the region’s 34 cities, including Luhansk City as the oblast regional 
center, are now located in the NGCAs. An estimated 84 percent of the industrial capacity and 81 percent of all 
jobs in Luhansk Oblast have been left outside of the GCAs. Unemployment in the GCAs reached 17.5 percent 
among working age individuals in 2018, the highest of any oblast5 and the region has experienced the sharpest 
decline of any oblast in GDP between 2010-2017. While outmigration from Luhansk Oblast averaged 4,000 to 
6,000 individuals per year during the 2008-2013 pre-conflict period, it has since increased to more than 13,000 
people per year.6   
 
7. Luhansk GCAs also face severe connectivity challenges and lack a quality transport system to serve as 
a backbone of the regional economy. Before 2017, the financial and institutional arrangements in Ukraine’s 
road sector created a large backlog of periodic maintenance and rehabilitation. The shortage of funding, 
combined with a large share of overweight trucks, has resulted in premature deterioration of the network. From 
2011 to 2016, the share of national roads in poor condition (with an International Roughness Index (IRI) > 6) 

increased from 5 to 17 percent. Ukraine is also currently ranked 66th of a total of 160 countries in the World 
Bank’s 2018 Logistics Performance Index 7 and lags behind the best performers in the region and all European 
Union (EU) member states. For Luhansk Oblast, connectivity and logistical challenges are particularly acute. In a 
national comparison, Luhansk Oblast GCAs ranked as having the lowest connectivity level, based on its low 
proportion of roads per square kilometer and the limited access of its cities to major national markets. Major 
upgrading of the regional road network has not been undertaken since the 1980s. Luhansk’s transport system 
has also been severely impacted by the interruption of rail lines and road networks due to the conflict, resulting 
in an increase in overweight trucks transporting products over long distances. The average IRI on the network 
in Luhansk Oblast in 2017 was approximately 6.54, well below the national average.  
 
8. The long-term industrial decline and the recent conflict have increased the prominence of the 
agricultural sector in the Luhansk GCA economy and its importance to rural livelihoods. Before the conflict, 
the share of agriculture in the regional economy was about 10 percent and about 10 percent of the labor force 
was employed in the sector. Today, about 76 percent (or 1.5 million hectares) of the total agricultural land of 
the Donbas is located in the GCAs of Luhansk Oblast, with a growing percentage of workers employed in the 
agricultural sector.8 In the majority of Luhansk GCA districts, agriculture is the leading economic activity and 
sector of employment. In 2018, 23 percent of new jobs created were in agriculture, more than any other sector.9 
As of 2018, a total of 964 agro-industrial enterprises and more than 45,200 private family farms were involved 
in agricultural production.10 These family farms provide significant numbers of informal employment and 
support to rural livelihoods in the region. The sector remains critical because of its role as an employer of last 
resort and its importance for livelihoods for rural populations in the region. Luhansk’s regional development 
strategy highlights agricultural development as a key objective, including increasing productivity and efficiency 
and facilitating processing and access to markets. The project’s focus on agricultural development in Eastern 
Ukraine also aligns with the Bank’s broader support for Ukraine’s land and agricultural reform agenda as a future 
engine of Ukraine’s economic growth and development. Finally, interventions in the agricultural sector, such as 
the introduction of new technologies and the development of value chains, are likely to be more efficient and 
cost effective for recovery than focusing on the restructuring or reconstruction of the former and now 
uncompetitive industrial sector. 
 
9. However, the conflict has resulted in significant negative impacts on agricultural supply and value 
chains in the region. Cereal and oil seed production has remained by far the most important agricultural activity, 
with 57 percent of arable land cultivated with cereals and sunflowers. Prior to the conflict, Luhansk Oblast relied 
on the Luhansk-Valuyki railway and road connections for the transportation of agricultural goods. Commodity 
flows have now been reoriented westward towards the Kharkiv region via longer, poorer quality road 
connections that have increased the required road haulage distance by an average of 65 kilometers. In 2018, 
transport costs for commodities increased by UAH 140-190 per ton of cargo, which impacted profitability and 
income.11 The resulting increased truck traffic has hastened the deterioration of the oblast’s primary and 
secondary road network. In addition, many of the large-scale grain and oil storage, processing, and logistical

facilities, and most of the food processing industry and modern laboratory testing facilities are now located in 
the NGCAs and are therefore inaccessible. Production costs have also increased because of higher prices for the 
import and transportation of agricultural inputs, such as fuel and lubricants, seeds, and fertilizers.  
 
10.  Subsistence farming is widespread in Luhansk GCAs and is critical in supporting basic livelihoods in 
rural areas but small and household farmers producing vegetables, fruits, dairy products, and meat have lost 
access to aggregators and to the urban markets of Luhansk NGCAs, which accounted for over half of the 
oblast’s pre-conflict population. These producers now also face challenges because of the lack of access and 
investments in on-farm innovation and technology; limited storage, laboratory services, and processing 
facilities; and poor access to finance that would allow them to transition from subsistence level to more market-
oriented production. These challenges are exacerbated by the general uncertainty about the prospects of a 
political settlement and reintegration of NGCA urban markets and trade.  

 
11. Youth, IDPs, and veterans in Luhansk Oblast face particular development challenges. Among the 
average of 13,000 individuals that migrate from the GCAs each year, 67 percent are under 28 years of age, driven 
by limited opportunities for civic engagement, limited prospects for well-paying employment, and concern over 
poor social infrastructure for young families.12 Luhansk Oblast ranks second to Donetsk Oblast in the number of 
IDPs per oblast, with over 270,000 people officially registered. Tensions with host communities are low, 
however, and IDPs are well represented among employees of public service institutions. Yet IDPs face difficulties 
in accessing land, obtaining satisfactory housing, and joining established agricultural networks within the GCAs 
of Luhansk. Most IDPs have skills in engineering, processing, and other mechanical or technical trades that they 
acquired in their home areas, which are now in NGCAs. Veterans in Luhansk Oblast, as elsewhere, have to 
contend with unemployment and difficult transitions to civilian life, lack of psychosocial and rehabilitation 
support, long absences from farming and assets, and difficulty securing their benefit entitlements.13    
 
12. The conflict has exacerbated gender gaps, particularly for rural women. With men being predominantly 
engaged in military operations, women have taken on greater responsibilities for household affairs, with many 
becoming sole caregivers for their families, the elderly, and the disabled.14 Female pensioners, women IDPs, and 
female-headed households with young children are particularly vulnerable to the conflict-induced social 
disruption prevalent throughout Luhansk Oblast.15 Poor road conditions and the resulting longer commutes via 
personal vehicles as well as limited and neglected public transport systems also disproportionately disadvantage 
rural women’s mobility in the region and their access to employment, healthcare, childcare, and other public 
services. Poor mobility also constrains women’s access to more diverse employment opportunities and more 
lucrative markets.16 Many women in rural Luhansk GCAs are engaged in agricultural production at a small-scale 
or household level. However, the supplementary income and food security gained from farming activities is 
limited by poor access to markets, limited productive inputs (both advisory and technological), and lack of access 
to information and skills development around value chain development and value-added production.17

D. Project Description  
 

13. The project seeks to reinforce national commitment to recovery and development of Eastern Ukraine 
and highlights the benefits of socio-economic connectivity in support of a future settlement.  The project’s 
multi-sectoral investments aim to promote agricultural sector development in rural areas in Luhansk GCAs that 
could help stimulate future growth and opportunity in the region.  Prioritized investments reflect an intensive 
stakeholder dialogue during project preparation with national, regional and local officials, agri-industry, 
agricultural producers, agricultural communities, women, IDPs, veterans, and youth in project areas. 
Recognizing the socio-economic and administrative characteristics of Luhansk GCAs, the project will include the 
following components:  
 
14. Component 1: RECONNECT - Roads Investments to Link Rural Communities to Processing, Markets, and 
Services.  Component 1 will support the rehabilitation of roads in Luhansk Oblast in support of the agricultural 
sector and connecting rural communities to urban service centers in Luhansk GCAs.  Poor and deteriorating local 
roads have been a key bottleneck to agricultural logistics and supply chains and the broader development of the 
region.  Component 1 prioritizes road investments that link farmers to processors, markets, and service centers 
in Luhansk GCAs.  The target road network will be rehabilitated to a category 2-3 standard which is a two-lane 
road with safety specifications including side crash barriers where required.  The project will finance all 
necessary road infrastructure such as bridges, interchanges, and railway crossing, safety measures, site 
supervision of civil works, and equipment.  Additionally, for protection of the investments, the project will 
include installation of weigh-in-motion stations and speed cameras.  The Component will also include activities 
to engage local administration and communities in project areas on road use, road safety measures, and will 
provide technical assistance to support development of ‘feeder roads’ to the network.  This is expected to 
promote local ownership and sustainability of transport investments.  
 
15. Component 2:  RECOVER - Agriculture Investments to Support Sector Recovery and Modernization.  
Component 2 will complement the connectivity investments of Component 1 through select agricultural sub-
projects that address some of the conflict’s impacts on the agricultural sector in Luhansk GCAs, including loss of 
access to agricultural services, processing facilities, product testing and local urban markets, as well as limited 


technology and value chain to market support for the Oblast’s many small producers.  Component investments 
will include: (a) an Agriculture Logistics and Service Hub in Starobilsk City, including a grain/oil seed elevator; a 
small grain/oil seed quality testing facility; an office building for administration and business development 
support; an innovative online trading platform to link producers and traders; and an agricultural services support 
area; (b) a Regional Agricultural Testing and Food Safety Laboratory to address a critical gap following the loss 
of access to the agricultural product testing and food safety management services due to the conflict; and (c) 
Agricultural Cluster Development for small household-level producers.  Community-based Cluster support will 
facilitate the transition from current subsistence production towards more organized and market-oriented 
production practices, including value-chain to market support to an estimated 5 to 10 clusters of 100 to 150 
small household-level producers.  The component will also finance the associated detailed design studies. 
 
16. Component 3 - REVITALIZE: Implementation Support Platform.  Component 3 will support the 
development of an implementation support platform to address management capacity constraints, deficits in 
state-citizen dialogue, and requirements for national-regional-local cooperation to effectively delivery the 
project activities.  Component 3 will finance Project Management activities for the MRTOT.  Component 3 will 
also include the following activities: Luhansk regional public-private investment forums to gather project 
beneficiaries, international and Ukrainian private sector representatives, international and domestic financial 
institutions, GoU representatives, and development partners to raise awareness and promote investment 
opportunities in the region; user/beneficiary surveys and community forums to provide feedback on project 
design and implementation (project processes, budgets and outcomes) for infrastructure investments under 
Components 1 and 2; and a 3R Project beneficiary feedback mechanism (BFM), including Grievance Redress 
Mechanism (GRM).  To educate communities and stakeholders in project areas on the objectives, procedures, 
purpose, and opportunities associated with the project and to emphasize the project as a national investment 
to support economic recovery in Eastern Ukraine, Component 3 will also finance strategic communications 
activities.  The implementation platform supported by Component 3 will promote sustainability and possible 
future scale-up and expansion of Project investments to additional sectors and geographic areas in Eastern 
Ukraine. .

Summary of Assessment of Environmental and Social Risks and Impacts 
. 
17. The proposed project is expected to have substantial environmental and social risks. The 
Environmental and Social Risk Classification is based on the potential environmental and social risks associated 
with project activities, as well as project location (proximity to conflict areas) and baseline conditions, overall 
scale of the project, possible cumulative impact and anticipated challenges in environmental and social risk 
management supervision due to limited client capacity. 
 
18. Environmental risks. Although the specific sites where physical works will take place are mostly existing 
roads and urbanized areas, key environmental issues will be related to: (a) waste management of removed road 


surfaces and construction spoils; (b) noise and air pollution with dust; (c) the presence and handling of 
hazardous materials such as bitumen, paint, oil containing materials; (d) the health and safety of the populations 
of the villages and towns along the roads and travelers during road rehabilitation phases, as well as the 
populations living near the agriculture-related investment construction sites; and (e) impacts on water, soil, and 
air quality in case of construction-related spills. These predictable impacts are expected to be temporary, 
reversible, moderate in magnitude, and site-specific. The location of the project near the armed conflict zone 
and in a post-conflict territory raises the risk of unexploded ordnances (UXOs) and some of the locations may 
require demining activities to take place before civil works. Adequate adoption of UXO neutralization 
procedures and occupational health and safety practices for workers during construction and maintenance 
operations will be required. Also, the agricultural logistics and service hub is required to adopt HACCP (Hazard 
Analysis and Critical Control Point) and integrate it into its operational model.  
 
19. Social risks. Social issues and potential risks identified include: one, works to be financed under 
components 1 and 2, and associated ESS5 impacts, particularly under component 1 roads investments; two, 
engagement with local communities and other relevant stakeholders (including with most vulnerable and 
disadvantaged groups) and challenges in ensuring their genuine participation in decision-making processes of 
the project; three, the challenging social environment and baseline conditions in Eastern Ukraine due to conflict; 
and four, limited capacity of Ukravtodor as well as MRTOT in handling ESF requirements.  In addition to these 
risks, the evolving situation around the COVID-19 pandemic may also potentially impact project 
implementation, particularly given public health guidelines on physical distancing and quarantine.  Meaningful 
community engagement will be a challenge in the project areas.  To mitigate this risk, implementing entities 
prepared a draft Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP), which among others, suggests preliminary tools (such as 
virtual consultations, etc) to ensure continuous community engagement. Consultation, communication, and 
feedback mechanisms in the design of the project will help to manage expectations, especially for large 
infrastructure projects, and orient investments in ways that address local priorities and strengthen transparency 
in resource allocation decisions.  
 
20. Environmental and Social Framework instruments. Detailed analysis of the application of the World 
Bank’s Environmental and Social Standards (ESSs) has been provided as part of the Environmental and Social 
Review Summary (ESRS). The project applies ESS 1-6, 8, and 10 as relevant at this stage of development and 
needed environmental and social measures will be implemented through the actions agreed in the respective 
Environmental and Social Commitment Plan (ESCP) prepared by UAD and MRTOT and submitted to the World 
Bank. The Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) with template ESMP, draft SEP, draft RPF 
and Labor Management Procedure were developed and will be updated during project implementation as 
required. Once the project activities are finalized and environmental and social assessments completed, 
additional measures such as subproject-specific Environmental and Social Management Plans (ESMPs), Traffic 
Management Plans (TMP) and Waste Management Plans (WMPs) are to be prepared. A project-specific 
Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM) will be established as outlined in the ESMF. 

 
E. Implementation 

 
Institutional and Implementation Arrangements 

 
21. Because the project is a multi-sectoral program of support for socio-economic recovery and growth in 
Luhansk Oblast, it requires the involvement of government agencies responsible for recovery/IDPs/veterans, 
transport, agriculture, local infrastructure, and economic development; as well as regional and local officials in 

Luhansk Oblast project areas.  The implementation arrangements will also encourage opportunities for 
interaction and dialogue between national and local levels of administration on project activities.  The Bank team 
agreed specifically on the following: 

 

• UAD will implement Component 1 through its central Project Implementation Unit (PIU) – SOE 
“Ukrdorinvest” (UDI) – and in coordination with the regional UAD office in Luhansk Oblast.  Ukrdorinvest 
has experienced staff with project management, procurement, FM, and social and environmental 
safeguards experience.  Ukrdorinvest will also coordinate with the regional UAD office in Luhansk Oblast 
to support supervision activities and to liaise with local authorities and communities.   
 

• MRTOT will implement Components 2 and 3, drawing on its mandate for conflict-recovery efforts and 
to support establishment of an implementation support platform for national investment in Eastern 
Ukraine.  MRTOT will implement the project through a central PIU and place select PIU staff in the already 
established Sector Office in Luhansk Oblast to carry out coordination, monitoring, communications and 
oversight functions in close coordination with local authorities.   
 

• A Project Steering Sub-Committee will be established under the current Inter-Governmental Council on 
Recovery of the Eastern Regions chaired by MRTOT, or any relevant successor coordination body on 
conflict-recovery.  The Sub-Committee will include participation of relevant national-level agencies, 
including Ministry of Infrastructure, UAD, MDETA, Ministry of Finance, and the Luhansk Oblast State and 
Civil-Military Administration.  The Sub-Committee will be chaired by MRTOT and provide overall strategic 
guidance and oversight to the 3R Project.

B.   Introduction and Context

Country Context
Sri Lanka is a lower-middle-income country of 20.5 million people and a per capita GDP of US$ 
3,811 (2014).  Growth over the past decade has been strong, averaging 6-7% per year.  Absolute 
poverty declined from 22.7 to 6.7% from 2002 to 2012.  Despite this progress, roughly one 
quarter of the Sri Lankans remain nearly poor, as defined by living above the national poverty line 
(about US$ 1.5 but below US$ 2.50 per day (2005 PPP terms).  Sri Lanka has comfortably 
surpassed most of the Millennium Development Goals. Primary school enrollment is near 
universal, while secondary and tertiary enrollment has substantially increased.  Maternal and 
infant mortality rates are at very low levels, and life expectancy at 74 years has been above its 
regional peers for over a decade. 
 
With the end of the civil war in 2009, reconstruction, infrastructure investment, and increased 
consumption have delivered a strong economic peace dividend, driven by the non-tradable sectors 
and public sector investments.  Sri Lanka is also undergoing a structural transformation away 
from agriculture, which now accounts for 10% of GDP towards industry (32.5%) and services 
(57.5%) with associated productivity growth and accelerating urbanization.  However, this 
transformation is progressing relatively slowly with 30% of the labor force remaining in 
agriculture.  Notwithstanding the post-conflict environment, Sri Lanka’s economic policies over 
last ten years have been inward-looking with an increasing degree of protectionism and anti-
export bias.  This has prevented the country from capitalizing on comparative advantage and 
exports; attracting domestic and foreign investments to foster technology transfer; and generating 
new sources of innovation driven growth and employment. 
 
The country’s fiscal landscape is challenging.  In 2014, a widened deficit and a slowdown in 
growth increased the fiscal deficit to 5.7% and the public debt 71.8%, as share of GDP, marking a 
slight reversal of the fiscal consolidation path of the post-conflict period.  The fiscal budget for 
2016 presented to Parliament projected a deficit of 6.0% of GDP for the years 2015 and 2016.  
The government presented its economic policy in November 2015 that includes as priorities the 
generation of one million job opportunities, enhancing income levels, developing the rural 
economy, and creating a wide and a strong middle class.  It proposed fiscal consolidation through 
increasing revenue collection, reforms of state owned enterprises, and enhanced trade and foreign 
investment.
Sectoral and institutional Context
Sri Lanka’s agriculture is characterized by a non-plantation sector and a plantation sector.  Of the 
country’s approximately 2.3 million hectares of agricultural land, 80% are used for non-plantation 
foods crops, comprising rice, maize, fruits, vegetables, and other crops that are primarily grown in 
small-holdings.  About 1.65 million smallholder farmers operate on average less than 2 hectares 
and contribute 80% of the total annual food production.  Commercial crops (minor export crops) 
include cinnamon, pepper, cocoa, and coffee and are grown on small and medium land holdings 

as well.  Plantation crops—coconut, rubber and tea—are cultivated in large estates and small and 
medium land holdings.  Typically, non-plantation crops are grown under irrigated conditions 
while plantation and minor export crops are grown in the rain-fed areas.  Monsoonal rainfall 
patterns shape the agricultural seasons and irrigation patterns.  Two thirds of the agricultural area 
are located in the dry zone where the bulk of the country’s irrigation infrastructure is located. 
 
Sri Lanka’s has successfully attained self-sufficiency in rice and recently also in maize 
production. Rice production has increased steadily from 2.9 million tons (2002) to 4.8 million 
tons in 2015, in part because previously inaccessible land was reopened for cultivation after the 
end of the war but also through introducing high-yielding varieties, expanding irrigation capacity, 
fertilizer subsidies, restrictions on crop choices, and import substitution.  Achieving self-
sufficiency has meant that the production structure has remained concentrated in the low value 
food crops. In 2013, about 45% of the cultivated area was under rice cultivation (up from 37% in 
1980) but the share of rice in the overall value of crop production was only 18%.  Furthermore, 
average rice yields of 4.06 tons/hectare are relatively low and agricultural productivity, as 
measured by total factor productivity, has only grown by an average of 0.6 percent per year since 
1980, lagging behind other South and East Asian countries. 
 
With rice self-sufficiency secured, there is a need to diversify the production structure out of the 
lower value food crops towards high-value agriculture.  Sector policy to date, however, has 
neglected the domestic fruits and vegetable sectors, despite growing domestic demand and 
potential for export growth.  Demand has instead been met by increased imports.  A broad 
recognition has however emerged recently that the modernization of agriculture is needed if 
agriculture is to realize its potential for greater value generation and as a renewed source of rural 
growth for poverty reduction and job creation. Such modernization will require a structural shift 
towards a more high-value oriented agriculture production structure, agro-processing and value 
addition activities, and increased competitiveness.  It will also involve aligning trade policies to 
become more consistent and conducive for high-value export agriculture; realigning and better 
targeting of public sector support, especially fertilizer subsidies; greater attention to R&D; and 
relaxing the rice self-sufficiency policy and allowing for more demand-driven and market 
oriented production.  This will require differentiated strategies for different parts and production 
arrangements across the country.  In the northern and eastern parts of the country, comprising 
primarily the dry zone, there is significant scope for agricultural productivity growth and potential 
for better linkages to domestic and export markets, including value-added production.  In other 
parts of the country, more robust and scaled-up private commercial investment and innovation 
through agri-enterprises and agri-enterprise-farmer partnerships is needed for value addition and 
farmer integration into high value chains through scaling up and diversification into more 
commercial crops.   
 
The proposed project provides a broad framework for Sri Lanka to experiment with innovative 
approaches to address the above mentioned sector issues, overcome the low productivity 
equilibrium, and strengthen agriculture’s contribution to the economy and employment creation.  
The strategic thrust reflected in the project design is to support overall agriculture sector 
development and addressing the longstanding constraints through: (a) developing an incentive 
structure for small, medium, and large enterprises, including farmer producer organizations, to 
invest in commercial agriculture and value chains; (b) promoting partnership arrangements 
between private sector partners and smallholder pro ducers for better linkages; (c) demonstrating 
new agriculture technologies and innovations at sufficient scale to enhance productivity, 

resilience, and diversification in selected prioritized lagging regions; (d) promoting technology 
diffusion through capacity building and training and new models for extension service delivery; 
and (e) supporting sector policy analysis and research for reform.

C.  Proposed Development Objective(s)

Development Objective(s)
The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to support increasing agriculture productivity, 
improving market access, and enhancing value addition of smallholder farmers and agribusinesses 
in the project areas.

Key Results 
The achievement of the PDO will be measured using the following results indicators: (a) number 
of direct project beneficiaries, disaggregated by gender; (b) number and share of participating 
farm households adopting improved technology packages and production practices supported 
under the project; (c) number and share of project-supported farmer producer organizations and 
farmer – agribusiness partnerships making a profit; (d) percentage increase in average value of 
sales of agriculture products due to project interventions; and (e) the number of new jobs created 
through small and medium enterprise investments under the project.

D.  Project Description

The project comprises four components, as follows: 
 
Component 1: Agriculture Value Chain Development (Total US$102.7 million; IDA US$58.6 
million). The component would promote commercial and export-oriented agriculture through 
attracting and leveraging investments from farmer producer organizations and agribusinesses for 
high value agriculture production and value addition. Component 1 comprises the following sub-
components: 
 
Sub-component 1.1: Investment Preparation Support, supporting: a training program on principles 
and procedures of the Matching Grants Program under sub-component 2; public advertisements 
and information workshops at national, provincial and district levels for prospective grant 
applicants; support to the project’s Technical Review Group and Board; international advisory 
support to operationalize the Matching Grants Program; staffing support and equipment and 
operation cost for the Matching Grants Secretariat and three regional support offices; technical 
assistance support to assist applicants in the preparation of quality investment proposals; and 
technical assistance support to support the environmental and social safeguards requirements 
within the Matching Grants Program. 
 
Sub-component 1.2: Matching Grants to Producer Organizations and Agribusinesses, supporting a 
Matching Grants Program to support investments from farmer producer organizations and 
agribusinesses in agriculture. Matching Grants would be provided under two windows.  Matching 
Grants of US$5,000 up to US$75,000 would be provided for investments to be developed and 
implemented by farmer producer organizations.  Eligibility criteria for farmer producer 
organizations to participate in the program would include: formal registration; appointment of an 
accountant; a cash contribution of 10 percent of the total investment; and availability of 
commercial financing of 40 percent of the total investment.  Matching Grants of US$75,000 up to 
US$500,000 would be provided to agribusiness for agriculture value chain investments. 


Applications for grant support would be evaluated on criteria, such as outreach and capacity 
building to smallholder farmers, including women headed producer groups; focus on lagging 
regions; as well as technical quality, innovation, business rationale and others. 
 
Sub-component 1.3: Partial Credit Guarantee (PCG), supporting a PCG to share financial risk 
with participating financial institutions that have expressed interest in lending to beneficiaries of 
the Matching Grant Program.  The PCG would be administered by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka 
(CBSL) and operate on the basis of the World Bank Group Principles on Partial Credit Guarantee 
Schemes, published in December 2014, covering the governance, management, administration, 
sustainability, and monitoring of PCG. 
 
Component 2: Productivity Enhancement and Diversification Demonstrations (US$ 58.63 million, 
IDA US$ 58.63 million).  The component would support smallholder farmers to produce 
competitive and marketable commodities, improve their ability to respond to market 
requirements, and move towards increased commercialization.  Component 2 comprises three 
sub-components: 
 
Sub-component 2.1:  Farmer Training and Capacity Building, supporting knowledge building and 
capability improvements of smallholder farmers and the establishment of farmer organizations to 
help them to respond better to market opportunities.  Individual farmer capacity building and 
farmer producer organization training will be implemented through training programs reaching 
out to approximately 600 villages and approximately 500 farmer producers groups.  The trained 
and established farmer producer organizations would become eligible for participation in the 
Matching Grants Program under Component 1. 
 
Sub-component 2.2:  Modern Agriculture Technology Parks, supporting the introduction, 
demonstration, and scale-up of innovative agriculture technology packages to support 
productivity improvements, diversification, commercialization, more sustainable and climate 
resilient production patterns.  The sub-component would support 7 agriculture technology 
demonstration parks in the selected districts of Jaffna, Mullaitivu, Anuradhapura (Northern 
Province), Batticaloa, (Eastern Province), Matale (North-Central Province), Moneragala (Uva 
Province), and Polonnaruwa (Central Province) which have been identified based on high poverty 
headcounts and agriculture potential.  The agriculture parks would be established to demonstrate 
entire value chain approaches, involving farmer mobilization and training, production, post-
harvest handling and/or processing, and marketing. 
 
Sub-component 2.3: Up-grading Production and Marketing Infrastructure, supporting: (i) the up-
grading and rehabilitation of small-scale irrigation infrastructure and existing water tanks in 
selected areas and linked to the agriculture technology demonstrations parks; (ii) the improvement 
of existing production and market access roads and construction of new field access tracks to 
improve transportation, access to markets and accessibility for agricultural machinery; and (iii) 
village level storage and product handling facilities, including drying platforms and sheds, 
composting facilities of crop residues, storage facilities and others. Infrastructure investment 
would focus on public infrastructure and would be linked to gaps identified under the technology 
parks development (sub-component 2.2). 
 
Sub-component 2.4:  Analytical and Policy Advisory Support, supporting the CPCU, MOPI and 
MOA in addressing knowledge gaps; developing an evidence-based policy, legal and regulatory 
framework; and formulating sector and sub-sectoral strategies to provide an enabling environment 
for a sustainable and competitive modern agriculture and food system.  The component would 
provide support to evaluate policies and regulations and recommend adjustments, reforms or new 
policies to promote competitiveness, responsiveness to market demand, sustainability, and 
resilience; undertake market analyses for new exports, and analyze policy, regulatory and 
institutional constraints, and identify public investments to address these constraints; and evaluate 
the social and economic impact of policies and public expenditures and make recommendations to 
improve the efficiency and effectiveness of public expenditures.  The sub-component would also 
provide some technical support the MOA, including the design of a National Agriculture 
Information System and others. 
 
Component 3: Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation (Total Cost US$ 7.74 million, US
$ 7.7 million IDA).  The component would support the PMOs at MOPI and MOA at the central, 
provincial and district levels in project management and coordination, technical supervision, 
financial management, procurement, social and environmental safeguards, and monitoring and 
evaluation (M&E).

E.  Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis (if known)

The project is national in scope and designed as framework approach.  Specific project locations 
and their characteristics are not yet known and would be identified during implementation as part 
of the project’s demand-driven Matching Grants Program approach. Itis expected that project sites 
would be located in all three major agro-ecological zones, including the wet zone (average annual 
rainfall above 2500 mm); the intermediate zone (annual rainfall between 1750-2500 mm); and the 
dry zone (annual rainfall less than 1750 mm).  The dry and intermediate zones cover about 66% 
of the agriculture land area and receive about 30% of the country’s annual surface water yield.  
They are extensively used for agriculture and require irrigation water to be productive.  The bulk 
of the country’s irrigation infrastructure is hence located in the dry zone.   The wet zone, on the 
other hand, comprises 34% of the agricultural land area and receives 70% of the country’s annual 
surface water yield.  The three major plantation crops, most other export crops and various types 
of fruits are grown here under rain-fed conditions. 
 
The project’s proposed agriculture technology demonstrations parks included under Component 2 
and the complementing production infrastructure investments will be located in the 7 priority 
districts of Jaffna, Mullaitivu, Anuradhapura, Batticaloa, Matale, Polonnaruwa, and Moneragala.  
While exact project sites are not yet known and will be determined as part of a detailed feasibility 
study process during implementation, the districts are located in the dry zone (except for 
Moneragala, which is located in the intermediate zone) and have been identified based on high 
poverty rates and high absolute numbers of poor.  The majority of these districts are located in the 
former conflict affected areas and are characterized by poor or dilapidated public infrastructure, 
lack of productive infrastructure at the farm level, and poor access to markets, as well as limited 
livelihood and employment opportunities.

II. Implementation
Institutional and Implementation Arrangements
Institutional responsibilities and arrangements for project implementation will be established, as 
follows: 
 
A Central Project Coordination Unit (CPCU) will be set up in the Ministry of National Policies and 
Economic Affairs with representation from other government stakeholders.  The CPCU has the 
mandate to ensure effective coordination and communication between the Ministry of National 
Policies and Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, Central Bank, Ministry of Primary Industries, 
Ministry of Agriculture, and Provincial Councils; provide overall policy guidance and support to the 
implementing ministries; mobilize and ensure coordination with public and private sector 
stakeholders; and oversee the project’s regular internal auditing/ third party-monitoring of the two 
main investment components to ensure adherence to project principles and transparency. 
 
Ministry of Primary Industries (MOPI).  MOPI will be responsible for implementing Component 1, 
sub-components 1.1 and 1.2, and will oversee the following project-relevant units and entities: 
 
A Project Management Unit (PMU) in MOPI is responsible for the management of Component 1, 
sub-components 1.1 and 1.2, including annual work and budget planning, coordination of the 
Department of Export Agriculture in Kandy and the three regional offices (Kilinochchi, Ampara, 
Matara); coordination with the three Provincial Councils and Provincial Ministries of Agriculture; 
procurement; fund withdrawal and financial reporting; technical and institutional aspects of 
implementation; general oversight, field supervision and acceptance checks; and training and 
capacity building, and the periodic progress reporting to the Bank.  A separate Secretariat would be 
set up in the PMU of MOPI to manage the day-to-day implementation of the matching grants 
program. 
 
A Board of Directors will be set up to oversee and govern the application process and approval of 
matching grants under sub-component 1.2.  The Board will be chaired by the Secretary of MOPI and 
include representatives from MOF, Board of Investment, Ceylon Export Board, Central Bank, 
Chamber of Commerce, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Fisheries and the Provincial Councils 

and Provincial Ministries of Agriculture.  The Board would be responsible for reviewing and 
approving applications for matching grants that have passed the technical, institutional and business 
reviews, ensuring that proposals are in accordance with government policy directions and objectives, 
especially outreach and integration of farmers and female entrepreneurs; make good business sense; 
and are in compliance with project regulations, including safeguards. 
 
A Technical Review Group (TRG) will be appointed, comprising representatives from government 
technical departments, academia/ research, industry-related enterprises, and other stakeholders.  The 
TRG would provide guidance to farmer producer organizations and agribusinesses that have 
expressed interest in applying to the matching grants program on technical and business-related 
aspects of investment proposals, such as crop/ product selection, technology innovation, production 
organization and processing, marketing research, partnership arrangements, investment costing, and 
other elements of investment planning process.  The TRG would review finalized investment plans 
for farmer producer organizations and agribusinesses for technical and economic soundness and 
compliance with project regulations and recommend such proposals for approval to the Board.  
 
The Regional Development Department of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka would be responsible for 
administering the Partial Credit Guarantee (PCG) under Component 1, sub-components 1.3.  The 
Department would also maintain the PCG Operational Manual, develop a business plan and pricing 
model, continuously review the eligibility criteria for loans, establish a registration system for loans 
to be covered under the PCG, and manage the claims processing system under the project. 
 
Under the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA)  the following project-relevant units and entities would be 
set up or would be set up for the management of Component 2.  
 
A Coordinating Committee will be set up in MOA to be responsible for the regular coordination 
between MOA and the Provincial Councils of the participating provinces, based on the principles of 
the Wadduwa Declaration of the National and Provincial Ministers of Agriculture, signed on 
September 30, 2015. The Coordinating Committee would ensure that project’s sub-components 2.2 
(Agriculture Technology Demonstration Parks) and 2.3 (Upgrading Production and Marketing 
Infrastructure) are fully coordinated with the Provincial Councils based on the devolved provincial 
mandates for agriculture and rural development 
 
A Project Management Unit (PMU) in MOA will be responsible for overall day-to-day coordination 
and management of Component 2 in coordination with the five Provincial Councils and Provincial 
Ministries of Agriculture.  The PMU would be responsible for annual work and budget planning; 
coordination with provinces/ districts in public outreach and community mobilization, procurement 
and contract management, fund withdrawal and financial management, including and financial 
reporting; technical and institutional implementation aspects, field supervision and acceptance 
checks; and training and capacity building.  It would also be responsible for reporting on project 
progress and implementation issues to the Bank, including the relevant project M&E indicators and 
safeguards implementation performance. 
 
The Sri Lanka Council for Agriculture Research Policy (CARP) under MOA, would be responsible 
for implementation of sub-component 2.4. Day to day activities under the component will be 
managed by a small Policy Analysis Unit, housed in CARP with project support and reporting to the 
Chairman of CARP.  The primary responsibility of the Unit would be to support policy level 
discussions of the CPCU, Ministry Finance, MOPI and MOA; monitor consistency of economic 


policies across various parts of the government; develop an annual program of studies and analytical 
work, and monitor implementation during the year through periodic activity progress updates.

III. Safeguard Policies that might apply

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional)
Environmental Assessment 
OP/BP 4.01

Yes To mitigate potential environmental and social 
impacts that may be caused due to physical project 
interventions and ensure all negative impacts 
associated with project investments are avoided and/
or mitigated, an Environmental Assessment and 
Management Framework (EAMF) and a 
Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) have been 
prepared.  These will provide detailed guidance on 
the specific due diligence requirements as well as on 
the specific environmental and social safeguards 
instruments required for sub-projects, including 
screening, environmental management plans, 
resettlement action plans etc.) to mitigate any 
potential negative project impacts.

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 Yes The project will support agriculture activities on 
existing farmland.  Expansion of farmland into 
fragile habitats is not foreseen. The project will 
improve agricultural practices and is expected to 
reduce the pressure on farmland and surrounding 
natural habitats.  Some activities might impact 
natural habitats because of their proximity to such 
habitats (construction and/or upgrading of rural 
infrastructure).  The EAMF prescribes a due 
diligence mechanism under OP 4.01 to ensure 
impacts are mitigated.  Preventive and mitigation 
measures will be included in sub-project EMPs, as 
needed.

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No Project-supported agricultural activities will take 
place on existing agricultural areas and there will be 
no expansion into forest areas.  No activities in 
commercial forests or in close proximity to forest 
areas are expected.

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes The project promotes Integrated Pest Management as 
a key thematic area,  however, the intensification and 
diversification of agriculture could to lead to changes 
in the application of pesticides for pest and disease 
control.  A Pest Management Plans (PMP) has been 
prepared based on Integrated Pest Management 
(IPM) principles, describing the national regulatory 
framework, current status of pest and disease control, 
monitoring and supervision mechanism, major 


experience and problems, and lessons learned from 
past projects.  It specifies a range of actions to 
strengthen integrated pest management practices and 
awareness and includes capacity building and 
monitoring program to facilitate implementation.

Physical Cultural Resources 
OP/BP 4.11

No No project-support activities are expected in the 
vicinity of or to affect physical cultural resources, as 
defined by OP/BP4.11. Measures on safeguard 
chance finds are  included as part of mitigation 
measures defined in EAMF OP/BP 4.01.

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 
4.10

No No conclusive evidence or data exist yet on the 
possible presence of indigenous peoples 
communities in the country.  In general, "forest 
dwellers" who live in remote locations and close to 
commercial forests and national forest reserves are 
considered native communities.  Their livelihood is 
dependent on forest resources.  Project supported 
agricultural activities will take place on existing 
agricultural areas and there will be no expansion into 
forest areas.  No activities in commercial forests or in 
close proximity to forest areas are expected and 
therefore forest dweller communities will not be 
affected through proposed investments under the 
project.

Involuntary Resettlement OP/
BP 4.12

Yes The project will not involve involuntary resettlement 
or physical displacement.  Small-scale land 
alignment or acquisition for village-level civil works 
may be necessary.  Where the need for land 
acquisition may arise, the project’s RPF will apply.  
The RPF provides the guidelines and procedures for 
land acquisition; describes provisions for 
compensation and mitigation measures, includes a 
grievance redress mechanism, and set up safeguards 
monitoring and institutional arrangements in the 
event of land acquisition and livelihood losses.

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 Yes The project may include the up-grading and 
rehabilitation of small-scale irrigation facilities   and 
water tanks.  OP/BP4.37 applies because of the 
dependence on water conveyance and control via 
irrigation systems and the links of smaller tanks with 
the storage and operation of upstream medium/ large 
dams, which is typical for Sri Lanka’s cascading tank 
and irrigation infrastructure.  The rehabilitation of 
small irrigation schemes and tanks will not include 
dams and embankments more than 15 meters high 
and will not include medium to large scale dams.  

The EAMF includes generic dam safety measures to 
be adopted in the design and implementation of 
rehabilitation/ improvement of irrigation structures.  
It also includes guidance on the preparation of 
operation and maintenance (O&M) plans and dam 
safety plans in accordance with OP/BP4.37.

Projects on International 
Waterways OP/BP 7.50

No The proposed project activities do not have any 
impacts to the international waterways and therefore 
this policy is not triggered.

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/
BP 7.60

No There are no disputed areas where project 
interventions are undertaken and therefore this policy 
is not triggered.

IV. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify 

and describe any potential large scale,  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
The project is expected to bring positive environmental benefits to the project areas through the 
introduction and expansion of modern technology applications that help improve current cropping 
patterns and farming methods, increase efficiency in the management of water resources, protect 
agriculture soils, and roll out integrated pest management. However, two components under the 
project may involve activities that could have significant environmental impacts if not mitigated 
properly, especially during the construction phase.   Component 1 will support commercial 
agriculture and agro-products processing. Component 2 would finance the establishment of 
agriculture technology demonstration parks and improvements of rural infrastructure, including 
access roads and tracks, rehabilitation of small irrigation schemes, land preparation, market 
facilities, and others. The project’s process-oriented and demand-driven framework approach does 
not allow to determine project investments and specific project locations for investments under 
these components at appraisal. However it is known that these will be conducted in existing 
agricultural areas. 
 
Sub-component 1.2: Matching Grants to Producer Organizations and Agribusinesses:  
 
The agricultural sector faces a number of challenges in managing land productivity which often 
results in encroachment of forest areas for search of new land for cultivation. Soil erosion, crop 
disease management, water use efficiency, water pollution from excessive use of chemicals, and 
cultivation of unsuitable crop varieties are among the key areas where focus in terms of 
environmental management are a priority.   
 
Supporting the commercial agriculture and agro-products processing will require that stringent 
environmental screening, identification of potential environmental and impacts and management 
in terms of set up and operations of the activity. Among other best practices would be organic 
cultivation and at the same time careful soil management needs to be taken care of to prevent soil 
erosion and top soil degradation.  As specific sites and nature of the agro-business activities are 
not yet known, best practices that need to be employed and general recommendations cannot be 
employed as the nature of the activity varies and depend upon the soil type, area of cultivation ,i.e. 
dry zone or wet zone, and topography, crop type and the specific agriculture sector.  A site-


specific Environmental Management Planning approach plays a key role and has been 
incorporated in to the Matching Grants Program.  In addition, via strengthening technical 
knowledge and extension services focusing on the careful and minimal use of chemical fertilizer 
and pesticides/herbicides through good practices such as Integrated Pest Management and 
Integrated Plant Nutrition Management via the project’s Pest Management Plan, activities that 
facilitate sustainable agricultural development should be essentially promoted. 
 
Sub-component 2.2: Establishment of Modern Agriculture Technology Parks: The sub-component 
would support 7 agriculture technology demonstration parks in selected districts in the Northern, 
Eastern, Central, North-Central and Uva Provinces, which have been identified based on high 
poverty headcounts and agriculture potential. The exact location of where these interventions will 
be taking places will only be deduced during the project implementation stage. Environmental 
screening will be an essential part of the site selection process in order to ensure project-supported 
agriculture-related activities would take place on existing farmland and no expansion or creation 
of new farmland into fragile habitats is foreseen. The project will bring improvements to 
agricultural practices that are expected to reduce the pressure on these areas and the likelihood of 
encroachment into sensitive natural habitats. 
 
Sub-component 2.3: Up-grading Production and Marketing Infrastructure:  This component will 
entail physical interventions under the following purview; (i) the up-grading and rehabilitation of 
small-scale irrigation infrastructure and existing water tanks and irrigation systems in selected 
priority areas, linked to the agriculture technology demonstrations parks; (ii) the improvement of 
existing production and market access roads and construction of new field access tracks to 
improve transportation, access to markets and accessibility for agricultural machinery; and (iii) 
village level storage and product handling facilities, including drying platforms and sheds, 
composting facilities of crop residues, storage facilities and others. Infrastructure investment 
would focus on public infrastructure and would be linked to gaps identified under the technology 
parks development.  Impacts to physical and ecological environments during the construction 
phase of physical interventions outlined under Sub-component will be predominantly during the 
construction phase and consist of impacts such as the stress of natural resources such as sand, 
water and spil, removal of productive topsoil, solid waste generation in the form of construction 
waste, localized dust and noise and safety and occupational health to laborers. These impacts will 
be management via mitigation measures that will be implements via sub-project specific 
environmental management plans. 
 
The project is expected to generate positive social benefits and provide sustainable poverty 
reduction opportunities into lagging rural areas. Improved agriculture productivity and value chain 
development are expected to create additional economic returns for farmer households.  Expected 
benefits include employment opportunities for poorer households, individual and collective 
empowerment through membership in formal farmer producer organizations and in partnership 
arrangements with agribusinesses, improved access to finance, technology, and markets, as well as 
technical and management skills. Attention to more equitable sharing of economic gains from 
investments in commercial agriculture modernized value chains will be paid during the process of 
farmer producer organization establishment. Investments in local infrastructure will have positive 
impacts if infrastructure is targeted to serve both agricultural production needs and the needs of 
local communities.  A mandatory social screening is specified in the Operations Manual and RPF 
and will allow for the detailed assessment of potential social impacts and risks and relevant 
mitigation measures of all sub-projects.  Land acquisition is expected to be small-scale and to be 
manageable through the RPF and Resettlement Action Plans.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities 
in the project area:
No potential indirect negative environmental or social impacts are expected under the project.  It is 
worthwhile to note that women producer organizations will receive priority in the matching grant 
facility and other project-supported activities. However, a number of issues deserve attention and 
monitoring from a social development perspective during implementation:  Women-headed and 
poor households may be especially vulnerable and their participation in project activities might be 
limited resulting in inequitable production arrangements within farmer producer organizations or 
in partnership arrangements with agribusinesses. Market risks will remain substantial, and timely 
access to market information will remain challenging.  This may result in producer organizations 
not being able to assess market and demand conditions adequately.   Modern agriculture requires 
more investment while some of the proposed commodities may provide returns only with some 
time lags.  Poorer households may therefore face increased risk of indebtedness because of their 
motivation to participate in the project.  Producer arrangements will require the organization and 
streamlining of large numbers of smallholder producers under unified production and land 
management arrangements, requiring special attention to ensuring voluntary and fully informed 
participation.  Complex land tenure and land ownership patterns in Sri Lanka’s smallholder 
agriculture might hinder the introduction of modern agriculture practices and new technologies.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse 
impacts.
Alternative design consideration included a three pronged approach that included major 
investment components on climate smart agriculture, value chain development for higher value 
agricultural products, and on reforms to the country’s research and development and extension 
systems.   This scope was considered to broad and complex, including from an environmental and 
social safeguards perspective and the project design was simplified as described above.

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
An Environmental Assessment and Management Framework (EAMF) in lieu of an overall project-
specific Environmental Assessment (EA) and a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) have been 
prepared as details of specific sites and related activities and interventions are not yet available. 
The EAMF primarily includes an assessment of generic issues that are typically associated with 
anticipated interventions under the project, measures for environmental risk mitigation and 
institutional arrangements for conducting environmental assessment, instruction to the preparation 
of Environmental Management Plans (EMPs), implementation and monitoring. The RPF provides 
guidance on the land acquisition process and  the preparation of site-specific Resettlement Action 
Plans where needed. 
 
To ensure that project interventions supported under the Matching Grant Program are 
environmentally sound, the EAMF includes environmental screening and evaluation criteria which 
will be part of the screening process for matching grant applications under Component 1.   MOPI 
will be responsible for ensuring the environmental screening of all project concept notes and full 
proposals submitted by applicants to the matching grant program.  The environmental screening 
process and evaluation criteria presented in the EAMF are reflected in the Operational Manuel of 
the Matching Grant Program as well and built in to the eligibility assessment criteria of matching 
grant applications.  
 
All interventions (excepting those that obviously are environmentally benign or low impact) under 

Component 2 will be subject to an environmental screening with the objective to: (a) determine the 
anticipated environmental impacts, risks and opportunities of sub-project; and (ii) determine if the 
anticipated impacts and public concern warrant further environmental analysis, and if so to 
recommend the appropriate type and extent of Environmental Assessment needed as per the set 
criteria in the EAMF.   
 
The EAMF is taking the applicable safeguard policies into account as well as the national 
environmental requirements and will serve as a guide to the level of environmental analysis and 
mitigation required for all interventions supported by the project which will have the potential to 
trigger negative environmental impacts and thereby ensure compliance with the World Bank’s 
environmental safeguard policies and the relevant national Environmental regulations during 
implementation. As a category B project, all physical activities financed under the project in 
general will be required to prepare an EMP and follow the World Banks Environmental Health 
and Safety Guidelines and agriculture sector guidelines as defined in the EAMF. 
 
Interventions under Component 2, sub-component 2.3 may include the rehabilitation and up-
grading of small-scale irrigation infrastructure and existing water tanks (managed by the Agrarian 
Services Departments) linked to the agriculture technology demonstrations parks under sub-
component 2.2.  OP/BP4.37 applies because of the dependence on water conveyance and control 
via the irrigation systems and the links of smaller tanks with the water storage and operation of 
upstream medium/large dams, which is typical for Sri Lanka’s historical cascading tank and 
irrigation infrastructure.  There is an ongoing and effective dam safety program in Sri Lanka 
targeting all large to medium scale dams (upstream of small irrigation structures) and smaller 
dams along cascading irrigation systems.  Full-level inspections, dam safety assessments, and 
safety remedial measures have already been conducted and details are documented by the 
Government satisfactorily to the Bank and in compliance with the provisions of OP/BP4.37 on 
Dam Safety.   
 
Typical interventions under this project would include repairs and improvements, such as 
protection of downstream slopes of dam embankments, providing toe-filters and toe drains to 
improve downstream drainage and arresting excessive seepage flows, upstream slope protection 
strengthening of the structural stability of  spillways and sluice structures etc.  The anticipated 
project activities will result in an overall enhancement of the safety of dams (tank bunds) against 
the risk of failure.  The project, however, will not finance construction of new tanks (new dams/
tank bunds).  Small dams i ncluded under the project would be less than 5 meters in height. 
 
All irrigation infrastructure related interventions will require a screening, as per the EAMF to 
verify whether upstream medium to large scale dams are present and connected hydrologically, 
and to assess their dam safety status and, if needed outline follow-up actions.  If the presence of 
upstream and hydrologically connected dams is confirmed and these have not been rehabilitated or 
strengthened and thus have Dam Safety implications, the following will be conducted: an 
inspection and evaluation of the safety status of the dam, its appurtenances, and its performance 
history; and a review and evaluation of the mandated dam owners operation and maintenance 
procedures.  A report will be provided on the findings of the review, including recommendations 
for any remedial work or safety-related measures necessary to upgrade the existing dam to an 
acceptable standard of safety.  Necessary additional dam safety measures or remedial work may be 
financed under the project. When substantial remedial work is needed, these will be undertaken 
using the following procedures: a competent professional will be recruited to design and supervise 
the work.  Because the size of dams would be less than 5 meters in height, qualified professionals 


will be hired by MOA to design and supervise the work. 
 
The MOA and MOPI have limited prior experience with Bank-funded projects respectively and 
the capacity to manage environmental and social safeguards in project implementation is limited 
as well.  MOPI is a new entity.  MOA has been long established, however, does not partake in the 
implementation of national level environmental regulations and institutional capacity is weak.  
MOA has however sufficient capacity and technical expertise in pest management because MOA 
is implementing national programs in pest control and pesticide management.  To address capacity 
weaknesses, the PMUs under MOA and MOPI will both recruit full-time qualified environmental 
and social specialists prior to the commencement of field implementation to be responsible for the 
implementation of the project’s environmental and social regulations, including the EAMF, PMP, 
EMPs, and RPF and RAPs.  In addition, the project will provide training in environmental 
management and on environmental and social management to improve institutional capacity. The 
cost for monitoring and supervising the implementation of environmental and social project 
regulations have been integrated into the overall project investment cost.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure 
on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Consultations with direct and indirect project beneficiaries, government stakeholders at various 
administrative levels and farmers will be conducted as part of the participatory process for 
designing and implementing sub-projects.  Consultation will aim at: sharing information, listening 
to feedback, engaging citizens in decision making, and involving stakeholders in participation in 
the implementation process.  Consultations will also enable the project team to hold joint 
discussions with the beneficiary communities, share ideas about planning and implementation, and 
benefit from local knowledge to take more informed decisions. Consultation will take place inform 
of public meetings, focus group discussions, sub-project specific community consultations as part 
of the social screening process and direct one-to-one consultations.  A Public Information Booklet 
will be used as an information dissemination technique to promote competition and innovation in 
technology development and advocate for poor framer groups, including women farmer groups, to 
take part in project activities.  Following review by the Bank, the safeguards instruments including 
RAPs, EMPs have been disclosed through the Infoshop and locally on the ministries’ websites, 
and through the PMUs and at Divisional Secretariats of project areas. 
 
The project will adopt following as citizen engagement mechanisms: (a) continuous community 
consultations as social preparation and screening of  subprojects; (b) social audit committees at 
local level to monitor subproject implementation; and (c) third party monitoring of project 
implementation to ensure projects benefits are distributed  equally and efficiently across different 
social groups and geographical regions.  The outcome of the citizen engagement exercises will be 
documented and reviewed during implementation support missions.

A. Introduction and Context 
 
1. Sri Lanka is a Lower Middle-Income country with a GDP per capita of USD 4,073 (2017) and a total population 
of 21.4 million people. Following 30 years of civil war that ended in 2009, Sri Lanka’s economy grew at an average 5.8 
percent during the period of 2010-2017, reflecting a peace dividend and a determined policy thrust towards 
reconstruction and growth; although there were some signs of a slowdown in the last few years. The economy is 
transitioning from a predominantly rural-based economy towards a more urbanized economy oriented around 
manufacturing and services.  Economic growth has contributed to the decline in the national poverty headcount ratio 
from 15.3 percent in 2006/07 to 4.1 percent in 2016. Extreme poverty is rare and concentrated in some geographical 
pockets. 
 
2. The Government that came to power in 2015 envisions promoting a globally competitive, export-led 
economy with an emphasis on inclusion. It has indicated keenness to undertake reforms in the areas of public finance, 
competitiveness, governance, and education sectors. In 2017, the Government presented Vision 2025, a policy 
document that both identified economic limitations due to the constrained fiscal space and presented structural 
reforms (including the promotion of private sector participation) to address key economic challenges and strengthen 
economic growth. Despite Sri Lanka’s remarkable economic achievements, many people continue to be at risk of falling 
back into poverty. 
 
3. Sri Lanka is vulnerable to climate-related natural disasters that have major economic impacts. Long-term, 
annual losses for housing, infrastructure, agriculture, and relief from natural disasters are estimated at LKR 50 billion 
(USD 327 million), with the highest annual expected losses from floods, cyclones or high winds, droughts and landslides. 
This is equivalent to 0.4 percent of GDP or 2.1 percent of GoSL expenditures. Due to the increased sophistication of the 
economy the damage caused by the 2016 and 2017 floods and landslides was more than twice as high in US$ terms 
than the worst flood disasters between 1992 and 2011. 
 

B. Sectoral and Institutional Context 
 

4. The agriculture sector remains the backbone of Sri Lanka’s culture and economy.  The agriculture sector 
contributes 7.7 percent to GDP and still employs approximately 27 percent of the population.  Of the country’s 
approximately 2.3 million hectares of agricultural land, around 80 percent is under smallholder production, with 
around 1.65 million smallholder farmers operating on average less than 2 hectares.  Sri Lanka has successfully attained 


self-sufficiency in rice through policy interventions including fertilizer subsidies. However, expenditures on vital public 
services, such as Research and Development (R&D) and extension services account for only three percent of total 
agriculture expenditure and much of this limited budget is spent on rice research. The focus on self-sufficiency in rice 
has limited farmer’s opportunities to diversify into higher value products and kept the sector concentrated in the low 
value food crops.  As a result, agriculture productivity, as measured by Total Factor Productivity (TFP), has only grown 
by an average of 0.6 percent per year since 1980 and Sri Lanka lags significantly behind other South and East Asian 
countries. Women contribute to over 38 percent of the farming operations in Sri Lanka. However, the unemployment 
rates of women are more than double that of men at all age levels, with more than 60 percent of women engaged in 
agriculture working as unpaid family labor. Furthermore, only 10 percent of female farmers receive extension services 
in comparison to 90 percent of male farmers.  
 
5. Irrigation is a key feature of the smallholder agriculture sector.  Sri Lanka has a long history of water 
management for agriculture production.  The expansion of crop cultivation into the dry zones of the north, east and 
south-east of the country was enabled through the construction of elaborate water management systems, dating back 
to the period between 500 BC and 300 AD. The systems are based on water capture in small reservoirs commonly 
known as “tanks” connected via canals into “cascades” which enabled crop cultivation throughout the country 
including those areas with long and variable dry seasons. Tank cascades remain the primary source of water for dry 
season cultivation of approximately 74,150 hectares, supporting the livelihoods of approximately 154,744 farmers.  
Recently, water scarcity has increased because of high inter-annual and inter-seasonal variability in rainfall, catchment 
area land-use changes which have reduced the proportion of rainfall available for capture in downstream tanks, and 
the growing demand for water to meet the needs of a growing population.  For example, drought in 2016 and 2017 
affected 1,927,069 people across 17 districts, according to the Disaster Management Centre. During the Maha season 
in 2016, 612,224 hectares of paddy were cultivated of which 50,615 hectares were damaged due to the drought, with 
total production of MT 2.383 million, 30 percent of the average in last ten years. 
 
6. Hotspot areas are the most vulnerable to climatic events .  Although much of the country has been subject 
to the increased frequency and severity of climate e vents, some areas have emerged as being particularly 
susceptible to either flood or drought events, or both.  These are areas which are predominantly agriculture based 
and therefore the livelihoods of smallholder farmers are at risk.  Hotspots have been identified through a rigorous, 
analysis of empirical evidence by the Department of Agrarian Development (DAD) of the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA), 
the World Food Program (WFP) and the International Water Management Institute (IWMI). 
 
7. The management of irrigation water suffers from institutional fragmentation and lack of local accountability. 
The management of irrigation tanks has undergone a transformation in the post-independence period. Community 
institutions which originally managed these tanks were initially replaced with a new GoSL-led institutional system that 
ultimately became ineffective. To overcome the top-down management of tank systems, since 1978 there have been 
experiments in Participatory Irrigation Management (PIM), involving local communities in the management of irrigation 
schemes. PIM was approved as official policy in 1992 and Farmer Organizations (FOs) were created by the Agrarian 
Services Act of 1991 to manage minor tanks. Despite this policy direction, less capacity of FOs to manage limited 
remaining water and lack of strong oversight from GoSL have compounded the situation. Within GoSL, the responsibility 
for the management of these tanks currently lies with three different institutions: Ministry of Irrigation, Water Resource 
and Disaster Management (MIWRDM); Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) and, Provincial Councils (PCs). The responsibility 
for system maintenance budgeting and implementation is shared across these institutions and FOs often with unclear 
mandates. Water user fees were removed after the independence, and GoSL started to allocate maintenance budgets 
which are insufficient to meet maintenance needs. But, FOs collect contribution from farmers and they are 
maintaining their own Operation and Maintenance (O&M) funds. 




 
8. While many of these tanks are still functioning, some are in a completely dilapidated condition and the 
overall performance is low.  Past tank rehabilitation efforts have largely failed to produce the desired results for many 
reasons. Firstly, insufficient attention has been paid to water and land use management in the upstream catchment 
areas. The supply of water from upstream catchment areas is in most cases decreasing because of land use changes, 
including deforestation and infrastructure development, which has also increased the flow of silt into the supply canals 
and tanks resulting in declined water inflows into the tanks and reduced water storage capacity in the tanks. Secondly, 
previous rehabilitation efforts have not adequately accounted for the hydraulic inter-connectedness of tanks within 
cascades resulting in sub-optimal development of water resources and negative downstream impacts. Finally, past 
rehabilitation efforts have not sufficiently factored in either growing water demand in the tank command areas or the 
likely future impacts of climate change, such that rehabilitated tanks have failed to provide enough water supply to 
meet even current demand. 
 

9. Improved access to irrigation and better water management needs to be addressed in conjunction with 
improving productivity in the sector.  Agriculture productivity is low due to an inhibiting policy framework, weak public 
services and low levels of private investment.  With rice self-sufficiency secured, a consensus has recently emerged 
within the GoSL that the country should take a more strategic approach to addressing low productivity by (i) 
modernizing water resource infrastructure, minimizing flood damages and managing water allocation more efficiently 
and (ii) diversifying the agricultural sector away from relatively low value food crops towards high value and export-
oriented commodities. In the water sector, an integrated basin approach to water investment and management needs 
to be built on integrated basin plans developed through effective stakeholder participation. As a middle-income country 
in an economically strong region, farmers can capitalize on growing domestic consumer demand for diversified, 
nutritious, and higher-valued foods and take advantage of the country’s proximity to fast growing neighboring markets. 
The GoSL has recently implemented measures to improve the competitiveness of the agriculture sector, such as 
promoting commercial and export-oriented agriculture through attracting and leveraging investments from farmer 
producer organizations and agribusinesses for high value agriculture production and value addition under the Bank-
supported Agriculture Sector Modernization Project.  
 
C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  

 
Development Objective(s) (From PAD) 
  
10. The Project Development Objective is to improve the productivity and climate resilience of smallholder 
agriculture in selected hotspot areas. 

 
Key Results 

11. The key results indicators to assess project outcomes are: 

• KPI 1: Increase in water productivity at farm level (Custom); 

• KPI 2: Increase in agriculture productivity of crops (Custom); 

• KPI 3: Crop diversification index (Custom); and 

• KPI 4: Direct project beneficiaries, segregated by gender (CRI). 
 

D. Project Description 
  
12. Theory of Change: The project will address the key problem of the vulnerability of agriculture systems in 



climatic hotspot areas of the country.  The drivers of this vulnerability are (i) lack of farmer access to reliable 
sources of irrigation water, (ii) insufficient protection of agriculture land from floods; (iii) low levels of 
diversification in agriculture production; and (iv) limited adoption of climate-smart technologies. Addressing 
these issues will involve an approach that (i) addresses expected long-term trends in climate change including 
the frequency and severity of climatic events (flood and drought); (ii) adopts a catchment scale approach to water 
management; and (iii) integrates agriculture and water by working with farmers and Farmer Organizations (FOs) 
to improve the sustainable management of water and soil resources, and promote the adoption of suitable on-
farm water management and crop production technologies. 
 
13. The proposed project interventions will introduce catchment level hydrological assessments that 
incorporate future climate change projections to assess water availability and identify appropriate investments 
for upper catchment area treatments, water harvesting, rehabilitation of irrigation systems and reduced flood 
damage. Once water availability is assessed in a river basin, watersheds, sub-watersheds, cascades and individual 
tanks, then technical designs will be carried out for the tank irrigation systems, which consist of watershed 
catchment area, tank headworks, canal system and agriculture production area. The water stored in rehabilitated 
tanks will be used to commence CSA activities. Management of irrigation schemes will be enhanced through 
improved capacity of FOs. The project would support the identification, demonstration and adoption of 
technologies to both improve water use efficiency and enable farmers to diversify their production and move 
into higher value crops. Finally, support would be provided to enable farmers to have improved market access. 
Through these interventions, as stated below, the core project objectives of improving climate resilience and 
increased productivity would be achieved. 
 

 
 
 
14. Project Beneficiaries: The primary project beneficiaries will be over 470,000 smallholder farmers in 
hotspot areas (375,000 ha) in eleven administrative districts (Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu, Anuradhapura, 
Polonnaruwa, Puttalam, Kurunegala, Trincomalee, Batticaloa, Ampara, Hambantota and Moneragala) spread 
across six provinces (Northern, North Central, North Western, Eastern, Southern and Uva) in the dry zone of Sri 


Lanka (see Project Area in Annex 9). Smallholder farmers consist of small farmers (1.0 to 2.0 ha of farm land) and 
marginal farmers (less than 1.0 ha).  They will gain knowledge and technology transfer and access to 
infrastructure assets to enhance climate resilience in farming resulting in increased revenue from crop 
diversification and participation in emerging value chains.  Many technical and managerial staff of the 
participating agencies will benefit through training and capacity building activities. The project will also promote 
participation of youth and women in all key project interventions to ensure that they would benefit from the 
project activities. 

 
15. Hot-Spot Area Development Model: Given the centrality of tanks in the agrarian livelihoods of the dry 
zone of Sri Lanka, their current levels of neglect and the increasing vulnerability of these areas to both droughts 
and floods in quick succession with consequent impacts on agricultural production and incomes, the 
rehabilitation of tank-based irrigated agricultural systems is key to improving the resilience of these areas and 
the agrarian communities that depend on them. Resilience being ‘the ability of a system to bounce back or return 
to normal functioning after adversity’,1 the Hot-Spot Area Development model aims to enhance the resilience of 
these areas and those who depend on them for their livelihoods. Climate shocks add to relatively low paddy 
productivity. Resilience will be built through stable and rising incomes of agrarian families living in these hotspot 
areas despite increasing climatic variability. The expected results of this novel model will be achieved by (1) 
flexible and adaptive management of existing and improved irrigation water storage and delivery structures to 
make irrigation more reliable in the face of rising climatic variability (including more frequent episodes of high 
intensity rainfall and flooding and/or drought); (2) better agricultural inputs, techniques and practices that will 
help farmers maximize water use efficiency given rising climatic variability – and reduce crop harvest losses; and 
(3) better access to new markets and higher prices, through marketing higher up the value chain, more 
competitive agri-enterprises and upgraded infrastructure for agricultural trade to stabilize and increase incomes 
from agricultural livelihoods. The project will prioritize nutrient-rich foods to improve year-round nutrition. 
 

16. Phasing: In view of the complexity and innovativeness of the project and to learn lessons, the project will 
be implemented in three overlapping stages. The first stage (2018–2021) will cover three Hot-Spot Areas 
(Anuradhapura, Kurunegala and Kilinochchi districts), whereas the second (2020–2023) and third (2021–2024) 
stages will cover the balance eight districts. Progress will be reviewed annually and prior to completion of every 
stage, to sanction the next stage of implementation. All project financed activities in a stage will be completed in 
3 years but the O&M activities will continue till end of the project.  

 

Project Components 

 
17. Component 1: Agriculture Production and Marketing (US$ 42 million). The objective of this component 
is to improve agriculture productivity and diversification through the adoption of CSA practices and improved 
on-farm water management. 
 
18. Component 2: Water for Agriculture (US$ 92 million). The objective of this component is to facilitate (a) 
planning for water and other infrastructure necessary to support climate-resilient irrigated agriculture, (b) 

 
construction of the planned infrastructure; and (c) co-management of this infrastructure by central/provincial 
governments and the local community. 
 
19. Component 3: Project Management (US$ 6 million). The objective of this component is to ensure the 
quality of overall project management, while ensuring smooth coordination of activity implementation by various 
agencies and strategic partners at national and subnational levels. This component will finance (i) the consultancy 
and operating costs of the PMU and DPD Offices and of different project executing agencies, including for 
fiduciary and safeguard aspects; (ii) the monitoring and evaluation of project activities at baseline, midterm and 
end of project, including geotagging of the assets created; and (iii) information, education and communication 
campaigns to make all stakeholders aware of the project. 

 
20. Component 4: Contingent Emergency Response (US$ 0.0 million). This emergency response component 
will allow for rapid reallocation of project proceeds in the event of a natural or man-made disaster or crisis that 
has caused or is likely to imminently cause a major adverse economic and/or social impact. 

 

21. Climate Co-Benefits: The project seeks to derive Climate Co-Benefits (about 95 percent) through: (i) 
enhanced water security at farm level through the rehabilitation and modernization of irrigation systems and 
improvement in water efficiency; (ii) improved soil health through the adoption of good agricultural practices to 
improve soil fertility, soil nutrient management, and promote soil carbon sequestration; and (iii) improved 
adaptation to climate risks through increased farm productivity and crop diversification. 

 

22. Project Cost and Financing: The project will be financed through a six-year Investment Project 
Financing (IPF) loan. The total project cost is US$140 million and will be funded by an IBRD loan of US$125 million, 
with the GoSL contribution of US$ 10 million to cover salary costs on parallel basis and the Beneficiaries 
contributing US$ 5 million in kind.  Retroactive financing up to an aggregate amount of US$ 5 million will be 
available for eligible expenditures incurred under all project components and all categories prior to the date of 
signed Loan Agreement, but on or after July 01, 2018. 
 
E. Implementation 
 
23. The key design features incorporated in the institutional and implementation model include: multi-
stakeholder approach - different stakeholders involved in the field of climate resilient irrigation and agriculture 
are expected to contribute to project implementation from national to sub-national levels; coordinated 
approach - stakeholders are expected to share knowledge and resources in a collaborative manner at each level; 
citizen engagement - local smallholder farmers, medium sized agribusiness owners, common interest groups, 
producer organizations, individual entrepreneurs and their customers will be involved in the planning & 
implementation of project activities, along with government counterparts, NGOs, academia and the private 
sector; consistency with the National Poverty Alleviation Programme – since the project will also work with the 
People’s Company of the Grama Shakthi Programme implemented at Grama Niladhari Division (GND) level; Use 
of existing government staff – except a few of the full-time key professionals to be recruited from the open 
market, the rest of the staff will be from existing government cadres and work on a part-time basis at both 
national and provincial levels; and gender equality - the project design and approach will take into account the 
gender dimension and ensure that the project provides equal opportunities for women to participate in the 
project cycle. 

 

24. Institutional arrangements:  The project is fully integrated in the GOSL administration, and the 
implementation is designed to capitalize on existing government agencies at national, provincial, district, 
divisional, and   Grama Niladhari Division levels. A Project Management Unit (PMU) will be established under 
the Ministry of Agriculture, whereas Deputy Project Director’s Offices (DPD Offices) will be established under 
the Ministries of Irrigation & Water Resources Management and of Provincial Councils and Local Government. 
At provincial level, there will be Provincial DPD Offices set up in each of the participating Provinces to implement 
the project. The Provincial DPD Offices will be set up under the Chief Secretaries in Kilinochchi, Kurunegala, 
Anuradhapura, Trincomalee, Hambantota and Moneragala Districts, and they will cover the district level 
activities of the respective districts. In addition, a District Unit of the DPD Office will be established under the 
District Secretary at the Office of the Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Development in Puttalam, Batticaloa, 
Mullaitivu, Polonnaruwa and Ampara Districts to coordinate all agencies operating at district level.  
 

25. There will be a Project Appraisal Team (PAT) set up at district level, and it will be coordinated by the 
District Planning Director. The PAT is an independent body and will report to the DPD. In addition, at the district 
level, there will be an advisory committee headed by the District Secretary. The Divisional secretaries of the 
participating divisions and district and divisional level heads of the government agencies, representatives of 
chamber of commerce, Associations of Farmer/Producer Organizations and NGOs will participate in the Advisory 
Committee. The Advisory Committee will guide the project implementers at the district level to implement CSIAP 
effectively. 

 
26. At Divisional level, there will be a Divisional Unit of the Provincial DPD Office set up at the Agrarian 
Service Center (ASC), and it will be headed by the Divisional Officer of the ASC. The Divisional Unit will function 
as a supporting unit to the Provincial DPD office and work closely with the District Unit to implement the Project 
effectively. The community based organizations, such as Farmer Organizations (FOs), Producer Groups (PGs), and 
Grama Shakthi People’s Company (GSPCs) operating at the Grama Niladhari Division (GND) level are the 
institutions that will be actively involved in the project together with the beneficiary farmers at the community 
level. Given the transformative nature of the project, institutional coordination across the relevant sectors is 
emerging as a critical task for the PMU in developing an effective project implementation mechanism to achieve 
convergence with other programs. The institutional arrangement is further described in Annex 2 of the PAD. 
 
27. Implementation arrangements:  Overall project implementation is the responsibility of the Ministry of 
Agriculture (MOA). Since the institutional capacity of MOA is limited and special skills are required to implement 
the complex project activities, the project will draw expertise from the Ministry of Irrigation, Water Resource 
and Disaster Management (MIWRDM), Department of Agriculture (DOA), Department of Agrarian Development 
(DAD) and Irrigation Department (ID), as well, and acquire outside expertise, including consulting services. The 
day-to-day management and operation of the project is the responsibility of the Project Management Unit 
(PMU), headed by a Project Director (PD) appointed by MOA and assisted by national level Deputy Project 
Director’s offices in MIWRDM and MSPCLG as well as provincial level Deputy Project Director’s offices. The 
project will give attention to institutional coordination across departments, agencies, and strategic partners 
involved in the implementation of project activities. Specifically, as the MoA has an existing PMU under the 
ASMP, core functions such procurement, FM and safeguards would maximize the use of existing capacity.  Overall 
project oversight is the responsibility of the National Project Steering Committee (NPSC), established in the 
Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs (MNPEA) and chaired by its Secretary. The main responsibility 
of the NPSC is to provide strategic guidance for the implementation of the project and to act as the interface 
between the central and provincial institutions. The NPSC also approves the annual work program and budget 
for the project, endorses the working arrangements with strategic partners, and is briefed by the Bank (and the 


PD) on the outcomes of implementation support and review missions carried out with the Bank team at least 
biannually. 

 
28. The PMU is responsible for ensuring that: (i) all project activities are planned, financed and 

implemented as per the project annual work program and budget, (ii) project implementation is in line with 
operational guidelines of the Project Implementation Plan (PIP), (iii) project procurement and financial 
management activities are carried out in timely manner as per the World Bank’s Procurement for IPF Borrowers 
(2016), the project fiduciary manuals and the procurement plan, and (iv) social and environmental safeguards 
applicable to the project are fully complied with. The PMU is also responsible for monitoring project activities, 
preparing the quarterly and annual project progress reports, and ensuring that all reports (including financial 
reports) are submitted to the World Bank in timely manner.  

 
 .    
F. Project location and Salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 
 

The proposed project will be implemented in 11 districts in the dry zone climate vulnerability hot spots, 
covering at least 5 major watersheds. The mean annual rainfall is under 900mm (much of it being received 
during the northeast monsoon season from November to January) and mean annual temperature ranges 
between 28°C to 32°C. Droughts that persist for more than three months are common. It has a climax 
vegetation of dry evergreen forest and moist deciduous forest, with forests giving way to a stunted, 
shrubby, drought-tolerant vegetation in its driest parts. The forests found in most parts are secondary 
vegetation, which developed after hundreds of years of repeated clearing and cultivation. The natural 
vegetation has adapted to the annual change from flood to drought. The forests have been largely cleared 
for agriculture, timber or grazing, and many of the dry evergreen forests have been significantly degraded. 
Several protected areas have been established to protect some of remaining natural forests. Agriculture, 
settlements and other development activities have fragmented most of the forests giving rise to human-
wildlife conflicts, particularly with elephants. Overall, about 30% of Sri Lanka’s labor force is engaged in 
agriculture, and in the dry zone that has been the frontier for irrigation based development, directly or 
indirectly connecting entire population to agriculture. However, most farm households have multiple 
livelihood strategies as income from one source is insufficient for living. The predominant form of 
settlement in the project area is ‘village’ organized around a tank that is part of a cascade system. Although 
many of these small tank based villages have been incorporated into large and medium scale irrigated 
agricultural development schemes managed by the government, a substantial number of tank-villages that 
are rain-fed, persists. Most settlers in the project area have been granted land ownership and smallholdings 
predominate, and sub-division and fragmentation is common in tandem with the occurrence of large 
operational holdings – all devoted to food crop cultivation. Irrigation communities in the dry zone are 
connected with the government system of administration and management, including for irrigation 
management. Additionally, highland agriculture and illegal slash and burn agriculture also can be observed 
alongside small-scale inland fishery activities which take place in man-made tanks.

SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY 

 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

In order to mitigate potential environmental and 
social impacts that may be caused due to physical 
interventions and to ensure all negative impacts 
associated with project investments are avoided 
and/or mitigated, appropriate environmental and 
social management measures will be guided by the 
EAMF. The EAMF provides detailed analysis of the 
scale of due diligence required (such as 
environmental assessments, environmental 
management plans, etc.) for potential activities 
under the project. Additionally, a RPF has been 
prepared to identify and mitigate land-related social 
impacts under the Project. A ToR for the proposed 
Strategic Environmental Social Assessment (SESA) 
has also been included in the EAMF. SESA will inform 
the mini-watershed planning process to ensure 
broader watershed-level impacts are integrated into 
the planning process. 

Performance Standards for Private Sector 
Activities OP/BP 4.03 

No 
There will not be any financing of private sector 
entities under this project and therefore this policy is 
not applicable for this project. 

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 Yes 

OP4.04 applies to all types of natural habitats 
including natural forests. There is the possibility of 
impacting catchment forests due to dam 
rehabilitation activities. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 Yes 

Project-supported agricultural activities will take 
place on existing agricultural areas and there will be 
no expansion into forest areas. No activities on 
commercial forestry is supported by the project. 
However, dam improvement work may impact some 
of the catchment forests.  There will be watershed 
protection activities, which would have positive 
impact on forests. These impacts will be managed 



through the safeguard instruments that will be 
developed under OP 4.01 and OP 4.37. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

Because of the standardization, intensification and 
diversification of agricultural activities under the 
project, changes in the application of pesticides for 
pest and disease control are foreseen. It is not clear 
at this point, if the project would finance the 
procurement of pesticides. A Pest Management Plan 
(PMP) that has been prepared under the Agriculture 
Modernization Project building on Integrated Pest 
Management (IPM) principles has been adopted by 
this project. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 No 

As of now, no project activities are expected in the 
vicinity of or affect physical cultural resources (PCR), 
as defined by OP 4.11.  There are also no new 
construction of irrigation infrastructure planned. 
Mitigation measures if any activity takes place closer 
to PCRs and measures on PCR chance finds will be 
included as part of the mitigation measures defined 
in EAMF under the OP 4.01. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 No 
There is no conclusive evidence/information 
available that establishes the presence of indigenous 
people in the project area. 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

The project will support civil works and other 
activities associated with construction, rehabilitation 
and reconstruction of small-scale market 
infrastructure, tank systems, water harvesting 
structures, irrigation schemes, etc. At present, these 
activities are envisaged to take place on existing 
canals and schemes or land belonging to individual 
farmers, and the need for taking private land under 
the project is not expected. However, there may be 
need for additional land, albeit minimal, for 
catchment area treatment, reestablishment of canal 
reservations, and rehabilitation/reconstruction of 
irrigation schemes. Further, there may be 
encroachers or others using the land necessary for 
the civil works thus requiring adequate mitigation 
measures to be put in place during project 
implementation.  Accordingly, a Resettlement Policy 
Framework (RPF) has been prepared in accordance 
with OP/BP 4.12. Further, to support the mini-
watershed planning process, a ToR for the proposed 
Strategic Environmental Social Assessment (SESA) 
has also been included in the EAMF. 


Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 Yes 

The project plans to improve and rehabilitate small 
dams and the EAMF will include the process to be 
adopted on safety of dams including required 
expertise under the OP/BP 4.01. irrigation schemes 
to be reconstructed/rehabilitated would entail 
minor works to improve existing capacity of the 
tanks to ensure the cascade system functions 
efficiently. The Dam Safety and Water Resources 
Management Project financed by the World Bank  
has already rehabilitated most of the larger tanks 
and their respective dams and has also set up dam 
safety panel to monitor the interventions and 
operations. They will continue to provide guidance 
to the decisions that will be taken on this project.  All 
the requirements applicable to the project will be 
identified early during the implementation stage so 
that all the necessary plans and organization set-up 
are completed on time. 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

No 
The proposed project activities do not have any 
impacts to the international waterways and 
therefore this policy is not triggered. 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No 
There are no disputed areas where project 
interventions are undertaken and therefore this 
policy is not triggered. 

 
 

KEY SAFEGUARD POLICY ISSUES AND THEIR MANAGEMENT 

 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential 
large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
The project area covers hot spot areas spanning Ampara, Batticaloa, Trincomalee, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu, 
Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Puttalam, Kurunegala, Hambantota and Moneragala Districts in Eastern, Northern, 
North Central, North Western, and Uva Provinces. The first stage of the Project (2018-2021) will cover three Hot Spot 
Areas, whereas the second stage of the project (2020-2022) and third (2022-2024) will cover the balance eight 
districts. However, the exact locations for the specific interventions under the Project have not been identified, and 
the selection of activities will be determined only during implementation.  
 
The project is classified as an Environmental Category B.  It is expected to bring positive environmental and social 
benefits to the project areas through the scale-up of climate-resilient agricultural technologies and farming practices 
that help improve soil health, water-use efficiency and crop products, catchment area treatment to promote more 
efficient use of surface water and more sustainable use of groundwater for agriculture and development of waterbody 
capacity of climate hotspots, and overall improvement in the productivity of small-holder farmers. Components 1 and 
2 may involve physical activities that could have adverse environmental and social impacts if these aspects are not 

 

fully integrated into hot-spot area development plans and negative environmental and social risks are not identified 
and mitigated properly. Likewise, some activities supported under the project, such as small scale market 
infrastructure, construction and rehabilitation of irrigation canals, water storage facilities, etc.,  are likely to cause 
social risks and impacts, including land acquisition, impacts on livelihoods, loss of assets, etc. Although the project 
activities will be confined to rehabilitation of existing infrastructure and support to existing farmlands, some of the 
project districts consists of known physical cultural resources that can be impacted during works carried out under the 
Project. 
 
The promotion of climate smart agriculture systems and related value chains under the project could also lead to 
changes in the application of pesticides for pest and disease control. At present, project-supported climate-smart 
agricultural activities are envisaged to take place on existing farmland, and no expansion or creation of new 
agriculture systems into fragile habitats is foreseen. Likewise, the project will bring improvements to watershed 
protection and promote agricultural practices that are expected to reduce pressure on natural habitats and the 
likelihood of encroachment into sensitive ecosystems. However, some activities may negatively impact natural 
habitats because of the proximity of project activities, such as the construction or upgrading of rural infrastructure. 
The project plans to undertake catchment treatment as part of village-level watershed plans to make them more 
climate resilient and, which may bring positive impacts on natural forests in the upper catchment areas due to 
additional protection measures. Such areas that require additional protection related activities are expected to be 
identified through SESAs.  
 
Some negative impacts to forests are expected during tank rehabilitation work and while the project will primarily 
support the increase in the storage capacity of tanks through removal of excess sedimentation and establishment of 
mechanisms to reduce future sedimentation, some inundation of forests may still be possible, particularly in those 
areas where small tanks have been abandoned and natural forest regeneration has taken place on the tank bed.  
 
 
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area: 
Based on the available information, no potential indirect negative environmental or social impacts are expected under 
the project.The project interventions will spread across 11 hotspot areas where the nature/scope of future activities is 
presently not known. Regardless, the SESA proposed to be carried out during implementation for each hotspot will 
help in identifying any indirect and/or long-term impacts of future activities and mitigating such impacts as part of 
project interventions. 
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts. 
Alternatives to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts can be considered only during implementation once the 
project area and the specific activities are known. In principle however, the EAMF and the RPF include measures that 
need to be adopted in order to avoid or minimize adverse impacts. For instance, a 'negative list' has been prepared 
under the EAMF which among others indicates types of sub-projects that will not be financed under the project (e.g., 
activities that involve significant conversion or degradation of critical natural habitats, activities that would increase 
human-wildlife conflict, construction of large new infrastructure within or directly adjacent (in buffer zones) to 
protected areas, etc). Likewise, to avoid impacts of land acquisition, the RPF indicates that to the extent possible, sub-
project activities will be carried out in the existing footprint of the infrastructure facility, utilize public land or land that 
is voluntarily donated, and only in exceptional basis will there be acquisition of private land under the Project. 
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower 


capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
An Environmental Assessment and Management Framework (EAMF) has been prepared to guide the screening of 
activities for physical investments, technical assistance, project supported-advisory, and policy support interventions 
and resulting implementation from an environmental perspective and mitigation actions to manage their 
environmental impacts. The EAMF defines the screening and decision-making process based on the screening, the 
content, procedures and responsibilities for the preparation and implementation of individual sub-project 
Environmental Assessments (EAs) and Environmental Management Plans (EMPs) to address site-specific risks and 
impacts and subsequent monitoring and reporting requirements. The EAMF also includes sectoral environmental 
management guidelines for the subsectors of agricultural processing, which will be applicable under the matching 
grant program. To ensure impacts to natural habitats are mitigated, the EAMF prescribes proper due diligence 
mechanisms, including relevant preventive and mitigation measures to protect local ecosystems and habitats to be 
included in the respective sub-project EMPs with special attention given to ensure risks and impacts due to human-
elephant conflict are mitigated where such conflicts exist and using successful co-existence models that already have 
been demonstrated within the country. In order to ensure negative impacts to forests are minimized, the EAMF 
includes screening criteria and relevant mitigation measures. In addition, a separate Pest Management Plan (PMP) 
prepared under the Agriculture Modernization Project developed based on Integrated Pest Management (IPM) 
principles has been adopted by this project.  
 
Likewise, the RPF sets out principles and guidelines to identify and assess the potential social impacts and risks, 
prepare mitigation plans as part of sub-project preparation, institutional arrangements and processes to be followed 
for the Project. This includes: (i) principles and procedures for screening and assessing impacts; (ii) the criterion and 
due diligence processes based on risks, including the provisions for entitlements and eligibility criteria; (iii) guidelines 
for preparing time-bound action plans to ensure compliance with WB's OP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement and 
national regulations relating to land acquisition; (iv) institutional arrangements for implementing resettlement action 
plans; (v) guidance for public consultation process and disclosure of safeguard documents; (vi) mechanisms for 
grievance redress, monitoring and evaluation of process and outcomes; and (vii) responsibilities of the GoSL and WB in 
relation to the preparation, implementation and progress review of social safeguards documents for the various CSIAP 
sub-projects.  
 
In addition to the EAMF and the RPF, as part of hot-spot area development, Strategic Environmental and Social 
Assessments (SESAs) will be undertaken to be integrated into the village-level plans. All irrigation infrastructure 
related interventions require a screening to be included in the SESA to verify whether upstream medium to large scale 
dams are present and connected hydrologically and to assess their dam safety status and, if needed, outline follow-up 
actions. If the presence of upstream and hydrologically connected dams is confirmed and these have not been 
rehabilitated or strengthened and have dam safety implications, the project will undertake an inspection and 
evaluation of the safety of the dam, its appurtenances, and its performance history, and a review and evaluation of 
the mandated dam owner’s operation and maintenance procedures. A report will be provided on the review’s 
findings, including recommendations for any remedial work or safety-related measures necessary to upgrade the 
existing dam to an acceptable standard of safety.  Necessary dam safety measures or remedial work will be financed 
under the project. When substantial remedial work is needed, these will be undertaken, including recruitment of a 
competent professional to design and supervise the work, and the Dam Safety Panels established under the 
Department of Irrigation and Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka will provide the guidance and continuous due diligence 
as necessary. As part of SESAs, physical cultural resources will be documented, and the EAMF includes screening 
criteria to ensure sub-projects will not produce any negative impacts to such resources. The EAMF also includes 
procedures to be adopted during a chance find.  
 


In terms of capacity, the Ministry of Agriculture has recently been exposed to world Bank-financed Project while the 
Irrigation Department has two ongoing operations supported by the Bank. In addition, some of the provincial councils 
(e.g., Northern and Eastern) have been involved in World Bank financed operations. However, a comprehensive 
capacity building program for implementation of safeguards instruments prepared under the Project as well as the 
social and environmental management within the sector, will be prepared during implementation. 
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, 
with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
The primary key stakeholders are smallholder farmers, producer organizations, productive alliances, agribusiness 
entrepreneurs, implementing organizations, government departments/units, including technical and managerial staff 
of participating agencies. The project will actively promote youth and women in all key project interventions to ensure 
that they are fully engaged in and also benefit from all project activities.  
 
During the preparation of the safeguards instruments, consultations were held on 18 June 2018 in Anuradhapura and 
on 21 June 2018 in Colombo, and feedback received during these consultations have been included as part of project 
design and minutes of the consultations with details of the participants, have been included as part the RPF. 
Additionally, the EAMF and the RPF also include consultation strategy which among others emphasizes that all 
stakeholders will be consulted in a culturally appropriate manner while preparing site-specific safeguards instruments 
as well as during implementation. The process of consultation will be documented and account taken of the results of 
consultatoins, including any agreed actions resulting from the consultation. The RPF and the EAMF also requires that 
all the social and environmental assessment documentation and site specific safeguards action plans (e.g., EMP, SIMP, 
RAP) will be made available to the public by the PMU through the project website and notices through media (as 
relevant), prior to start of civil works, and or tending of works contract. The EAMF and the RPF have also been 
disclosed in-country as well as through World Bank's external website.

B. Introduction and Context
Country Context

Pakistan posted the GDP growth of 4.2 percent in FY2014/15, below the 5.1 percent target. Private 
investments as share of GDP declined to 9.7 percent, but overall deficit remained 5.3 percent of GDP, 
0.3 percent higher than estimated. While Pakistan continues to score poorly on doing business 
indicators, there are signs of improvement. Growth in FY16 was expected to be moderate at 4.5 
percent, well below the 5.5 percent target. For FY17, the expected growth is 5.2 percent while for 
FY18 it is projected at 5.5 percent.

Sectoral and Institutional Context

Pakistan’s agriculture sector is heavily depends on irrigation - more than 90 percent of production is 
form irrigated lands. However, per capita availability of useable water is decreasing with population 
growth, pollution and inefficient use of water. An estimated 40 percent of water is lost in the unlined 
watercourses due to seepage, spillage, side leakage and evapotranspiration. In Punjab, out of the total 
59,500 watercourses, about 43,700 were improved in various projects and Government’s National 
Program for Improvement of Watercourses (NPIW). Under PIPIPP 5,500 new watercourses are being 
improved leaving about 10,300 that still need improvements.

C. Proposed Development Objective(s)
Original Project Development Objective(s) - ParentPHORGPDO

The project?s main objective is to improve productivity of water use in irrigated agriculture. This will 
be achieved through improved physical delivery efficiency and irrigation practices, crop 
diversification and effective application of inputs that will translate into greater agricultural output per 
unit of water used. The project?s objectives would contribute to increased agricultural production, 
employment and incomes, higher living standards and positive environmental outcomes.

Proposed Project Development Objective(s) - Additional Financing

The project?s main objective is to improve productivity of water use in irrigated agriculture. This will 
be achieved through improved physical delivery efficiency and irrigation practices, crop 
diversification and effective application of inputs that will translate into greater agricultural output per 
unit of water used. The project?s objectives would contribute to increased agricultural production, 
employment and incomes, higher living standards and positive environmental outcomes.

Key Results 

The AF would support: (a) installation of high efficiency irrigation systems; (b) improvement of 
community irrigation systems; (c) introduction of modern technologies and methods in irrigated 
agriculture, assistance in crop diversification and training; and (d) Project management, construction 
supervision, quality control, technical assistance and training.

.

D. Project Description

The AF would provide resources for: (i) component B of the project related to upgrading of the 
Community Irrigation Systems; (ii) a new sub-component C3 is added focusing on post-harvest 
processing, value addition and market linkages; and (iii) make up for loss of resources due to changes 
in exchange rates between SDRs to USD.

W/Cs would be improved using only pre-cast concrete sections (PCPS) with water-tight joints. The 
WUAs/farmers would share costs through providing labor, and the Government of the Punjab 



would provide PCPS and other material needed for watercourse improvement. The AF would 
improve 2,000 W/Cs and irrigation schemes – making the total number of schemes under 
component B 11,000.

PHCOMP

Component Name:
Improved Agriculture Technology/Practices and Monitoring and Evaluation
Comments ( optional)
Changes in this component are based on implementation experience and lessons learnt. These 
changes include: (i) supplementing support under sub-component C1 and C2 for monitoring and 
evaluation and impact assessment of the additional works under the AF; and (ii) adding a new sub-
component to address value addition and market access for farmers adopting efficient irrigation 
technologies.

E. Project location and Salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if 
known)
The AF project will be implemented in Punjab province of Pakistan. Agriculture in Punjab is affected 
by waterlogging and salinity. In central and southern Punjab, rainfall is more sporadic and agriculture 
is entirely irrigation dependent.

II. IMPLEMENTATION
The implementation arrangements under the AF will remain the same as for the Original 
Project. The Director General Agriculture (Water Management) (DG-AWM) will continue to be 
responsible for the implementation of the Project. The Directorate of On-Farm Water 
Management (OFWM) has demonstrated that it has the capacity to implement such programs in 
the Punjab.

III. SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY
Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional)

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 
4.01

Yes The Government prepared an Environmental 
and Social Assessment (ESA) for the original 
project. An Addendum to ESA covering 
revised and up-scaled scope of work has also 
been prepared. The Addendum is cleared and 
disclosed. The key potentially negative 
environmental and social impacts of the 
proposed interventions under the AF project 
include changes in land use pattern 
particularly where barren/fallow land is 
brought under cultivation, contamination of 
soil and water caused by excessive use of 
agro-chemical inputs, salt build up in crop 
root zone, loss of natural vegetation and trees 
for water course improvement, loss of crops 
caused by water course improvement works, 



and reduced ground water recharge caused by 
water course lining.  These potential impacts 
are temporary and reversible in nature and can 
be mitigated with the help of appropriate 
mitigation measures, such as avoiding 
interventions in the environmental hot spots 
and wildlife protected areas when expanding 
the cultivation fields, awareness raising and 
capacity building of farmers for judicious use 
of chemical inputs, occasional flood irrigation 
in fields using high efficiency irrigation 
systems to avoid salt build-up in soil, tree 
plantation to compensate any tree cutting, 
avoiding cropped area while carrying out the 
water course improvement and other 
construction works during the project, and 
limiting the extent of water course lining in 
the sweet groundwater zone to minimize 
negative impacts on groundwater recharge. 
Some of the new activities proposed under AF 
may have additional environmental impacts 
like those related with disposal of waste and 
wastewater from fruit washing bays and 
cleaning platforms, construction related issues 
with small-scale platforms, and disposal of 
discarded fruits, vegetables (generally and 
largely biodegradable material). Occupational 
health and safety may be an additional 
potential environmental impacts for the new 
activities related to post-harvest processing 
centers. The Addendum proposes adequate 
mitigation measures for these issues and after 
the adequate implementation of mitigation 
measures, no residual impacts are forecasted.

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 No The project supports activities only in already 
disturbed environment and no project site is 
located in any natural habitat.

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No The project does not support any activity in 
the forest land.

Pest Management OP 4.09 No The proposed interventions are likely to 
reduce the quantities of agro-chemicals 
particularly the ones that are water soluble.

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 
4.11

No The project activities will be undertaken 
where cultivation is being practiced for 
decades if not longer. Hence presence of any 
physical cultural resources is extremely 
unlikely.  Chance Find procedures are 
nonetheless included in the main ESA.



Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 No There are no indigenous communities in 
project area.

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 No No land acquisition is envisaged for the 
proposed activities.

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 No The project does not include any component, 
which involves construction of new or 
rehabilitation/upgradation or renovation of 
any existing dam.

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50

Yes An exemption to notification was obtained for 
the original project that also applies to the AF.

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 
7.60

No The project is located in the Punjab province, 
which does not have any disputed area as 
defined in the policy.

.

IV. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and 
describe any potential large scale,  significant and/or irreversible impacts:

The project prepared an Environmental and Social Assessment (ESA) report, which suggests 
that the proposed project does not pose any long term or irreversible adverse environmental 
impacts. The key potentially negative environmental and social impacts of the proposed 
interventions under the original project include changes in land use pattern particularly where 
barren/fallow land is brought under cultivation, contamination of soil and water caused by 
excessive use of chemical inputs, salt build up in crop root zone, loss of natural vegetation and 
trees for water course improvement and reduced ground water recharge caused by water 
course lining.  Scope of additional work proposed under Component B does not bring in any 
additional or new environmental impacts other than those which have already been covered in 
the ESA prepared for the original project. New activities proposed under Component C3 may 
have additional environmental impacts like those related with disposal of waste and 
wastewater from fruit/vegetable washing bays and cleaning platforms, construction related 
issues with small-scale washing bays and platforms, and disposal of discarded fruits, 
vegetables (generally and largely biodegradable material). Occupational health and safety 
may be an additional potential environmental impacts for the new activities related to post-
harvest processing centers. These potential impacts are temporary and reversible in nature and 
can be mitigated with the help of appropriate mitigation measures, such as avoiding 
interventions in the environmental hot spots and wildlife protected areas when expanding the 
cultivation fields, awareness raising and capacity building of farmers for judicious use of 
chemical inputs, occasional flood irrigation in fields using high efficiency irrigation systems 
to avoid salt build-up in soil, tree plantation to compensate any tree cutting, avoiding cropped 
area while carrying out the water course improvement and other construction works during 
the project, and limiting the extent of water course lining in the sweet groundwater zone to 
minimize negative impacts on groundwater recharge. The Addendum proposes adequate 
mitigation measures for the issues arising out of the implementation of component C3 and 
after the adequate implementation of proposed mitigation measures, no residual impacts are 
forecasted. Land acquisition will not be required for the project rehabilitation works, which 



will be undertaken within their existing boundaries.  There are no indigenous communities in 
the project areas as defined under World Bank OP 4.10 on Indigenous Peoples. The project 
will support livelihoods through improvements in food harvesting and handling of produce. In 
particular, women may benefit from these interventions through decreased work load in post-
harvest processing. The community water course improvement will benefit agricultural 
communities’ especially small farmers.
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in 
the project area:

Agriculture and irrigation development are key priorities of the Government’s development 
agenda with the aim to improve agricultural productivity, irrigation efficiency and livelihood 
of the people. The long term impacts of the project will contribute to reduction in poverty in 
conjunction with environmental protection.
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse 
impacts.

The ESA report elaborates on various project alternatives including, ‘no project’ option, 
alternative irrigation methods, alternative land-leveling methods, alternative methods of on-
farm water conservation and alternative methods of implementation. Analysis concluded that 
high efficiency irrigation results in reduced need of farm inputs such as fertilizers, pesticides, 
fungicides, and herbicides, as well as reduced vulnerability of crops to pest attacks and 
proliferation of weeds, leading to less use of pesticides and herbicides. In addition, fertigation 
(application of fertilizers or other soil additives through the irrigation system) is done through 
drip and sprinkler, which results in increased effectiveness of fertilizers with reduced 
quantities needed.  Similarly, through high efficiency irrigation systems, chemigation 
(application of pesticides, fungicides, and herbicides) is also done through drip and sprinklers, 
resulting in effective use of chemicals with reduced quantities needed. The overall result of 
high efficiency irrigation system is therefore a much reduced usage of chemical inputs and 
introduction of post-harvest technology under AF will help better achieve the PDO. The only 
comparable alternative for this activity is ‘no project option’.
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.

The original ESA is based on detailed assessment and includes an Environment and Social 
Management Plan (ESMP) for any possible environmental and social impacts under the 
project. The Addendum to the ESA uses the same ESMP with some additions related to the 
proposed activities under Component C3 and proposes preparation of a separate ESMP for 
each post-harvest fruit/vegetable processing facility. These ESMPs will need to be cleared by 
the Bank before these facilities can be established. For establishing these facilities, transparent 
and accessible guidelines on the selection process will be established, and communicated 
widely to all farmers to ensure that the selection process is seen as transparent and fair, and 
possible social conflict is avoided. The ESA Addendum is cleared and disclosed.
The original ESA report presents a well-structured organogram for the implementation 
arrangements of EMP. The Director General Agriculture Water Management (DG-AWM) is 
overall responsible for environmental and social performance of the project in accordance 
with the national and WB requirements. An officer is designated as the Environmental and 
Social Coordinator (ESC) for ensuring effective implementation of ESMP. The ESC 



coordinates with the WMOs at the district level, who have been designated as the district 
environmental and social coordinators (DESCs) at district level. The DESCs supervise and 
coordinate with the WUAs and farmers for the actual implementation of the environmental 
and social guidelines and other ESMP requirements. These institutional arrangements have 
been effective in ESMP implementation of the original project and will be continued for AF 
project.
The Project Implementation and Supervision Consultant (PISC) are responsible for 
implementation of ESMP while M&E Consultants are responsible for monitoring. Production 
and maintenance of all documentation outlined in ESMP is to be done by PISC. The client has 
been successfully implementing the ESMP in the original project and understands fully the 
planning and operational levels of safeguards requirements. While GD-AWM does not have 
an environmental management unit within its operational hierarchy, it continues to implement 
project level implementation of ESMP. The implementation performance of environmental 
safeguards in the original project is satisfactory. Quarterly progress reports are done regularly 
and will continue for the AF. Training is conducted for field staff as outlined in the ESA and 
these will continue for the AF. Monitoring will include both quantitative and qualitative data 
through consultations and feedback from beneficiaries, especially women, and will be 
included in the progress reports.
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on 
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.

Key stakeholders consulted at various levels include: (i) People directly affected by the 
Project and Project beneficiaries (i.e., farmers, WUA members, and other villagers), (ii) Sales 
and service companies, (iii) Officials from the Agriculture Department and agriculture 
research institutes, (iv) Environment Protection Agency of Punjab, (v) Academia, (vi) Donors, 
and (vii) NGOs, international organizations, and other interest groups. Consultations with the 
project stakeholders were carried out during preparation of original ESA. The stakeholders 
have remained involved during the implementation including the project affected people, 
project beneficiaries and other local communities in several districts. Similar consultations 
were carried out for AF project during the preparation of the ESA Addendum and will 
continue during the implementation of the AF.

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 

 
1. Turkey has achieved commendable economic and social development results between 2000 and 2016. GDP per 

capita more than doubled from US$4,200 in 2000 to US$9,505 in 2018. Poverty incidence more than halved over 2002-

2015, and extreme poverty fell even faster from 13 to 3.1 percent. During this period, Turkey urbanized dramatically, 

maintained strong macroeconomic and fiscal policy frameworks, opened to foreign trade and finance, harmonized many 

laws and regulations with European Union (EU) standards, and greatly expanded access to public services. However, 

growing economic vulnerabilities and a challenging external environment have threatened to undermine the 

sustainability of these achievements in the last few years. Turkey experienced a period of economic overheating in late 

2017 and early 2018 and intense market volatility in mid-2018, resulting in contracting economic output, rising 

unemployment (from 10 percent in January 2018 to 14 percent in mid-2019), and high inflation (estimated at around 15 

percent in September 2019). Recent adjustments in the Turkish economy have lessened external vulnerabilities and 

contributed to a more stable Lira. The economy grew in the first half of 2019 and has stabilized in the short-term. 

Nevertheless, stagnating output, high costs of production, and high consumer prices have also led to significant job losses 

and falling real wages. Poorer households have been most impacted because many low-income workers are employed 

in construction and agriculture – the sectors that saw a significant decline in jobs. Large regional disparities continue to 

persist, as rural poverty remains higher than urban poverty1. 

 
Sectoral and Institutional Context 

 
2. Turkey has made progress in relatively decoupling growth from a range of environmental pressures, but rapid 

population growth, urbanization, and industrialization continue to take a heavy toll on the country’s natural resources 

and the environment2. Soil erosion, land degradation, and desertification are among the most severe environmental 

problems in Turkey. Soil erosion, mostly caused by human factors coupled with geographic, topographic, climatic, and 

soil characteristics, is observed at very large scales, affecting about 86% of Turkey’s lands3 and putting most of the country 

under risk of desertification4. Turkey has undertaken considerable afforestation efforts for erosion control, adding a total 

of 2.14 million hectares of forest land since 1973. Despite this increase in forest cover, about 43% of Turkey’s forests 

(9.64 out of 22.34 million hectares) are degraded5, and the deterioration of forest ecosystems and their associated 

ecosystem services and loss of biodiversity continue to be critical issues6. Water quality and scarcity are also of grave 

concern as they affect the availability of water resources for human consumption and economic uses. Deforestation, 

sedimentation, discharges of untreated industrial and domestic effluents into freshwater bodies and the sea, 

insufficiency of wastewater treatment facilities, and diffuse nitrogen and ammonia pollution from agricultural activities, 

all contribute to decreased water quality. By international standards, Turkey is currently considered a water-stressed 

country and, with rapid population growth, is predicted to be water-scarce by 20307. In addition to natural resource 


degradation problems, Turkey is also vulnerable to a range of natural disasters, with floods and landslides being the 

second (25.3 percent) and third (7.4 percent) most frequent and disastrous hazards after earthquakes8. Floods and 

landslides in Turkey are directly linked to topography, land use, land cover, urbanization levels, and rainfall regimes. 

Between 1975 and 2015, 1209 floods were recorded, causing loss of 720 lives and damaging 894,474 hectares of land. 

The amount of average annual property damage caused by floods has reached 300 million Turkish Liras. Hazardous floods 

are mostly observed in the Black Sea, Mediterranean, and Western Anatolia regions9. 

 
3. Climate change is expected to further exacerbate the pressure on the natural resource base of Turkey. The 

country is already experiencing an increase in annual mean temperature and changes in the precipitation regime. A long-

term downward trend in average yearly precipitation is projected for overall Turkey, although the distribution pattern 

varies across locations. The Eastern Black Sea and northeastern parts of the country will likely experience an increase in 

average annual precipitation, while the southern regions will experience a decrease. Projected climate change impacts 

include reduction in surface water availability, more frequent and severe incidences of floods, and more prolonged 

droughts. With a mostly arid and semiarid climate and environment, increased frequency and severity of droughts and 

extreme precipitation events will negatively affect water holding capacity of the upper layers of the soil, further 

exacerbating soil erosion and increasing the risks of flooding and landslides, particularly in terrains with rough 

topography10. More frequent droughts will negatively affect crop yields and threaten food security, while floods and 

landslides will continue to affect the safety and welfare of hundreds of thousands of people. Without accelerated actions, 

the combination of climate-induced hazards, a degrading natural resource base, and water scarcity and quality issues will 

increasingly affect societal wellbeing and act as constraints on growth. Poor rural communities whose livelihoods depend 

on natural resources will be disproportionately affected11, which could lead to an increase in rural-to-urban migration. 

 
4. Recognizing the importance of adapting to the impacts of climate change and protecting the country’s natural 

capital to sustain current gains, Turkey’s Eleventh Development Plan for the 2019-2023 period pays significant 

attention to a sustainable and inclusive growth pathway.  The Plan places “Livable Cities and Sustainable Environment” 

among its five fundamental pillars of development. Priorities and targets embraced under this pillar include reduction of 

environmental pollution, protection of biodiversity, and sustainable management and use of land, forest, water, and 

other natural resources through integrated watershed management. This pillar also includes targets to ensure access to 

healthy drinking water, including appropriate waste water treatment, combat poverty, promote the employability of 

rural labor force, prevent and mitigate disaster risks, and develop climate adaptation capacity and resilience of affected 

communities. The Plan highlights agriculture and forestry as one of the three priority development areas and emphasizes 

the need to bridge regional disparities and increase job opportunities and employment of women and youth12. 

 
5. Natural resource management in Turkey is guided by a multitude of sectoral strategies and plans, however 

integration among them is currently low. The Turkey National Forestry Program (2004 – 2023) has the objective to 

ensure sustainable forest management, ecosystems and biodiversity conservation, and efficient use of forest resources, 

with the participation of stakeholders, including local communities. A special emphasis is placed on the ecosystem 

services provided by forests, including soil conservation, water quality protection, prevention of desertification, erosion, 

and natural disasters, air quality regulation and carbon storage13. The National Strategy and Action Plan to Combat 

Desertification (2015-2023) aims at mitigating against the adverse effects of aridity, desertification, and land degradation 

and balancing conservation with efficient land use objectives14. The National Climate Change Action Plan (2011-2023) 

includes the objectives to increase the amount of carbon sequestered in forests and to reduce deforestation and 

associated GHG emissions from land use and land use change. The National Basin Management Strategy (NBMS) (2014-


2023) provides guidance for the medium and long-term investment programs for the sustainable management of 

Turkey’s 25 river basins15. Under the NBMS, River Basin Management Plans (RBMPs) are now been prepared for each of 

the basins to address the water quality and quantity issues and meet the ecological status for both surface and 

groundwater bodies as per the requirements of related EU water legislation, including the EU Water Framework 

Directive, Flood Directive, Drinking Water Directive, and Urban Waste Water Directive. The NBMS attempts to integrate 

the objectives of several relevant sectoral strategies and plans by promoting an integrated landscape-based ecosystem 

approach at basin or sub-basin scale, through coordinated efforts of related agencies and stakeholders to enhance the 

sustainability, while also improving the productivity of natural resources in Turkey’s river basins. Such integrated 

watershed/sub-basin management approach can address the interrelationships among land use, soil, and water and the 

interlinkage between upstream and downstream areas, and help link natural resources management with socioeconomic 

wellbeing and regional development.16 Nevertheless, the RBMPs (the planning tools under NBMS) that have been 

developed so far are highly water-focused and not sufficiently detailed to be operationalized at the sub-basin level. There 

is also a lack of integration among various basin-related plans (RBMPs, Flood Management Plans, Drought Management 

Plans, Sectoral Water Allocation Plans) and other sectoral plans including land use planning, spatial planning, and 

agricultural development plans. 

 
6. Institutional coordination also poses constraints to the implementation of integrated natural resources 

management (NRM) approaches in Turkey. Institutions directly involved in NRM include the Ministry of Agriculture and 

Forestry and its line agencies such as the General Directorate (DG) of Forestry, DG for Combatting Desertification and 

Erosion, DG of Agricultural Reform, DG of Water Management, and State Hydraulic Works (DSI); the Ministry of 

Environment and Urbanization, the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, the Disaster and Emergency Management 

Presidency under the Ministry of Interior, as well as the Provincial Directorates of these respective ministries, and local 

authorities, among others. The involvement of numerous institutions with often overlapping jurisdictions and 

responsibilities results in duplicities and fragmentation in management efforts, leading to inefficient use of public 

resources. The institutional arrangement for river basin management in Turkey is meant to bring these institutions 

together to coordinate their works, however, it has yet to be effectively implemented in practice.  

 
7. The Eastern Black Sea (EBS) Basin has the 3rd highest poverty rate (20.9%) in Turkey combined with a multitude 

of environmental challenges.17 The EBS Basin has the third-largest annual flow rate, after the Euphrates-Tigris and 

Eastern Mediterranean Basin18 and is home to approximately 2.46 million people19. It has a harsh mountainous 

topography with no extensive plains and the highest peak at 3,937 meters running parallel to shore. EBS has a prevailing 

humid-temperate Black Sea climate with the highest precipitation level in Turkey (averaged above 2500mm annually 

versus the national average of 574 mm)20. A combination of short rivers with rapid descending slopes, an abundance of 

snow and rains, and the highest rainfall level on the slopes facing the sea make EBS highly flood-prone, with flooding 

being the most commonly occurred natural disaster in EBS (39% of the total number of disasters). Climate-induced 

change in precipitation will likely further exacerbate flood risks. Additionally, soil erosion and landslide-caused disasters 

are prevalent in EBS due to topography, morphological structure, lithology, climate characteristics such as heavy 

precipitation, and land use change. The transformation of natural vegetation for hazelnut and tea cultivation since the 

1950s in the region has resulted in the formation and increased frequency of landslides.21 Landslide frequency is higher 

in the elevation range of 0-500 meters due to slope instability connected to the conversion of forest areas into hazelnut 

gardens and road construction.22 Despite the abundance in annual rainfall, EBS is considered water-stressed due to high 

seasonal rainfall variability, severe water pollution from agricultural and livestock activities, industrial and domestic 


     

waste discharges, and insufficient water storage capacity. EBS has four sub-basins, including Ordu-Giresun, Harşit Stream, 

Trabzon, and Rize-Artvin23. 

 
8. The Bolaman Basin, located within the Ordu-Giresun sub-basin of EBS, is an area severely challenged by 

landslides, flooding, and degradation of natural resources affecting the wellbeing and livelihoods of the local 

population. The Bolaman Basin has its distinct geographical boundaries and hydrological structure and covers an area of 

158,886 hectares almost entirely within the Ordu Province. With a population of 255,000, most of its residents live in 

rural areas across 97 villages, 53 of which are forest villages. Over 58 percent of the basin area is agricultural land, of 

which 39 percent is cultivated land, and 19 percent is pasture land. Forest land has been largely converted to hazelnut 

groves over the years and currently only accounts for 28.9 percent of the basin area. Hazelnut is cultivated monoculturally 

up to altitudes of 600-700 meters from the coast and accounts for 98 percent of cultivated lands. Ordu Province is the 

biggest hazelnut producer in Turkey. In 2018, Ordu produced 180,397 tons of hazelnut, accounting for 35 percent of the 

entire hazelnut production in Turkey with a total export value of US$3 billion. Hazelnut is almost the only source of 

income in all villages; the remaining comes from small-scale subsistence farming and livestock activities. Bolaman 

experiences a composite of problems typical for the EBS Basin, including soil erosion, degradation of forest ecosystems, 

surface water pollution, landslides, drought and floods. An estimated 457,411 tons of soil is moved annually due to 

erosion in the basin. Estimated annual point source and non-point source nitrogen and phosphorous pollution recorded 

in 2012 for the entire Ordu-Giresun sub-basin was the highest in EBS (6,866 tons/year and 421 tons/year, respectively)24. 

Drinking water in Bolaman is mostly supplied from surface water, and pollution of over 75 percent of surface water bodies 

seriously threatens the availability of drinking water sources for communities in Ordu. Turbidity problems experienced 

in heavy precipitation events and water level declines during episodes of drought further impede access to healthy 

drinking water. Ordu also experiences natural disasters that have caused the loss of life and properties to local 

communities. Between 1950 and 2011, 368 incidences of landslides, 44 incidences of flooding, and 36 incidences of falling 

rocks occurred in the province25. Landslides and floods due to excessive rainfall in 2016 and 2018 caused substantial 

damage to roads, settlements, bridges and agricultural and forest areas in Ordu.26 Recent landslide events resulted in the 

complete collapse of 15 and substantial damages to 30 houses and a flood in 2018 led to the collapse of a large bridge in 

the Ünye, Fatsa, and Çaybaşı districts. In 2019, a village completely collapsed by landslides in the Aybastı district and 

severe landslides affected the Kabataş district. The road system in the basin is frequently impacted and damaged by these 

disaster events, preventing access to markets and certain isolated settlements. Integrated solutions to the severe and 

multifaceted problems in the Bolaman Basin are urgently needed as this area has become a priority for the Government 

of Turkey (GoT). It also presents an opportunity for piloting innovative elements for integrated approaches to NRM that 

can generate valuable lessons for other basins in Turkey and the region. 

 
9. Turkey is well poised to pursue integrated approaches for the sustainable use of natural resources but lacks 

experience in current cost-effective innovations in NRM such as Nature-Based Solutions. Watershed management has 

evolved significantly since its inception. The first generation of watershed management projects in the 1970s and 1980s 

mostly applied an engineering approach to soil and water management with specific on-site and downstream physical 

outcomes. The investments were costly with limited benefits as the needs of upstream communities and their ownership 

of the interventions were not considered. The second generation of watershed management projects in the 1990s 

departed from this top-down engineering approach to focus more on farming systems and stakeholder participation, in 

order to create synergies between resources conservation and rural poverty reduction.27 In recent years, Nature-based 

Solutions (NBS), including Green Infrastructure (GI) and others, have been promoted as innovative, cost-effective and 

sustainable solutions to a variety of environmental, social, and economic challenges. NBS operationalizes the concept of 


ecosystem services to address specific problems and deliver multiple benefits such as buffering against natural disasters, 

regulating water, sequestrating carbon, and providing resources for sustaining livelihoods and economic activities.28 In 

many cases, combining GI with traditional gray infrastructure can create next generation solutions that can better protect 

communities by tackling the immediately pressing problems while restoring the regulatory functions of ecosystems that 

can enhance the performance, life cycle, and cost-effectiveness of gray infrastructure29. In the case of Turkey, this hybrid 

green-gray solution can prevent capital lock-in as most of the interventions implemented and planned at the basin level 

have been predominantly traditional gray infrastructure, which are highly expensive.30 In addition, previous investment 

operations spread out across large river basins have resulted in moderate visible results for local communities.  

 
Relationship to CPF 

 
10. The proposed project is aligned with the World Bank Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for Turkey for the 

FY18-21 period and with the objectives of Turkey’s 11th Development Plan (2019–2023). The CPF sets out the overall 

objective of supporting Turkey in achieving more sustainable and inclusive development by focusing on growth, inclusion, 

and sustainability dimensions31. The proposed project will contribute to meeting CPF objective 9 (Increased sustainability 

of infrastructure assets and natural capitals) under the sustainability focus area to help Turkey orient its growth toward 

a more resilient and sustainable trajectory. 

 
11. The proposed project will also contribute to meeting Turkey’s sectoral objectives as set out in multiple national 

strategies and plans as well as commitments under global conventions. These include: (i) sustainable development 

objectives under the 11th Development Plan; (ii) voluntary national Land Degradation Neutrality targets for afforestation, 

soil conservation, and rehabilitation of forest lands and pastures per the commitments under the United Nations 

Convention on Combating Desertification and National Strategy and Action Plan to Combat Desertification (2015-2023); 

(iii) water quality and quantity as well as disaster reduction objectives in line with the EU Water Framework Directive, EU 

Flood Directive, Drinking Water Directive, Urban Waste Water Directive, and EU Integrated Environmental Approximation 

Strategy (2007-23); (iv) increased carbon capture and sink capacity of forests in line with the Intended National 

Determined Contribution under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and Turkey Climate Change Strategy 

(2010-2023); (v) climate change adaptation objectives per Turkey’s National Climate Change Adaptation  Strategy and 

Action Plan (2011-2023); and (vi) rural development and income generation for rural communities as targeted in the 

National Rural Development Strategy (2014-2020) and National Strategy for Regional Development (2014-2023). 

 
C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  

 
The project development objective is to strengthen integrated management of natural resources at the landscape level 
and increase access to climate-resilient infrastructure to communities in targeted areas of the Bolaman Basin.

D. Concept Description 

 
14. The proposed project will support the GoT in addressing the multitude of environmental challenges facing the 

Bolaman Basin in the Ordu province, while enhancing the livelihood security and resilience of local communities 

against the risks and impacts of climate-induced landslides, flooding, and drought. The project will adopt an integrated 

landscape management approach at the sub-basin scale (Boloman) to achieve these objectives. This integrated approach 

can help address the interlinked problems in Bolaman and rebuild the resilience of the social-ecological system within 

the sub-basin. Building on GoT and the Bank’s previous experience in watershed management, this project will design a 

participatory planning process to take into account inputs from different stakeholder groups, allowing for the 

coordination and integration of solutions among different government agencies as well as between government and local 

stakeholders. Such participatory planning approach will contribute to bridging various stakeholders within the NRM 

sphere and improving institutional coordination. The project will also deploy integrated green and gray infrastructure 

solutions as both short-term and long-term responses to mitigate the risks of landslides, floods, and drought, and 

enhance climate resilience of the local populations and ecosystems. NBS in combination with sustainable and climate-

smart agricultural practices will be designed based on sound technical, social, and financial analysis to achieve synergies 

between resources conservation and livelihood enhancement and ensure local stakeholders’ ownership and thus, the 

sustainability of project interventions.  

 
15. The integrated NRM approach of the project will generate valuable lessons and innovative elements that can 

be applied to other basins with similar problems in Turkey and in other countries. To demonstrate and promote an 

integrated landscape approach to NRM, the project will also include a technical assistance and capacity building sub-

component that will develop and employ planning tools at the landscape level to optimize the synergies and integration 

of interventions across the sub-basin and establish associated institutional structures.  

 
16. Theory of Change and Project design. The central problem statement the Project tries to address is that the 

degradation of natural resources and unsustainable land use, coupled with climate change, and the lack of appropriate 

infrastructures for landslide and flooding control, water and sanitation, and mobility are affecting the well-being and 

livelihoods of the local population in the Ordu province. The proposed operation will address these issues through six 

groups of interventions: (i) strengthening of institutional capacity for INRM; (ii) restoration of ecosystem functions and 

services; (iii) promotion of sustainable land use practices and diversification of rural livelihoods; (iv) construction of 

resilient flood and sedimentation control structures; (v) construction of resilient water and sanitation facilities; and (vi) 

climate and disaster-proofing of rural road network. These groups of activities, organized under three interlinked 

components, are expected to strengthen integrated management of natural resources at the landscape level and increase 

access to climate-resilient infrastructure for flood and landslide control, water and sanitation services, and mobility for 

communities under the project lifetime. In the long run, these intermediate outcomes will help reduce the vulnerability 

to natural disasters and climate change impacts and enhance their well-being and livelihoods of the population in the 

Ordu Province and other vulnerable areas. The three project components are described below along with a menu of 

activities that have been pre-identified at concept stage. The detailed project activities will be refined during preparation 

through the development of a feasibility study and technical assistance to identify the right mix of green and gray 

infrastructure in consultation with local stakeholders. 

 

 
 
17. Component 1: Green and sustainable rural development (~US100 million). The objective of this component is to 

restore and maintain the health, function, and productivity of critical ecosystems and promote sustainable land uses 

within the watershed to improve the sustainability of the natural resource base, enhance the livelihood security of local 

communities, and build resilience against climate-induced hazards. Investments will include a variety of green 

infrastructure measures, sustainable and climate-smart agricultural practices, and livelihoods diversification 

implemented by the General Directorate of Forestry (OGM) and the General Directorate of Agricultural Reform (TRGM) 

through their regional and provincial units. Forests play a key role in protecting soil cover and regulating water. Green 

infrastructure can improve the resilience and strengthen the functions of ecosystems and produce long-term climate 

adaptation and mitigation co-benefits such as soil, water and sediment retention, buffering extreme flood events, and 

reducing CO2 emissions. Green infrastructure can also provide habitats to enhance biodiversity and provide economic 

benefits through tourism and circular economy related activities. Increasing forest cover and improving forest health can 

help prevent soil erosion and landslides and reduce the impacts of floods. Green infrastructure will be designed in 

conjunction with gray infrastructure to optimize the functionality, cost-effectiveness, and resilience of the integrated 

natural and built system. Income generation and livelihood diversification for the rural poor enhance their livelihood 

security and welfare while reducing the pressure on the forest ecosystems upon which these communities traditionally 

depend. This will also contribute to reversing the current trend of outward migration of the local population. 

 

18. Sub-component 1.1: Green infrastructure and rural livelihoods. This subcomponent will be implemented by OGM 

and aim at restoring and sustainably managing ecosystems that provide resources for income generation to local 

communities and critical services for soil retention and water regulation that contribute to buffering against landslides 

and floods and regulating the flow and quality of water. The menu of activities under this sub-component will include: (i) 

afforestation and reforestation; (ii) erosion and sedimentation control works; (iii) upstream natural water retention and 

storage works; (iv) restoration of riparian ecosystems and stream corridors; (v) rehabilitation and climate-smart pasture 

management; (vi) maintenance and sustainable management of secondary forests; (vii) income generation and livelihood 

diversification activities for poor forest communities, such as bee-keeping, non-timber forest products, and ecotourism. 

 

19. Sub-Component 1.2: Sustainable agriculture and climate-resilient value chains. This sub-component will be 

implemented by TRGM with the aim to promote sustainable and climate-smart agricultural practices and associated 

climate-resilient agri-food value chains. The menu of activities under this sub-component will include: i) sustainable and 

climate-smart agricultural production practices such as terracing for hazelnut gardens to protect topsoil layer, micro-

dosing to reduce the application pesticides and fertilizers, agroforestry, and rainwater harvesting to manage soils and 

water sustainably; ii) diversification of agricultural production (kiwi, persimmon, mushroom, truffles vegetables) to 

reduce land areas used for hazelnut cultivation; iii) improvement of livestock productivity to reduce environmental and 

natural resources footprint; iv) climate resilient and energy-efficient agri-food value chains to enhance market access for 

local farmers; and v) branding and marketing of sustainably produced agricultural products. 

 

20. Component 2: Climate resilient gray infrastructure (~US$ 185 million). The objective of this component is to 

increase access to climate-resilient infrastructure systems for protection against climate-related disasters such as 

landslides and floods, and for provision of drinking water supply, sanitation, and mobility for local communities. Although 

the Bolaman Basin is an area with relatively high annual rainfall, the lack of access to drinking water is a major problem 

in the cities and small villages within the basin due to the increase in population (particularly during the tourist season), 

seasonal changes in precipitation, polluted surface and groundwater sources, and turbidity problems in heavy 

precipitation and flooding events. Currently, Bolaman has a population of approximately 255,000 people, and the 

required drinking water need is 600 lt/s. By 2070, the population in the basin is projected to be roughly 550,000 people, 

with drinking water needs expected to rise to 1300 lt/s. Adequate infrastructures to meet drinking water needs and 

protect surface water and groundwater resources from domestic and industrial pollution are much needed. Drinking 

water sources are further threatened as wastewater from domestic and industrial sources are mostly discharged directly 

into the natural environment without any treatment due to a lack of wastewater treatment facilities, which could also 




treat water for reuse for agricultural purposes. The high precipitation levels in the region make it easier for bacteria, 

parasites, and harmful chemicals from untreated discharges to reach creeks, lakes, and rivers network. Landslides and 

floods that frequently occur in Bolaman are of a disastrous nature, causing the loss of life, property, transport and other 

infrastructure. All of these problems are threatening the wellbeing of the local population and requiring immediate 

solutions that can be readily met through “no-regret” gray infrastructure measures. The design of these infrastructure 

systems will integrate green infrastructure into their plans to deliver more cost-effective and resilient services and extend 

their lifespan. The design will also include appropriate measures to withhold the impacts of climate change. This 

component will be implemented by State Hydraulic Works (DSI) and the General Directorate of Highways (KGM), in close 

coordination with the Ordu Metropolitan Municipality General Directorate of Water and Sewerage Administration (OSKI). 

The scope and specific locations for some of these investments have already been pre-identified by participating 

institutions and will be assessed during preparation through a feasibility study. 

 

21. Sub-component 2.1: Flooding, landslide, and sedimentation control works. This subcomponent will be 

implemented by DSI. The menu of investments considered includes: (i) multipurpose reservoirs for effective use and 

regulation of water resources in the basin; (ii) flood control structures, precipitation levees, and sediment control 

structures; and (iii) disaster emergency maintenance of existing infrastructures and repair works. 

 

22. Sub-component 2.2: Drinking water and wastewater treatment works. This subcomponent will also be 

implemented by DSI. The menu of investments considered includes: (i) drinking water infrastructure systems 

rehabilitation and development (including treatment plants and distribution networks); and (ii) wastewater 

infrastructure systems rehabilitation and development (including wastewater treatment plants and sewage networks). 

The design of these systems will include energy-efficient measures and measures to minimize non-revenue water loss 

and promote water reuse where possible. 

 

23. Sub-component 2.3: Climate-resilient rural road system. This sub-component will be implemented by KGM and 

will invest in measures such as drainage and walls to climate and disaster-proof rural road segments that are frequently 

and heavily damaged by landslides, floods, and falling rocks, with the aim to provide safe access and mobility to local 

communities and markets. 

 

24. Component 3: Institutional coordination, project management and sustainability (~US$15 million). The 

objective of this component is to strengthen the capacities and coordination among participating institutions, to ensure 

not only effective and efficient project implementation, but also to support the institutional structures and processes 

that need to be established in a sustainable way to support integrated NRM planning and management in both the project 

area and elsewhere. Implementation of this component will be the responsibility of OGM and will include the following 

two sub-components: 

 

25. Sub-component 3.1: Institutional coordination and sustainability. Activities under this component will include: 

(i) technical assistance for developing an integrated NRM model, which will include planning tools at the landscape level 

that can be replicated in other basins with similar problems in Turkey; (ii) strengthening of institutional coordination and 

capacity building to establish institutional structures for integrated NRM to support the replicability and sustainability of 

the approach implemented by the project. 

 

26. Sub-component 3.2: Project management, environment and social aspects, monitoring and evaluation. 

Activities under this component will include: (i) project management support, including strengthening technical, 

fiduciary, environment and social capacities of participating institutions; (ii) support for environmental and social 

management aspects, including grievance redress, citizen engagement and communications; and (iii) monitoring and 

evaluation.  

 

27. Climate change. The project is designed to take into account Turkey’s climate change vulnerability context. In 

particular, climate change is expected to result in more frequent and severe incidences of floods, more prolonged arid 

seasons, and a reduction in surface water availability across the country. Climate change will also further exacerbate soil 

erosion and increase the risks of landslides in vulnerable locations. The Bolaman Basin is an area already prone to soil 

erosion, landslides, and floods due to its mountainous topography with steep slopes, morphological structure, lithology, 

and heavy precipitation. Climate change will further exacerbate these problems. The availability of drinking water during 

dry months will also be worsened due to more prolonged dry seasons and drought periods. The proposed project is 

designed to address these problems and enhance the resilience of local communities in the project area against the risks 

and impacts of climate change and climate-related hazards. The project will do so by implementing integrated green-gray 

infrastructure solutions for mitigating against landslides and floods, rehabilitating rural road system to be climate and 

disaster-resilient, and promoting climate-smart agricultural practices to enhance the livelihood security of the local 

population. Thus, activities under sub-component 1.1., 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 will generate significant adaptation co-benefits. 

In addition, support for agricultural value chains under sub-component 1.2 and drinking water and wastewater treatment 

systems under sub-component 2.2 will include energy-efficient measures in their design and will generate mitigation co-

benefits. GHG accounting for applicable investments will be calculated using Bank approved methodologies in the 

subsequent stage of project preparation. 

 

28. Gender. The environmental and social impact assessment of the project will include a gender analysis of the 

conditions, needs, and aspirations of women and men living within the Bolaman Basin. The gender analysis will be 

conducted during project preparation to identify relevant gender gaps concerning rural livelihood, access to 

infrastructure (drinking water, sanitation, irrigation), and access to agricultural investments and services. The gender 

analysis will also help to define relevant actions and indicators to reduce identified gender gaps. A gender action plan will 

be developed for the project to guide the mainstreaming of efforts for equitable distribution of project benefits between 

men and women during and beyond implementation. 

 

29. Citizen Engagement. The project will establish effective participation of stakeholders through extensive Citizen 

Engagement activities at local and national levels during preparation and implementation. The project will explore 

extensive and meaningful stakeholder consultations through focus groups and surveys, and employ monitoring 

mechanisms such as satisfaction surveys, grievance redressal (GRM) and multi-stakeholder forums. Priority needs in local 

communities particularly among marginalized/vulnerable groups will be identified through participatory mechanisms 

under components 1 and 2, which will inform project design and implementation to ensure equitable distribution of 

project benefits. Under component 3, the project will support capacity building for government officials and community 

leaders on citizen engagement and efficient response to beneficiary/citizen needs. A detailed citizen engagement 

strategy that highlights mechanisms and actions for enhancing multi-stakeholder dialogue and inclusion throughout the 

project cycle will be designed. An indicator in citizen engagement will be included in the project’s Results Framework.

I. Introduction and Context
Country Context
China's rapid urbanization over the past three decades has facilitated impressive economic and 
social gains. The country became the second largest economy in the world in 2010, with over half of 
its population now living in cities. About 500 million people have been pulled out of poverty in the 
process. Further transition is projected to add another 300 million to China's urban population by 
2030 and continue boosting the economic growth. Unfortunately, China's economic gains came at a 
significant cost to its environment, with serious implications on health and quality of life, as 
environmental depletion and degradation were overlooked during China's impressive economic 
growth period. The cost of environmental degradation and resource depletion in China is estimated 


to approach 10 percent of GDP, of which water pollution accounts for 2.1 percent, based on China 
2030 Study estimates. The Government of China has recognized that it cannot continue on this road 
and has put in place plans to ensure the environmental sustainability of its economic development 
pathways.

Sectoral and Institutional Context
The Chinese water sector suffers from both water quantity and quality challenges. In terms of water 
quantity, with 20 percent of the world's population but only 7 percent of its freshwater, water 
scarcity is a major problem for sustainable urban development in China. Moreover, there is also a 
strong disparity in spatial distribution of its water resources, as only 19 percent of China's water 
resources are available to 40 percent of the population in the north, where most of the major grain 
production is located, and in the west. In terms of water quality, due to environmentally 
unsustainable development trajectory pursued over the last three decades, a significant portion of 
China's freshwater sources are polluted. According to 2010 data, about 40 percent of rivers in China 
were seriously polluted and unfit for drinking water. Similarly, the groundwater quality in more 
than half of 200 cities surveyed was classified as 'bad' (in 40.3 percent of cities) or 'extremely 
bad' (14.7 percent). Similar figures are reported for the quality of other water bodies in the country, 
including lakes. 
 
Poyang Lake is the largest freshwater lake in China with a maximum surface area reaching 5,050 
km2 and a storage capacity - 30 billion m3. The basin area of the lake is about 162,200 km2 
covering over 97 percent of the land area of Jiangxi Province. The lake plays many vital functions, 
such as hydro-morphologic, environmental, social, cultural and economic; the livelihood of more 
than 40 million people is closely linked to the water and environment of Poyang Lake. Poyang Lake 
connects to Yangtze River in the middle reach at Hukou, Jiujiang County. The dynamics of the lake 
water movement is governed by both the stages of the Yangtze River and the discharges from its 
five major tributaries (Gan, Xin, Fu, Rao and Xin Rivers). While the annual water level in the 
Poyang Lake has remained stable in the recent years, the area of the lake fluctuates dramatically 
between the wet and dry seasons. In normal years, the average lake area is about 3,200 km2. The 
fluctuations are also affected by severe climate events, e.g., in early 2002, due to serious drought, 
the area of the lake reached a low of 200 km2.   
  
Poyang Lake is also a wetland of national and global importance, which provides a key habitat for 
half a million migratory birds. It is a house for over 95% of world's white crane, 60% of world??s 
white-napped cranes, 55% of world's hooded crane, 60% of world's white storks, and 96% of 
world's swan goose population. Poyang Lake is also a species gene pool with 156 kinds of aquatic 
plants, 136 planktons, 230 kinds of benthic animals, 58 kinds of fishes, 89 kinds of water birds, etc. 
It also plays a significant role in the seasonal flow regulation of the Yangtze River. The average 
amount of lake water entering the Yangtze River is about 150 billion m3, amounting to 15.6% of the 
mean annual runoff of the river.  
 
The water quality of the Lake has been comparatively good (with 83% falling under Class I ~ III, 
13% under Class IV, and 4% under Class V ). However, research results of the World Bank 
supported TCC5 project and the available monitoring data of Ministry of Environmental Protection 
show a concerning trend of water quality deterioration, with chemical oxygen demand (COD) and 
ammonia-nitrogen (NH3-N) gradually increasing and dissolved oxygen (DO) gradually decreasing. 
The existing data on COD discharge collected by the local governments in the lake basin show that 
domestic wastewater (about 60%) and solid waste disposal (about 30%) produce the major water 

pollution. While industrial pollution remains an issue, discharges from industries are gradually 
decreasing. Site visit also found uncontrolled solid waste disposal and insufficient treatment, and 
improper fish feeding and improper habit of farm land fertilizing also lead to severe water pollution. 
By provincial environmental statistics, only 79% of domestic wastewater is treated in urban areas of 
Jiangxi province, which is much lower than the national average of 85%. Similarly, solid waste 
collection and treatment rate in the province is 69% compared to the national average of 80%.   
 
Conclusions from recent studies and discussions with Provincial governments identify the following 
key causes for increase of pollution levels in the waterbodies feeding into Poyang Lake: (a) lack of 
basin wide integrated water/environment management; (b) weak water quality and pollution source 
pollution monitoring and disclosure system; (c) lack of public awareness and incentives in the 
communities on environmental protection; (d) weak enforcement of regulations related to disposal 
of untreated industrial and domestic wastewater directly into water bodies; (e) lack of investment in 
infrastructure for wastewater collection and treatment systems in urban and rural areas as well as for 
solid waste management in the small cities and towns and rural areas; and (f) lack of use of good 
practices on proper domestic solid waste disposal and agriculture practices. 
 
Government of China and Jiangxi Provincial government recognize the needs to protect the Lake. 
Series of measures have been triggered at national, provincial, and county levels to protect the value 
the Poyang Lake as a unique resource and a national heritage, and to control the lake's pollution and 
to restore the vital water quality and its associa ted functions. The Government of China issued the 
Poyang Lake Ecological Economic Zone Development Plan (PLEDP) in 2009 focusing on 
ecological development of Poyang Lake. Under the PLEDP, there is an implementation plan and 18 
specific sector plans, including water environment management, water resources, five river 
management plan, etc. In 2014, Jiangxi government also issued a plan for establishment of 
ecological and civilization demonstration areas, stating actions and targets for industrial, domestic 
wastewater and solid waste management. Based on the plan, by 2020, COD would be decreased by 
5% compared to the 2015 baseline, wastewater treatment ratio would reach 90% and urban solid 
waste treatment ratio - 85%. The PLEDP together with other relevant sector plans foresee 
significant increase in size of population and economic activity by 2020, with the focus on tourism 
industry. This, together with unresolved improvements in infrastructure, is expected to result in big 
pressure on water quality in the lake basin. 
 
Following the series government plans, the government of Jiangxi has been conducting six major 
ecological environment protection group projects: (a) Poyang Lake wetland and biodiversity 
protection projects; (b) Poyang Lake-rim green belt projects; (c) pollution prevention and control 
projects including wastewater, solid waste and non-point agricultural pollution control; (d) blue sky 
action demonstration projects; (e) circular economy, energy conservation, and emission reduction 
projects; and (f) ecological cultural projects. 
 
In 2013, the World Bank approved the Jiangxi Poyang Lake Basin and Ecological Economic Zone 
Small Town Development Project with the objective to improve key public services in participating 
small towns of Jiangxi Province through improvements to priority infrastructure. Though overall 
project implementation has been satisfactory, there are a number of challenges including the rapid 
urbanization rendering some of the sub-projects irrelevant/unviable, capacity constraints and issues 
related to O&M for wetland, solid waste and wastewater facilities. The proposed project would 
expand the coverage to include seven additional counties, particularly focusing on water 
environment management and solid waste management infrastructure while taking into account 

lessons from the Small Town Development Project and incorporating in its design best international 
practices.  
 
Note : Chinese surface water quality standards: Class I is good quality water which with simple 
purification is drinkable (DO>7.5mg/l; COD<15; BOD5<3; NH3-N<0.15; P<0.02); Class II is good 
quality water which is slightly contaminated, drinkable after normal purification (DO>6mg/l; 
COD<15; BOD5<3; NH3-N<0.5; P<0.1); Class III contaminated water which could be drinkable 
after treatment (DO>5mg/l; COD<20; BOD5<4; NH3-N<1; P<0.2); Class IV water is not drinkable 
(DO>3mg/l; COD<30; BOD5<6; NH3-N<1.5; P<0.3); and Class V is bad quality water (DO>2mg/
l; COD<40; BOD5<10; NH3-N<2; P<0.4).

Relationship to CAS
The project is aligned with the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for 2013-2016, specifically the 
objectives set under focus area I --"Supporting greener growth", including Enhancing Urban 
Environmental Services; Promoting Sustainable Agriculture Practices; and Demonstrating 
Sustainable Natural Resource Management. The project design is in line with the national strategic 
development plan of China, as envisioned in the Poyang Lake Ecological Economic Zone 
Development Plan (2009) and Jiangxi Province implementation plan for establishment of ecological 
and civilization demonstration areas (2014). The project is also in line with 12th Five-year Plans 
and draft 13th Five-year plan at Jiangxi provincial and county levels. 
  
The project is expected to contribute to both China??s national strategy on water security agenda 
and to the World Bank Group twin goals of ending extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity. 
Water security has become a high priority at highest for decision makers at all levels (central and 
local government). The strategy focuses on applying systematic treatment and combination of 
structural and non-structural measures in water sector to promote ecological safety, economic 
security and the safety of human health and lives. The project would contribute to, through 
integrated and participatory approaches, sustainable water/environment management, improvement 
of ecological condition, promotion of social and economic environment of Poyang Lake Basin, as 
one of the key areas of Chinese water system. 
 
For the contribution to the twin goals, as the poor are known to live relatively closer to degraded 
and polluted areas, and have less access to water and solid waste disposal infrastructure, they are 
expected to directly benefit from the project. The project will aim at addressing specific challenges 
that the poor, vulnerable and women face, as identified through social assessment. The project is 
also expected to boost shared prosperity, as improved water quality and local living conditions will 
likely result in such benefits as increase in land value, access to income earning opportunities etc.     
 
To achieve maximum impact and to address the higher strategic objectives indicated above, the 
project will incorporate an "integrated" approach in the design of the activities in selected counties, 
and focus on enhancement of ecological and institutional sustainability of water/environment and 
strengthening of domestic wastewater and solid waste management system. This will involve 
participation of communities during project preparation and implementation as well as in designing 
long-term operation & maintenance mechanisms to ensure sustainability of the investments. 
Ultimately, successful implementation of the project will help to facilitate the improvement and 
restoration of water quality and ecological environment of the Poyang Lake basin. It would also 
contribute towards the enhancement of water regime in the Yangtze River. 
 

Note :   "Integrated approach" refers to a mechanism whereby structural and non-structural 
measures are fully utilized, as well as whereby management of environmental protection is done in 
a collaborative and coordinated way throughout the project cycle involving all stakeholders (from 
different sectors and disciplines) and based on consensus building to ensure sustainability.

II. Proposed Development Objective(s)
Proposed Development Objective(s) (From PCN)
The project development objective is to reduce the pollutant discharge into key selected waterways 
in the Poyang Lake basin and to improve management of water environment.

Key Results (From PCN)

Guidelines . 
 
Note :   The guidelines broadly include elements such as citizen participatory engagement and 
institutional capacity to undertake regular water monitoring, reporting and enforcement.

III. Preliminary Description
Concept Description
a. Overview.  
 
The Jiangxi Provincial Government proposes to utilize the World Bank loan in managing the water 
environment in the key towns of Poyang Lake Basin. Seven counties - Duchang, Poyang, Yugan, 
Jishui, Fengxin, Jingan, Shangli, have been selected for project planning and implementation; total 
population of the seven counties are about 5 million. These seven counties represent a mixed pattern 
of geographic distribution across the basin: three sites are in close proximity to the main Lake, one 
site along the mid-stream of a main river draining into the Lake, two sites adjacent to the tributary 
streams of a main river, and one site at the remotest distance from the Lake. The water quality of 
Poyang Lake is closely associated with the quality and environment of the water and land bodies in 
these contributing catchments, and vice versa.  
 
The project is designed to integrate different ways of environmental protection to improve the water 
quality of Poyang Lake basin, including by means of wastewater treatment and solid waste 
management, as well non-structural measures. As such, the project will focus not only on 
engineering aspects but also on enhancing institutional mechanisms, improving operation and 
maintenance (O&M) and monitoring systems to help the selected counties in Jiangxi Province to 
enhance water environmental services, including wastewater collection and treatment systems, 
urban storm water management, river and lake environment restoration, solid waste collection and 
transportation system, and participatory integrated environment management system.  
 
b. Proposed Project components.  
 


The proposed project activities consist of four main components as below:  
 
Component 1: Strengthening Institutional Capacity for Managing Water Environment in Poyang 
Lake Basin (US$15 million): This component will finance capacity building and awareness raising 
activities to improve participatory wastewater and solid waste management, enforcement of 
environmental regulations and creating pre-conditions for sustainability of project results. The 
component will be structured in two key sub-components: (a) institutional capacity building and 
enforcement and (b) sustainable Poyang Lake basin management.  
 
Sub-component 1.1: Institutional Capacity Building and Enforcement (USD11 million): This sub-
component will finance activities related to: (a) strengthening of the current integrated Poyang Lake 
Basin management institutional architecture (River manager as leader of the party - River 
implementer as the mayor of the county - high level leading group for strategic orientation and 
guidance, and Poyang Lake water/environment financial and investment mechanism study; (b) 
strengthen Basin-wide water/environment management planning: (i) support an integrated 
vulnerability and sensitivity assessment of Poyang Lake (water quality improvement and protection- 
water quantity control - land uses change -biodiversity conservation- urbanization and demographic 
changes- tourism impact and industrialization-basin pollution, and providing comments on 
integrated action plan leading to series of projects with implementation sequencing and synergies in 
line with the long-term commitment) along with resilience and adaptation measures; (ii) promotion 
of integrated basin plans for the five tributaries of the Poyang Lake; (c) strengthening knowledge 
sharing of integrated lake management and establish Lake management advisory platform - with the 
continuous pressure on water resources, the lakes under environmental stress are evidenced across 
China; and (d) strengthening the water/environment monitoring system through upgrade/newly 
installation of water/environment monitoring facilities, enhancement of the integrated monitoring 
information system, early warning system, real-time data disclosure etc. 
 
Sub-component 1.2: Sustainable Poyang Lake Basin Management (USD4 million): This sub-
component will finance activities related to enhancing conditions for lake basin environmental 
management sustainability, including: (a) enhancement of citizen participation and information 
disclosure - translating the high level ownership of the Poyang protection to grassroots level could 
contribute to the rapid and broader success of the Poyang Lake conservation. Building on the 
institutional structure and ecological compensation mechanism, the citizen participation could 
involve labor corporations (fishermen, farmers, factory workers and industries etc.) in having a 
voice in Poyang Lake protection; and (b) ensuring soundness of infrastructure design and its O&M 
sustainabilityÂ¡Âª the project will aim to increment the quality of innovation and appropriate 
technology with the economics of their financing for sustainable operation and maintenance 
implementation; and strengthening of incentive mechanisms, i.e., the compensation scheme for 
ecological protection of the Poyang Lake that could be further strengthened building on proven 
incentive mechanisms; 
 
Component 2: Improvement of Lake and River Environmental Restoration and Enhancement of 
Domestic Wastewater Management System (US$ 140 million). This component will finance 
activities related to protection and restoration of the water environment of selected rural and urban 
water environments in Poyang Lake basin through collection and treatment of urban and rural 
wastewater; collection and safe disposal of stormwater from both rural and urban watersheds; and 
implementation of integrated engineering and biological as well as Low Impact Development (LID) 
interventions in selected rural and urban waterways.  The aim of the component is to demonstrate an 


Integrated water
shed management approach by focusing on key areas for protection, improving 
water quality and environmental protection caused by the municipal wastewater and aquaculture 
sources, and establishing ecological pollution-control zones along the course of pollutant movement.
 
Sub-component 2.1: Improvement of Lake and River Environmental Restoration (USD66 million): 
This sub-component will finance implementation of integrated engineering and biological 
mitigation measures and Low Impact Development (LID) in selected small lakes, rivers, and 
catchments in Poyang Lake basin. This will include restoration of water environment in Zhuhu Lake 
in Poyang county, Pipa Lake (river) in Yugan county, and ecological restoration of stream corridor 
of Zoujiazui River in Duchang county. Key activities will include construction of stormwater 
collection and diversion systems from upland watersheds, rural wastewater treatment facilities, 
distributed wastewater collection along lake banks, introduction of good aquaculture practices (for 
fishing farming and pearl culture) and water environment monitoring system.  
 
Sub-component 2.2: Enhancement of Domestic Wastewater Management System (USD74 million): 
This sub-component will finance rehabilitation and expansion of urban wastewater collection and 
treatment systems to improve capacity of wastewater collection and treatment of selected counties. 
Main project activities include: construction of wastewater collection networks (including 
household connections); and construction and/or rehabilitation of wastewater treatment plants in 
Duchang, Jiang'an, and Jishui counties.  
 
Component 3: Construction of solid waste collection and transportation system (USD75 million): 
This component is to improve solid waste collection and transportation system in rural and urban 
areas to reduce solid waste disposal to river system of Poyang Lak Basin. This component will 
finance setting up solid waste separation system, construction of solid waste collection stations and 
transportation stations, and establishment of sustainable solid waste collection and transportation 
system, and establishment of monitoring and management systems in Shangli, Duchang, Poyang, 
Yugan, and Jing'an Counties. 
 
Component 4: Project Implementation Support (USD15 million). This component is to support the 
effective and efficient implementation of the project activities. This component will finance project 
management, project implementation supervision, project social, resettlement and environmental 
monitoring, domestic and international training and study tours, and relevant project management 
equipment and facilities. Main project activities will include procurement of office equipment, 
domestic and international training and study tours, procurement of project implementation 
supervisors, procurement of social and resettlement and environmental monitoring services, etc. 
 
d. Gender. 
 
There is strong evidence that gender inequalities contribute to poverty and reduce human well-
being, and that gender issues are an important dimension of the fight against poverty. In water 
supply operations specifically, there has long been an understanding of importance of incorporating 
a gender perspective, because women and girls are most often the primary users, providers and 
managers of water in their households and are the guardians of household hygiene. Limited access 
to water and poor water quality have direct impact on household welfare and health. If a water 
system falls into disrepair, women are the ones forced to travel long distances over many hours to 
meet their families' water needs. Therefore, women and girls benefit most when services are 
improved. Given women's household roles and responsibilities, they are also more likely to impact 


decisions related to ways to collect and dispose the domestic waste. Finally, women can greatly 
contribute to oversight of a well-functioning community enforcement of environmental reg  ulations 
and also such aspects as decisions related to water and solid waste collection fee levels.  
 
Worldwide good performance on gender mainstreaming in projects requires: (a) carrying out a 
gender analysis as part of the project's social assessment; (b) introducing relevant design elements; 
and (c) tracking project performance through the inclusion of gender disaggregated indicators. The 
project will conduct a standalone social assessment, in which a close attention to gender aspects will 
be paid. This will include investigating on and consulting with female beneficiaries in the project 
areas in order to clearly identify their needs and concerns, as well as possible project impacts, and 
explore both mitigation measures of such impacts and opportunities for women targeted activities to 
achieve project objectives. The project design will particularly emphasize female participation in 
project activities, capacity building and M&E activities. Specific indicator(s) related to women's 
participation will be included in the Results Framework and will be closely monitored during 
project implementation. 
 
e. Lessons learned from Jiangxi Poyang Lake Basin and Ecological Economic Zone Small 
Town Project 
 
There are valuable lessons of Jiangxi Poyang Lake Basin and Ecological Zone Small Town Project 
implementation that will be taken into account during further design of the proposed project. The 
on-going project faces challenges in terms of institutional capacity and inter-departmental 
coordination, issue that is also observed in other provinces in China. Collaboration in controlling 
and reducing substances at their source is the most effective way of keeping pollutants out of the 
lake. This requires clarity of responsibilities of each authority, as well as full collaboration to meet 
the joint objective. While industrial pollution control is under the responsibility of provincial 
Environmental Protection Department (EPD), agricultural land and aquaculture pollution control is 
managed by the provincial Agriculture Department (AD).   
 
To address these problems, it is critical that county Government maintains ownership of the 
proposed sub-projects, even with the change of the county leadership to ensure continued focus on 
initially agreed project activities and development objectives. Similarly, continuity and retention of 
project staff at the county level (including PMOs, PLGs and Expert Groups) is important to ensure 
good capacity developed under the project is maintained. Finally, the project will also raise 
awareness among communities and farmers.  
 
Equally important is to considerably strengthen institutional coordination mechanisms, not just for 
project purposes, but also for future management of the Lake. It would be important to assign a 
function of responsibility to review development proposals in the basin with a view on their 
implications on the Lake water quality to one of the institutions that is currently managing Poyang 
Lake, or to establish a Poyang Lake Management Commission. The institution would also be 
responsible to spearhead the improvement/ restoration of the Lake water quality over the long run. 
This entity could include representatives of relevant provincial and county governments, as well as 
concerned citizens and academic or research agencies.  
 
f. Global Lessons Learned and World Bank's Value Added 
 
World Bank participation has the added benefit of introducing and replicating, where possible, 


international best practices in the management of water body pollution control and environmental/
ecological improvement. Lessons learned from World Bank-financed pollution control and 
ecological restoration projects (such as Danube Water Program; Iran Northern Cities Water Supply 
and Sanitation Project to reduce pollutant loads to the Caspian Sea; Lake Victoria Environmental 
Protection Project; Aral Sea Restoration Project; Integrated Water Management in Metropolitan Sao 
Paulo Project) as well as lessons from other countries' experiences (such as the Great Lakes and 
Chesapeake Bay restoration programs in the US) are being used to inform the key concept of the 
project, and include: (a) investments in infrastructure upgrading needs to be matched consistently 
with required institutional support for appropriate maintenance and management competencies, to 
ensure sustainability of investment; (b) the needs within the basin exceed the current scale of 
investments and therefore (i) investments need to be modelled, targeted and monitored to establish 
the most cost-effective interventions to improve basin health and green resilient growth that 
supports livelihood and maintains the sustainability of economic development; (ii) capacity and 
investments need to be leveraged from a variety of public and private partners; (c) problems related 
to water quality management, pollution control and urban upgrading are complex and require multi-
sectoral and integrated approaches; (d) both the institutional and environmental objectives 
associated with addressing such complex issues should be treated as long-term program goals rather 
than short-to medium-term project objectives; (e) integrated approaches to water quality 
management can enhance additional benefits and contribute to poverty alleviation; (f) participatory 
approach, though time-consuming, is essential for sustainability of project results as it ensures 
consensus building between all stakeholders in reaching agreement on project design and achieving 
institutional and policy reform and public support; and (g) ex-post monitoring of activities to collect 
evidence of costs and benefits help to enhance chances for successful replication. 
 
Specific best practices that will be examined for application of proposed project activities include: 
(a) strengthening of the current institutional architecture - River manager as leader of the party - 
River implementer as the mayor of the county - high level leading group for strategic orientation 
and guidance (the Great Lakes National Program Office (GLNPO in the USA); the Office of the 
Prime Minister Program for the Lake Balaton (Hungary); and the creation of the Commission and 
Secretariat of the Lake Balaton from above mentioned office); (b) strengthening of incentive 
mechanisms (direct and indirect payment fee mechanism in Biwa Lake (Japan); environmental fee 
on net revenue from chemical factories around Lake Toba (Indonesia); fee grid for water 
consumption in Lake Constance (Germany-Switzerland and Austria) and; the revolving polluter-
payer fee/subsidy mechanism of the Seine Normandy River Basin Agency (France)); (c) citizen 
participation and information disclosure - (Women Association for the Lake Balaton which 
pioneered the lake's protection in earlier 1990; the Lake Naivasha (home of Kenya??s flowers 
export) Riparian Association (LNRA) and Lake Naivasha Growers Group (LNGG)); (d) ensuring 
soundness of infrastructure design and its O&M sustainability (the Chesapeake Bay restoration 
program (USA); Lake Champlain basin program (USA/Canada); the Lake Balaton water quality and 
tourism program; and Danube Water Program); (e) integrated action plan to maximize impact of 
interventions (the Great Lakes restoration program; the lake Ponchartrain restoration plan 
(Louisiana); the Lake Balaton program). 
 
Note:   Proposed project activities have been selected based on the following criteria: (a) cost 
effectiveness - each sub-project should have economic/financial return; (b) sub-projects should not 
cause any negative social and environmental impacts that cannot be mitigated through proper design 
and contract execution; (c) sub-projects must be in compliance with government development plans; 
(d) all land used for construction purposes shall conform to general land utilization plans of the 


cities and / or townships and their annual land use plans; (e) proposed interventions should solve 
existing problems systematically rather than only solve part of the problem; and (f) sub-projects 
should have demonstration value.

Track II - The review did authorize the preparation to continue

I. Introduction and Context
Country Context
The Chinese Government has always made poverty reduction an important goal and task of national 
development and China’s success in reducing poverty has been remarkable, an achievement that is 
acknowledged worldwide.  In the mid-1980s, the Government started the development-oriented 
poverty reduction programs in rural areas. Subsequently, the Government formulated and 
implemented the Seven-year Priority Poverty Reduction Program (1994-2000) and the Outline for 
Poverty Reduction and Development of China’s Rural Areas (2001-2010). After three decades of 
successful poverty alleviation and strong economic growth that has lifted some 600 million people 
out of poverty, the rate of poverty reduction, however, is beginning to show signs of becoming less 

responsive to broad-based growth. In addition, with increasing rural-urban disparities and diverging 
living standards, the Government recognized that the number of remaining rural poor was likely to 
be underestimated and adjustments to the previous poverty reduction policy were needed to better 
understand the patters of the remaining rural poverty and to integrate traditional rural poverty 
reduction with rural-urban transformation and urbanization policies.  
 
Consequently, in 2011, the Government revised the rural poverty line from CNY1,196 (2009) to 
CNY2,300 (US$361) which increased the number of rural poor from 27 million in 2010 to 128 
million in 2011. In addition, the State Council’s Leading Group for Poverty Reduction and 
Development released the Outline for Development-oriented Poverty Reduction for China’s Rural 
Areas (2011-2020) to provide a new strategic direction for addressing rural poverty. The strategy 
complements the traditional geographical targeting of designated poverty counties with the concept 
of adjacent destitute mountain areas of which 14 are prioritized for comprehensive regional 
development investments. The new strategy aims to eliminate hunger and elementary needs by 
2020, achieve a growth rate in rural per-capita income in poor areas that is above the national 
average, and promote the convergence of human development indicators and public services 
coverage across rural and urban areas. To narrow the rural-urban gap, the strategy lays out a broad 
approach that includes rural industrialization based on comparative advantage, infrastructure 
development, relocation and village consolidation, rural-urban integration, comprehensive public 
service provision and expansion of household-based social protection programs, such as the 
minimum living allowance (dibao), rural pension, and healthcare, and education, family planning, 
and environmental management.

Sectoral and Institutional Context
The project is proposed to be implemented in Gansu, Sichuan, and Guizhou provinces.  The three 
provinces face the common challenge of persistent rural poverty in remote rural areas.  Many of the 
project areas are traditional semi-subsistence areas where the poverty rate ranges between 30 to 50 
percent.  Agriculture remains an important source of local employment and income but geographic 
and climatic conditions, labor migration, underinvestment, and underdeveloped infrastructure pose 
challenges to future agricultural development.  In all three provinces, a gradual restructuring of the 
agricultural sector is needed to allow productivity and farm income to increase and to overcome 
constraints to agriculture modernization.  
 
Gansu Province.  Project counties are situated in the Liupan Mountains of Gansu in northwestern 
China.  Project areas have comparative advantages in horticulture, and several counties have 
successfully developed advanced production and marketing bases for apple, pear, grapes, medicinal 
herbs, and potato.  Still, rural poverty is high, often above 40 percent.  Poverty appears not so much 
rooted in poor production potential but more in the dominance of enterprises in the horticulture 
sector which appear to capture a considerable share of revenue in the value-chain while relatively 
little value is reaching the household or farm level.  One of the challenges in Gansu under this 
project is to strengthen the institutional environment for smallholders through the promotion of 
effective farmer cooperative arrangements that allow farmers to participate effectively in the 
modernization of the sector and to benefit from the high-value agricultural production chains. 
 
Sichuan Province.  Project areas are located in the Wumeng and Wuliang Mountains of southern 
Sichuan.  They are characterized by high mountains, narrow and steep valleys, and very limited flat 
or terraced land for farming.  Per capita farmland is often less than half a mu or about 0.03 hectares.  
Altitudes within one county range from several hundred to over 4,000 meters above sea level and 


agro-climatic conditions vary widely.  Alpine meadows and shrublands are generally used of 
livestock grazing, often in unsustainable ways with visible degradation of vegetation and soils. At 
lower elevations, steep slopes and narrow valleys are used for cropping and erosion risk is high. 
 
Local communities belong nearly exclusively to the Yi Minority.  Yi language is used widely while 
only few people speak Mandarin Chinese in rural areas. Due to the remoteness of these areas, the 
unique cultural background of the population, as well as low education levels, communities are not 
well integrated into the mainstream society and labor mobility is limited as compared to other areas. 
Development opportunities are limited as well; and investments in public service expansion appear 
to be prohibitively expensive in many remote locations.   The development challenge in Sichuan is 
to identify and focus on those project areas with long-term development potential and to promote 
agricultural production systems that can generate income and are environmentally sustainable. 
Opportunities exist for producing and primary processing of higher value and niche-market 
products, such as walnuts, medicinal herbs, and fruits, and for restructuring the high altitude 
livestock sector to become environmentally and economically sustainable.  
 
Guizhou Province.  Guizhou Province is located in southwest China. Out of Guizhou’s total 
population of 40 million, 11.5 million live below the national poverty line. About 80 percent of the 
province belongs to the limestone and karst areas of the Wuling and Wumeng Mountains in which 
sixty-five poor counties and 85 percent of Guizhou’s poor are located.  These areas are 
characterized by relatively fertile but often shallow soils and are subject to severe water and soil 
erosion and management problems.  The unique geographic conditions and the limited availability 
of productive farmland, combined with inaccessibility and underdeveloped infrastructure, represent 
significant challenges to agricultural development.  Recent improvements in transportation 
infrastructure, both highways and village access roads, however, are providing potential 
opportunities to reach large urban markets in Chongqing and Guiyang.  These remain un-tapped to 
date because of the limited investment into the agricultural sector itself. For the future, modern 
agricultural production systems that build on: (a) more sustainable land use; (b) improvements of 
the organizational level of farmers, and (c) carefully designed land consolidation programs offer 
promising ways to overcome technology constraints, attract investment, and link agricultural value 
chains to urban markets.

Relationship to CAS
The project would support the CPS’ strategic theme two: promoting more inclusive development, 
by geographically focusing on lagging regions and small towns and by supporting policies and 
demonstration projects that address inequalities. It would contribute to the CPS outcome 2.3: 
enhancing opportunities in rural areas and small towns, by piloting new ways to boost rural incomes 
and reduce poverty under the umbrella of the new Poverty Reduction for China’s Rural Areas 
Strategy (2011-2020) and by promoting inclusive innovation to decrease disparities.

II. Proposed Development Objective(s)

Key Results (From PCN)
The achievement of the Project Development Objective would be measured through the following 
key performance indicators, namely the:  
 
a)       The generation of incremental net value of agricultural production through project 
investments;  
b) The fair and equitable distribution of the net production value among the various  
stakeholders in the value chain; 
c)  Additional private sector investment leveraged through project investments; and  
d) Viability and sustainability of the project models and potential for up-scaling.  
 
Additional component-specific performance indicators as well as sector core indicators will be 
formulated and included into the results framework during project preparation

III. Preliminary Description
Concept Description
The proposed project seeks to assist the Government in developing models to advance the rural-
urban integration and rural sector modernization agenda in representative destitute rural and 
mountain areas.  The focus of the project would be on demonstrating approaches to rural income 
generation that are based on the modernization of selected agricultural sub-sectors and value-chain 
development, institutional farmer cooperative development, the provision of grant funds for poor 
farmer households and cooperatives to support their participation in agricultural value chains, and 
capacity building for rural households, cooperatives, enterprises, and local governments.   
 
The project would seek to achieve the development objective through the implementation of the 
following components and activities: 
 
Component 1: Integrated Value Chain Development.  The objective of this component would be to 
develop more efficient agricultural value chains focusing on 2 to 4 agricultural or rural pillar 
industries in each project county.  This would be achieved through the restructuring and 
modernization of the current production patterns and by supporting the enabling institutions in each 
pillar industry.  The modernization would aim at creating or supporting larger, economically more 
viable and long-term sustainable production arrangements, for example cooperatives, household 
groups, or enterprises, which are capable to use better technologies and can capture value added in 
the up-stream processing and marketing value chains.  The component would also support the 
establishment of socially acceptable models of cooperatives, household groups, company-farmer 
household, and company-farmer household-cooperative organizations through a business and 
market-based approach. 
 
Component 2: Public infrastructure and services support.  The objective of this component would be 
to improve public infrastructure and public services in order to enable and facilitate restructuring of 
the agricultural sub-sectors under Component 1.  The component would support investments in: (a) 
production road infrastructure; (b) irrigation and drainage, terracing, etc. (c) communications and 
information and telecommunications (ICT) infrastructure and equipment; and (d) public market 
facilities, electricity supply and other infrastructure necessary to facilitate and complement farmer 
and private investments.  In addition, the component would provide investment in other supporting 
public services, such as food safety testing and control, public extension and training services, 
marketing systems and agriculture research and technology transfer. 
 
Component 3: Rural and Agricultural Business Development Support.  The objective of this 
component would be to provide business development services to farmer households and 


cooperatives in support of the agriculture-value chain development under omponent 1.  Specific 
investments would include:  (a) a conditional grant program to poor households and households 
groups to encourage the self-organization of households and provide means for the purchasing of 
agricultural and other inputs to allow them to participate in new production arrangements; (b) 
training and mentoring for new and existing enterprises and cooperatives and for community-based 
economic groups in ethnic minority areas; (c) training for government officials on the roles of 
government and private sector and on how to built public-private partnership arrangements; in 
addition, training on appraisal guidelines for public sector support in rural areas; (d) technical 
assistance to value-chain operators; (e) policy studies on how to improve investment climate, good 
governance, and fair benefit-sharing in cooperative-enterprise arrangements; and (f) marketing 
studies for selected products, analytical studies related to poverty reduction and agricultural sector 
development, policy guidelines, and the development of appraisal guidelines for public sector 
support in rural areas.  
 
Component 4: Project management, monitoring and evaluation (M&E).  The component would 
establish the project management and M&E system of the project and provide office equipment, 
transportation and technical assistance services. It would support the coordination between 
implementation agencies at all levels and with other government programs and institutions and the 
capture of implementation lessons from value chain development.  It would also include support to 
establishing and operatingthe project’s progress and impact M&E system.

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 

1. Over the past ten years, India has seen strong economic growth - exceeding 7 percent per annum - driven primarily 
by robust private consumption, a resilient services sector, and a revival in some industrial activities. The reduced 
momentum in investment and exports notwithstanding, annual growth rates are still projected to average 7.5 percent per 
annum in coming years because of the diversity in the country’s drivers of growth and the vast scope for improvement in 
many areas.   

2. Alongside this growth, India has achieved significant progress in reducing extreme poverty - from 46 percent in 1993 
to 21 percent in 2011 (using the international poverty line of $1.90 per person per day in 2011 purchasing power parity). 
World Bank estimates point to continued reduction in poverty in more recent years, indicating that the country is on track 
to eliminating extreme poverty by 2030. Urban growth and rising labor earnings due to movement of labor from agriculture 
to non-farm work, an unprecedented rise in wages for unskilled labor, and demographic changes (e.g. a declining 
dependency ratio), underlie the rapid poverty decline.  

3. Over the past three decades, the economy has undergone a structural shift from agriculture as the dominant sector, 
to services and industry. Even then, agriculture continues to be essential for achieving India’s development goals, as the 
sector employs about 59 percent of the country’s total workforce, is a source of livelihood for 70 percent of India’s rural 
households, and is the main source of economic linkages in rural areas. In 2017, the sector contributed about 17 percent 
to the national Gross Domestic Product (GDP). While its contribution to the economy is likely to keep declining, agriculture 
will continue being the single largest contributor to employment and income of the rural population in the foreseeable 
future. 

4. Because of a complex web of policies and institutions that limit the performance of agricultural markets, diminishing 
returns to technologies that once sparked the green revolution, and suboptimal diversification among others, the 
agriculture sector continues to perform below its potential. Long-term agricultural growth has averaged about 3 percent 
per year1 and generally lags the growth rate for the larger economy. Sector growth is subject to large annual shocks, which 
as projected, are expected to be exacerbated by climate change. In addition, India’s agriculture has, for long, been based 
on an unsustainable resource-intensive model, predominantly characterized by inefficient use of water and land 
resources, and as an imperative, will have to shift to higher levels of resource use efficiency, given the country’s low per 
capita natural resource endowments2 and the projected impacts of climate change.  

                                            
1 With decelerating productivity growth of food grains. 
2 With annual per capita water availability of only about 1,000 m3, India is one of the most water-stressed countries in the world. 



     

5. Moving away from its long-running policy focus on raising agricultural output and improving food security, the 
Government of India has now prioritized the doubling of farmers’ incomes by 2022 and through a number of interventions 
e.g. the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) is also committed to accord high priority to improving water use 
efficiency - more crop per drop - in a focused manner3. 

 

Sectoral and Institutional Context 
 
6.  Odisha ranks among the fastest growing economies in India, consistently growing at rates higher than the national 
average. Mirroring the national level, Odisha’s economic growth has been mainly driven by services (43.5 percent of GDP) 
and industry (36.6 percent of GDP). Between 2012 and 2017, per capita incomes in the State increased by 30 percent 
(from Rs. 47,632 to Rs. 61,678) and poverty reduced at an annual rate of 3.5 percent. Despite this good progress, Odisha’s 
per capita income still stands at only 75 percent of the national average.  

7. While Odisha’s economy has transformed from a predominantly agro-based economy, agriculture remains a key 
sector, providing employment and livelihoods to more than 62 percent of the State’s workforce, and contributing close to 
20 percent to its GDP. Indeed, a strong correlation exists between agriculture sector performance and overall state GDP, 
pointing to strong linkages between agriculture and other sectors. 

8. Like much of India, Odisha’s agriculture sector performance, relative to potential, is low. The officially reported 
compound annual average growth rate of 2.8 percent for the sector for the period 2011-17, is below the national average, 
and masks the highly volatile sector performance, which in reality is characterized by significant negative growth every 
alternative year. Consequently, because of low sector performance, Odisha ranks at the bottom in terms of annual farmer 
income (i.e. Rs. 16,884 per family), only outperforming West Bengal, where the average farmer income stands at Rs. 
11,748 per annum.4 

9. Among others, key constraints to the improved performance of Odisha’s agriculture sector include: (i) low 
productivity; (ii) limited diversification; (iii) high exposure and vulnerability to extreme weather events; (iv) access to 
reliable irrigation; and (v) dysfunctional or non-existing value chains for important crops. First off, average yields for major 
crops in Odisha still lag both those in neighboring states with comparable factor endowments and the national averages 
(Table 1), and are far below their potential5.

10. According to the findings of a State-level NITI Aayog Task Force on Agriculture6, these low farm-level yields are 
largely due to limited adoption of productivity enhancing technologies (including the use of improved germplasm), a

degrading natural resource base, inadequate and mostly unreliable irrigation7,8, and weaknesses in the extension system.  

11. Due to several factors9, Odisha’s progress with respect to diversification – an important vehicle for agricultural 
growth - has been mixed at best, even against a backdrop of real shifts in consumer demand towards more diversified 
food baskets. While the net area devoted to rice showed some reduction between 2006 and 2015, the latest year for 
which comprehensive data sets exist, the total area devoted to food grains has been increasing. In fact, according to the 
Odisha Economic Survey of 2017-18 example, the areas under spices, vegetables, fruits, and floriculture - a proxy for 
diversification - declined by 20 percent, 6 percent, 9 percent and 12 percent, respectively, between 2014 and 201710. 

12. In addition, extreme weather events, largely droughts, and to a lesser extent, floods and cyclones, also continue to 
undermine Odisha’s agriculture performance and have been the principal driver of the volatility in sector growth. Figure 
1 for example, shows percent annual growth in rice production-the major crop - over five decades, and attests to the 
vulnerability of the State’s agriculture to the debilitating impacts of extreme weather events, which seem to occur with 
almost predictable periodicity.   

Figure 1: Percent annual  growth in rice production, 1962-201411 

 

 

13. While Odisha has a long history with the menace of drought – going all the way to the drought of 186612 - recent 
trends point to an increasing frequency13 as well as more agricultural areas coming under the ambit of droughts. As 
pointed out in the Odisha Climate Change Action Plan, this trend will be further amplified in the future due to climate 

                                            
7 About 2/3 of the State’s gross cropped area is rain-fed and depends on monsoon – a vast reliance on nature in an environment with highly 
skewed annual rainfall availability.  
8 Of the total cultivable area of 8.7 million ha in the State, irrigation potential has been developed for 2.96 million ha in Kharif and 1.48 million 
ha in Rabi season.

change14. With 2/3 of its gross cropped area under rainfed production and an insignificant use of groundwater, the State 
has few and inadequate instruments to mitigate against climate change-induced weather vagaries.  

14. Moreover, even when Odisha has relatively more water resources than many States in India, Irrigation 
development is low and below the national average.  Of the total cultivated area of 8.7 million ha, only 1.9 million ha (21 
percent) is under irrigation. Only 34 percent of the total irrigation potential of 5.5 million ha has been developed and 
groundwater use is negligible. With limited irrigation development and seasonally skewed rainfall, Odisha is not making 
the most out of every drop of water. In fact, estimates indicate that about 40-50 percent of available rainfall is lost as non-
beneficial evapotranspiration, a loss higher than the neighboring states. In addition, many of the irrigation systems have 
become victim to a vicious cycle of the build-neglect-rebuild. Operation and Maintenance (O&M) is not conduced 
systematically as a result of insufficient funds, the quality of irrigation services degrades and further undermines farmers’ 
willingness and capacity to pay for services. Arrangements for irrigation management have not been adapted to the 
requirements of recent developments, including the use of groundwater, adoption of more individual irrigation 
technologies, and the need to adopt a cascade perspective on irrigation management. 

15. Furthermore, remunerative and reliable markets in Odisha, a precondition for sustained agricultural growth are 
limited, mainly due to poorly functioning value chains. For example, supply chains for otherwise high-value commodities 
(e.g. spices, vegetables) are fragmented and uncoordinated, often involving multiple layers of intermediaries in some 
places, and completely no players in many other places. 

16. The Government of Odisha (GoO) has identified increasing production and productivity, reducing the vulnerability 
of agriculture to climate change, diversification towards high-value crops, rainwater harvesting and improving efficiency 
of water use, improved produce marketing, and addressing absentee landlordism inter alia, as important issues to be 
addressed to improve the performance of the agricultural sector and raise farmer incomes. The proposed project 
contributes to these efforts. The proposal is to support higher agriculture growth, more efficient water use, better quality 
and reliability of irrigation service delivery, and strengthen the resilience to climate change of production systems in six 
districts (see Table 2) in Odisha.  

17. Characterized by highly skewed and variable rainfall patterns15, a lack of perennial rivers, these districts depend on 
a cycle of dry seasons alternating with increasingly uneven and erratic monsoons for water. On average, they suffer from 
marginal drought one in three to five years, moderate drought in six to eight years, and severe drought one in thirty years. 
Among other reasons, the undulating physiography and the predominantly small-sized land holdings limit the technically 
and economically efficient development of centralized major and medium irrigation systems (reservoirs and canals) to 
serve these areas and, they therefore, generally have comparatively lower irrigation coverage than other parts of the State 
(Table 2).

14 Climate projections indicate that drier areas will become drier and flood prone areas will be subject to more flooding. Other problems such 
as pest and disease outbreaks are also likely to increase due to climate change. 
15 When it rains, eighty six percent of the rains fall in the monsoon period (June-October), while the remaining 14 percent occurs during the 
other 7 months of the year, from November to May.

18. The districts therefore, have historically relied on water, stored in cascades of impoundments (tanks) for agricultural 
production and as a buffer against droughts. The tanks support livelihoods of over 300,000 households, most of whom 
are in the poorest quintile. Besides sustaining agricultural livelihoods, the network of tanks in these areas also serves other 
important purposes such as controlling and reducing the impacts of floods - when they occur-and recharging the 
groundwater table. Investing in these districts will also help meet a key policy objective of the GoO to more evenly spread 
the benefits of irrigation - currently confined to a few districts in the form of major and medium irrigation projects16.   

19. Specifically, the project will support sustainable and resilient intensification, judicious diversification17 to high-value 
commodities (especially during the Rabi season and for some areas under upland rice in Kharif), improved produce 
marketing and also incentivize and improve the quality of irrigation service delivery and the reliability of water supply to 
ensure a more efficient, productive and equitable distribution of water to beneficiary farmers throughout the year that is 
more responsive to the more demanding higher value crops. The project builds on the successes of an earlier Bank-
financed Odisha Community Tanks Management Project in bridging the gap between the then existing irrigation potential 
and actual irrigation coverage of selected tanks and expands the engagement further into institutional reforms and 
capacity strengthening for improved system performance, diversification and marketing of farmer produce. 

 

Relationship to CPF 
 

20. The India CPF (2018-2022) argues that for the country to maintain its trajectory of high growth and poverty 
reduction, it must: (i) embrace much more efficient use of the country’s resources, particularly water and land and address 
the impacts of climate change; (ii) foster inclusiveness both for poverty reduction and as a key condition for sustaining 
high rates of economic growth; and (iii) strengthen the agility, performance and responsiveness of public sector 
institutions. One of the three CPF focus areas (Focus Area 1) proposed for Bank engagement is “resource efficient growth” 
where one of the Objectives is promotion of a more resource-efficient, inclusive and diversified growth in the rural sector. 
The proposed project dovetails and is consistent with Bank support (to include inter alia, support to sustainable 
productivity gains, CSA practices, diversification, investments in irrigation and drainage for improved water use efficiency, 
value chains etc.) that is envisaged under this Objective.  

C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  
 
21. The Project Development Objective is to intensify and diversify agricultural production, enhance climate resilience 
and improve water productivity in selected cascades of Odisha. Project beneficiaries include small and marginal farmers, 
Water Users’ Associations (Pani Panchayats), farmer producer organizations, and other agro-entrepreneurs. Targeted 
investments will be undertaken to address any gender gaps as well as benefit other vulnerable groups. 

Key Results (From PCN) 
 

22. The project is expected to lead to increased average yields, increases in the range, volume and value of marketed 
agricultural output, more productive and efficient use of scarce water resources, a more reliable supply and a better 
quality of irrigation service delivery, and improvements in farmers’ capacity to adapt to climate change. Proposed key 
outcome level performance indicators include the following: (i) increase in productivity of selected agricultural

commodities supported by the project (t/ha); (ii) farmers adopting improved agricultural technology (number); (iii) share 
of non-rice products in total production in project areas(percent); (iv) water users provided with new/improved irrigation 
and drainage services (number); (v) acreage under crops that are less water demanding (ha); (vi) productivity of water use 
(kg/m3), and (vii) number of direct project beneficiaries (disaggregated by gender).  

 
D. Concept Description 

 
23. Agricultural production system improvements (e.g. improving productivity, system resilience to climate change and 
resource use efficiency) and market development are known to reinforce each other and are therefore better pursued 
and accomplished together. The proposed project primarily seeks to improve and diversify farmer yields and production, 
improve water productivity and efficiency, build resilience to climate change risks, and improve market access for farmers 
who can generate a marketable surplus in selected districts in Odisha. Producing higher value and more diverse crops puts 
a high premium on the quality and reliability of irrigation service delivery, as they leave no room for water supply errors 
and the higher use of farm inputs significantly increases the stakes. Higher value horticulture crops generally use less 
water as compared to wheat, paddy, sugarcane and cotton. The conceptual framework underlying the proposed design 
therefore links efforts to promote adoption of CSA practices18, diversification and productivity increases, with 
improvements in incentives for technology adoption, quality of water service delivery and water resource management. 
The project will comprise three components as described below: 

Component 1: Climate-Smart Intensification and Diversification of Agriculture 

24. The objective of this component is to increase agricultural productivity, strengthen the capacity of organized farmer 
groups to cope or adapt to climate change stresses affecting crop production, and diversify production in Rabi in response 
to effective demand as expressed by pre-identified commercial off-takers or gleaned from other reliable market signals. 
Support under this component is proposed to be organized around two mutually inclusive, overlapping and reinforcing 
subcomponents. 

Subcomponent 1.1: Support to Improved Productivity and Resilience 

25. This subcomponent aims at supporting and incentivizing farmer adoption of technologies and practices that 
demonstrably deliver the triple-wins of increased productivity, improved resilience to climate shocks and reduced GHG 
emissions, as a co-benefit. The exact nature of technology support will be: (i) a function of the specificities of production 
environments and unique climate vulnerabilities19 in individual cascade; (ii) scaled to farmer capacities and endowments 
and (iii) based on the principles of response to market demand, good choice of improved germplasm, adequate plant 
nutrition, and effective pest and disease management. 

26. In this respect, project support is envisaged to go towards organizing farmers for technology transfer purposes (e.g. 
through farmer field schools), technology sourcing and demonstration, farmer training, improving availability and access 
to productivity enhancing and resilient germplasm by strengthening key segments in the State’s seed production and 
distribution system, and strengthening advisory service provision, currently plagued by weaknesses in the extension 
system - such as inadequate manpower and limited knowledge and skills.   

Subcomponent 1.2: Support to Diversification and Produce Marketing 

27. The objective of this subcomponent is twofold: (i) support farmers to reduce the current emphasis on food grains 

                                            
18 In this context, CSA practices are defined as practices that sustainably increase productivity and farmers’ income and build resilience to 
climate change, while reducing GHG emissions where possible and appropriate

Implementation of Odisha State Climate Change Action Plan. 


(especially rice and wheat) while increasing the share of high-value agriculture (e.g. fruits, spices and vegetables) in their 
overall production structure; and (ii) improve produce marketing to increase incomes and reduce price risks associated 
with diversification. A successful shift in favor of more diversified production would not only generate faster productivity 
and superior incomes for targeted farmers, but will also result into improved nutrition security, help reduce the water 
footprint of paddy, foster biodiversity, and strengthen resilience of the production systems to climate change.  

28. Project support to diversification and improved marketing is proposed to follow productive alliance approaches, 
which bring together organized farmers, produce buyers, technical service providers and leverage private sector financing 
to address market imperfections and build competitive value chains for select commodities. In this respect, the project 
could provide funding for several activities, including but not limited to: (i) awareness creation of diversification among 
farmers; (ii) identification of competitive value chains; (iii) farmer experimentation with new crops and 
training/demonstration of relevant production technology; (iv) strengthening of farmers for collective action (including in 
production, aggregation, technology transfer, among others); (v) business plan development; and (vi) selected productive 
investments - as would be identified in the business plans. Project support to crop diversification will be based on 
agronomic/agro-ecological suitability, comparative advantage of specific cascades, and local, national or international 
market opportunities. To further diversify farmer income streams (a key adaptation strategy) and maximize the utility and 
productivity of water stored in the tanks, during preparation, the project will explore the feasibility of using the tanks for 
seasonal aquaculture.  

Component 2: Improving Access to Irrigation and Water Productivity  

29. Access to reliable irrigation is generally critical to enhancing crop productivity, building resilience to climate change, 
promoting diversification and access to markets. It is doubly important in the targeted project areas that are characterized 
by frequent droughts and highly variable rainfall availability. Bridging increasingly longer dry spells during Kharif and 
producing more demanding higher value and more diverse crops during Rabi when the stakes are higher and when there 
is no margin for water supply errors, puts a high premium on the quality of irrigation services.   

30. Among others, reliability of irrigation services and a more productive use of water resources in the project areas is 
weighed down by: (i) the poor condition of hydraulic assets- mainly due to deferred maintenance; (ii) limited knowledge 
and skills in water management - often inadequate to provide supplemental irrigation during Kharif season, and to cover 
water-stress conditions during Rabi; and (iii) weak arrangements for O&M. Additionally, most of the tank irrigation 
systems have been developed for rice cultivation and need to be adapted for a more diversified and more demanding 
cropping system.  

31. The proposed project aims to improve the performance of irrigation throughout the year and across cascades of 
selected tank irrigation systems through modernization of hydraulic assets, institutional reforms, and capacity 
strengthening. The objective is to use water more efficiently, reduce water losses and save water during Kharif season, 
and transfer these savings to Rabi season. Capacities for irrigation management (including the introduction of asset 
management) will be strengthened to provide higher quality services. In addition, the project will promote sustainable 
groundwater use to supplement scanty rainfall and mitigate increasing rainfall variability. Key outcome indicators include 
the productivity of water use ($/m3) and the number of water users provided with new/improved irrigation and drainage 
services (number). 

Subcomponent 2.1: Irrigation Modernization 

32. The project will invest in the modernization of hydraulic assets. To that end, a comprehensive water assessment will 
be conducted in the Project cascades to identify opportunities for reducing water losses and for transferring the savings 
to Rabi season. For each of these opportunities, the implications on downstream water use will be identified through 
preparation of a pre- and post-project cascade-wide water balance. Investments include strengthening of canal bunds, 
modernizing hydraulic canal structures, installation of field channels and sub-surface pressurized pipes, and developing 

groundwater extraction. The project will also help farmers access subsidies at central and state level for the promotion of 
pressurized irrigation at chak level. In line with GoO’s intention, where feasible, the project will finance investments 
through DBOTs on a Hybrid Annuity Basis. 

Subcomponent 2.2: Irrigation Management 

33. Crop diversification and intensification require a higher quality of irrigation service delivery to meet the 
requirements of more demanding crops. Traditional arrangements for irrigation management often lack the capacities 
and incentives to deliver these improved services. The project will pursue institutional reforms and pilot the use of private 
(publicly funded) operators that will be incentivized to deliver high performing irrigation and O&M services through DBOT 
contracts on a Hybrid Annuity basis – in conformity with GoO’s intentions.  

34. The Project will promote conjunctive management and sustainable use of both ground- and surface water resources 
by improving groundwater monitoring linking these with irrigation scheduling decisions. The Project will also establish a 
surface and groundwater monitoring and benchmarking system and will (i) link these data to decision making on irrigation 
scheduling, and (ii) significantly improve citizen engagement in the management of irrigation systems.  

35. The project will strengthen capacities of farmers and Pani Panchayats through Farmers’ Field Schools and 
demonstrations, among others in modern irrigation technologies, improving irrigation efficiency and rational hydraulic 
asset management. The project will also introduce the allocation of investment resources on the basis of scheme 
performance (including abidance by agreed water allocation, meeting efficiency targets and cost recovery). Capacities will 
also be strengthened to improve the management and maintenance of hydraulic assets. 

Component 3: Project Management 

36. This component will strengthen capacities for project management, monitoring and evaluation (M&E) (including, 
inter alia, the areas of procurement and financial management) through the provision of goods, consultant services, 
training, and financing of incremental operating costs. This component will also develop a comprehensive management 
information and data collection and reporting system on key performance outputs and impact indicators through baseline 
surveys, participatory assessments, mid-term reviews and final evaluations. Staffing of the PMU will include a number of 
technical, financial management, M&E and safeguards (social and environmental) experts. Detailed implementation 
arrangements will be spelled out in the Project Operational Manual. (POM). Regular training of PMU staff will be organized 
to strengthen their capacities to implement the project. 

 
    

  SAFEGUARDS 

 
A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 

 
Odisha is located on the east coast of India along the Bay of the Bengal. The state has coastal line of about 450 km, and a 

geographical area of 155,707 sq. km which accounts for 4.87% of the total area of India. The state of Odisha can be 
divided into five agro-ecological zones: (1) The coastal plains, (2) The middle mountainous range – part of Eastern Ghats 
mountain range, (3) The rolling uplands, (4) river valleys, and (5) subdued plateaus. While the state has a wide network of 
river basins and sub-basins, it is mainly associated with 3 major river basins; Brahamani, Mahanadi and Vansadhara. 
Despite such diverse natural resource base, it’s agriculture sector has been performing well below its potential. Among 
key constraints to the improved performance of Odisha’s agriculture sector include: (i) low productivity; (ii) limited 
diversification; (iii) high exposure and vulnerability to extreme weather events; and (iv) dysfunctional or non-existing 
value chains for important crops. 
  


To address these concerns, the project will invest on repair and rehabilitation of about 600 tanks spread across the state 
to revive small holder farming. The interventions will include: improving the efficiency of water assets, modernizing the 
irrigation systems, enhancing agriculture productivity, promoting adaptive agriculture practices, enhancing fishery 
production,  and promotion of climate friendly agri-business practices. 
  
 
 

 
B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 

 
Government of Odisha has recently completed a project of this nature, reflecting that the implementation capacity has 

already been established to address environment and social safeguard implications. The PMU is already in place, and the 
consultancy services for conducting ESMF, IPNM and TDP are already in place. Safeguard compliance tools needed are 
already available with the Government of Odisha to be used during the proposed project.

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

The physical investments under the project would 
include rehabilitation of existing water assets such as 
strengthening of canal bunds, modernizing hydraulic 
canal structures, installation of field channels, etc. 
where improper construction could result in adverse 
impacts. The investments under the climate resilient 
agriculture practices could result in positive impacts 
on the environment with effective planning and 
implementation. The project has been categorized as 
category B. There is no large scale, significant and/or 
irreversible impacts envisaged due to the proposed 
project interventions. An Environmental and Social 
Assessment (ESA) will be undertaken to identify 
environment and social issues of significance. Based 
on ESA, an Environmental and Social and Management 
Framework (ESMF) will be prepared toadress the 
requirements of a category B project, to manage risks 
and maximize environmental and social opportunities. 
Both the ESA and ESMF will take into account 
experiences and lessons from the previous project. 

Performance Standards for Private Sector 
Activities OP/BP 4.03 

No No impact is expected due to project interventions. 

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 Yes 

The rehabilitation and modernization of the tank 
system is likely to improve the water storage capacity 
and wetlands in the upper catchment. As the 
rehabilitation of tanks may impact natural resources 
including wetlands (if any). The ESA that  will help 
ascertain such impacts, and will develop a screening 
mechanisms that will help identify and avoid impacts 
on sensitive environmental habitats and important 
ecosystems. As details of the exact sites of the 
proposed investments are yet to be finalized, the 
ESMF would include all adequate measures for any 
negative effects on natural habitats. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No No activities impacting on forests will be undertaken 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

The project will not directly finance pesticides, but 
improved irrigation efficiency and subsequent increase 
in crop productivity and diversification may induce 
pesticide use. The project will strictly use IPNM 
(Integrated Pest and Nutrition Management) 
approach. In addition, the ESMF will have a detailed 
local specific IPNM strategy for the project. This will 
reduce the reliance on chemical pesticides, include all 
measure for labour health and safety for pesticide 
application and usage, and guidance on training and 
demonstrations, that will be provided so that there is 
no significant adverse impact on the environment and 
public health. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 No No impact is expected due to project interventions. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 Yes 

The state has a sizeable tribal population - 22.5% of 
the total population. In fact, Odisha is unique in having 
distinct tribal areas enshrined under the 5th Schedule 
of the Indian Constitution. At this stage, investment 
plans and locations are not known, and therefore, a 
Tribal Peoples Planning Framework (TPPF) will be 
prepared. Subsequently, sub-project specific Tribal 
Development Plans will be developed as and when 
sub-project locations are finalized. 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 No 

The project does not anticipate any form of land 
acquisition or involuntary resettlement impacts as it 
would cover the existing  tank with a focus on repair 
and rehabilitation only. 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 Yes 
No new dam construction will be  supported under the 
project. The project will rehabilitate and modernize 
the existing rainwater harvesting structures (known as 

Tanks and each having more than 40 Ha of command 
areas). Some of them would be having earthen 
embankments above 10 meters high, hence the 
project is triggered. 
This policy was triggered during the previous project, 
and a Dam Safety panel was put in place. The same 
Dam Safety panel will continue for this project under 
the technical guidance from the Chief Engineer, 
Central Designs Organization. The project will seek 
better coordination with the Dam Safety panel and 
support safety enhancement of the tank system as 
part of the tank rehabilitation. 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

No 
There is no evidence that the project would impact on 
any international water ways 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No Project areas do not fall in any disputed areas. 

 
E. Safeguard Preparation Plan  
 
Tentative target date for preparing the Appraisal Stage PID/ISDS 
 
Mar 31, 2019 
 
Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed. The specific studies and 
their timing should be specified in the Appraisal Stage PID/ISDS 
 
The Borrower has already engaged consultants who shall commence preparation of the safeguards instruments soon. 

They shall undertake ESA to prepare Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF), Tribal Peoples Planning 
Framework (TPPF), Integrated Pest Management Plan (IPMP) / Integrated Nutrient Management Plan (IPNM). These 
instruments are expected to be ready by March 31, 2019, or before appraisal and will be publically disclosed.  
The ESMF will provide essential baseline data, confirm policies that are triggered, assess likely impacts of the project 

interventions. The ESMF will also propose mitigation measures for any adverse impacts that may be envisaged through 
the design and construction phases of various interventions. Recommendations for strengthening institutional capacity, 
and estimate the budget required for the implementation will also be included. Assessments will be participatory with 
extensive consultations with all the stakeholders.

  Other Decision (as needed) 
 

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 

1. Pakistan, the world’s sixth most populous country, is a lower-middle-income country 
which has made significant progress towards macroeconomic and financial stability. Pakistan’s 
per capita income has almost doubled and the share of the population living in poverty has 
decreased by two-thirds over the last decade. Gross domestic product (GDP) growth reached 4.7 
percent in 2016 and is expected to reach 5 percent in 2017, supported by construction and 
manufacturing activities, increased private sector credit growth, increased reserves, low 
inflation, continuing strong remittances, and an upturn in foreign direct investment related to 
the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.  

2. Nevertheless, Pakistan faces serious development challenges, mostly in rural areas. 
GDP growth has been slower than needed to provide for the level of jobs required for a young 
and growing population. Inadequacy in the private sector environment, public sector 
management, and implementation capacity will continue to hamper service delivery 
performance. Thus, human development indicators continue to lag. In fact, Pakistan did not meet 
the targets of most of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015. Rural poverty remains 
about double the urban poverty (35 percent versus 18 percent in 2014) and decreases less 
rapidly, given low growth of the agriculture sector, inadequate rural infrastructure and 
connectivity to markets, weak governance and institutions, and limited access to finance. 

3. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) has faced a number of crises in the past decade. With 
geographical proximity and community-level ties to Afghanistan, KP has suffered from the fallout 
of the conflict in Afghanistan, which has given rise to a precarious security situation as well as 
prolonged political and social instability. Related hostilities and extremist violence have caused 
far-reaching disruption to economic activity and inflicted extensive damage on private property, 
livelihoods, and public infrastructure.  


4. KP is also one of Pakistan’s less developed regions, with some economic and social 
development indicators lagging behind the national averages. The province of KP accounts for 
an estimated 10.5 percent of the country’s GDP and about 14.6 percent of the population 
(approximately 30.5 million). The per capita income in KP is estimated to be 33 percent below 
the national average, and despite a sharp and consistent decline in poverty, 27 percent of 
households are estimated to be living below the national poverty line. Another relevant indicator 
is the household size, which is strongly correlated with poverty in Pakistan. KP households 
comprise 7.2 members on average, well above the national average of 6.3 members. Most of 
KP’s population (85 percent) also lives in rural areas, where access to public services and income 
generation opportunities is lower than in urban centers. 

5. Climate change is expected to exacerbate extreme weather events in KP, thereby 
increasing the vulnerability of people and assets to climate induced disasters. Since 2010 
extreme events such as cloudburst over the catchment areas of Indus and its tributaries, have 
frequently occurred during the annual monsoon season. This often leads to flash floods and 
landslides, causing damages across several sectors, including agriculture, livelihoods, 
infrastructure, transport and communications, and housing. Since 2010, KP has been facing 
extreme precipitation events, in the Indus catchment areas, particularly during the annual 
monsoon season. This results in swelling of rivers, causing localized and major floods in low-lying 
areas. KP is also facing an increased number of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOF) due to 
increased temperatures and intense precipitation. Being an upper riparian province in Pakistan, 
KP receives the shortest lead times for early warnings on climate induced hydro-meteorological 
disasters. As a result of the 2010 floods, KP suffered US$ 1.1 billion in damages, which included 
damages and losses of US$ 96 million1 to the agriculture sector in the province. 

B. Sectoral and Institutional Context 

6. Agriculture is important for Pakistan and the Government has placed agriculture 
development and water efficiency at the forefront of its development agenda. Agriculture2 
remains the second largest economic sector in Pakistan, contributing about 21 percent to the 
national GDP and employing approximately 42 percent of the labor force. The sector is also the 
largest contributor to export revenues with about 75 percent share from exports of primary and 
processed (mostly cotton textile) goods. The Government acknowledges that sustaining an 
annual GDP growth rate of 6 percent or more will require greater focus on agriculture and 
improved water resources planning, governance, and resilience. The Government is pursuing 
multiple initiatives to boost efforts to increase agricultural and water productivity, promote 
efficient use of its scarce water and precious land resources, and incentivize private sector 
investment in these areas for economic growth and shared prosperity.  

7. The contribution of agriculture in the KP economy, however, is less prominent, although 
it employs a high percentage of its labor force. KP’s contribution to the country agriculture GDP 

 

is the smallest of all provinces at 7 percent, compared to its share in total GDP of 11 percent. Also 
within KP, agriculture accounts for only 14 percent of the provincial GDP, representing the 
smallest share of all provinces. The sector accounts for 37 percent of labor force employment3 
and 11 percent of the total household income. The total cultivated area of the province is 1.6 
million ha (7 percent of the country’s total), half of which is rain fed. It produces about 5 percent 
of the country’s total wheat, 2 percent of rice, 17 percent of maize, 8 percent of sugarcane, 16 
percent of barley, 4 percent of gram, 3 percent of rapeseed and mustard, and 75 percent of 
tobacco. Its share in the country’s total livestock population is about 6 percent in cattle, 2.5 
percent in buffalo, 2 percent in sheep, and 8 percent in goats. KP is currently facing a food deficit 
and depends heavily on imports from other provinces, especially from Punjab, for important 
commodities like wheat (64 percent), rice (74 percent), milk, meat, sugar (80 percent), and 
vegetables (90 percent) to complement its production. The answer to this conundrum of 
agriculture may lie in the under exploitation of its natural resources, as the sector grew at a 
decent rate of 3.1 percent to 7.3 percent in the 2010–2015 five-year period, especially after the 
active insurgency period ended. 

8. KP’s land and water resources are under exploited. Of the total culturable4 land of 2 m 
ha., 1/3rd is irrigated, 1/3rd is rainfed and 1/3rd is culturable waste. Water allocated to KP under 
the National Water Apportionment Accord (WAA) of 1991 is 8.78 million acre feet (MAF) but due 
to current carrying capacity of the aging infrastructure and lack of new infrastructure the 
province is only able to withdraw about 68 percent (5.97 MAF) of its share. Also, 14 percent in 
floodwater, under the accord, is not fully used. Additionally, all water resources freed up from 
the WAA’s ambit, for the province, are not yet fully used. These include waters from schemes not 
exceeding 5,000 acres above elevation of 1200 ft. (Survey of Pakistan Datum [SPD]) and waters 
from Kurum/Gomal/kohat basins located in the highly-underserved areas of Kohat, Hangu, Karak, 
Bannu, Lakki Marwat, and D.I. Khan Districts. Thus, one-third of KP’s arable land depends on 
rainfall in a climate that is semiarid to arid. Another one-third (1.08 million ha) of KP’s arable 
land, called culturable waste land, is out of cultivation due either to water logging, non-
availability of irrigation water, salinity, unlevel land, lack of manpower, funds shortages, and so 
on. Thus, more land and water resource development is desperately needed for KP’s food 
security, import substitution, and economic development especially of the lagging areas. That’s 
why feasibility studies are included in the project design to prepare future investments in water 
resources development. 

9. The irrigation infrastructure in KP suffers from deferred maintenance5. KP canals are 
aging. Some are older than 100 years. As an upper riparian province with hilly terrains and steep 
slopes, KP’s canals suffer from frequent bank breaches, bed erosion and scouring due to floods, 

 
3 28 percent of male and 77 percent of female (mostly rural); 44 percent of rural and 6 percent of urban labor force is engaged 
in agriculture. The labor force participation is 80 percent male and 20 percent female (21 percent in rural and 12 percent in 
urban areas). 
4 According to bureau of statistics-Pakistan, culturable land includes cultivated and culturable waste lands and 

cultivated area includes rainfed and irrigated lands. 
5 De-siltation; oiling & greasing; repairing leakages, damaged sections of canal prism, cross drainage structure and outlets 



sliding and high velocities in addition to the normal wear and tear of a canal. Due to the poor 
condition of the canals, the system’s delivery performance is poor and the leakages/wastages 
(estimated at 25%) are causing water logging. Unlike Punjab, the reliance on ground water is 
minimal in irrigated areas, therefore water lost would be wasted and even would cause water 
logging and salinity. The silt deposition raises the level of the command area for which canal bed 
needs to be raised to continue providing the required volumes of water. 

Besides the canals, there are some 4,000-km long surface and subsurface drainage system in KP 
that was built to flush out the excess water to keep the fertile land in production in the central 
districts. However due to lack of funds, this infrastructure is also suffering and, the carrying 
capacity of the drainage system has diminished and large tracts of precious fertile lands are 
becoming water logged and saline again.  

To keep pace with the exceptional level of O & M needs of the KP irrigation and drainage system, 
larger amounts of funds are needed. However, according to the KP Irrigation Department, only 
1/3rd (PkR 500 m vs PkR. 12,00 m for the last 10 years) of the needs are provided. Water charges 
(Abiana) collections in the province has been low at 30% of the total assessed, mainly because of 
the limited paying capacity of the large number of small landholders and low flat rates - PKR 
300/year/acre. Besides, its own system, the department also must, at times, shoulder the 
rehabilitation of civil canals which are community owned and do not pay any water charges. 

This practice of ‘build neglect rebuild’ costs the exchequer dearly6 which are oftentimes met from 
the development budget. 

Removing this backlog of rehabilitation as well as modernization is important to improve the 
system service capability, reduce water wastages/leakages and water logging and safeguard the 
system sustainability.  

10. In KP, as reported by the Irrigation Department, 10-15 percent of the canal outlets are 
tampered and /or illegal. This creates in-equity among growers in the system and affects the 
productivity of the farmers mainly at the tail end. An understanding has been reached with the 
Department to resolve such in-equities during the rehabilitation of the system. 

11. Historically, the collaboration between Irrigation and Agriculture Departments, in KP, is 
weak. Irrigation Department is responsible for development of dams, canals and drains, its 
functionality and O&M; delivering water to farmers at the outlet/farmgate (in watercourses); and 
assessment and collections of water charges. The Agriculture Department is responsible for 
development and rehabilitation of watercourses, promoting water conservation technologies 
and training farmers in good agriculture practices. Due to poor coordination, the benefits of up 
and down stream investment do not consolidate at the farm level. The Baizai Irrigation scheme 
is a good example. The Irrigation Department constructed the upstream delivery system with 
capacity for 25,000 acres but since no provision was made in the scheme budget for the 

 
6 According to a global estimate, a dollar deferred maintenance costs US$7 in repair/rehabilitation 


construction of watercourses, the agriculture department could not do so and after more than 2 
years the farmers are unable to utilize the water fully. This collaboration has started to improve 
in some very new schemes and this project will contribute to improving this collaboration further. 

12. In KP, as in the rest of the country, O & M of the watercourses, that brings water from 
canals to the farms, is a challenge on the daily basis. These are earthen structures owned and 
managed by farmers. The average length of a watercourse (including branches) is about 3 km, 
serving an average area of 150 acres with an average number of 75 shareholder farmers. Every 
farmer has a turn, once a week, to take his share in proportion to his landholding from the 
watercourse. Every time a farmer diverts his/her share, loose earth/mud and stone mixture are 
gathered from the surrounding fields to plug and unplug the farm gate and watercourse at the 
turnouts. Preventing leakage from these structure is a continuous battle for the farmer. Since 
this channel must pass near each farm, there are many turns and branches through which water 
passes. This is an important cause of spillage and leakage for water. Being earthen, many 
different weeds/shrubs/trees start growing on the banks of the watercourse. These often 
become a source of blockage due to its own biomass and capturing silt load causing the water to 
overflow and causing ponding near the watercourse-sometimes becoming mosquito breading 
points. Another source of damage are rodents and grazing animals. This necessitates recurrent 
seasonal cleaning by farmers. Since farmers are poor and cannot afford to hire labour, they do it 
mostly themselves. This O & M of the watercourse draws heavily on the farmers’ time and labour 
-and also cause wastage of his precious water estimated up to 40%. Being earthen, it is easier to 
cut and steal other farmer’s share that can become source of heavy rifts in relations. Therefore, 
it is important to support farmer with watercourse improvement i.e. lining of 507% length, 
installing all turnout structures, construction of crossing culverts, washing pads, and animal 
drinking wallows. It is estimated that this investment helps the farmer save 75% labour time, 15 
percentage point of water wastage, water travel time by 50%, in-equity, theft control which 
results in 15-20% crop yield increase, 30% cropping intensity and ultimately increased net 
incomes. In addition to these benefits it also helps in saving energy costs and precious ground 
water on tube-well water courses. 

13. Field application of water is highly in-efficient in KP as in other parts of the country. Due 
to the widespread practice of flood irrigation and insufficient knowledge of good irrigation 
agronomy practices, water losses are highest at the field level where application efficiency is as 
low as 65–70 percent. Resultantly, crop yields and cropping intensities are low. Investments to 
promote water conservation technologies such as high-efficiency irrigation systems (HEIS) and 
laser-based precision land leveling (PLL) on-farm are of paramount importance for saving losses 
on-farm. HEIS is estimated to increase field application efficiency by 25 percentage points to 95% 
and PLL helps save water by about 30% resulting in increased yields and incomes. 

14. In KP, farmers’ productivity is generally low. Most crop yields in KP are low compared to 
other provinces and progressive growers. This could be attributed to large number of (80%) small 

 
7 So far the department lined 30% but the new findings and demand from the farmers suggest to increase it to 50% 



landholdings lacking scale and purchasing power; labour shortage due to out migration to cities 
and abroad and insufficient mechanization to off-set this shortage; shortage of skilled labour; 
insufficient private sector participation and services; lack of financial services; weak public sector 
research and extension services. 

15. KP has pockets with unique agro-climatic conditions, ideal for horticulture production. 
These include, among others, citrus, dates, pome fruits, potato, tomato, and onions. However, 
the current share of the subsector in the total cropped area is only 6 percent. With improved 
access roads to the main domestic markets and neighboring Afghanistan and air links to the Gulf 
and Central Asian countries, KP could potentially further capitalize on this comparative 
advantage.  

16. Postharvest losses are high. Lack of postharvest technology and management and 
modern cool chain infrastructure and inappropriate storage, packaging, and transportation 
facilities are major bottlenecks specially for perishable commodities in KP. Postharvest losses of 
35 percent to 40 percent for fruits and vegetables remain one of the most pressing problems, 
mostly given the lack of farmer’s awareness about scientific handling of farm produce. 
Inappropriate storage facilities, both in the public and private sector, register the highest losses 
during handling operations. Horticulture products are mostly stored in shallow pits covered with 
farm wastes without ventilation, without proper sanitation, and without preventive measures for 
insect and disease control. The concept of a cool chain network is in its infancy and integrated 
cool chain networks are mostly lacking. The existing cold storage facilities are unevenly 
distributed across the country with Punjab dominating with 512 units, while KP only had 16 units 
in 2009 (Planning Commission 2009). The cold storage facilities are based on old technology that 
do not differentiate for unique temperature requirements of crop species. Moreover, most of 
the existing packing facilities do not measure up to international standards. The types of 
containers used for transporting and storing products vary from place to place, but a common 
practice is to use whatever container is available. This causes the produce to be pressed hard in 
the crates or carried in oversized containers, causing huge loss.  

17. In addition, the agricultural marketing infrastructure and system is inadequate and 
lacks market responsiveness. Many wholesale markets (mandis) were built years ago, and are 
unable to cope efficiently with increased transactions. Serious traffic congestion, insufficient 
space for efficient movement of products in and out, inadequate storage, and improper 
management are some of the major factors for increased marketing costs and physical losses of 
farm products. Hygiene conditions, particularly in the case of fruits, vegetables, and livestock, are 
quite dismal. Excessive domination of commission agents, lack of physical and allied facilities, 
non-involvement of growers and consumers in market committees, and an ineffective market 
information system are some of the inherent problems of these markets and are putting farmers 
at a disadvantageous situation while selling their produce. In addition, the lack of planning and 
communication between demand and supply result in gluts at one time and shortages at other 
times, causing severe price fluctuations and loss of farmer incomes.  



18. The level of processing and value addition of agricultural products is very low in 
Pakistan. Only 3 percent of the total production of fruits and vegetable and less than 10 percent 
of milk are processed in the country (Planning Commission 2009). There exists enormous 
potential of adding value to various fruits and vegetable, such as freezing, drying, dehydrating, 
or crushing into powder, juice, pulp, oil, paste, sauce, chips, pickles, chutney, and jam. The culture 
of value addition through processing and diversification is still at infant stages in Pakistan. This 
small amount of processing leaves large opportunities and could also absorb some of the 
seasonal glut and extend the life of the raw material. 

19. The new government has increased the budget allocation to the sector and shifted its 
policy from higher productivity to higher profitability for smallholder farmers. The KP 
Government increased the budget for its annual development plans to US$62 million for 
agriculture and US$71 million for irrigation in FY17, which is still well below the needs. Key 
priority areas of the new government, as highlighted in the KP Integrated Development Strategy 
of 2014–18 and the KP Agriculture Policy and Strategy—a ten-year perspective (2014–24), are 
improving, among others, production, processing, and marketing, thus improving extension 
services; diversification into high-value agriculture (horticulture, livestock, dairy, and 
aquaculture); adaptation to climate change; on-farm water management (OFWM); development 
of new water resources; rehabilitation/modernization of the existing irrigation and drainage 
infrastructure; and governance. 

20. The World Bank’s last engagement with KP in the sector was for about six years from 
2001 to 2007 for a total of US$21 million made mainly in restoration/rehabilitation of the 
irrigation network from the secondary to the tertiary level. Major efforts were also made, in 
support of the national drainage program (NDP), in devolving the management to farmers, with 
powers to collect water charges and keep 40 percent for managing the operation and 
maintenance of the system from the secondary level downward. However, this outcome could 
not be sustained for long and has been rolled back by the Government. 

C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  

21. To enhance water management, productivity and climate resilience of irrigated 
agriculture in project areas. 

Key Results (From PCN) 

22. The project outcomes will be measured with the following indicators: 

a) Area provided with improved irrigation and drainage services; 

b) Increase in agriculture productivity (yield); 

c) Increase in areas cultivated for High-Value Agriculture; 

d) Area under climate-resilient technologies and practices (resilience); 

e) Total number of project beneficiaries (including number of female beneficiaries) 


D. Concept Description 

23. The project will contribute to the development of the agriculture sector by working on (a) 
water as an important input and limiting factor to productivity and overall production (b) training 
and technology for improving productivity, post-harvest management and value addition. More 
specifically, it will support six key priority areas of the government strategy for the sector, that 
is, improving performance/functionality of the delivery system and reducing water wastages; 
making water allocation/distribution equitable; increasing financial sustainability of the irrigation 
system management; increasing climate resilience; increasing productivity and promoting high 
value agriculture (production, processing and marketing); and strengthening the department for 
improved service delivery and governance.  

24. To consolidate the benefits of the project, priority will be given to schemes where all the 
three components’ interventions can happen together. In this way, the two departments of 
agriculture and irrigation will work in close collaboration, hitherto weak.  

25. The project will provide climate change co-benefits derived from: (a) adaptation, by changing 
irrigation management systems and practices to reduce vulnerability to climate change, by 
reducing water wastages and its negative externalities during delivery and by reducing losses 
during field application and crop growth stages; and by promoting innovative resource 
management practices to increase resilience, expanding the use of crops and crop 
mixes/rotations less vulnerable to climate variability, and expanding the use of protected 
agriculture and drought/heat resistant varieties; and (b) mitigation, by promoting sustainable 
water management practices that promote water use efficiency and by promoting agricultural 
intensification using higher yielding varieties, carbon sequestration species and cropping 
patterns, and replacing traditional sources of energy. 

26. Woman will be particularly encouraged and targeted to derive maximum benefits of the 
project and play role in the implementation of the project. The project will also ensure to 
safeguard the interest and needs of woman and marginalized groups e.g. providing for protected 
washing pads and animal drinking willows, and avoiding technologies and practices that increases 
drudgery for woman. Further, contractors, consulting firms and implementing partners of the 
project will be sensitized on gender issues and encouraged to achieve gender balance in their 
teams. The operational manual will spell out gender aspects and protocols for mainstreaming 
gender within project interventions.  

27. The project will be open to the entire province and will be completed in six years. The 
project will have the following components: 

Component A: Irrigation System Management (IDA $52 m US) 

This component will have the following three sub-components. 



28. Sub-compoenent-A1: Rehabilitation and reduction in in-equities: This sub-component 
would support the Irrigation Department to overcome the backlog of rehabilitation to fully 
restore the functionality/performance of the irrigation system; reduce the excessive and wasteful 
losses estimated at 25% by 7 percentage points; and increase economic/service life by at least 
10-15 years. This will include support to both the government and civil (community owned) 
canals systems. The government has prepared a prioritized list of 22 schemes, costing about 
USD140 million, for rehabilitation. The project, during the preparation, will conduct a diagnosis 
of the KP irrigation system, including the list provided by the government to, identify the schemes 
to be support by the project. The criteria for selection would include: vulnerability to climate 
change impacts; acreage and number of beneficiaries; potential for high value agriculture; 
poverty levels in the area served; and cost effectiveness (cost per unit area served). A Project 
Preparation Facility (PPF) has been discussed with the client for preparing detail designs and 
bidding documents for the selected schemes. The rehabilitation works would, usually, include 
flood eroded beds and banks; sunken earth filled sections; and damaged hydraulic structures like 
100ft up and down stream of the fall structures, off-taking points of minors and sub-minors, 
footings of overhead bridges; passages through settlements and deep cut areas; and catchwater 
drains for flushing flood water. Before rehabilitation work begins, any outlets tampered and/or 
illegally installed will be removed. 

29. Sub-component-A2: Institutional strengthening & Reform: To avoid buildup of further 
backlog, an understanding with the GoKP will be developed to increase allocation of recurrent 
budget for the O&M of the system by lifting the current cap that is in place for the last 10 years. 
This could be informed by conducting a study on the cost of neglecting (under funding) the O&M 
of the system. However, to make it sustainable in the long run, support will be provided to the 
department to improve its revenue generation capacity by improving collection of the water 
charges. The investments of component C, should help increase the farmers’ capacity to pay 
water charges by improving their crop productivity and switching to high value crops.  

Further support will be provided for training of staff; developing asset management plan; and 
developing water budgets and water balances estimates for the six-major government canal 
systems.  

The KP government has planned to develop the Provincial Integrated Water Resources 
Management Policy with support from the Bank managed MDTF funded Governance and Policy 
Support project. Support under this sub-component will be re-aligned with the directives of this 
policy.  

30. Sub-compoenent-A3: Future investments preparation: To increase availability of water for 
irrigation, households and livestock; support ground water recharge; reduce intensity of floods, 
siltation downstream by tapping hill torrents and splash floods in the rainfed areas, the project 
will finance preparation of feasibilities, detailed designs, and bidding documents for selected 
dams and irrigation schemes. The scheme selection will be based on criteria of number of farmers 
and acreage benefiting and cost effectiveness and poverty levels in the area served. 


Component B: On-farm Water Management (IDA $51 m US) 
This component will enable the Agriculture Department to support farmers including woman, to 
rehabilitate/improve existing and construct new watercourses; adopt water conservation 
technologies on their farms; and in training its staff. The component design benefits from lessons 
drawn from Sindh and Punjab Irrigated Agriculture Improvement projects. These include a) 
developing good database of watercourses with information for length, no. of shareholders, legal 
status; inclusion of tube-well watercourse; lining 50% length and all turnouts; seasonal work 
windows; monitoring dashboards; estimation of average costs; openness to the entire province 
b) empowerment of the farmers to select and negotiate price of the HEIS and PLL equipements 
with suppliers; training of farmers in crop agronomy; fixing maximum cap on project support per 
unit, c) ensuring geographical spread for laser land leveling promotion etc. The component will 
also finance the extended presence of consultants/firm for engineering supervision of activities 
to be implemented by the field teams of the Department. This component will have the four sub-
components, as follows; 
31. Sub-component-B1: Rehabilitation of existing watercourses: The rehabilitation/improvement 
works will be done on existing watercourses on government and civil canals; springs and tube-
well irrigated areas. This work will include lining of 50% length from the offtake point including 
selected critical sections; alignment; desilting; re-sectioning; installing all turn out structures; 
crossing culverts, washing pads and animal drinking willows. Farmers will contribute 20% of the 
total cost in the shape of skilled and unskilled labour and form themselves into water users’ 
associations with at least 70% farmers’ representation.  

32. Sub-component-B2: Construction of watercourses network: Construction of new 
watercourses network will be done in some new schemes areas where the Irrigation Department 
has already completed the upstream irrigation infrastructure but not the watercourses due to 
which farmers are unable to utilize water. The project support will include farmer’s mobilization 
and their formation of WUAs; engineering design, BOQ & cost estimates for construction of the 
full length of earthen watercourse; lining of 50% length preferably from the off-taking point and 
other critical sections; construction of all turn out structures, crossing culverts, washing pads and 
animal drinking points. Here again farmers will contribute 20% of the total cost in the shape of 
skilled and unskilled labour and form themselves into a water users’ association where at least 
70% farmers become members. 

33. Sub-component-B3: Promote water conservation technologies: To promote on-farm 
water conservation, technologies like HEIS and precision laser land leveling (PLL) will be 
supported on a cost sharing basis. These technologies will particularly suit at the tail end and 
tube-well irrigated areas. Farmers will be trained in growing high value crops under HEIS to make 
the use of technology economically viable. 

34. Sub-component-B4: Capacity building & institutional strengthening: The project will 
finance training of staff in new improved methods of on-farm water management and data and 
studies on the watercourses network. 


Component C: Agriculture Productivity Enhancement and Value-Addition (IDA 
$50 m US)  
The objective of this component is to improve the productivity, diversification, harvest and post- 
harvest management and processing & value addition in agriculture (crops, horticulture, fisheries 
and livestock sub-sectors). This objective will be achieved by i) strengthening public sector 
institutions (e.g., research and extension institutions) to solidify the foundation for sustained 
sectoral growth; i) investing in capacity building and iii) introducing modern technologies to 
farmers; and iv) support agribusinesses/ag-entrepreneurs for higher value addition through agro-
processing and commercialization services. This component addresses the climate change 
vulnerabilities to the agriculture sector, as set out in the project’s vulnerability context. All the 
activities under the Component will adequately reflect important CSA areas of productivity, 
adaptation and mitigation as highlighted in Pakistan CSA profile important for agriculture in 
Northern Pakistan. Considering that more than 70% of Pakistan’s female workforce is employed 
in agriculture, there is a special need to ensure all services provided by the Component will be 
more gender sensitive. The lessons drawn from similar projects, for example, the Sindh 
Agriculture Growth Project, have been incorporated to the Component design. The component 
will also finance the extended presence of technical consultants/firm to assist with planning and 
management of the Component. 

35. Subcomponent C.1: Modernizing public extension service and agricultural research (US$14 m). 
The sub-component will finance modernizing and rehabilitating extension and research facilities 
which have been identified as critical for the KP agriculture sector, such as the agricultural 
research centers, training centers and laboratory facilities etc. The subcomponent will also 
finance information and communication (ICT)-based technologies and services for delivery of 
agricultural extension and marketing for farmers and value chains, such as developing mobile 
phone APPs and other ICT tools (e.g., 24/7 call center, interactive websites, mobile training and 
demonstration centers etc.). The subcomponent will also support studies and data on the sector 
and training of staff. 

36. Subcomponent C.2: Capacity building of farmers (US$6 million).  The project will finance 
training and capacity building for famers, which will be based on training needs assessment 
carried out by the departments and their technical assistance providers. Training topics will 
include, but not limited to, good agricultural practices (including those specifically related to 
CSA), agribusiness management, negotiating in the market, basic accounting, and business plan 
development skills, etc. This will be done through demonstration plots, public information 
campaign, face-to-face training (farmers field school), domestic study tours and exposure visits 
etc.  Special attention will be given to climate smart agriculture related knowledge.    

37. Subcomponent C.3: Introducing modern technologies to farmers (US$20 million).  The project 
will finance investments to increase productivity, climate resilience and on-farm pre-and post-
harvest management of crops, horticulture, fisheries and livestock sub-sectors through 
technology (e.g., farm machinery, equipements, seeds, breeds, and infrastructure etc.).  This 



support will be provided on a cost sharing basis with 70% paid by the Project and 30% by 
beneficiaries on a first come first serve basis, with ensuring regional equity. 

38. Subcomponent C.4: Support agribusinesses (US$10 million). This sub-component will support 
agribusinesses (SMEs)/agro-entrepreneurs for improved services, commercialization and 
processing & value addition. This will include businesses like seed companies, nursery growers, 
fish hatcheries, animal semen producers, farm machinery & equipements providers; reefer 
transporters, chillers, ventilated & cold storages, pack-houses including graders, sorter; slaughter 
houses, pulpers, oil extractors, de-hydrators, tanners; trading centers like rehabilitation of fruit, 
vegetable, livestock and grain wholesale markets; introducing digital trading platforms and 
contract growing etc. The project will provide a competitive grant program with a transparent 
and efficient review and selection process. The grant size will be up to US$100,000, with 30% 
matching fund from applicants. The grant will be released in three tranches based on verified 
progress of proposal implementation. 

39. The component will provide climate change co-benefits derived from: (a) adaptation, by 
promoting innovative resource management practices to increase resilience, expanding the use 
of crops and crop mixes/rotations less vulnerable to climate variability, and expanding the use of 
protected agriculture and drought/heat resistant varieties; and (b) mitigation, by promoting 
agricultural intensification using higher yielding varieties, carbon sequestration species and 
cropping patterns, and replacing traditional sources of energy.. 

Component D: Project Management and Implementation Support (IDA US$12 
million) 

40. This component will support the establishment of the project management structure. This 
will include project administration, human resources including woman staff, procurement, and 
financial management; monitoring and evaluation (M&E); communications management; social 
and environmental safeguards management; and grievance redress and community feedback 
mechanisms particularly channeling the voices of woman beneficiaries.  

41. Citizen Engagement (CE): The populations targeted in the citizen engagement mechanism 
of the proposed project will be farmers and agribusiness owners receiving support to increase 
their yield/productivity and the commercialization of their products. The CE mechanism will 
assist the extension service and government officials in making more informed decisions about 
resource allocations, training and technology needs of farmers and agribusiness owners. Overall, 
the CE mechanism will enhance the successful implementation of the project, and guide the 
government in preparing better programs for farmers. A detailed citizen engagement mechanism 
and grievance redressal mechanism will be elaborated during the preparation phase of the 
project, and will be included in the project implementation manual. 

42. Gender. The project design and approach will reflect the need for taking account of the 
gender dimension and risks associated with knowledge and technology transfer. Project will be 
designed to ensure that it provides equal opportunities for women to participate in project 



activities. Climate-resilient agricultural technologies will be screened to ensure that they are 
gender-neutral. A comprehensive social assessment has been initiated as part of project 
preparation and is expected to result, among others, in a Gender Action Plan. 

   

  SAFEGUARDS 

 
A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 

 
The project will be implemented in various districts of KP. The land cover of KP changes from north to south. The 

Province sits primarily on the Iranian plateau and comprises the junction where the slopes of the Hindu Kush mountains 
on the Eurasian plate give way to the Indus-watered hills approaching South Asia. Geographically, the province could be 
divided into four agro-ecological zones on the basis climatic conditions covering temperature, rainfall, altitude and 
topography as developed by Environmental Protection Agency of KP:  
(a) Zone A – Northern Mountains covering districts of Buner, Shangla, Upper and Lower Dir, Swat and Chitral.  
(b) Zone B – Sub Humid Mountain covering districts of Haripur, Batagram, Mansehra, Abbottabad, Kohistan and 

Torghar.    
(c) Zone C – Central Valley Plains covering districts of Peshawar, Mardan, Charshada and Nowshera. 
(d) Zone D – Piedmont Plains (including Suleiman) covering districts of Bannu, karak, Lakki Marwat, Tank and DI Khan.  
The snowcapped mountains of Chitral and Swat have low vegetative cover above 4,000 meters. Mountains having 

altitude less than 4,000 meters have alpine forests (up to 3,300 meters). Altitudes between 3,000 meters to 1,500 meters 
have conifer and between 1,500 up to 900 meters have sub-tropical forests. These forests and plains provide habitat to 
98 species of mammals and birds including endangered species of snow leopard, brown bear, ibex, etc. The protected 
areas notified in KP includes 6 national parks, three wildlife sanctuaries, 38 game reserves, 90 community game reserves, 
16 private game reserves, 2 wildlife refuges and 8 wildlife parks. The combined area of all protected areas is 666,340 ha. 
The project activities are located in parts of Zone C valley plains and Zone D piedmont plains, which are are mostly used 

for agriculture and livestock grazing. Indus River and its tributaries are the main source of water for agriculture in the 
Province. Other major rivers that crisscross the province are  Kabul, Swat, Kunar, Siran, Panjkora, Bara, Kurram, Dor, Haro, 
Gomal and Zhob. 
 
B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 

 
The KP Government will be the implementing agency. The last time these two departments, Agriculture Department and 

Irrigation Department  implemented a World Bank project was in 2001-2007, and there the Irrigation Department had a 
secondary role. This leaves much desire for familiarity with and improvement in the understanding of the Bank safeguard 
policies. Therefore, safeguards capacity support, handholding and training will be provided throughout the project 
implementation to ensure that they have adequate capacity to respond to project safeguard issues. 
 
A Project Coordination & Management Unit (PCMU)—led by the Agriculture Department, will be established to manage 

implementation and coordination. Project Implementation Units one each in Agriculture (or two in its sub departments) 
and Irrigation Departments will be established to supervise technical implementation in the field. The PCMU will have a 
senior Safeguards Specialist as part of the PCMU Team. PIUs  at the two departments level will be supported by individual 
environment & social safeguards consultants. These consultants will work closely with the engineering supervision 
consultants, and will provide input into the project design as per safeguards instruments (such as ESMF, RPF, RAP, etc.). 
The senior Safeguards Specialist at the PCMU level will be responsible for the overall implementation and performance of 
the safeguards documents, while the day-to-day screening, monitoring and implementation will be the responsibility of 

d specialists at the PIU levels. The project will have a Project Implementation Committee (PIC) co-chaired by 
Secretary Agriculture and Secretary Irrigation and membered by heads of the PIUs, Chiefs of Water, Agriculture & 
Livestock from P & D, to review the progress of project components. The senior Safeguards Specialist at the PCMU level 
will be a part of the PIC. All project implementation and supervision consultant firms will be required to have adequate 
social and environmental safeguards specialists. The contractors for civil works will implement Contractor ESMP, including 
all necessary guidelines on labor health, safety and environment.  
 
Project launch workshop will be organized by the task team once the project becomes effective and will include a 

detailed session on safeguard implementation arrangements. 
 
D. Policies that might apply 

 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

The project activities involve irrigation infrastructure 
improvement, on farm water management schemes 
and production and post-production support to 
farmers and market actors. These activities are 
expected to cause some adverse environmental and 
social impacts. Overall, most of the impacts are 
expected to be during the construction phase and are 
likely to be temporary and reversible. Consequently, 
the policy has been triggered. Since project will also 
finance feasibility studies for dams, the scale and 
capacity of which is currently unknown. Based on 
existing information, the project has been categorized 
as Category A.   
 
The irrigation infrastructure improvement will overall 
improve irrigation efficiencies and help in ensuring 
availability of designed water flows at the tail-end of 
watercourses. However, improved infrastructure will 
not change the designed water allocations.Typical 
negative impacts associated with civil works financed 
by the project include land acquisition and 
resettlement; noise, air, soil and water pollution due 
to dust and exhaust emission and other wastes; 
vegetation clearance; damage to the existing 
infrastructures such as rural road, temporary water 
stoppages for irrigation, community and worker health 
and safety risks, etc. During operation, some potential

adverse impacts are forecasted such as water 
pollution and spreading diseases by human and animal 
wastes, pesticides use potentially causing water and 
soil pollution, excessive application of irrigation water 
causing leaching of soil nutrients and changes in soil 
characteristics, etc.  
Since the exact location of subprojects are not known 
at present and will be identified during project 
preparation and implementation, framework 
approach has been adopted.  Environmental and 
Social Management Framework (ESMF) along with 
Environmental and Social Management Plans (ESMPs) 
for the known priority projects will be developed by 
project appraisal. The ESMF will also include 
assessment of regional impacts on water quality, 
analysis of any possible changes in groundwater and 
downstream surface water availability. The ESMF will 
also include Terms of Reference for environmental 
and social impact assessment (ESIA) for the feasibility 
studies of small dams and environmental and social 
screening checklists/procedures for competitive grant 
program (project component C). 

Performance Standards for Private Sector 
Activities OP/BP 4.03 

No  

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 No 

Most of physical infrastructure investments financed 
by the project are rehabilitation and improvement of 
the existing infrastructures. Some new construction 
activities such as construction of watercourses in new 
command areas and small-water storage tanks will 
take place on the existing agricultural lands. These 
activities are not expected to convert or degrade 
natural habitat. Therefore, the policy is not triggered.   
It is important to mention here that the project is 
supporting preparation of feasibility studies for 5 small 
dams or irrigation schemes. The studies will include 
EIAs. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No 
The project is not expected to impact forests and 
associated ecosystems as envisaged in the policy. 
Therefore, the policy is not triggered. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

The project will not support purchase of pesticides. 
However, the policy is triggered because the project 
interventions may lead to substantially increased use 
of pesticides and subsequent environmental 
problems. Thus, to mitigate this impact the project will 
apply an IPM approach with an IPMP prepared. 


     

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 TBD 

At this stage, it is not possible to identify potential 
impacts on physical cultural resources (PCRs). 
However, final determination would be made by QER.  
Chance find procedures will be included in ESMF. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 Yes 

The project area extends across KP, including Chitral 
district which is home to the Kalash who are 
recognized as Indigenous People (IP); hence, OP 4.10 is 
triggered. An Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework 
(IPPF) for interventions in Chitral district will be 
prepared, consulted upon, and disclosed publicly on 
the client’s website (in-country) and by the Bank prior 
to appraisal. Indigenous Peoples Plans (IPPs), if 
required, will be prepared for specific project 
locations. 
Given the cultural sensitivity and tribal nature of the 
area, the social assessment will carefully assess 
potential project impacts on IPs and mitigation 
measures including grievance redress mechanism will 
be developed through free prior and informed 
consultation as required under OP4.10. 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

Small parcels of land will be required for project 
interventions. In most cases land needs will be met 
through Community or Voluntary Land Donations 
(VLD), the procedures for which will be laid out in the 
ESMF. In few cases small parcels may need to be 
acquired e.g. watercourses construction in new 
command areas (e.g. Bazai etc.). Certain interventions 
e.g. rehabilitation of existing water courses, may 
involve minor temporary impacts on livelihoods (due 
to restricted access; temporary dislocation) which 
could require small scale compensation. However, the 
impacts are not expected to be large scale. Hence OP 
4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement has been triggered. 
A Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF), and 
Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) for actual sites that 
may have been identified, will be prepared, consulted 
upon, and disclosed publicly on the client’s website 
(in-country) and by the Bank prior to appraisal. 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 Yes 

The project will not directly finance rehabilitation of 
existing dams or construction of new dams. The 
project activities especially investments for 
improvements in irrigation infrastructure may rely on 
performance of the existing dams such as Warsak Dam 
on Kabul River or Munda dam on Swat River. However, 
the exact location of schemes are not known at 
present. The project will also finance feasibility studies 



     

for dams, scale and capacity of which is currently 
unknown. The policy is therefore triggered to ensure 
due diligence and for adequate coverage of 
environmental and social aspects/impacts. 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

Yes 

The proposed project activities are located in the 
command area of tributaries of Indus river, which is an 
international water way (river). The proposed project 
activities under component 1 and 2 qualify to trigger 
this policy. The task team will consult LEGEN to 
determine whether waiver to notification to riparian is 
applicable. 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No 
There are no disputed areas as defined in the Policy 
where project interventions are to be undertaken and 
therefore this policy is not triggered. 

 
E. Safeguard Preparation Plan  
 
Tentative target date for preparing the Appraisal Stage PID/ISDS 
 
Sep 17, 2018 
 
Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed. The specific studies and 
their timing should be specified in the Appraisal Stage PID/ISDS 
 
1. ESMF by 30 August, 2018 
2. ESMP for first year schemes by 30 August, 2018 
3. IPMP by 30 August, 2018 
4. A Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) will be prepared to provide guidelines for project interventions that could 

require land acquisition, and which may lead to resettlement and impact on livelihood. RPF will be completed by 30 
August, 2018. 
5. RAP for first year schemes by 30 August, 2018 
6. Ingenious Peoples Planning Framework (IPPF) will be prepared by 30 August, 2018. IPPs (Indigenous Peoples Plans) for 

the first year schemes will be prepared by 30 August, 2018, where required.  
7. Assessment of regional impacts on water quality, groundwater availability and downstream water availability will be a 

part of the overall ESMF, as well as the social assessment. Moreover, given the cultural sensitivity and tribal nature of the 
area, all assessments will carefully assess consultations/GRM/FPIC requirements.  
8. All feasibility studies will include a TOR on E&S screening and social and environmental impacts analyses.

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 
 
1. India has sustained economic growth during last decade: India’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for 2016-17 is 
estimated at 7.6 percent, higher than the 7.2 percent for the preceding year, but lower than the projected 8.1-8.5 
percent for this year

1
. Sustained economic growth during the last decade, however, has contributed to annual decline in 

poverty by 1.5 percent, but income inequality has continued to persist. Emerging as one of the fastest growing 
economies, there has been significant upturn in key development indicators. Life expectancy at birth increased to 68 

                                            
1
Economic Survey 2016-17 



 
Years in 2014 from a low of 54 in 1980. India's per capita gross national income increased by about 338 percent between 
1980 and 2014, from $1,255 in 1980 to $5,497 in 2014. As a result, India has climbed five notches to 130th rank in 
Human Development Index among 188 countries in 2014

2
.  

2. Reducing poverty and creating jobs can fuel economy: Sustained economic growth notwithstanding, India 
remains home to 263 million poor people (80% of whom reside in rural areas) living on less than US$1.90/day. Expansion 
of the economy in recent decades has largely resulted in jobless growth. For addressing these issues, Govt. of A.P has set 
an ambitious goal of achieving an annual growth rate of 8.2 percent, reducing poverty by 10 percent (poverty in the 
State is on a decline and currently stands at 9.2%, as per Socio-Economic Survey 2016-17), and creating 50 million new 
jobs.. It has been argued that adequate attention to agriculture could fuel growth, create  jobs and reduce poverty. In 
the wake of consecutive low monsoon rainfall and consequent decline in farm productivity, agriculture has served a 
wake-up call, demanding attention from policy makers. 

3. Agriculture sector continues to lag behind: The issues of inclusive growth and gainful employment are major 
challenges in rural areas where two-thirds of the workforce resides. About 66 percent of the labor force is employed in 
agriculture sector which accounts for 14 percent of GDP, and is saddled with problems of uncertain growth. Per capita 
land and water availability is decreasing while high intensity rainfall events and dry spells are increasing. Land and labor 
productivity continues to be low. 

4. Agriculture growth is essential in achieving India’s development goals: During the last 25 years, agriculture 
sector has not achieved the envisaged growth targets. In 1990s and 2000s, the annual agriculture growth rate was 
around 3-3.5 percent and declined to less than 1 percent in the last two years (2014-16) due to technology fatigue, 
degradation of land and water resources, growing water scarcity, exacerbated by two consecutive droughts, floods, 
cyclones, heat waves, and declining international commodity prices. The growth in agriculture sector in 2015-16 has 
continued to be lower than the average of the last decade, mainly due to a second successive year of lower-than-normal 
monsoon. Report from the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare for 2015-16 indicates that the 
production of food-grains and oil-seeds is likely to decrease by 0.5 and 4.1 percent respectively, while that of fruits and 
vegetables is likely to witness a marginal increase. 

5. To fuel the agrarian economy, strategic shifts in agriculture would  be aimed  (based on the Socio-economic 
Survey 2016-17 projections) at: (i) towards high value vegetables, fruits, livestock and fish products; (ii) towards value 
addition in post-harvest segments; (iii) towards diversification and resilience of farming systems to address climate 
change effects; (iv) towards nutrition sensitive agriculture; and (v) finally a shift towards improved water use efficiency. 

6. Many new schemes have been launched to effect the proposed shifts in agriculture: Pradhan Mantri Krishi 
Sinchai Yojana will fast track irrigation coverage and improve water use efficiency in rural areas; Parmparagat Krishi 
Vikas Yojana aims to reduce input costs by promoting organic farming; Pashudhan Sanjivani, Nakul Swasthya Patra, and 
E-Pashudhan Haat have been proposed to improve livestock productivity. There is an enormous potential for harvesting 
gains from transformation of irrigated agriculture as production, consumption and agribusiness shift from traditional 
cereal crops to horticulture, livestock and fish production. India has a comparative advantage in having a very large and 
largely untapped domestic market, which reduces reliance on exports as the principal driver and consumer of agriculture 
growth. 

 
Sectoral and Institutional Context 
 
7. Andhra Pradesh is a leading reforming economy: Bifurcated on June 2, 2014, the present state of Andhra 
Pradesh (AP) is a middle income state with an average per capita annual income of INR 107,532 which is 15 percent 
higher than the national average. The state accounts for 4.95 percent of India’s land mass, 4.09 percent of its population 
and 4.44 percent of its GDP. AP is predominantly a rural state with 70.4 percent population living in villages and 
dependent on agriculture as the main source of livelihood. Despite severe challenges following the division of AP into 
two states in 2014 (AP and Telangana), the state has recorded appreciable progress in terms of the objective of 
achieving inclusive growth with noteworthy performance in both development and welfare sectors. In 2015-16, the 
Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) grew at the rate of 10.99 percent, compared to corresponding growth rate of 7.2 
percent for the country. 

8. The sector-wise growth rate is equally impressive. At 2011-12 constant prices, agriculture grew by 8.4 percent, 
compared to industry by 11.13 percent and services sector by 11.39 percent. The per capita income of AP at current 
prices registered a growth of 12.38 percent over 2014-15. This has led to decline in the incidence of poverty from 45 
percent in 1993-94 to 9.2 percent in 2015-16

3
. AP is recognized as one of India’s leading reforming states and in the last 

two decades has achieved significant development outcomes through sustained policy and institutional reform 
programs in which the World Bank has been an important development partner. Rich in natural and human resources, 
the state is keen to leverage its strengths through specific growth strategies tailored to achieve double digit growth. 

9. Agriculture sector has performed below capacity: The performance of the state agriculture sector, which 
accounts for 27.6 percent of the state GDP and employs 62 percent of the work force, has been a cause of concern. 
Between 1999-00 and 2013-14 agriculture grew at around 2.1 percent per annum with most of this growth coming from 
livestock, horticulture and fisheries sub-sectors. In 2015-16 these sub-sectors respectively contributed 26, 25 and 15 
percent to the Agriculture State Domestic Product (AgSDP). Land use pattern is critical for agriculture growth, only 38.31 
percent of the state’s geographical area is net sown (6.23 million hectares). Majority of the farmers are small and 
marginal with average landholdings of 1.06 hectare (ha). The main crops are rice, groundnut, sugarcane, cotton, maize 
and Bengal gram. Due to seasonality and scarcity of water supply, cultivation is mostly limited to only one crop per plot 
per year, with a cropping intensity of 126 percent.  

10. The productivity of major crops has remained largely stagnant: The reason for low productivity is because AP is 
one of the severely water stressed states of India with an average annual rainfall of 966 millimeters, and a coastline of 
974 kilometers that is vulnerable to cyclones. Agriculture in AP is highly exposed to extreme weather events like 
droughts, untimely and high intensity rains, floods, cyclones and hailstorms. Increasing erratic weather aberrations and 
climate change are likely to exacerbate vulnerability of agricultural sector. Of the net sown area of 6.23 million ha in the 
state, 3.15 million ha is presently irrigated through a combination of canals, wells, tanks, ponds and other sources. 
Although 40,817 tanks cover a command area of 2.56 million ha, the actual area irrigated by tanks has declined 
significantly from about 1 million ha in 1990 (24% of irrigated area at that time) to 0.26 million ha in 2015 (8.4% of 
irrigated area).  

11. Irrigation is the key to revival of the agriculture sector: Due to deficient maintenance and management of the 
tank systems, as a result of which most tanks are performing well below the capacity, the actual area irrigated to 
potential created varies between 35-55 percent depending on rainfall. Some 35,376 tanks having a command area of 
0.32 million ha have been transferred from Panchayat Raj Department to Minor Irrigation Department. The rapid spread 
of groundwater irrigation has been an additional contributing factor to the decline in tank irrigation, and has also led to 
a serious depletion of groundwater resources across large parts of the state. Since most of the tanks are in rainfed areas 

                                        
 

with limited possibilities of providing other systems of surface irrigation, their decline poses a serious threat to the 
fragile agricultural economy of these areas.  

12. Poorer farmers, often found at the tail-end of dilapidated tank/pond systems (Small Scale Community Based 
Irrigation Systems- SSCBI Systems) and lacking resources to access groundwater irrigation amidst low and falling water 
tables, are particularly affected. In response to the difficulties being faced by the agriculture sector, the State 
Government has substantially expanded capital investments for modernizing irrigation infrastructure since 2006-07.  The 
Government has also taken steps to strengthen participatory irrigation management and AP was the first state in the 
country to adopt participatory irrigation management (PIM) following enactment of the Andhra Pradesh Farmers 
Management of Irrigation Systems (APFMIS) Act in 1997.  About 6,400 Water User Associations (WUAs) were formed 
which collect water taxes for meeting operation and maintenance (O&M) costs of tanks.  

13. Institutional development through capacity building has contributed to the success of PIM, a process that has 
been significantly supported by externally funded projects. The Bank-supported AP Community Based Tank 
Management Project (APCBTMP), which concluded in July 2016, has made significant development impacts in the state 
by rehabilitating 2,157 tanks, which resulted in 32 percent increase in tank command area and contributed to increase in 
paddy, maize and groundnut productivity by 36, 72 and 97 percent, respectively. In addition, tank rehabilitation resulted 
in 388 percent increase in fish productivity. 

14. Agriculture sector is in need of a paradigm shift: The negative consequences of low agriculture yields extend 
from precarious incomes of farmers to large tracts of land locked in low value agriculture, despite growing demands for 
high value products such as fruits, vegetables, and livestock products. According to NSS data4, the average annual 
income of the median farmer net of production costs (of 1 hectare) from cultivation is less than INR 20,000 in 17 states, 
including Andhra Pradesh. Add high cost of cultivation, growing indebtedness, climate uncertainty, ineffective 
procurement, insufficient storage space and market linkages, and it makes agriculture an increasingly uneconomical 
activity.5 The crisis in agriculture sector is evidenced by the ‘Crop holiday’ (farmers abstained from farming) observed by 
farmers of East Godavari district in an area of 85,050 acres in Kharif 2011, which is further reflected in continuing 
suicides by farmers in the state. During 2015, 516 suicides by farmers were recorded in AP

. 

15. Primary Sector Mission seeks institutional convergence for maximizing profitability: To pull agriculture from its 
current abysmal condition, AP requires a new paradigm with the following components: increasing productivity by 
getting “more from less” especially in relation to water; prioritizing the cultivation of less water-intensive crops, 
especially pulses and oil-seeds, supported by a favorable price regime that incorporates the full social benefits of 
producing such crops, and backed by a market-linked value chain. To effect a paradigm shift, GoAP has proposed the 
Primary Sector Mission to converge independently operating sub-sectors viz., agriculture, horticulture, fishery, and 
agribusiness into an integrated farming system for maximizing profitability of small and marginal farmers from a unit of 
arable land. The proposed project will showcase an alternate approach for leveraging capacities of relevant departments 
to improve farm incomes, and make agriculture resilient to climate change.  For a clear understanding at the highest 
level of authority in the state to prevent further deterioration of the socio-economic fabric in rural areas (exodus, farmer 
suicides), a more comprehensive, longer term approach based around adaptive management in agriculture is required – 
particularly given the climate projections and their impact on the agriculture and water sectors in AP. The GoAP has 
evaluated the results of different initiatives taken during the previous years to develop a comprehensive long term 
strategy aimed at making agriculture in the state productive, profitable, sustainable and climate resilient. The state has 

also realized that a mono-cropping production system based on capital intensive irrigation infrastructure and 
technologies has its limitations under the present circumstances with climate variables.    

16. To unlock the full potential of agriculture sector growth, AP has stressed a strong need for policies and programs 
to focus on: (i) improvement of water use efficiency; (ii) intensification of cropping systems and diversification to high 
value crops and commodities; (iii) enhancement of post-harvest management and value addition; and (iv) improvement 
of the resilience of agriculture system in order to deal with increasing threats of climate change. By reorganizing PIM 
with regular administrative systems, AP envisions realizing the full potential of its water sector reforms by achieving a 20 
percent increase in water use efficiency over the next five years. 

Relationship to CPF 
 
17. The proposed project is fully consistent with the India Country Partnership Strategy (CPS): The proposed 
project is fully consistent with the India Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY 2013–17 to support poverty reduction 
and shared prosperity in India. The proposed project is aligned with two key pillars of CPS – ‘transformation’ and 
‘inclusion’. In line with ‘transformation’, the project aims to promote inclusive rural growth, development and 
dissemination of new agricultural and water management technologies, climate-resilient agriculture, enhanced market 
linkages for small and marginal farmers, and improved water and natural resource management (CPS Outcome 2.4). The 
proposed project will have positive impact in terms of environmental protection, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions 
by disseminating high efficiency irrigation systems, and promoting diversification to pulses and high value crops, which 
significantly reduce water and carbon footprint of agriculture (CPS Outcomes 2.5/2.6). 

18. The project is aligned with the Bank’s transformative and inclusive criteria:  With respect to ‘inclusion’, the 
project aims to enhance the livelihoods of small and marginal farmers through crop diversification, enhanced market 
access (CPS Outcome 3.6), and also by improving disaster management abilities of GoAP and local communities through 
enhanced design and restoration of smallholder irrigation infrastructure with better drought proofing and flood 
protection features (CPS Outcome 3.8).  

19. The proposed project will directly contribute to the achievement of 5 out of 17 United Nations’ Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDG), namely:  

Goal 2 – End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and ote sustainable agriculture, by enhancing 
income, food security, and nutrition of large number of rural population, where majority of AP’s poor reside. 

Goal 6 – Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all by investing in irrigation 
infrastructure, promoting a whole range of water saving technologies for irrigated agriculture, which uses 
about 75 percent of all water in the state. 

Goal 8 – Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent 
work for all by promoting a broad-based agriculture growth and employment in rural areas, where more than 
two-third of country’s population are employed. 

Goal 9 – Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation by 
rehabilitating and modernizing irrigation infrastructure (supply canals, water tanks) with enhanced resilience 
features of flood protection in about 1,211 tanks. 

Goal 13 – Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts and reduce GHG effects of agriculture production 
by promoting a wide range of water saving technologies and agricultural practices (SRI, micro-irrigation), 
expanding areas under pulses and high value crops, which consume less water, and also by enhancing 
awareness-raising, human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, and impact 
reduction. 

 
20. The project will also coordinate with other Bank-supported projects in Andhra Pradesh and at national level 
including Assam Agriculture project, Maharashtra Agricultural Competitiveness Project, Andhra Pradesh-Telangana 
Water Sector Improvement Project, National Hydrology Project, and National Groundwater Improvement Project to 
ensure synergy and enhance long-term project impact.

D. Concept Description 
 

. Description 
 
23. Project Rationale: The proposed project is seized of GoAP initiatives in ameliorating the current distress in the 
state farm sector. The biggest challenge for the state is to pull farmers out of the current crises. To achieve food and 
nutritional security, the issues related to growing water scarcity, degrading land resources, high cost of cultivation, 
stagnant farm productivity, and the impacts of climate change need to be systematically addressed. AP with 13 districts 
and 6 agro-climate zones has great potential for growth and profitability in agriculture and allied sectors (fisheries & 
horticulture). This is what the project seeks to realize by providing transformative direction to the agriculture sector by 
packaging and up-scaling relevant technologies and appropriate practices, and by supporting reforms (Primary Sector 
Mission) that could support more effective policies and management practices to improve the productivity of 
agriculture, animal husbandry, and fisheries to increase net benefits, and improve equity and livelihoods 

24. Alternative considered:  

25. In line with the Government of India’s policy imperative on getting ‘more from less’, especially in relation to 
water, the project proposes to improve SSCBI for realizing underutilized potential of decentralised irrigation system for 
benefitting small and marginal farmers for producing less water-intensive crops, especially pulses and oil-seeds, and 
creating a favorable procurement ecosystem towards improved profitability under emerging specter of climate change. 
 

 
 

 
26. Innovative design: The project design is consequently built on the key lessons learnt from the APCBTMP 
and from similar projects in other States (Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra), clubbed with the emerging need of 
integrating with climate variables, and value addition to the SSCBI Systems for reducing farm-level water footprints, 
and for enhancing carbon stock in farmers’ fields in providing a strategic direction to develop climate-resilient 
sustainable production systems. The innovative aspects will include improved designs of smallholder irrigation 
infrastructure for efficient capture, storage and delivery of rain water, strong focus on improving water-use 
efficiency, recent advances in intensification and diversification of agriculture, agri-entrepreneurship, and 
movement toward climate resilient agriculture with relevant agriculture-water related investments and substantial 
improvements of participatory irrigation management practices.  
 
27. Improved resilience of agriculture production systems is expected to be achieved under the project 
through improving soil organic carbon, higher water use efficiency, reducing crop water footprints through 
diversification, and increased adoption of technologies and practices for optimizing and sustaining productivity. 
Project activities will be complimented by the use of innovative information and communication technology (ICT) for 
enhanced efficiencies and faster turnaround time for delivering services to project beneficiaries, and new media 
technologies for real time reporting and data sharing among project teams working at different levels. 
 
28. The total project cost is expected to be around US$ 238 million, of which the World Bank will finance US$ 
170 million (70 percent of total project cost) and the GoAP will finance US$ 68 million (30 percent of total project 
cost). The project activities will cover the entire state of Andhra Pradesh (its individual components will cover 
different geographic areas) and will be implemented over a six-year period. The project activities would be grouped 
into four main components: (i) Improving Irrigated Agriculture Efficiency at Farm Level; (ii) Promoting Adaptive 
Sustainable Agriculture Practices; (iii) Post-harvest Management, Market and Agribusiness Promotion; and (iv) 
Project Management and Capacity Building. The individual components have been detailed below.  

 
Component A: Improving Irrigated Agriculture Efficiency at Farm level  (approx. US$ 110 million) 

 
29. This component would improve SSCBI systems to strengthen the integrated farming system (in which 
growing crops, agro-forestry and rearing of livestock co-exist) with reduced water footprints. It will consist of four 
inter-related sub-components: (i) institutional strengthening and capacity building (ii) improving Small Scale 
Community Based Irrigation System (SSCBI System) performance and resilience; (iii) improving water productivity 
and efficiency; and (iv) building synergy with the Primary Sector Mission (on agriculture, fishery, horticulture, 
livestock and irrigation). 

 
Sub-component A.1: Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building 

 
30. The sub-component would focus on engaging communities through water users’ associations (WUAs) in 
social engineering of project interventions. The Participatory Irrigation Management (PIM) will follow a distinct 
approach where better operation and maintenance (O&M) of rehabilitated smallholder tank systems will be 
dovetailed with irrigation outreach based on reduced water footprints through adaptive agriculture practices 
(Component B) at the farm level.This sub-component will also sensitize water users and ensure that a desired level 
of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission is managed at the tank level. Water use efficiency will be the leitmotif for 
creating a culture for ‘more crops, per drop’ through community based institutions for assuming greater 
responsibility towards making water-conserving crop choices for water conservation and management. The sub-
component will support in strengthening the existing WUAs and establish new WUAs for effectively developing all 
aspects related to efficient in situ water conservation and management practices. The component would enhance 

WUA capacity in grounding the concept at the farm level. 
 
31. In addition, the sub-component would relate to mobilizing water users for collective action through the 
vehicle of WUAs for ensuring local level participation in planning, implementing and managing the SSCBI facilities as 
well as establishing backward and forward farm-linkages with the external government, private sector and non-
government agencies. The proposed project would expand the scope of ‘SSCBI” beyond the ‘crop irrigation’ into 
others - fisheries, animal husbandry and domestic users. The spheres of intervention would include: (i) Policy and 
Governance - educating and enabling enactment of the existing legislative provisions and  exploring new vistas for 
establishing relation between different sets of water users; (ii) Physical and Engineering- creation of assets, 
including capacity building support for designing and implementing construction, as well as managing procurement, 
finance and quality control; (iii) Operation and Maintenance (O&M) involving physical sustainability and improved 
irrigation performance leading to enhanced production/productivity, incomes and food security; (iv) Social 
mobilisation - local level organizational development including leadership building and problem solving approaches, 
empowerment of poor and vulnerable sections such as women, Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes etc., and 
provision of capacity support and capacity building including observation and study tours; and (v) Economic - fixing 
and collection of water tariff and building of a corpus to enable further modernization and diversification, market 
penetration to enable establishing backward and forward linkages; and the related book keeping.  

 
Sub-component A.2: Improving  Small Scale Community Based Irrigation (SSCBI) System Performance and 
Resilience 

 
32. This sub-component will modernize irrigation infrastructure, including SSCBI systems and irrigation canals 
within a defined catchment and also use a cascading management approach. The modernization of irrigation 
infrastructure will focus on improving the bulk water delivery to irrigation systems through rehabilitation and 
modernization of approximately 1,211 smallholder irrigation structures. The expected works will include 
modernization of control structures (diversion weirs), supply channels, cross-masonry structures, de-silting

8
 of 

feeder and supply channels, construction of recharge well structures and strengthening and up-gradation of tank 
bunds, installation of flow measurement devices, up-gradation of distribution systems, improvements of irrigation 
and drainage canals, and introduction of modern quality testing devices to determine soil compaction parameters, 
as well as modern quality testing devices for meticulously maintaining specified cover to reinforcement steel in the 
construction of reinforced concrete structures for long term durability.In addition, relevant catchment treatment 
approaches will be considered for reduced siltation, reliable and dependable flow to cascade SSCBI systems. 

 
Sub-component A.3: Improving Water Productivity and Efficiency 
 
33. The objective of this sub-component will be to promote water saving technologies such as drip and 
sprinkler systems, and for implementing Participatory Groundwater Management (PGM) at assessment unit level. 
The investments will include catchment and command area treatment of SSCBI systems, including construction of 
group based mini-irrigation schemes (dug wells, shallow tube wells, water harvesting and groundwater recharging 
systems).For drought proofing and capturing flood waters, cascades will be linked. Robust automation systems will 
be demonstrated, which will enable spatial homogeneity in water delivery in these systems.  
34. Conjunctive use of surface and groundwater will be coordinated with crop planning and water budgeting. 

                                            
8
Considering economic and environmental perspectives, desilting of the tank will be limited only to remove silt from the tank bed to 

use for raising and strengthening tank bund during the rehabilitation of tank bund in such a way that sufficient area upstream of 

sluices is de-silted on priority to ensure free flow of water towards the sluices. 


Water sharing by groundwater users (with surplus water) with those without irrigation source will be promoted; and 
pipelines provided for efficient water distribution (as implemented in APCBTMP). Consolidation and linking of 
groundwater sources piloted in Anantapur district under the World Bank supported AP Drought Adaptation 
Initiative will be encouraged. All development and improvement activities will be included in an Integrated Water 
Resource Conservation and Management Plan (IWRCMP). A basin level ridge to valley treatment for water 
conservation and management in convergence with the activities of all the primary stakeholders and implementing 
departments will be undertaken. 

 
Sub-component A.4: Building Synergy with Primary Sector Mission 

 
35. For effective service delivery to farmers, various departments and entities involved in water, agriculture 
and related sub-sectors need to collaborate. For achieving this GoAP is working towards forming a consortium of 
knowledge stakeholders, including relevant state line departments, knowledge institutions, civil society 
organizations and other relevant national and international organizations to support planning, implementation and 
monitoring the activities of the Primary Sector Mission. The project will provide support to policy and institutional 
reforms for enhancing institutional capacities of relevant departments. The sub-component will provide incentives 
for capital investments, including through unlocking opportunities for crowding-in private sector investments. 
Support will also be provided for guiding, designing and implementing holistic strategy for the Primary Sector 
Mission.  
 

36. As an innovative design feature, the project will use information and communication technology (ICT) 
tools, sensors and remote sensing in two ways – (i) leveraging Internet of Things (IoT) technologies combined with 
sensors to remotely capture data and information on various aspects pertaining to minor irrigation systems such as 
water flows, water quality and (ii) use ICT and remote sensing products for monitoring and evaluation (M&E). 
 
Component B: Promoting Adaptive Sustainable Agriculture Practices (approx. US$ 79 million) 
 
37. This component aims to improve productivity of the tank systems and enhance resilience of agriculture 
production systems for increasing production and managing risks associated with climate variables. This would be 
achieved by diversification of farm production, introduction of climate resilient solutions, improving value 
realization at the farm level through improved post-harvest management, and strengthening farmer-market 
linkages. The component will provide incentives for capital investments by unlocking opportunities for crowding-in 
private sector investments. This component will have three sub-components: (i) Promoting climate smart 
diversified agriculture production systems; (ii) Innovation and technology transfer for fishery production; and (iii) 
Post-harvest management, marketing and agribusiness promotion.  
 
Subcomponent B.1: Climate Smart Diversified Agriculture Production Systems  
 
38. Sustainable intensification and diversification of crop and horticulture production systems will be achieved 
by awareness creation, on-farm demonstrations on new seeds and promising technologies, capacity building and 
training activities; and by leveraging private sector investments in water management and farm mechanization. 
Climate risk resilience will be built in agriculture production systems by promoting crop diversification from rice to 
low water requiring pulses, maize, oilseeds, millets, vegetables and fruits; cultivation of high yielding, short 
duration, drought-, pest- and disease-tolerant crop varieties/hybrids; complementary agronomic practices; and 
building ability to withstand biotic and abiotic stress through a large scale program of demonstrations, and training 
activities as well as investments in farm implements and resource saving technologies like micro irrigation systems 



to enhance water use efficiency and land productivity.  Component interventions will focus on irrigated command 
areas of the project, and   will also cover the rain fed areas in the project villages and cascades. The project will 
support operationalization of web-based integrated weather forecasting and water management system to 
provide real time crop advisories, including water, pest and disease stress, and implementation of mitigation 
measures and contingency plans. A baseline of Green House Gas (GHG) emissions from agriculture production 
systems will be established and would be regularly monitored for changes during the project period.  
 
39. The project will focus on increasing farm productivity by reducing ‘input’ costs and enhancing ‘output’ 
from farming systems on a sustainable basis. This will be achieved by (a) adopting diversified cropping system on 
‘navdanya’

9
 pattern to buffer weather anomalies; (b) promoting comprehensive, crop specific sustainable 

agricultural package of practices; (c) installation of integrated weather forecasting systems to provide weather-
based crop advisories in selected smallholder irrigation cluster areas; and (d) developing a mechanism to quantify 
crop resilience to climate variability, and creating a baseline for quantifying soil organic carbon and GHG emission 
from crop production systems. 
  
Subcomponent B.2: Innovation and Technology Transfer for Fishery Production 
 
40. Fish production has registered an average annual growth rate of 9.92 per cent in AP. Building on this, the 
component aims at improving fish productivity and profitability in the project tanks and ponds which offer high 
economic opportunities and benefits. The GoAP accords top priority to fisheries development in the state, and has 
released the Fisheries Policy and Plan for 2015-2020. Under this policy, the government has approved the fiscal 
benefits covering several sections of the industry, including production, processing, marketing and disease 
management for stimulating development of the fishery sector. 
 
41. The subcomponent will focus on strengthening research-extension linkages in order to improve farmers’ 
access to technology, and support participation of fish farmers in value chains. Project aims to promote innovative, 
climate resilient, and modern technology packages in production, post-harvest management and marketing. The 
project will (i) support multiplication of improved germplasm for quality seed production, (ii) introduce suitably 
formulated fish feed using locally available ingredients; (iii) demonstrate semi-intensive and intensive production 
models at appropriate locations in ponds; (iv) promote improved fish production techniques in irrigation tanks 
including innovative technologies such as cage culture in an environmentally sustainable manner; and build 
institutional capacity of the fishery sector. The project will facilitate suitable linkages for better access to markets, 
and support measures for maintaining hygienic conditions throughout the fish value chain. 
 
Component C: Post-harvest Management, Market and Agribusiness Promotion (approx. US$ 32 million) 
 
42. This subcomponent will enhance farmers’ linkages to markets by providing alternate marketing channels 
and promoting farm level aggregation, post-harvest management and value addition. The project will support 
organizing producers into farmer producer organizations (FPOs) and companies (FPCs); develop their capacity and 
skills for accessing wider input and output markets; and investment support to the FPOs for establishing common 
service centers for aggregating grains and horticulture produce. The expected benefits to the FPO members are 
higher prices through a combination of larger critical mass of saleable produce, thereby providing economies of 
scale, savings in transaction costs, and strengthened negotiation positions, coupled with the added value achieved

‘Navdanya’ means nine seeds (a traditional diversified cropping system which includes cereals, millets, and pulses), a system of 

farming that produces food while enhancing biodiversity, building soil fertility and conserving water. 



through primary grading and packing. The project will support integration of producer organizations in commercial 
value chains of agricultural commodities, and facilitate public-private partnerships to enable direct buying 
arrangements.  Key strategy will be market oriented agricultural production through collective marketing by 
farmer producer organizations. 
 
43. For mitigating price risks the project will support operationalization of Negotiable Warehouse Receipts in 
AP. For promoting agri-business ecosystem in the state, an Agri-Business Promotion Facility (ABPF) will be 
established. The ABPF activities will include conducting market and value chain studies on the identified 
commodities; establishing and operating mentorship programs; scouting new technologies (including climate 
resilient technologies); assisting small and medium private entrepreneurs to prepare business and financial 
proposals; and providing business planning and incubation services to emerging agri-entrepreneurs.  
 
44. The value chain for selected commodities will help to increase the share of farmers in wholesale and retail 
prices of the commodity. Some of the measures to achieve this include farmers’ participation in commodity 
exchanges, establishing storage infrastructure starting from primary, intermediate and transit warehouses for 
value addition. For high value crops, emphasis would be laid on demand based production, post-harvest 
processing, and creating forward linkages for direct marketing. Such a production and marketing system would be 
aimed at encouraging farmers to diversify into high value crops for additional income. 
 

Component D: Project Management and Capacity Building (approx. US$ 16 million) 
 
45. The objective of this component is to ensure smooth implementation of project activities, as well as 
monitoring of, and learning from project processes and outputs. Activities to be financed include: (i) setting up, 
supporting and capacity building of project management unit (PMU) to align with the project components at the 
state and district level; (ii) project monitoring, evaluation and promotion of learning culture at the PMU level; (iii) 
documentation of project processes and experience on a rolling basis, and its dissemination to the wider 
development community for cross-learning and sharing; (iv) hiring services of an external M&E agency as 
consultants for the duration of the project for creating a feed-back loop for improving project thrust and 
implementation; and (v) providing support for emerging needs and innovations during implementation; and 
networking with partner organizations, external professional agencies and the World Bank. 
 

  SAFEGUARDS 

 
A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)     

 
Andhra Pradesh is located on the east coast in peninsular India facing the Bay of Bengal. The State has three 
physiographic zones, the hilly region (having Nallamalai, Erramalai hills and the Eastern Ghats having an altitude of 500 
to 1400 m); the plateau (having an altitude of 100 m to 1000 m) and the deltas of rivers (between the Eastern Ghats 
and the Sea Coast).  It has a coast line of 974 km and its major rivers are   Krishna, Godavari, Tungabhadra. It has about 
21% of the geographical area under forest cover with 6 National Parks and 21 Wildlife Sanctuaries. It has an ancient 
religious/cultural heritage and Tirupati is one of the most popular temples in the country. 
 
The state is drained by three major perennial rivers viz. Godavari, Krishna and Pennar, several other medium and small 
rivers. In total 40 rivers drain into the sea. Rainfall varies from 560 mm in the Rayalaseema region to about 1200 mm in 
the northeastern coastal part of the state. The State receives about 66% of rainfall from south-west monsoon (June-


\and about 25% from north-east monsoon (October-December). The stage of ground water development is 
around 70%. Six Agro-Climatic Zones are recognized – Scarce Rainfall Zone, Southern Zone, North Coastal Zone, 
Godavari Zone, Krishna Zone and High Altitude Zone. The state experiences frequent storms, floods particularly in 
coastal areas and drought in the Rayalseema region 
 
The project activities will involve investing on repair and rehabilitation of about   1200 tanks spread across the  state.  
The interventions will include: improving water assets, modernizing irrigation infrastructure, improving water 
productivity, promoting adaptive sustainable agricultural practices, enhancing fisheries production and climate friendly 
agri business promotion.  Andhra Pradesh (erstwhile undivided) is known to be a leading consumer of agrochemicals in 
the country with 24% share and 21% share in pesticides alone. 

 
B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies     

 
Safeguard issues revolve around augmenting and/ or re-engineering the existing minor irrigation tanks along with 
water conveyance system and other associated activities related to enhancing production, productivity and incomes in 
the spheres of agriculture and fisheries.  The key intervention relates ensuring bridging of the gaps between designed 
and actual irrigable area with participation by the local water using communities.  Major challenge thus lies in 
mobilizing the local tank based community towards group action and establishing linkages with other public and 
private sector institutions. This has been addressed successfully under the first project (Andhra Pradesh Community 
Managed Tank Project) with the help of an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF). The proposed 
project would build on the same, but taking into account the latest legislative developments and expanded scope of 
the interventions, into agriculture and fisheries. Environment Management Plans (EMP) will be prepared for tanks that 
are known to be rehabilitated by appraisal. In addition, the project will develop a Pest Management Plan (PMP). All this 
points to adequate capacity for safeguards management with the borrower.  
 
The previous project has put in place a robust systems   in place and capacities are developed for managing the social 
and environmental impacts. Adequate number of experienced professionals too have been deployed for managing the 
ESMF.  However, as the follow on project’s scope is enhanced both in terms of the number of tanks and the 
interventions, GOAP has already initiated efforts towards re-visiting the ESMF. The learnings drawn the 
implementation experiences of the first project will be fed into this revision.  

 
D. Policies that might apply     

 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

The physical investments under the project would be 
largely on rehabilitation of existing water assets 
where improper construction could result in adverse 
impacts. The investments under productivity 
enhancement through sustainable agriculture 
practices could result in positive impacts with 
effective planning an implementation. 


An Environmental and Social Assessment will be 
undertaken and a Social and Environmental 
Management Framework will be developed for 
managing risks and maximizing the environmental 
and social opportunities. These will take into account 
experiences and learnings from the previous phase.  
 

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 TBD 
The rehabilitation of tanks may impact natural 
habitats such wetlands, which will be determined 
during EA. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No 
The project interventions are not expected to impact 
the forest areas. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

The project will not directly finance pesticides but the 
improved irrigation and crop diversification may 
result in increased use of pesticides. The project will 
work in synergy with the state primary sector mission 
and focus on climate smart agriculture production 
system which will promote the non-chemical package 
of practices. A Pest Management Plan (PMP) will be 
prepared for the project. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 No 

No significant adverse impacts on cultural property 
expected, but this issue will be examined during the 
ESA and appropriate measures will be put in place to 
deal with any chance findings. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 Yes 

AP state has a tribal population of 2.7 million 
amounting to 5.5% of the total population. A few 
pockets in three districts are predominantly inhabited 
by tribals and are covered under the Fifth Schedule of 
the Indian Constitution. So, project areas is likely to 
have tribal population. However,   investment plans 
are currently not known. Hence, to address such 
situations wherein the project is likely to be taken up 
in tribal areas, a Tribal Peoples Planning Framework 
(TPPF) will be prepared. 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

The project will not and need not resort to 
involuntary acquisition of lands as the existing 
irrigation tanks will focus of repair and rehabilitation. 
However, cases of encroachers on /within the Tanks 
cannot be ruled out. To address this, a Resettlement 
Policy Framework will be prepared. 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 Yes 

Some of the tanks could be large with high 
embankments above 10 m. The heights of the 
embankments will be known by appraisal for 
ensuring that appropriate mitigation measures are 
put in place for addressing any potential adverse 
environmental impact. This policy was also triggered 



 

during the previous phase and arrangements were 
put in place.  Already, a robust mechanism exist in 
the state, which will be further strengthened. Three 
region-wise Dam Safety Panels (DSPs) were 
constituted by the Government to function with 
technical guidance from the Chief Engineer, Central 
Designs Organization. 
The project will seek better coordination with the 
Dam Safety Panel and processes. The project will also 
support safety enhancement of tank systems as part 
of tank rehabilitation.

Concept Review 
Decision

I. Introduction and Context
Country Context
Building on its remarkable social and economic performance over the last 20 years, Bangladesh 
aims to become a middle income country by 2021; to achieve this will require among other that the 
GoB overcomes considerable challenges in agricultural development and rural economic growth. 
The country’s GDP growth averaged 5.8 percent between 2000 and 2010, accompanied by a decline 
in the national poverty headcount rate from 48.9 percent to 31.5 percent over the same period, 
effectively lifting some 16 million people out of poverty. Bangladesh, a country of over 160 million 
inhabitants, has also made noteworthy gains in education and health, and is well set to achieve most 
of the MDGs.  
Bangladesh remains a predominantly agricultural country and growth and development 
achievements in rural areas must be brought on par with those in urban areas. Agriculture occupies 


some three-quarters of the scarce land space of the country and supports the livelihoods of the 
majority of the population. While overall poverty has significantly declined over the 2000 to 2010 
period, the poverty headcount in rural areas (still 35.2 percent) has not declined as fast as in urban 
settings; moreover, the proportion of people living in extreme poverty in rural areas is still three 
times higher than in urban areas. The contribution of agriculture to the country’s economic output 
has declined over the past decade, but crops, livestock, forestry, fisheries still combine for almost 
one-fifth of GDP. Moreover, with some 70 percent of the population living in rural areas and over 
43 percent of the country's total labor force engaged in agriculture, achieving further economically, 
socially and environmentally sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction will require 
policies and investments conducive of lasting transformational changes in rural areas – including 
through technological innovations in agriculture.

Sectoral and Institutional Context
To eliminate the country’s extreme poverty by the year 2030 and to promote shared prosperity for 
the poorest 40 percent, agriculture  must continue to grow (in ways that are sustainable and adapted 
to climate change) and rely on a more diversified production base. Poverty reduction in rural areas 
depends crucially on growth in agricultural productivity, which is driven by investment in 
infrastructure, generation of new or improved technologies adapted to changing climate, and their 
adoption by farmers and other value chains actors (e.g. processors). Sustainable intensification and 
diversification of agriculture through technological change requires an efficient and productive 
national agricultural technology system, comprising agricultural research (technology development 
and refinement) and agricultural extension (technology dissemination and adoption). This needs to 
be supported by appropriate value addition and market linkages through smallholder participation in 
emerging/established supply chains for higher value agriculture. To achieve these strategic goals, 
the GoB has been seeking the support of development partners such as the Bank, to develop and 
finance activities aimed at boosting agricultural production through productivity enhancement, and 
increasing smallholders’ income.   
In Bangladesh, while the performance of the NARS has been impressive in contributing to food 
security (in particular with rice), research in some key sub sectors (e.g. livestock, fisheries) has yet 
to reach its potential productivity in terms of releasing a sufficient stream of useful innovations 
(including a range of new climate smart technologies for production and post-harvesting). The 
extension system has still extremely limited reach into the myriad communities of the nation (in 
particular for the fisheries and livestock subsectors were local level public extension workers are 
absent), and worse, hardly communicates with the NARS, or the relevant private and non-
government entities also engaged in technological advance. In short, the national agricultural 
innovation system is far from exploiting the systemic interactions that should drive it to success, and 
the insufficiencies pervade the system both within the subsystems, the all-too disconnected and in 
some instances less than strong elements of the NARS: public-private links are disturbingly absent, 
and links between research entities public and private with the higher education sector are sparse 
and severely underexploited. To enable agriculture and stakeholders to adapt readily when 
challenges occur and to respond readily when opportunities arise, the proposed project will seek to 
overcome some of the key constraints to increasing the efficiency and performance of the national 
agricultural innovation system. 
The National Agricultural Extension Policy (NAEP, 2012) and the Bangladesh Agricultural 
Research Council Act (BARC, 2011) provide the sector policy framework for the proposed 
NATP-2. NAEP advocates inter alia the development of decentralized, integrated, demand-driven 
agricultural research and extension services. Support is now required for the Department of 
Agricultural Extension (MoA) towards achieving the strategic objectives of the NAEP and as well 

as technical assistance for the Department of Livestock Services and the Department of Fisheries 
(both MFL) for the completion of their respective sector extension strategy/policy. The 2012 BARC 
Act aims at fostering the coordination of research activities conducted by the twelve NARS 
institutes, making BARC responsible for the allocation of resources among the NARS institutes and 
for the approval of the institutes’ research programs; it is among other things expected to reduce 
duplication of research efforts and enhance accountability. Implementation of the BARC Act 
remains a challenging process and requires additional financial and technical assistance. Further, 
there are some significant differences in the institutional capacity and performance among the 
various NARS institutes (with livestock and fisheries lagging behind), and the project is expected to 
strengthen the research agenda and outcomes for livestock and fisheries given the importance of 
these sub sectors for rural economic growth and rural livelihoods.

Relationship to CAS
Agriculture has long occupied a central place in the Bangladesh development agenda and in the 
CPSs of the WBG. In the CPS for FY11-14 (subsequently extended to FY15), agriculture is 
highlighted in Pillar 3, Vulnerability, Adaptation and Inclusion, although the sector surely 
contributes to the growth Pillar 2, and benefits from initiatives under the 4th Pillar of Governance. 
As the CASPR (Report No. 73983-BD) of November 20, 2013 notes concerning Pillar 3 Outcome 
3.1 on Agriculture and Food Security, program implementation has been ramping-up and is showing 
significant improvements in agricultural productivity as measured in crops and livestock 
performance. Recurrent natural disasters and deficiencies in technology remain the basic threats to 
improvements in agricultural production, and are therefore the focus of Bank interventions in the 
sector. IFC, with financing from the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience, is also assisting by 
supporting the climate resilience of agribusiness companies and their supply chains, and is 
exploring availability of low-cost housing and livestock protection structures in flood-prone coastal 
areas. Furthermore, IFC’s investment climate and advisory services include activities in agriculture 
that are complementary to NATP-2 (e.g. development of Seed Act and National Seed Policy, 
strengthening of sanitary and phyto-sanitory registration and certification system, development of 
the dairy value chain). The proposed follow-up to NATP Phase 1 was retained in the revised CAS 
for FY15 implementation.

II. Proposed Development Objective(s)
Proposed Development Objective(s) (From PCN)
6. The proposed project development objective (PDO) for NATP-2 is to enhance the 
agricultural productivity of smallholders through better research and extension and improve their 
market access through better integration in selected value chains. To that effect, NATP-2 will 
support a decentralized, demand-driven agricultural research and extension services, and promote 
market-oriented smallholder production. NATP-2 will also support access to markets for 
smallholder farmers by facilitating their linkages with selected value chains, contributing in turn to 
increased farm income and to the sustainability of farmer groups and producer organizations formed 
by the project. The following project design emerged as an outcome of the Identification mission: 
Comp.1: Promoting Agricultural Innovation, Comp.2: Supporting Crops Development; Comp.3: 
Supporting Livestock Development; Comp.4: Supporting Fisheries Development; and Comp.5: 
Project Management and Coordination. 
7. NATP-2 will achieve the PDO: (i) by strengthening the capacity of the NARS and the 
extension services to generate and diffuse agricultural technologies aimed at increasing farm 
productivity; and (ii) by promoting the sustainability of existing and newly created farmer groups 

and producer organizations by strengthening their linkages with markets. Sustainable intensification 
and diversification of agriculture through technological change requires an efficient and productive 
national agricultural technology system, comprising agricultural research (technology development 
and refinement) and agricultural extension (technology dissemination). This needs to be supported 
by appropriate value addition and market linkages through the strengthening of supply chains for 
high value agriculture. To that effect, while NATP-2 will continue supporting agricultural research 
and extension, it will need to have a stronger focus on market-oriented production, on value chains 
and on the participation of smallholders in those emerging market opportunities, than under 
NATP-1.

Key Results (From PCN)
(i) Client satisfaction (including for female-led households) with the agricultural extension and 
advisory services provided by the agricultural innovation system has increased  
(ii) New technologies generated by the agricultural innovation system have been adopted by 
producers (including by female-led households) and other value chain actors targeted by the project  
(iii) The increase achieved in agricultural productivity (for crops, fisheries and livestock) is 
larger for farmers supported by the project  
(iv) The proportion of smallholder agricultural production marketed relative to total smallholder 
farm output has increased 
(v) The women-led Common Interest Groups for homestead gardening are making a significant 
contribution to improving nutrition in participating households

III. Preliminary Description
Concept Description
NATP-2 will achieve the PDO by: (i) continuing to strengthen the capacity of the NARS and 
extension services to generate and disseminate agricultural technologies aimed at increasing farm 
productivity; and (ii) promoting the sustainability of existing and new farmer groups and producer 
organizations by strengthening their linkages with markets. Sustainable intensification and 
diversification of agriculture through technological change requires an efficient and productive 
national agricultural technology system, comprising agricultural research (technology development 
and refinement) and agricultural extension (technology dissemination). This needs to be supported 
by appropriate value addition and market linkages through the development of supply chains for 
high value agriculture. To that effect, while NATP-2 will continue supporting agricultural research 
and extension, it will need to have a much stronger focus on market-oriented production, on value 
chains and on the participation of smallholders in those emerging market opportunities, than under 
NATP-1. A differentiated approach will be required for project activities at field level to account for 
the vertical and horizontal scaling up efforts under NATP-2. The new project will deepen the 
interventions in existing upazillas (vertical scaling up) while expanding the geographic coverage to 
include new districts and upazillas (horizontal scaling up) . 
The project design for NATP-2 takes into account some of the shortcomings identified under 
NATP-1 and reflects the integrated approach required to achieve the PDO. NATP-2 includes a 
broader component that addresses the multiple dimensions required for decentralized, demand-
driven agricultural research as a core pillar of an agricultural innovation system in the country 
context. The project further includes three sub sector components, each tackling specific constraints 
to the development of selected commodities from technology generation to transfer and adoption at 
farm level, to market-oriented production and agro processing. This value chain approach is 
expected to lead to a better integration of research and extension, which was regularly reported in 

NATP-1 as an area requiring further improvement. Finally, the project includes a component that 
covers most cross-cutting activities as well as regular project management tasks. Project 
components, their objectives and contribution to the PDO, as well as the core activities covered, are 
described below. 
 
Component 1: Enhancing the Agricultural Innovation System 
This component, led by the Project Management and Coordination Unit with implementation 
support from other agencies, will support the development of decentralized, demand-driven and 
integrated agricultural research. This component will likely include investments, capacity 
enhancement and technical assistance in areas launched under NATP-1 (such as sustainability of 
Common Interest Groups (CIGs) and emerging Producer Organizations (POs), rehabilitation of 
rural markets, technical advisory services), strengthening National Agricultural Research Institutes  
(NARI) (including investments in physical infrastructure), developing one-stop farmer advisory 
service centers. The component will also include the window for competitive research and matching 
grants under the Agricultural Innovation Fund.   
 
Component 2: Supporting crop development  
This component, coordinated by the Department of Agricultural Extension, will support the 
development of decentralized extension services and demand-driven research for crop production 
(including horticulture), post-harvest management and processing, and facilitate the integration of 
smallholder farmers in selected crop-based value chains (bananas, vegetables, and aromatic rice). 
This component would include investments, capacity enhancement and technical assistance in e.g. 
smallholder farm mechanization, seed testing facilities (with IFC), an electronic phytosanitary 
certification system (with IFC), food safety, agricultural commercialization, and promotion of 
smallholder-based commodity value chains. Financial incentives to smallholder farmers for the 
adoption of productivity enhancing and post-harvest loss reducing technologies, as well as support 
to private small and medium agro entrepreneurs in the selected value chains (e.g. food processing) 
will be secured through the corresponding AIF window.  
 
Component 3: Supporting fisheries development  
This component, coordinated by the Department of Fisheries, will support the development of 
decentralized extension services and demand-driven research for fish and aquaculture, and facilitate 
the integration of smallholder fish farmers in selected commodity value chains (tilapia, major carps, 
and shrimps). This component would include investments, capacity enhancement and technical 
assistance in e.g. the rehabilitation of fish ponds, food safety, quality improvement of fish feed and 
fingerlings, fish commercialization and the promotion of aquaculture-based commodity value 
chains. Financial incentives to smallholder farmers for the adoption of productivity enhancing and 
post-harvest loss reducing technologies, as well as support to private small and medium agro 
entrepreneurs in the selected value chains (e.g. food processing) will be secured through the 
corresponding AIF window. 
 
Component 4: Supporting livestock development  
This component, coordinated by the Department of Livestock Services, will support the 
development of decentralized extension services and demand-driven research for livestock products, 
and facilitate the integration of smallholder farmers in selected commodity value chains (dairy, goat 
meat). This component would include investments, capacity enhancement and technical assistance 
in e.g.: laboratory infrastructure and equipment (including at the regional level), artificial 
insemination, fodder production and conservation, efficient biogas production, farm mechanization, 




food safety, and the promotion of livestock-based commodity value chains. Financial incentives to 
smallholder farmers for the adoption of productivity enhancing and post-harvest loss reducing 
technologies, as well as support to private small and medium agro entrepreneurs in the selected 
value chains (e.g. food processing) will be secured through the corresponding AIF window. 
 
Component 5: Project Management and Coordination 
Under this component a Project Management and Coordination Unit will be in charge of overall 
day-to-day project management and implementation, as well as coordination among the project 
PIUs from the Ministry of Agriculture and Ministry of Food. The PCMU will have the operational, 
safeguards and fiduciary responsibility and be accountable for overall project performance. The 
PCMU will carry out procurement and financial management activities. Other specific PMU-led 
activities under this component will include among others: (i) the support to the development of a 
national agricultural atlas, (ii) the coordination of third-party project monitoring and impact 
evaluation (with baseline, midline, endline surveys), (iii) the coordination of analytical studies and 
dissemination of findings, (iv) the support to short- and longer term assistance to the project 
management team and other agencies involved in component implementation, (v) the coordination 
of all staff training and (vii) preparation studies for a potential follow-up operation (phase III of 
NATP).

B. Introduction and Context

Country Context
1.      During the last decade, India’s economy expanded at an average annual rate of 7.6 percent, 
and projections are for the high growth rate to continue.  Despite the headline figures on growth, 
concerns linger about the pattern of growth. India continues to face daunting challenges in 
reducing the number of poor, creating jobs, and achieving shared prosperity. Long term 
agricultural growth remains volatile, fluctuating around 3 percent per year.  With India’s labor 
force predominantly in rural areas, and about 68 percent employed in agriculture, the political, 
social and economic importance of agriculture continues. 
 
2.      The Government of India (GoI) recognizes the important role of agriculture in the ongoing 
rural-urban transformation process and the potential it represents as an important source of growth 
and job creation.  The GoI also recognizes the necessity of strategic shifts for structural 
transformation of Indian agriculture to tap into this potential of growth and job creation.  These 
shifts reflect underlying trends in demand for food and factors affecting the supply of agriculture 
produce, and include:  (i) a shift away from a focus on foodgrain production towards 
diversification into high value agriculture production of fruits, vegetables, dairy, etc.; (ii) a shift 
away from a focus on on-farm production towards value addition in the post-harvest segments of 
agriculture value chains; (iii) a shift away from a focus on productivity towards resilience of 
agriculture production systems for addressing the effects of climate change; and (iv) a shift away 
from a focus on agriculture production towards nutrition sensitive agriculture. 
 
3.       To facilitate these four shifts, GoI has launched a number of policies and initiatives since 
2014. These include, among others, a technology driven second green revolution with a focus on 
higher productivity and diversification; a “National Adaptation Fund” to meet the challenges on 
climate change; a nationwide District Level Incubation and Accelerator Programme” focusing on 
micro, small and medium enterprise (MSME) sector; and a scheme for promotion of a National 
Agricultural Market to accelerate the integrated development of agriculture marketing and trade. 
 
4. Consumer demand for food commodities in India is rapidly changing, fueled by strong 
economic growth.  The structural shift in consumption pattern away from cereals to high value 
agricultural commodities is seen both in rural and urban areas.  This in turn is generating growing 
domestic demand for higher quality/value agricultural commodities (including animal proteins) as 
the share of cereals and staples in food expenditure declines, whilst that of animal proteins, fruits 
and vegetables increases.  This provides opportunities for farmers to obtain higher incomes from 
increasingly smaller holdings. 
 
5. Signaled by changes in consumers’ food baskets, India’s agriculture and agri-food marketing 
system is poised for a profound transformation.  The agri-food marketing system is changing from 
ad hoc transactions towards coordinated systems like cooperatives, producers’ associations and 
contract farming.  Public policy has been proactive in facilitating this transformation.  The central 
and state governments have taken important policy initiatives, such as de-regulation of food 
industry, enactment of an integrated food law, de-monopolization of agricultural markets, 
reduction in excise duties on manufactured food products, and priority sector lending to food 
industry to strengthen agriculture-industry linkages. 

Food processing is a “sunrise sector” and its share in GDP is on a continuous rise, with a 
compound annual growth rate of 8.4 percent. According to the Annual Survey of Industries 
2012-13 the food processing sector ranks first amongst all industry groups, both in terms of total 
number of factories (16%) and  number of factories in operation (16%), and third in terms of total 
output (12%), next only to ‘coke and refined petroleum products’ and ‘basic metals’.  More 
importantly, this sector is the largest employer amongst all industry groups, accounting for 11.59 
per cent of industry employment in India.  Its employment intensity can be seen by the fact that 
for every INR 1 million invested, 18 direct jobs and 64 indirect jobs are created in organized food 
processing industry.  Furthermore, food in India has an economic multiplier of 2-2.5, thus 
implying that not only the food products industry can be the antidote for India’s jobless growth, 
but that such a scenario may come at a relatively low (fixed capital) cost. 
 
7. Transition to high value commodities and opportunities in agro-food processing underscores 
the enormous potential for commercialization and income growth in agriculture (including small 
holder) as production, consumption and trade shift from traditional food crops to horticulture and 
other non-traditional (high value) commodities.  Moreover, relative to other countries, India has 
considerable comparative advantages in having a very large (growing and largely un-tapped) 
domestic market, which reduces reliance on exports as the principal driver for near term 
agriculture growth.  Nonetheless, beyond the domestic market there are also strong comparative 
and competitive advantages in developing high value agricultural trade, which is currently 
negligible.
Sectoral and Institutional Context
8. In Assam, agriculture and related sectors are the principal occupation of the vast majority of 
rural population in terms of employment and livelihood. About 90 percent of state’s population 
lives in rural areas and is mostly dependent on agriculture for their livelihoods.  Agriculture and 
the allied sectors directly or indirectly support more than 75 percent of the population, providing 
employment to about 50 percent of the total workforce.  While the average operational holding in 
India is 1.10 hectare, Assam’s farmer families are predominantly small and marginal (85%) with 
an average land holding of only 0.63 hectare. 
 
9.      The recently concluded the Assam Agricultural Competitiveness Project (AACP) was 
instrumental in increasing cropping intensity, on-farm productivity and diversification of 
agriculture in the state. Supported by AACP and other Government of Assam (GoA) initiatives, 
high value horticulture has seen a significant growth in production - the annual growth rate of 
production of fruits, spices and vegetables was 19.2, 6.4 and 72.2 percent respectively in the last 
decade, with Assam contributing significantly to national production in commodities like ginger, 
banana, pineapple, litchi, etc. As such AACP has laid the foundations for long term agriculture 
transformation in the state by shifting the focus from rice production towards diversification into 
high value agriculture production (vegetables, spices, fish, dairy etc.).  This move towards higher 
value products offers opportunities to increase contribution of agriculture to Assam’s growth. 
 
10. Diversification to higher value commodities and opportunities in specialized commodities 
reflect significant opportunities and challenges for farming communities in Assam:  growing 
specialized commodities would need adoption of rapidly changing technologies and quality 
standards.  Smallholder farmers face significant challenges in learning about and adopting rapidly 
changing agriculture technologies.  The Bank supported AACP has successfully introduced the 
Agricultural Technology Management Agency (ATMA) model, a participatory, decentralized 



planning, funding and implementation of technology dissemination to district, block and village 
levels in partnerships with farmer groups, and different line departments.  While the ATMA 
platform has introduced improvements in technology transfer and demand driven extension, the 
current approach focuses mainly on production related issues.  Its capacity needs to be 
strengthened to enhance the ability of farmers to adopt efficient and market led production and 
post-harvest practices for meeting the volume, timing and quality requirements of different 
markets. 
 
11. The key constraints in structural transformation of agriculture in Assam are limited market 
access, poor post-harvest handling infrastructure and fragmented supply chains:  agriculture 
marketing in Assam is characterized by a multiplicity of regulatory authorities in the state (viz., 
local panchayats, municipalities and state agriculture marketing board).  Reforms would be 
needed not only to harmonize the regulatory regime in the state, but also for the development of 
alternative marketing options for farmers.  The supply chain is characterized by the dominance of 
middlemen at different levels, involving pre-harvest contractors, forwarding agents, commission 
agents, wholesalers, sub-wholesalers and retailers.  The existence of multiple intermediaries 
causes prices to snowball with each transaction.  Despite the comparative production advantage in 
agriculture and allied commodities, and emerging marketing opportunities, conversion of this 
advantage into competitive food processing industries has proved to be a challenge in the state.  
There is low investment in assets and limited technology penetration across the food processing 
sector in the state, even though this sector contributes about 22 percent of the industrial output 
and represents 26 percent of gross value add of the state.  The food processing sector is largely 
unorganized and operates on a small scale.  Facilitating the development of organized Micro, 
Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) both for value addition and job creation, would require 
handholding, business facilitation services, and facilitation of access to financing, along with 
critical regulatory changes for agro and allied MSMEs to flourish in the state. 
 
12.     GoA recognizes that creating conditions for agriculture based rural transformation in the 
long term would require:  (i) a shift away from a focus on on-farm production towards value 
addition in the post-harvest segments of agriculture value-chains; (ii) a focus on productivity 
towards resilience of agriculture production systems in order to deal with the effects of climate 
change; and (iii) creating the necessary conditions for the emergence of a dynamic agri-business 
and enterprise sector in Assam.  Furthermore, GoA at the highest level is committed to 
transforming the agriculture and allied sector to a more commercial and market oriented 
production; promoting MSMEs and implementing necessary reforms for realizing the project 
goals. GoA has also stated its intention that this project will form the nucleus of a much larger 
government agribusiness and rural transformation program. Fundamentally this will involve 
mainstreaming of project’s initiatives in government programs and policies as well as 
convergence of various public programs to deliver along the objectives enshrined in this project. 
Especially the government will oversee the refocusing and strengthening of training and human 
resources program to support (agriculture) enterprise development activities in Assam.
Relationship to CAS/CPS/CPF
13.   The proposed World Bank support to this project is consistent with the current Country 
Partnership Strategy (CPS) for India (2013-2017). The CPS outlines Bank support to India under 
the three pillars of integration, transformation and inclusion with a cross-cutting focus on 
improving governance, environmental sustainability and gender equality.  The proposed project is 
aligned along at least two of these three pillars – transformation, and integration.  Under 
transformation, the project will directly help achieve one of the intended outcomes of the CPS, 



which is increase investor confidence and inward financial flows into the agriculture sector (CPS 
para 43).  The broader objective would be to instill a collective entrepreneurial spirit where 
producers shift from being “price takers” of primary produce, with no or very little influence over 
the market to being more business and value focused.  A key project thrust will be on enhancing 
agglomeration of producers to improve economies of scale in producing, processing and 
marketing.  In parallel with this, the project will support agriculture and livestock productivity 
(including value and incomes) through essential technology transfer in production and improved 
post-harvest and market operations, and also explore and pilot possible financing modalities to 
support entrepreneurship and agri-business (CPS outcome 2.4 para 86 and 89).  Overall, the 
support of the project to the development of higher value commodities and more efficient supply 
chains will underpin ongoing structural transformation of the economy (CPS para 34).  Under 
integration, the project offers the opportunity to increase gross state domestic product (GSDP) 
growth by stimulating private sector investment and agri-enterprise development in Assam, a 
special category state. (CPS, Outcome 1.4).  
 
14.   The project will also leverage the pent-up demand and natural resource advantages of the 
state as well as improve the investment climate (CPS para 72).  In particular, the focus will be on 
processed food, agribusiness, logistics and infrastructure, and MSME finance and insurance. The 
project will establish a new standard of excellence for entrepreneurship and business skills 
training by improving skills and knowledge transfer from trainers to MSMEs (CPS, Outcome 
1.3). Furthermore, the proposed project is aligned with the WBG’s goal of promoting shared 
prosperity.

C.  Proposed Development Objective(s)

Proposed Development Objective(s) (From PCN)
15. The proposed Project Development Objective (PDO) is to “increase value-added and 
improve resilience in the production and processing of selected agriculture commodities, focusing 
on small farmers and agro-entrepreneurs in targeted districts”.  
 
16. Project beneficiaries will include farmers and entrepreneurs especially in the MSME 
segment.  Others would include farmer producer organizations, sector management companies, 
and other value chain participants.  During preparation, specific attention would be given to 
gender inclusion in project design and implementation arrangements. The methodology followed 
to identify targeted districts is elaborated in the Annex 3, attached to the PCN.

Key Results (From PCN)
17. The Key Project Indicators (KPI) will be:  
 
a) Increase in value addition by agri-enterprises; 
b) New agri-enterprises established in the targeted districts; 
c) Number of jobs created, including for women (percent); 
d) Increase in value of agricultural marketed output per farm (in formal partnership);  
e) Increase in market oriented production – (% of farmer and area under cultivation); and  
f) Direct project beneficiaries (number), of which female (percentage).

D.  Concept Description

18.   The proposed project would support, value addition in the production and post-harvest 
segments of selected agriculture value-chains; facilitate agribusiness investments through 


inclusive business models that provide opportunities to small farmers as well as stimulate the 
establishment of new small and medium agribusiness enterprises; and support resilience of 
agriculture production systems in order to better manage increasing production and commercial 
risks associated with climate change, in the targeted districts . The project would adopt a cluster 
strategy within the targeted districts to generate economies of scale; promote vertical and 
horizontal links between local agricultural enterprises; enable diffusion of innovations; leverage 
network externalities; and channel public support for services and infrastructure. By adopting a 
cluster approach, the project would enable all the value chain participants to develop competitive 
and innovative products that meet market demands rapidly and successfully. 
 
19.    The project would achieve the PDO by:  (i) promoting investments in agri-enterprises, 
reducing the business and transaction costs, facilitating access to finance for agribusiness 
entrepreneurs, and, where appropriate, push for process, regulatory and/or policy change; (ii) 
supporting the development of a modern supply chain; improved information communication 
technologies (ICT) based farm information and intelligence services, and alternative marketing 
channels; and (iii) improving producer’s access to knowledge, technologies and infrastructure so 
that they are able to respond to market opportunities and climate variability. 
 
20.    By simultaneously intervening along multiple dimensions of the growth nexus (business 
environment, key infrastructure, access to basic services, local governance), the proposed project 
aims to remove key constraints to business development and strengthen the platform for growth in 
agriculture and allied sectors within targeted districts.  By doing so, it will contribute to the key 
aspects of the GoI, GoA and the Bank’s CPS strategic objectives related to faster and broader 
agriculture sector growth and inclusive development. In line with the PDO, the project will have 
the following components. 
 
Component A: Support to Agri Enterprise Development 
 
21. The focus of this component to enhance the pace of agricultural enterprise growth and 
employment in the targeted districts.  This would be done by establishing a cohesive institutional 
platform, and securing increased private sector investment in the development of value chains, 
processing and marketing in the targeted districts. 
 
Component B: Farm - Market Infrastructure Development 
 
22. The focus of this component is to establish a modern supply chain from farm to market that 
would enable farmers and other value chain participants to access new markets. This would be 
done by enabling secondary and tertiary processing that creates higher value for the produce; 
improving value realization at the farm level through improved sorting, grading and packing of 
produce that enhances the average price realized; supporting a supply chain infrastructure that 
prevents wastage and value erosion in transportation, and allows access to more distant markets; 
and supporting the development and up-gradation of basic and agriculture-specific infrastructure, 
including transportation linkages, warehousing capacity and wholesale market facilities. 
 
Component C: Market-led Production and Resilience Enhancement 
 
23.  The focus of this component is to enable farmers in the targeted districts to take advantage of 
the rapidly changing consumer demand and ensuring resilience of agriculture production systems 


in order to better manage increasing production and risks associated with climate change.  This 
would be done by diversification of their farm production; and introduction of climate resilient 
solutions. 
 
Component D: Project Management, Monitoring and Learning 
 
24. This component will ensure effective implementation of the project activities and monitor and 
evaluate project implementation progress, outputs and outcomes, building on implementation 
experience of AACP.  The component will support: (i) establishment and operations of a Project 
Coordination Unit (PCU), which will oversee and coordinate activities of the implementing 
agencies of the project; (ii) establishment and operations of Project Implementation Units in the 
respective implementing agencies; and (iii) setting up of a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) 
system for the project, including a project management information system, and contracting an 
external M&E agency to monitor project activities and impact. This component will also finance 
dedicated staffing for the project activities, consultancies, training and related material, office 
equipment, and incremental operational costs. The Project will provide investment and technical 
support for the establishment of a sound management information system and information and 
communication technology (ICT) systems and accompanying capacity strengthening of key 
personnel. 
 
25.      Green House Gas (GHG) Accounting: In accordance with guidelines for IDA 17 projects, 
GHG accounting for the proposed Project will be undertaken during the preparation phase. This 
analysis will help to measure the impact of the project on the GHG footprint and also guide 
investments that contribute to climate mitigation, given that world-over agriculture investments 
account of 25% of the GHG emissions. The conceptual framework of the proposed project 
indicates there could be reduced GHG emissions and carbon sequestration benefits as a result of 
interventions such as adoption of improved cropland management, plant nutrient management and 
conservation farming practices, soil health/fertility enhancement, whereas increased emissions 
and decreased carbon stocks could result from cropland expansion and increased electricity and 
fuel consumption during past harvest management, processing and transportation.  There is a 
paucity of specific carbon accounting data for the agri-horticulture sector.  The implementing 
agency will coordinate with the relevant departments to collect the relevant data for these 
analyses.  Furthermore, the recently concluded AACP and other government and donor-aided 
projects will provide a basis for developing carbon balance estimates for the proposed project.  
This accounting exercise will be undertaken using established methodologies that are consistent 
with the international best practice to measure GHG emissions in the proposed project.  The ex-
ante carbon balance tool developed by FAO has been selected as the primary tool for GHG 
accounting in agriculture. The analysis will be carried out by a World Bank team during the 
project preparation phase in close collaboration with state government counterparts and will be 
finalized by project appraisal.

II. SAFEGUARDS
A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis (if known)
Though the project location and boundaries are yet to be established, it is expected to cover most of 
the state, and would comprise of critical landscape features, ranging from hills and mountains on the 
one hand and floodplains and wetlands on the other. Water quality in Assam has often come under 
scrutiny for presence of natural fluorides, iron and arsenic. Assam is also endowed with a good forest 


cover and rich biodiversity that is well protected with several designated Protected Areas. The 
project will support small infrastructure development including rural roads that may require land and 
leading to minimal adverse impact on people including those who belong to Schedule Tribe, 
Schedule Caste and other vulnerable groups. Proposed agri-infrastructure development under the 
project could have adverse impacts on natural features, such as, wetlands, if not sited and built 
appropriately. Disposal of construction waste would require monitoring, as it could block natural 
drainage channels if dumped casually. Such impacts would necessitate an Environmental and Social 
Assessment (ESA) and management plans and/or framework for managing adverse environmental 
and social impacts and risks.

B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
The state is well versed with the Bank’s safeguard policies, as it has, over the past several years, 
implemented the World Bank funded projects including the recently concluded Assam Agricultural 
Competitiveness Project (AACP) wherein the safeguards have been rated as Highly Satisfactory in 
the Implementation Completion and Results Report. The ARIAS society, earlier supported under 
AACP would be responsible for implementing the project’s environmental and social safeguards. 
ARIAS Society would be suitably staffed for this purpose. An ESA will be undertaken that would 
identify the potential adverse environmental and social impacts and risks. The ESA would develop 
and include an Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) that would have 
appropriate mitigation guidance for complying with the Bank’s safeguard polices. The proposed 
ESMF would draw from the experience of implementing the existing one for AACP and build upon 
new activities that would be supported under this project, including wider dissemination and use of 
the Integrated Pest Management Plan developed under AACP. A good reporting mechanism on 
safeguards already exists in AACP and will be continued. At present all project locations are not 
known, therefore the use of framework is proposed. The ESA would be undertaken based on a 
sample of locations covering most of the proposed investment activities under the project. Therefore, 
even though the nature and scope of investment activities would be known, it may so happen that 
actual physical locations may not be known until an advanced stage of preparation. Therefore, an 
ESA will be done during preparation but an ESMF would be used during implementation. As far as 
possible and as the project design evolves, the borrower would ensure that some of the sampling 
locations and sites for the ESA are actual locations/sites proposed for project interventions. In 
addition, the proposed ESMF would include a screening mechanism that would allow for preparation 
of specific EMPs to mitigate adverse impacts of infrastructure investments, once exact location and 
design of infrastructure activities are identified. These would be particularly required for rural feeder 
roads, rural markets and supply chain infrastructure. At this stage, neither the scope and nature of 
infrastructure investments nor the locations are known. By appraisal, the borrower will develop site-
specific EMPs for infrastructure whose locations have been determined and detailed technical 
designs completed.

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 
 

1. The political reforms of 2011-2015 in Myanmar and economic liberalization coincided with strong economic 
growth and macroeconomic stability, followed by a slowing of economic activity since 2015.  After reaching 8.5% annual 
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth in 2014/2015, economic activity began to slow down with growth reaching 7% and 
5.9% in 2015/2016 and 2016/2017, respectively, due to (i) a challenging macroeconomic environment characterized by 
high inflation, and a reduction in government spending; (ii) a decline in commodity exports (gas and agriculture); (iii) 
constrained private and public investments; (iv) contraction of the agriculture sector due to the extreme weather shocks 
of the 2015/2016 El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event; and (v) a decline in industrial output.  Expectations of strong 
exports, industry and services activities contributed to a positive growth forecast for 2017/2018 at 6.4%, counterweighing 
a slow agricultural recovery1. The agriculture sector continues to be vulnerable to supply shocks and demand fluctuations 
from major trading partners (e.g., China and India) affecting the sector’s potential to significantly and sustainably 
contribute to growth and poverty reduction of Myanmar. 
 
2. Despite a decline in poverty in Myanmar over the last decade, poverty remains high and inequality is increasing.  
Nearly 70% of Myanmar’s population lives in rural areas where poverty is prevalent.  The poverty incidence fell from 48.2% 
in 2004/2005 to 42.4% in 2009/2010 to 32% in 2015, making it today one of the poorest countries in Southeast Asia 2.  The 
decline in poverty was rapid in urban than rural areas with the urban-rural gap being substantial in 2015, i.e., 38.8% of the 
rural population are found to be poor relative to 14.5% of the urban population.  In addition, one in ten households fail to 
meet their basic food needs.  In addition to the 32% of the population identified as poor, 14% are categorized as near-
poor making them vulnerable to shocks from crop failures, natural disasters, and health setbacks.  A sizable proportion of 
Myanmar’s poor rely on agricultural activities as smallholder farmers or casual employment with low income 
diversification and high reliance on paddy production.  Female headed households are not identified as being poorer than 
male headed households irrespective of level of profit making, the poor have limited dietary diversity, and have weaker 
productive and financial asset base.  Although living standards of the poorest in Myanmar improved, greater 
improvements were noted among richer households contributing to inequality increase.  There were no significant 
changes in the welfare of the poorest 10% of the population relative to the obvious welfare changes of the average 
household.  
 

        e variations in poverty incidence across the agro-ecological zones (AEZ)3 of Myanmar.  The poverty 
headcount rate in the Hills & Mountains AEZ is 40%, in the Dry AEZ the rate is 32.1%, in the Delta AEZ, the rate is 26.2%, 
and in the Coastal AEZ, the poverty headcount rate is 43.9%.  The Hills and Mountains and the Coastal AEZs have a lower 
share of the population living in them, yet they comprise 47% of the food poor, and 38% are in the bottom quintile of the 
expenditure distribution.  These two AEZs combined have 40% poverty rate and one in six will struggle to meet their basic 
food needs.  Nearly 65% of the poor reside in the densely populated Dry AEZ and Delta AEZ.  Even though the Delta AEZ 
has the lowest poverty head count rate, the number of poor in this area is significant due to its high population density 
(5.5 million poor which also includes Yangon) relative to the 2 million poor in the Coastal AEZ4. 

 
4. Myanmar’s human development faces numerous challenges.  While net primary education enrollment is high 
(93%), there is substantial student drop-out in enrollment at the secondary level resulting in net total enrollment of 55% 
in 2015.  Gender enrollment gaps have been narrowing over time.  On health outcomes, 41% of children under the age of 
five are stunted, 30% are underweight, and 11% are wasted.  In addition, 40% of the population between ages 5 and above 
are overweight or obese, and close to 1 in 7 infants are born with a low birth weight.  It was estimated that on an annual 
basis, Myanmar loses nearly US$400 million in GDP to Vitamin and mineral deficiencies.5  Overall, Myanmar’s Human 
Development Index (HDI) is 0.556, well below the average for East Asia and Pacific (0.720), ranking it 145 out of 188 
countries.  As a result, Myanmar is on a slow path towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) health 
outcomes. 
 

Sectoral and Institutional Context 
 
5. Despite Myanmar experiencing rapid structural change over the last decade, it is still an “agri-based” economy.  
Agriculture’s share of GDP declined from 52% to 32% during 2000-2015, while manufacturing share increased from 11% 
to 28%.  Nevertheless, the sector shares of employment remained constant over the last decade.  Agriculture continues 
to be the largest employer with agriculture’s share of jobs registering nearly 52%.  More than one-third of workers (nearly 
8.5 million jobs) identified farming as their primary source of employment through work in own family farms, and 16% 
(equivalent to 2.6 million people) are agricultural laborers.  The employment share in services and industry were 36% and 
12%, respectively.  The formal modern sector in Myanmar contributes to only 11% of the jobs.  
 
6. Agricultural growth relative to other sectors is low and volatile in Myanmar.  In 2011/12, agriculture growth was 
-0.7%, 1.7% in 2012/13, 3.6% in 2013/14, 2.8% in 2014/15, 3.4% in 2015/2016, and 4.3% in 2016/17 respectively.  The 
average sector growth during the period 2011/2012-2016/2017 was 15%, which is substantially lower than the 55% and 
59% growth seen in the industry and services sectors, respectively6.  Hence, contribution of the agriculture sector to the 
growth of Myanmar’s economy over time has been small.   

 
7. Low agricultural growth in Myanmar is attributed to low productivity7 with varying degrees across the agro-
ecological zones.  Paddy land and labor productivities in Myanmar are among the lowest in Asia.  In 2013/2014, the 
average land productivity for paddy was 2.7 tons/ha in Myanmar, 3.9 tons/ha in the Philippines, 2.8 tons/ha in Thailand, 
6.7 tons/ha in China, and 5.8 tons/ha in Vietnam.  Within Myanmar, paddy productivity and profitability are the lowest in 
Ayeyarwady and Sagaing States, and highest in Shan State.  Average paddy yield was 2.7 tons/ha (dry paddy equivalent) 

                                            
3 There are four agro-ecological AEZs in Myanmar: (i) Hills and Mountainous AEZ (covers Chin, Kachin, Kayah, Kayin, and Shan States); (ii) Coastal AEZ 
(covering Rakhine and Taninthayi); (iii) Delta AEZ (covering Ayeyarwady, Bago, Mon, and Yangon); and (iv) Dry AEZ (covering Mandalay, Magwe, Nay 
Pyi Taw, and Sagaing).

7 Productivity estimates are derived from the “Myanmar: Analysis of Farm Production Economics”.  

or 3.5 tons/ha (wet paddy equivalent).  This puts Myanmar on the lower end of rice production relative to rice producing 
Asian countries.  Labor productivity for paddy is also low.  For example, in monsoon season, the labor return from one 
day’s work yields 23Kgs of paddy, relative to 62Kgs in Cambodia, 429Kgs in Vietnam, and 547Kgs in Thailand.  Although 
Myanmar’s labor productivity is higher during the dry season, it is still considered very low in comparison with other 
countries.  Paddy production in Myanmar is still labor intensive (farmers in Ayeyarwady spend more than 100 days/ha of 
monsoon paddy relative to 52 says in Cambodia, 22 days in Vietnam, and 11 days in Vietnam).  
 
8. Productivity of non-paddy crops are also low but generally higher than paddy productivity also with varying 
degrees across the agro-ecological areas.  Myanmar’s farming systems are diversified and produce a range of non-paddy 
crops with higher productivity than paddy.  The labor productivity (value of crop per day of labor) of black gram, green 
gram, chickpeas, groundnuts, sesame, and sunflower seeds ranged from $9.29/day to $15.92/day, while for both monsoon 
and dry season paddy labor productivity was $4.75/day and $9.20/day, respectively.  The productivity of non-rice crops 
also varied across the agro-ecological zones depending on the production potential of each area.  For example, the 
productivity of green gram in Ayeyarwady (Delta AEZ) was $13.39/day while in Sagaing (Dry AEZ) productivity was at 
$17.69/day.  
 
9. Low earnings for both paddy and non-paddy production, although earnings from the latter are higher, reflects 
on the low agricultural competitiveness of Myanmar relative to its regional neighbors.  In 2013/2014, the net margin 
($/ha) from producing monsoon paddy averaged $114/ha (ranging from $88/ha in Ayeyarwady to $337/ha in Shan State 
due to proximity to China, resulting in higher farm-gate prices and lower input prices relative to other areas in Myanmar).  
Although the profitability of the dry season paddy was higher at $246/ha, this is still considered low relative to the earning 
of farmers in neighboring Asian countries.  In addition, male-headed households accrue higher profits than female headed 
households for many crops (for few crops the gender differentials in earning is insignificant).  On the other hand, the 
profitability of non-paddy crops (black gram, green gram, chickpeas, groundnuts, sesame, and sunflower seeds) is higher 
and ranged from $141/ha to $581/ha.  The earning differentials between paddy and non-paddy is due to the higher 
production cost of the former crop.  The low earnings raise alarming concerns about the potential of agriculture at its 
current state and a primary focus on paddy alone to achieve agricultural growth and uplift rural households from poverty.   
 
10. The inferior performance of Myanmar’s agriculture sector is first a legacy of past agricultural policies and 
investments centered on rice to attain primarily food security.  This was conducted through input intensification mainly 
for rice.  Public agricultural investments neglected undertaking “Resilient”, “Inclusive”, Competitive”, and 
“Environmentally” (RICE) sustainable investments that takes advantage of Myanmar’s diverse farming systems.   
 
11. The undersupply of quality agricultural public goods plays a significant role in Myanmar’s low agricultural 
productivity and weak support for diversification.  According to the 2017 World Bank Agricultural Public Expenditure 
Review8, the most underfunded function in the sector is agricultural research while there is compelling evidence of high 
returns to investments in core public goods related to technology generation and diffusion, market linkages and 
infrastructure, especially when augmented by policy and institutional reforms.  Undersupply of public goods: first, 
agricultural extension services are limited in number and have weak capacity to provide outreach to farmers.  The ratio of 
extension staff and farm family is very low (nearly 1 to 585)9.  Given the 3,819,1925 acres covering major crops, this means 
on average 1 extension worker covers 5,081 acres.  In addition, extension outreach was geared mostly towards paddy; 
second, farm management is poor.  Farmers have weak knowledge about the appropriate application of production 
technologies such as fertilizers, seed varieties, and pesticides; and third, agricultural research is underfunded, fragmented, 
and suffers from weak human resource capacity.

12. Private sector engagement in agricultural value chains is low. In addition to the constraints mentioned above, 
several other factors are adversely affecting the private sector’s full participation in agricultural value chain development.  
Infrastructure challenges such as post-harvest storage and cold chain facilities, and testing laboratories restricts them 
from contributing to the downstream side of the value chain.  Poor accreditation of services geared towards the regional 
and global export markets is also a constraint. 
 
13. Climate variability and extreme weather events have also significantly impacted performance of the agricultural 
sector.  In 2012, Myanmar was ranked the country most at-risk to climate shocks within Asia-Pacific, due to the wide range 
of hazards including, floods, cyclones, earthquakes, landslides, and tsunamis.  In addition, it ranks 2 out of 187 countries 
in the Global Climate Risk Index.  However, there are regions and states that are more vulnerable than others.  In 2015-
2016 ENSO event and the accompanying drought in the Central Dry Area decreased production and export of traditional 
crops such as sesame, beans and pulses.  Overall the drought from El Niño affected more than 15 million people in the 
Delta and Dry areas affecting livelihood, food access, decreased productivity and farmer income. 
 
14. Improving nutritional status of Myanmar’s population remains a significant challenge.  Rice continues to be the 
key staple crop consumed in Myanmar.  However, rice lacks nutritional value in terms of the minerals and vitamins typically 
found in a meal with dietary diversity.  A 195-gram serving of long grain cooked brown rice provides 11% of the 
recommended daily calorie value and provides no vitamin A, C or D intake, has only 5% of recommended daily iron value, 
2% of daily calcium and no vitamin B12 value10.  In addition, sufficient knowledge on dietary intake is lacking, especially 
among the rural population.  One way to tackle this challenge is to promote agricultural diversification and increase the 
knowledge of rural households about dietary diversity and importance for improved health outcomes, and productivity. 
 
15. Despite the significant sector challenges, Myanmar’s agriculture has ample potential for growth and rural 
poverty reduction.  Myanmar has abundant natural resources, youthful workforce, and diverse faming systems.  Myanmar 
is the world’s second largest exporter of beans and pulses (after Canada) and the largest exporter in the ASEAN region.  
For example, in 2014, the export earnings from beans and pulses was $835 million (exported to India, Thailand, 
Bangladesh, China, and UAE) which is higher than the export value of rice valued at $630 million during the same year.  In 
addition, urbanization and income growth amongst segments of the population are translating into changing dietary 
preferences and food spending patterns.  All these developments are expected to accelerate and expose enormous 
opportunities for farmers, and private sector across all segments of the value chain, and overall sectoral growth. 
 
16. Leveraging agriculture for sector growth and rural poverty reduction is a top government priority, and this is 
recognized in the 2017 Agriculture Development Strategy (ADS).  The ADS accept limitations of past approaches to ensure 
food security for promoting agricultural transformation and rural poverty reduction.  The strategy identified three priority 
areas requiring support: (i) Governance; (ii) Productivity; and (iii) Market Linkages and Competitiveness.   
 
17. The 2018 Myanmar Sustainable Development Plan (MSDP) recognized the agriculture sector challenges and 
proposed action plans.  The MSDP recognizes the high dependence of Myanmar’s economy on agriculture and its 
significance for poverty reduction, as noted under “Pillar 2: Prosperity & Partnership”. Under this Pillar, “Strategy 3.1: 
Creating a diverse and productive economy with rural development and agriculture as the foundation” stresses on 
addressing Myanmar’s low productivity to support value chain development, increase private sector participation and 
eventually boost agricultural competitiveness.

Relationship to CPF 
 
18. The proposed project is aligned to the 2015-2017 World Bank Country Partnership Framework (CPF) and the 
two years extended partnership framework. Rural poverty reduction is outlined as a focus area with several objectives, 
including increased productivity in farming and agribusiness, and addressing critical infrastructure and service gaps for the 
rural poor.  The extended CPF continues its support for rural poverty reduction through rural growth. 
 
19. Furthermore, the proposed project is aligned with the identified pathways for poverty reduction as outlined in 
the Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD).  The SCD identified improvements in agricultural productivity as necessary for 
poverty reduction and as an opportunity for short term gains.  The SCD recognizes the immense potential for 
improvement in Myanmar by addressing yield gaps, diversification, and value-addition. 

 
20. The proposed project is also aligned with the World Bank’s Twin Goals.  The proposed project activities are 
intended to increase the income of the rural poor and generate shared prosperity by building the capacity and knowledge 
of farmers to undertake enhanced farming practices that increases the resilience of their diversified farming systems as 
well as increase their agricultural competitiveness.   

 
21. This proposed project concept has benefited substantially from ongoing and completed analytical and 
investment activities.  The experience from the ongoing Agriculture Development Support Project (ADSP) in project 
management and implementation (fiduciary aspects), and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) arrangements will be used 
extensively for the proposed NAFSP.  Successful instruments of the ADSP such as Project Working committees (PWCs) 
that meets bi-monthly to improve collaboration and monitoring across participating departments and divisions and 
implementation through existing MOALI decentralized bodies such as Agricultural Consultative Committees (ACCs) at 
district and village track levels will be applied to this project.   

 
22. Insights on the status of Myanmar’s agriculture sector performance were drawn from two recent completely 

analytical activities.  The first study is “Myanmar: Analysis of Farm Production Economics”. This was funded by LIFT 

(Livelihood and Food Security Trust Fund) to address existing agriculture data constraints using a 2013/2014 Myanmar 

Agricultural Survey of 1,728 farm households in four regions/states across three Agro-ecological Zones (AEZs) in 

Myanmar: (i) Ayeyarwady and Bago (Delta AEZ), Sagaing (Dry AEZ), and Shan (Hills and Mountains AEZ).  The study did 

not cover the Coastal AEZ.  The survey covers crops produced during two main seasons i.e., monsoon and dry seasons. A 

follow-up survey is currently ongoing to assess changes in farming practices since the 2013/2014 survey.  The second 

study this concept note benefited from is the “Myanmar Agriculture Public Expenditure Review”.  Several insights on the 

status of Myanmar’s food system were highlighted during the recent “Workshop on Modern Food Systems in Myanmar” 

(February 2018).  The workshop discussions noted the ongoing challenges and opportunities for the development of 

Myanmar’s food systems, and these were captured in this concept note.   

 
C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  

 
 
23. The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to, “increase productivity of select high value commodities, enhance 
agricultural diversification and competitiveness, and diet diversity in selected agro-ecological zones of Myanmar”.  This 
will be achieved through the provision of key public goods and services that will facilitate and further enhance the 
engagement of (and with) the private sector. 
 


Key Results (From PCN) 
 
24. The key results of the proposed project are: 

 
i. Increase in production volume and yields of selected commodities 

ii. Change in agricultural land productivity of targeted farmers supported by the project (percentage) 
iii. Increase in sales of farm produce as a share of production among targeted farmers supported by the project 

(percentage, disaggregated by gender male- and FHHs) 
iv. Increase in efficiency of processing facilities supported by the project (percentage) 
v. Increase in linkages between producers and buyers 

vi. Increase in dietary composition of targeted households (percentage, disaggregated by gender) 
 

 
25. The key project beneficiaries are: (i) smallholders in four agro-ecological zones (Dry, Delta, Hills and Mountains, 

and Coastal); (ii) extension workers; (iii) agricultural researchers; (iv) buyers for value chain development; (v) MOALI 

departments and units participating in the project. 

 
 
D. Concept Description 

 
1. Once the priority agro-ecological zones and high value / potential commodities and value chains are determined, 
the proposed project will adopt the “Theory of Change” and “Maximizing Finance for Development (MFD) for Agricultural 
Value-Chains” frameworks for the identification and selection of project activities within each component and 
subcomponents.   
 
2. The proposed project areas and interventions will be made with close consideration provided to the following: (i) 
promotion of improved nutritional outcomes; (ii) inclusiveness of minorities and other marginalized groups; and iii) 
implementation in conflict and non-conflict areas.   

 
3. The proposed project is envisaged to have the following three components (with interventions tailored to the 
specific context of the selected commodities / value chains): 

 
4. Component 1: Development of Value Chains (US$ 20 million) – The objective of this component will be to support 
mechanisms by which public sector services are improved in collaboration with the private sector where opportunities 
exist to promote the development of selected agricultural commodity value chains, innovative modalities to better link 
farmers to markets, and improvements in the enabling environment for agro-enterprise.  This component will explore 
opportunities (including pilots) for private sector engagement on capacity strengthening to add value for key commodities, 
provision of equipment and infrastructure using out-grower schemes, and matching funds for farmer organizations and 
commodity specific associations.  This component will also include improvements in the enabling regulatory / legal 
environment for agro-enterprise (support to farm inputs and products) including food quality and food safety.  The 
infrastructure investment needs based on business plans and cost sharing mechanisms may include, (i) product collection 
centers, (ii) drying facilities, (iii) post-harvest storage structures, (iv) micro irrigation; (v) improved information technology 
service facilities, (vi) cold chain facilities, and (vii) facilitating a conducive policy environment, among others. 

 
5. Component 2: On-farm Agricultural Investment Support (US$74 million) – This component has two sub-
components: (i) On-farm Infrastructure Investments (US$54 million) and (ii) Agricultural Support Services (US$20 million).  



The objective of the first sub-component is to improve the production volume of selected commodities and crop 
diversification by providing support for infrastructure investments in priority farming systems.  The activities may include 
upgrading/constructing of critical infrastructure for increased productivity, crop diversification and/or competitiveness 
such as in existing and new research/ experimental stations, seed multiplication farms, laboratory buildings and 
equipment, border post quarantine and testing service centers; irrigation systems on-farm/ downstream; and 
decentralized training centers / information centers.  Capacity building related to optimizing infrastructure investments 
and operation and maintenance will also be included.  This sub-component will prioritize infrastructure investments in 
high-value commodities and areas where the level of engagement of the private sector is low or nonexistent.  The 
objective of the second sub-component is to ensure and enhance the provision of key public agricultural services such as 
agricultural research and innovation, extension services, institutional development and farmer training.  This component 
will provide capacity building and policy support to the national agriculture research and extension system with the aim 
to improve service delivery in the agriculture sector.  This component will also focus on services related to on-farm 
management practices which will include the adoption of climate smart production practices, crop diversification, and 
integration of nutritional and gender-sensitive activities. 
 
6. Component 3: Project Management (US$ 6 million) - The objective of this component is to ensure effective 
project management.  This component will support carrying out of the day-to-day project management activities, including 
project administration and implementation, procurement, financial management and audit, social and environmental 
safeguards (including peace and inclusion filters, marginalized/vulnerable population groups, gender etc.), and monitoring 
and evaluation (M&E). 
 
    

  SAFEGUARDS 

 
A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 

 
At concept stage, location for project interventions have not been determined.  
 
Myanmar is characterized by its central lowlands along the Ayeyarwady river, which flows from north to south through 

the Central Burma Basin and ends in a wide delta. These areas are its well-established agricultural production areas, 
which the current Agricultural Development Support Project (ADSP) (P147626) supports. The Central Valley Region is 
bordered by steep, rugged highlands in the north, the Arakan Mountains in the west and the Shan Hills, Karen Hills and 
Tenasserim Hills to the east. As a result, physical characteristics vary significantly across the country, as well as ethnic, 
social and cultural characteristics. 
 
Once project locations are identified, further information will be provided. 

 
B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 

 
Under the current ADSP project, the project management has hired one environmental and one social safeguards 

consultant, who have the skills and experience to manage the environmental and social risks of the project. The project 
management unit overall has been gaining knowledge and experience on World Bank safeguards policies and their 
implementation. However, without the consultants, the project management unit does not have dedicated staff who has 
backgrounds and experience in environmental and social risk management. As a part of the project’s environmental and 
social management framework (ESMF) preparation, a capacity need assessment will be conducted to identify areas for 
improvement and measures to increased capacities.

D. Policies that might apply 

 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

The proposed project will focus on activities that (i) 
improve farm management and value chain 
development which include upgrading testing 
laboratories and upgrading/building post-harvest 
storage and cold chain facilities; (ii) strengthening 
capacities of agricultural extension officers and 
researchers; (iii) improve farm management which 
includes support of seed multiplication and 
procurement and distribution of seeds and seedlings 
as well as supply of biological control; and (iv) ensure 
effective project management. 
 
Under Component 1, the proposed project will fund 
specific investments on infrastructure for improved 
farm management such as (i) research, ((ii) seed farms, 
(iii) national service laboratories, (iv) off-site and on-
site service and testing laboratories and centers, (v) 
border post quarantine and testing centers, and (vi) 
training centers and other high priority infrastructure 
to support improved farm management in selected 
agro-ecological zones.  
 
The project will also fund infrastructure for value chain 
development such as (i) product collection centers, (ii) 
drying facilities, (iii) post-harvest storage structures, 
(iv) improved information technology service facilities 
and (v) cold chain facilities intended to support 
downstream agricultural value chain development. 
 
Main potential environmental impacts are related to 
construction activities, maintenance and operation of 
the post-harvest storage and cold chain facilities (e.g. 
hygiene, reliable and adequate water and power 
supply). In regards to seed farms, waste management 
on the use of polythene plant bags for 
seedlings/nursery will be the main issue.  

Main potential social risks are related to land 
acquisition, contested land ownership and land 
conflict, and potential exclusion of ethnic minorities, 
landless farmers, women-headed households or other 
vulnerable groups. Any social assessment conducted 
during preparation or implementation will cover these 
social risks.  
 
Project target provinces and states are yet to be 
determined; therefore an Environmental and Social 
Management Framework (ESMF) will be prepared. The 
Framework will include the following: 
 
1. Guidance for screening of subprojects, 
ensuring that relevant safeguard policies (natural 
habitats, forests, and projects in disputed areas) are 
adequately addressed.  
 
2. Assessment of environmental and social 
impacts of various activities related to Component 1 
and Component 3. Component 2 of the proposed 
project will focus on capacity building. The component 
will incorporate technical inputs from the safeguards 
specialists into TA’s Terms of References to ensure 
safeguards aspects are mainstreamed. 
 
3. Details on the type, level and depth of 
environmental and social impact assessments 
(SAs/EMPs/SOPs/ECoPs) required for each of the 
investments/activities. 
 
4. Environment Health and Safety (EHS) 
Guidelines for reference as a generic environmental 
management plan, particularly for construction 
related activities. 
 
5. Environmental and Social Management Plan 
(ESMP), particularly on the following issues: 
construction related activities, maintenance and 
operation (hygiene, reliable and adequate water and 
power supply) issues related to the post-harvest 
storage and cold chain facilities (Component 1), and 
waste management on the use of polythene plant 
bags for seedlings/nursery as well as implication of the 


supply of biological control as part of the integrated 
pest and disease management (Component 3). 
 
Overall, the proposed project is expected to deliver a 
number of environmental benefits, such as improved 
soil and water management practices considering the 
agro-ecological context of the project intervention 
area. The project will also contribute to an integrated 
pest and disease management through the adoption 
of sustainable practices by supplying biological 
controls; the use of natural enemies to manage 
population of pest organisms.  
 
Considering the type of investments and activities, 
scale of the proposed project, as well as the nature 
and magnitude of its potential impacts, an 
environmental Category B operation is proposed. 
 

Performance Standards for Private Sector 
Activities OP/BP 4.03 

No  

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 Yes 

The policy is triggered to ensure that any affected 
natural habitats are adequately protected, because 
some of the project sites may take place near parks or 
protected areas. The proposed project’s ESMF will 
screen out and exclude any subprojects that would 
involve clearing of new land for agriculture. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No 
The proposed project’s ESMF will screen out and 
exclude any clearing or effects on forest lands. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

The policy is triggered as a precaution, because 
pesticide use is a necessity in agricultural activities in 
the region. The ESMF will promote Integrated Pest 
Management as standard practice. A screening 
mechanism will be included in the ESMF to determine 
if there are any sub-projects or activities with 
significant pest management issues; if so, then a 
separate Pest Management Plan will be required to 
ensure that these materials are well managed for 
those subprojects and/or activities. 
 
Under Component 3, the proposed project will fund an 
integrated pest and disease management which will 
support the adoption of sustainable pest and disease 
management practices by supplying biological 
controls; the use of natural enemies to manage 
population of pest organisms. The ESMF will provide 

more detailed information on the application of this 
method. 
 
 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 Yes 

This policy is triggered to ensure that any “chance 
finds” or other physical cultural resources during 
excavation or other earth-moving activities are 
adequately protected. Project’s ESMF will consist of a 
chance find procedure which requires that should any 
areas of potential cultural importance or artefacts be 
identified, works should stop and the government 
related agencies (to be identified at appraisal stage) 
should be contacted. No work should continue until 
approval has been sought from these agencies. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 Yes 

Myanmar is one of the most ethnically diverse 
countries in Asia, and the project will likely fund sub-
projects where ethnic minorities are present. Both 
under Component 1 (rehabilitation and construction 
of infrastructure) and Component 2 (formation of 
farmer groups), there may be risks that ethnic 
minorities do not have equal and culturally 
appropriate access to benefits, and may not be 
adequately consulted in decision making. 
 
Since project sites are not known at this time, MoA 
will prepare an IPPF as part of the ESMF in order to 
ensure that in sub-projects are screened for ethnic 
minorities, and sub-project areas where ethnic 
minorities are present, MoE will conduct a social 
assessment and ensure that free, prior and informed 
consultations are held to reach broad community 
support. If target project locations are identified 
during preparation, a social assessment will be 
prepared by appraisal, and free, prior and informed 
consultations will be held. If locations and location-
specific activities are not identified during preparation 
and this is left to project implementation, the social 
assessments under the current ADSP project will be 
combined and updated as an assessment of social risks 
in the agriculture sector, specific to the new project 
activities. 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

Rehabilitation and construction of test laboratories, 
post-harvest storage units and cold chain facilities are 
not expected to result in significant land acquisition 
impacts, especially since siting should be flexible for 

construction of new facilities. The impacts should be 
moderate and manageable. 
 
Since siting of sub-projects is not known at this time, 
MoA will prepare a RPF in order to ensure that sub-
projects are screened for land acquisition, and 
appropriate plans are prepared in cases where land 
acquisition is necessary. The RPF will also include 
protocols for voluntary land donation. 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 TBD 

The project will not finance construction of new dams, 
however, it is yet to be determined during project 
preparation whether it will include repairs / 
maintenance / rehabilitation  of existing dams in which 
case the dam safety measures would be applied. 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

TBD 

Project target provinces and states are yet to be 
determined. ESMF will cover the provision of OP/BP 
7.50 should project preparation discussions determine 
that the locations or activities subject to the policy are 
within the international waterway. 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No 
The proposed project’s ESMF will screen out and 
exclude any projects in disputed areas. 

 
E. Safeguard Preparation Plan  
 
Tentative target date for preparing the Appraisal Stage PID/ISDS 
 
Oct 10, 2018 
 
Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed. The specific studies and 
their timing should be specified in the Appraisal Stage PID/ISDS 
 
MoALI- Department of Agriculture will prepare an ESMF, including a pest management plan, IPPF and RPF, before 

appraisal. If target project locations are identified during preparation, a social assessment will be prepared by appraisal, 
and free, prior and informed consultations will be held. If locations and location-specific activities are not identified 
during preparation and this is left to project implementation, the social assessments under the current ADSP project will 
be combined and updated as an assessment of social risks in the agriculture sector, specific to the new project activities. 
These will be disclosed and consulted on after being cleared by the Bank. These instruments will be informed by the 
documentation and implementation experience of the on-going Agriculture Development Support Project (ADSP).

Other Decision (as needed) 
 
 
 

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 

 
1. India continues to be one of the world’s fastest-growing large economies and has experienced a substantial 
decline in poverty. The Indian economy’s annual growth rate grew from 5.5 per cent in 2012-13 to 8 per cent in 2015-
16, supported by robust private consumption, a resilient services sector, and some revival in industrial activity. In recent 
times, temporary disruptions from demonetization and uncertainty surrounding GST slowed India’s economic 
momentum; real GDP growth declined to 7.1 per cent in 2016-17 and further to 6.5 per cent in 2017-18. Private 
investments have remained subdued. Economic activity is expected to stabilise in 2018-19 and growth will resume 
gradual acceleration in the near term. Since the 2000s, India has made remarkable progress in reducing absolute poverty, 
declining sharply from 38.9 to 21.6 per cent at the international poverty line (US$1.90 PPP/day) between 2004 and 2011. 
With over a 100 million people escaping poverty, the pace of poverty reduction in India exceeded that of the developing 
world as well as that of Middle-Income Countries (MICs) in this period. High economic growth, a rapid rise in rural wages, 
greater rural-urban integration and increase in non-farm activity, especially construction, were the key drivers of poverty 
reduction. Since 2011, robust economic growth may have aided further reduction in poverty. However, trends in the 
construction sector and rural wages suggest that the pace of poverty reduction may have moderated.  

 
2. Agriculture plays a vital role in India’s economy and is central to policies aimed at alleviating poverty. 
Increasingly, the potential role of the sector to expand growth, create jobs and support the ongoing rural-urban 
transformation is becoming evident. More than 54 per cent of the population is engaged in agriculture and allied 
activities (census 2011), and the sector contributed 17.1 per cent to the country’s Gross Value Added (GVA) for the year 
2017-18 (at current prices). As expected in a fast-growing economy, there has been a continuous decline in the share of 
agriculture and allied Sectors in the GVA from 18.6 per cent in 2013-14 to 17.4 per cent in 2016-17. The annual agriculture 
growth rate was around 3-3.5 per cent in the 1990s and 2000s and dropped 3below 2 per cent per annum during 2013-
15, due to low productivity, growing water and land scarcity, rising labour costs, and declining commodity prices. This 



 

has led to an agrarian crisis with a growing emphasis on improving the ecological sustainability of the resource base and 
the socio-economic potential of the sector to increase farmer welfare and rural growth opportunities1. 

 
3. Rapid urbanisation in India is driving change in the agriculture value chain, deepening linkages between urban 
food systems and producers. This urbanisation leads to (i) an increased uptake of agricultural produce from rural to 
urban areas; (ii) changes in the farm production to reflect the food marketed and consumed; and (iii) larger and changing 
role of food supply chains in meeting urban food needs2. However, the current urban food system is in disarray with 
limited or no focus on food safety, food security to urban poor and multiplicity of authorities handling food related issues. 
 
4. Over the years India has developed export competitiveness in certain specialised products, making it the 
world’s 10th largest agriculture exporter.  Leading exports consisted of basmati rice, the meat of bovine animals, marine 
products, cotton, and sugar. However, India’s agriculture export basket accounts for only about 2 per cent of world trade. 
and the share of India’s high value and value-added agriculture produce in its agriculture export basket is less than 15 
per cent compared to 25 per cent in the US and 49 per cent in China.  This low share and low value are contributed mainly 
by (i) inconsistent policies in the areas of farm production, support prices and R&D (all focused on food security); (ii) poor 
inland transportation, exit point infrastructure; and (iii) export restrictions which results in uncertainty among the 
stakeholders. 

 
Sectoral and Institutional Context 

 
5. Maharashtra has a high agricultural growth rate, agricultural transformation toward higher value crops is 
underway, and the state is relatively integrated into global commodity markets.Agriculture has grown at an annual 
average of 6.4 per cent from 2004-05 to 2011-12, and the area under cultivation for cereals has declined since 2000, 
reflecting a shift from food grains towards cash crops. Food grains (rice, wheat, and millets, excluding maize) account for 
about 25 per cent of the gross cropped area, contributing only 7. 7 per cent of agricultural GDP3.  Since 2000, with the 
upsurge in the production of high-value crops, the state has emerged as one of the country’s largest producers and 
exporter of fruits, vegetables, pulses, cotton, and soybean. Many of these changes in the sector have led to positive 
developments because production is labour intensive (e.g., horticulture and floriculture), climate resilient (pulse-based 
cropping systems increase resilience, e.g. pigeon pea intercropping leads to higher soil carbon sequestration than 
monocrop system), and responds to market needs, both domestically and globally.  The food processing industry is 
dynamic in the state with increasing value addition, and it employs approximately 240,000 workers, about 15 per cent of 
the total formal sector employment. However, agriculture growth and structural transformation are not spread evenly 
across the state with some areas, notably the north and east, lagging behind.  Likewise, around 57 per cent of all industries 
are concentrated in only three districts4.  
 
6.  Small and marginal farmers5 dominate Maharashtra's agriculture and commodity downturns significantly 
impact them as the state’s agriculture is diversified and relatively integrated with the global value chains. Commodities 
like soybean, cotton, and sugar (covering 44 per cent of the cropped area in Maharashtra) are strongly influenced by 
global price movements. Commodities with little footprint outside India are mainly influenced by trade policies. For 
example, over the past few years, the price of pulses (where pulses cover about 20 percent of the total cropped area in

Maharashtra), while influenced by domestic consumption, were largely affected by the inconsistent trade policies of 
India. This is reflected in periodic farm distress in sectors linked to domestic and global markets, with broad shifts in the 
global prices of commodities such as pulses, soybean, sugar and milk leading to farmers not even being able to cover the 
cost of production in many cases. 
 
7. In response to these emerging production and market-related challenges, the Government of India (GOI) and 
Government of Maharashtra (GOM) have launched a number of programs, policies, and reform initiatives under the 
overarching vision of “Doubling Farmer’s Income by 2022”. New initiatives to address the production risks include a 
crop insurance scheme with enhanced coverage and use of technology; and a dedicated long-term irrigation fund with 
an initial tranche of US$3 billion. Additionally, to liberalise the regulated agriculture market, the GOI launched, and GOM 
adopted, second-generation marketing reforms, including the move towards integrating the country into a unified 
national market; and 100 per cent Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is allowed to enhance investments in agribusiness/food 
processing sectors. A new agricultural export policy is in the final stages of approval and proposes doing away with 
arbitrary export quotas, and price restrictions.  Through this policy, India is targeting a doubling of agriculture exports to 
4.00 per cent (US$ 60 billion) by 2022.  
 
8. Women face a number of additional barriers to the transition to high value agriculture (HVA) and agribusiness. 
While India’s farmers are increasingly likely to be women, they are less able to transition to HVA than men, and their 
ownership of agricultural assets has stagnated. Unlike men who, in addition to production, also serve as the actors in the 
upper levels of the value chains, including intermediaries or village-level traders and processors, wholesalers, retailers, 
or exporters, women are generally concentrated at the lower levels of the value chains. This division of labour is mostly 
a reflection of social and cultural norms, which discourage women to travel by themselves or own land. These factors 
curtail women’s access to resources and services, including credit, training, extension, inputs, and trading and marketing 
networks. Women do not have collateral to apply for loan or opportunities to participate in extension training because 
selection for these opportunities is often based on land ownership titles or other formal records. More than 2 million 
poor women have been mobilised into Self Help Groups (SHGs) and federated organisations in the state.    These SHGs 
and federated organisations can serve as an important pillar to substantially enhance inclusion of rural poor women into 
agribusiness transformation and related entrepreneurship opportunities.   
 
9. The state also faces significant adverse risks from climate change:   As part of the National Action Plan on Climate 
Change (NAPCC), the Government of Maharashtra has formulated the Maharashtra State Adaptation Action Plan on 
Climate Change (MSAAPCC) by commissioning a comprehensive vulnerability assessment study. The MSAAPCC climate 
modelling results for 2030, 2050 and 2070, show that temperature and rainfall are projected to increase across the state, 
with important regional variations resulting in potentially significant adverse impacts on agriculture performance. 
Impacts will be further aggravated by the projected increase in the frequency of extreme climate events (droughts, 
hailstorms, floods, delays in the onset of monsoons, higher rainfall intensity) already experienced in the state over recent 
past, as illustrated by the three severe droughts that hit the state over the past five years. Given these uncertain shifts in 
weather and climatic events, the small and marginal farmers are disproportionately exposed to risk and farm distress. 
 
10. With the support of the World Bank, Maharashtra has recently rolled out four programs, to enhance the climate 
resiliency of the state’s agriculture: the Maharashtra Project on Climate Resilient Agriculture, and three national level 
programs that have significant presence in the state: the National Dairy Support Project (P107648), the National 
Groundwater Management Improvement Program (P158119) and the proposed Agriculture Risk Resilience Insurance 
Access Project (P165923). Their focus is on enhancing climate resilience of farmers through promoting adoption of 
climate-resilient agricultural technologies, irrigation and production risk management. The proposed project will seek to 
complement and leverage these Bank financed projects/programs and other thematically related on-going/pipeline 



projects and initiatives both nationally and in the state viz., National Rural Economic Transformation Project (P104164), 
the proposed Food Processing and Value Addition Pilot Program (P167559). 
 
Relationship to CPF 

 
11. The project advances two focus areas of the India CPF of promoting more resource efficient growth and enhancing 
competitiveness and creating jobs. Specifically, the project will support the following CPF goals: 

 
12. Objective 1.1: Promote more resource-efficient, inclusive, and diversified growth in the rural sector. The project 
closely aligns to the CPF sectoral goal of supporting Government of India (GOI) priorities of agricultural transformation 
and doubling farmer incomes by 2022. The project seeks to undertake a range of interventions to enhance market access, 
competitiveness and resilience to market shocks of farmers and value chain actors in the state of Maharashtra. The 
project will seek to generate jobs in agribusiness related areas including input supply, provision of technical services and 
food processing. The project will also explicitly target and develop mechanisms for inclusion of women at all level of 
agricultural transformation, from diversification to higher value crops, to access to higher level technical services, and 
access to a broader range of markets. This will promote inclusivity and diversification of the rural growth. With its strategy 
to align with complimentary investments under other projects and schemes, the project will also advance resource 
efficient growth and build climate resilience of farmers. 

 
13. Objective 2.1: Improve the business environment and select firm capabilities. The project will support the GOM’s 
efforts to develop a more favourable regulatory environment for private investment in agribusiness related areas, 
promote private sector investments and enhance the competitiveness of the agricultural sector. This will include support 
for the improved implementation of reforms already undertaken; setting up of institutional structures for consultative 
planning and capacity building of identified value chains and growth clusters, and provision of technical services to 
agribusiness enterprises.  .  

 
C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  

 
14. The project development objective is to support the development of inclusive and competitive agriculture value 
chains6, focusing on small holder farmers and agri-entrepreneurs in Maharashtra.     
 
B. Key Results 

a) Increased access to new and organised markets (gender disaggregated, with a target for increased access for 
women producers/value chain participants); (measured by increase in the value of marketed output at the 
beneficiary level); 

b) Beneficiaries of job-focused interventions (CRI) (gender disaggregated); (measured by the number of beneficiaries 
reached by training, employment in processing, entrepreneurial development and other interventions that 
contribute to the jobs agenda); and 

c) Farmers reached with agricultural assets or services (CRI) (gender disaggregated). 
 
15. Project beneficiaries include producers, community-based organisations (viz., SHG federations, Farmer Producer 
Organisations, and Primary Agriculture Credit Cooperative Societies), agri enterprises and other value chain participants, 
including individuals where relevant. 
 
D. Concept Description 

                                            
6 Competitive value chains are defined as those providing project beneficiaries with access to services, markets, and jobs. 




 
16. The proposed project will strengthen and speed up ongoing agricultural systems transformation in the state of 
Maharashtra. The project will support the state in strengthening the continuing market-driven transition, with an 
expanded private sector role in the production, processing, and value addition, commercialisation of crops, and livestock 
products. With a substantial urban population – the highest in the country; relatively high per capita incomes – third 
highest in the country; and the highest industrialisation level amongst states, Maharashtra is well placed for such 
agricultural sector transformation. The proposed project will support the following pillars of agriculture and rural 
transformation in the state:  

 
(a) Build state capacity for evidence-based agribusiness reforms. The state has undertaken many agriculture market 

reforms and plans to do more to address market-distorting interventions and bottlenecks for private sector activity.   
The project will seek to build capacity of the state to inform on how reform issues are debated, decided, implemented 
and evaluated; and develop institutional mechanisms for coordination with the private sector.  

(b) Expand market access. Constraints to producers and entrepreneurs accessing emerging domestic and export markets 
include lack of access to technical services relating to food safety and quality; weak information on market 
opportunities and requirements; and inability to invest in market development activities.  The project will seek to 
improve access of producers and entrepreneurs to a range of technical and business development services to 
enhance competitiveness through food safety and quality; new technologies; and skills training. International 
experience shows that accessing new markets requires longer-term strategic actions including identifying 
opportunity based on local competitive advantages and supply-demand projections; and support for firms and 
entrepreneurs to undertake market development. The project will support a range of such activities including: 
identifying opportunity commodities and value chains for interventions; scaling up production and processing of 
identified commodities; enhancing access to timely market information and intelligence; and supporting producer 
and enterprise associations to undertake market access activities.  

(c) Strengthen risk mitigation measures. The project will support strengthening risk mitigation measures including 
building the capacity of the state to respond to commodity-price fluctuations and agriculture sector crises; 
developing access to timely information on markets and productions trends; and enhancing access of producers to 
financing and hedging instruments. Additionally, for building the climate resiliency and resource growth, the project 
will align with complimentary investments under other projects and schemes. 

 
17. In addressing these constraints, the project will support  a number of actions for leveraging additional resources 
by (i) improving the policy and regulatory environment for private sector investments in the agricultural sector; (ii) using 
public financing to enhance private sector incentives and to reduce transaction costs and risks  ; (iii) forging innovative 
partnerships for leveraging funding, including Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funding through the Village Social 
Transformation Foundation (VSTF), a foundation promoted by the GOM, with private sector participation and financing, 
to catalyze rural transformation. 

 
    

  SAFEGUARDS 

 
A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 

 
Maharashtra is one of India’s most prosperous states, with a population of 114 million. Yet, it has some of India’s poorest 

people, four of its 36 districts are among India’s 106 most backward. Agriculture and industry form the mainstay of the 
state's economy. Most of the cultivable land is still rain-fed, relying heavily on the southwest monsoon rains. The net 
irrigated area is only 30.77 million Ha or about 16% of cultivable land. Maharashtra has typical monsoon climate, with 
cold weather seasons. The state has been affected by the recurrent monsoon failures in recent years 
resulting in droughts which have disproportionately impacted the state’s semi-arid agro climatic zones. Sahyadri and 
Satpura are two important hill ranges and Godavari, Bhima and Krishna are the two major rivers of the state. The state 
also has a long coastline. About 17% area of the state is forest, majority of which are in the eastern and Sahyadri regions 
of the state. Since the central parts of the state receives low rainfall, most of the rivers in the region have multiple dams. 
Maharashtra has around 1800 notable large dams. Maharashtra is generally rich in biodiversity Southern Tropical Thorn 
with five major forest types (Southern Tropical Semi-Evergreen, Southern Tropical Moist Deciduous, Southern Tropical 
Dry Deciduous, Southern Tropical Thorn and Littoral and Swamp Forests). The Western Ghats areas of Maharashtra are 
included in the 34 global Biodiversity Hotspots. The proposed project will be implemented throughout the state. 
 
B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 

 
The Borrower is familiar with the World Bank's safeguard policies having implemented several Bank funded projects. 

More recently, in the agriculture sector, Maharashtra Agricultural Competitiveness Project (MACP) and Project on Climate 
Resilient Agriculture (PoCRA) are being implemented. Both have sound environmental and social management 
frameworks. MACP has been rated Satisfactory on safeguards performance consistently. There is now adequate capacity 
in the state to manage potential safeguard risks of projects. However, some capacity building efforts are needed to deal 
with the new set of challenges arising as a result of climate change impacts. In general, Maharashtra has good institutions 
that can prove technical support to deal with safeguards related impacts, risks and challenges and build on positive 
outcomes of resource efficiency and sustainability.

D. Policies that might apply 

 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

This policy is triggered. The project involves a series of 
interventions on agriculture value chain development, 
facilitating market access, supporting improvement of 
livestock productivity, food processing and, in general, 
enhancing resilience.  It is anticipated that 
investments to be made under the project will not 
lead to any major irreversible impacts. the project by 
design promotes market-led better natural resource 
and environmental management within the selected 
sectors and sub-sectors. The potential environmental 
issues that could arise if project financed investments 
are not implemented appropriately, include food 
safety, supply chain sustainability, waste generation 
and management, poor energy efficiency and 
associated emissions, soil degradation etc. Activities 
for post-harvest management and value chain creation 
for product aggregation, handling, and marketing 


could have impacts associated with general civil works 
construction, if supported under the project. This 
includes appropriate site selection for creating new 
infrastructure and reducing impacts of construction 
related activities like debris disposal, dust and solid 
wastes. 

Performance Standards for Private Sector 
Activities OP/BP 4.03 

TBD 

This policy may/may not be triggered. At this stage it is 
not clear if investments in enhancing the access of 
intended project beneficiaries to private markets will 
trigger this policy. The project investments may result 
in increased role of private markets and attract private 
investments in food processing etc. The proposed EA 
will ascertain whether this policy will be triggered. 

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 TBD 

This policy may/may not be triggered. Project 
investments are not likely to adversely impact natural 
habitats but certain elements may have some bearing 
on agro-biodiversity. The EA will ascertain whether 
this policy will be triggered. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No 
The project will not lead to any impact on forests or 
their management practices. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

Even through the project is not going to invest on the 
crop production side of agriculture, this policy is 
triggered as opportunities created through better 
market access could lead to overuse of pesticides and 
other agro-chemicals for boosting production. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 No 
The project is unlikely to have any impact on physical 
cultural resources. Proposed investments are largely in 
existing markets and/or rural household level. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 Yes 

Project activities will be implemented state-wide. 
Given that Maharashtra has a large tribal population 
spread across the state with 54% of those living below 
poverty line, OP 4.10 has been triggered. As specific 
locations for the project are unknown, an Indigenous 
People's Planning Framework (IPPF) will be prepared 
after free, prior and informed consultation with 
affected Scheduled Tribes as per OP 4.10 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 TBD 
Project activities currently envisaged are not likely to 
cause any involuntary resettlement. This will be 
updated during preparation. 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 No 
The project will not invest on constructing any new 
dam and/or support rehabilitation/improvement of 
any existing dam. 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

No 
The project does not involve any international 
waterways. 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No The project does not include any disputed areas. 

 
E. Safeguard Preparation Plan  
 
Tentative target date for preparing the Appraisal Stage PID/ISDS 
 
Apr 08, 2019 
 
Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed. The specific studies and 
their timing should be specified in the Appraisal Stage PID/ISDS 
 
The safeguard preparation will involve undertaking an Environment Assessment. The preparation timeline is aligned with 

project processing timeline. In addition, an Indigenous People's Planning Framework (IPPF) will be prepared to take into 
account initiatives undertaken in areas populated by Scheduled Tribes.

B. Introduction and Context 
 

Country Context 
 
1. India continues to be one of the world’s fastest growing large economies and has experienced a 

substantial decline in poverty. The Indian economy registered gradually rising growth from 5.5 
percent in 2012-13 to 8 percent in 2015-16. This was supported by robust private consumption, a 
resilient services sector, and some revival in industrial activity. Since the 2000s, India has made 
remarkable progress in reducing absolute poverty. Between 2004 and 2011, poverty declined sharply 
from 38.9 to 21.6 percent at the international poverty line ($1.90 PPP/day). With over a 100 million 
people escaping poverty, the pace of poverty reduction in India exceeded that of the developing world 
as well as that of Middle Income Countries (MICs) in this period. High economic growth, rapid rise in 
rural wages, greater rural-urban integration and increase in non-farm activity, especially construction, 
were the key drivers of poverty reduction. Since 2011, robust economic growth may have aided 
further reduction in poverty. However, trends in the construction sector and rural wages suggest that 
the pace of poverty reduction may have moderated. 

 
Sectoral and Institutional Context 

 
2. Agriculture continues to be important for rural Indians and there are 68 percent of the rural 

population dependent on it for livelihoods and about 49 percent of the labor force works in the 
agricultural sector but paradoxically it contributes only around 10 to 11 % to National gross domestic 
product (GDP). The Government of India’s new agenda of “Doubling Farmer’s Income”, which not only 
emphasizes upon productivity enhancement, intensification and diversification but also on agri-
processing, Agri-logistics, resource use efficiency, agriculture marketing and sustainability could 
possibly transform the Indian Agriculture. The opportunities in the agribusiness sector and local level 
primary value addition are growing with the changing consumer basket and increasing urbanization 
and demand for diversified and nutritious foods. Small producers have the opportunity to directly 
participate in this value chain if they are organized and provided with appropriate infrastructure, 
technology and information support. 



3. Non-farm economy, in recent times, has emerged as an important livelihoods source in rural 
India. A shift away from agriculture toward nonagricultural wage employment and reduced reliance 
on agricultural income has become evident. Non- farm activities contributed 65% rural income in 
2016-17 (Chand, 2017). Diversification into non-farm interventions (both self-employment and 
wage employment) marks the shift from low-productivity jobs to high productivity and it is an 
important pathway for poverty reduction and employment generation. Non-farm rural jobs are 
predominantly in manufacturing, services (including public administration, education, health, 
community, other personal or household services) and trade and transport (including wholesale 
and retail trade, hotels, restaurants, transport, storage and warehousing and communication).  
 

4. The Ministry of Rural Development, Government of India launched the National Rural Livelihood 
Mission in 2011 as its flagship program to enhance rural livelihoods and reduce rural poverty in the 
country. The world bank supported National Rural Livelihoods Project provided intensive support 
to the launch and scale up of the NRLM over the last 7 years. The National Rural Livelihood Mission 
(NRLM) has now been scaled up to o all 29 states of the country.  The intensive approach 
successfully demonstrated by NRLP in around 500 blocks is now being implemented across nearly 
2500 blocks across 29 states through the NRLM program. A total of 45 million rural women are 
currently part of Self-Help Groups and they have cumulatively leveraged nearly 25 billion USD of 
financing from commercial banks since the launch of the NRLM program in 2011.  

 
5. Ministry of Rural Development has subsequently launched two critical programs that aim to 

leverage the National Rural Livelihood Mission and scale up efforts to enhance agriculture incomes 
and on-farm incomes for the rural poor namely the Mahila Kisan Sashiktikaran Program (MKSP ) 
and the Startup Village Entrepreneurship program . The Mahila Kisan Sashaktikaran Pariyojana 
(MKSP) is launched as a sub-component of the Deendayal Antodaya Yojana-NRLM to improve the 
status of women in agriculture, who constitute 33% of the total agricultural labour force, and 
enhance economic opportunities available to them. The program exclusively focus upon small and 
marginal farmers, sustainable agriculture practices and vulnerability reduction. Community 
Resource Persons (CRP) are identified as best practitioners (locally named as Pashu Sakhi, Krishi 
Sakhi etc.) and are instrumental in promoting farm sector livelihoods (agriculture, animal 
husbandry and NTFP), through community to community sharing and learning – as a “proof of 
concept”. The ‘Start-up Village Entrepreneurship Programme’ (SVEP) launched by Government of 
India in 2014-15 aims to promote and support existing rural entrepreneurs by providing bouquet 
of business development services including entrepreneur capacity building, seed & growth capital 
along with handholding support for business development. Currently, the programme is being 
implemented in 47 Blocks across 14 states with support of 5 technical support agencies. Results 
from SVEP and other world bank supported programs to promote SMEs will inform the scaling up 
of enterprise development initiatives to be taken up under NRETP ( NRLP-AF) 

 
6. The Government of India has recently launched Mission Antyodaya to improve the well-being of 10 

million households from 5000 economic clusters (covering around 50,000 Gram Panchayats) by 
addressing multiple dimensions of poverty through convergent actions under wide range of existing 
development schemes and following a saturation approach. The movement of Panchayats away 
from poverty will be tracked through a mobile based application i.e. “Panchayat Darpan” using a 
set of indicators having differential weightage scheme. In a list of 24 indicators, 30% weightage has 
been provided on GP level Infrastructure development; another 30% on Human Development 
outcomes and rest 40% weightage has been given to livelihoods promotion. Mission Antyodaya 
further accelerates economic transformation process building on the NRLP outcomes 



 
7. One of the central lessons learned during the last seven years of implementation of NRLM has been 

that while investments in building institutional platforms of rural poor households is a critical 
foundation for sustainable poverty reduction, it is not sufficient unless these institutions are 
engaged in higher level production systems and have better market interface. Integration of core 
social mobilization and leveraging of financial resources have been adequately demonstrated. The 
next level challenge is to leverage social capital into economic opportunities and crowd in private 
investments; and engage with more commercial partnerships to integrate rural households into 
higher-level income opportunities. Therefore, one of the main thrusts of the NRETP (NRLP- AF) will 
be to develop value chains using end-to-end investments in selected commodities and facilitating 
access to finance to support enterprises in agriculture and allied sectors, thus contributing to 
productivity and profitability. The proposed project will build on existing investments and 
institutional capital to bring further income increase and inclusive growth in rural areas.

Key Results:  

3. The PDO indicators for the additional financing are:  

• 60% of SHGs# federated into Village Organizations.  

• 40% of SHG members* report reduction in high cost debt 

• 50% of SHG members report 30% increase in asset. 

• 20 % increase in income of households that have accessed technical and financial services1 
 
D. Project Description  
        
Project Beneficiary:  

1. The proposed NRETP (NRLP AF) intends to support 100 districts from the existing 13 NRLP States 
towards high end technical assistance and investment support towards deepening and scaling up of 
the economic transformative initiatives that were introduced as part of dedicated funds under NRLP. 

 
1 Define technical and financial services that will be provided/considered  



Additionally, it would support to the Mission Antyodaya program that intends to further accelerate 
economic transformation in selected areas, building on the NRLP outcomes.  

 
2. While MoRD through their own increased budget allocation would continue to saturate and bring 

remaining rural poor into the fold of women SHGs,  the specific investments under additional financing  
will work with targeted households that are already part of SHGs and would focus on strengthening 
of existing network (higher level federations i.e. VO and above) of community organizations of women 
having potential to be mobilized into producer groups and producer organizations and transit to next 
generation economic initiatives like high value agriculture including market access, enterprise and 
skills development etc. MoRD will directly reach out to over a million households through these 
initiatives. The project will support around 50000 individual enterprises; and around 100,000 youth 
will be trained and placed with in formal job markets using the resources available under DDUJKY and 
other skilling & entrepreneurship program of the Government of India. 

Project Component 

3. Component 1: Institutional and Human Capacity Development 
This component will continue to finance technical assistance consultancies, human resources, 
training and development of training material/approaches. Financing under this component will 
endeavor to place skilled professionals to work with NRLM at the national, state and district levels. 
As mentioned in the section on rationale, the TA will be focused on helping the National and State 
teams transition to a new phase of the NRLM that involves greater focus on economic initiatives such 
as high value agriculture and value chain development, enterprise and skills development. Given that 
experiences from these initiatives are relatively nascent, the additional financing support will 
emphasize sourcing of technical support from agencies (Public, Private and NGOs) with the requisite 
technical expertise in rural enterprise development.  National, regional and international experiences 
and skills may be sourced for this objective.   

 
4. In addition, a new sub component focused on providing technical assistance for Mission Antyodaya 

will be introduced. Specifically, as part of this sub component:  
 

a. TA will be provided for Mission Antyodaya at the national, state and district level.    
b. Support under this sub-component will be for 13 NRLP states and nearly 100 districts in those 13 

states. The 100 districts with the highest intensity of the NRLM implementation will be selected 
for the project. These districts will be the districts with the highest amount of mobilization and 
capitalization (both the catalytic capital from NRLM and the finance from commercial banks) and 
the possibilities of having transformative economic potential. Additionally, and as far as possible, 
the project will strive for coordinated technical or investment support with the blocks and 
panchayats selected under Mission Antyodaya and those under NRLP.   
  

5. Component 2. State Livelihood Support  
The activities to be financed under this Component will remain essentially the same but with further 
refinements to focus on the next generation institutional and investment support as described above 
in the rationale. Sub component 2.1 (State Rural Livelihoods Support) will remain the same but 
district level support will be focused on 100 districts that will be selected for project coverage under 
this NRETP (NRLP AF). Under sub component 2.2 (Institution Building and Capacity Building) financing 
will be oriented towards the mobilization of the producer groups and producer organizations. Under 
sub component 2.3 (Community Investment Support) the focus would be on financing community 



organizations mainly towards enterprise and skill development initiatives. The quantum of financing 
under sub component 2.4 (Special Programs) will be significantly scaled up and most of this financing 
will be focused on scaling up initiatives like high value agriculture including market access, enterprise 
and skills development etc.  that were introduced under the dedicated funds under this sub-
component during the project restructuring undertaken in January 2016. 

 
6. Component 3. Innovation and Partnership Support: There is no change in the activities to be financed 

under this component. The component will continue to finance pilot initiatives and technical 
assistance consultancies that support innovative livelihoods activities in agriculture, livestock, youth 
employment, among others, for rural poor households.  Learning and documentation of experiences 
from these initiatives will be emphasized. 

 
7. Component 4. Project Implementation Support: There is no change in the activities to be financed under this 

component. This component will continue to strengthen the National Mission Management Unit for effective 
project management at the national level, finance the Monitoring and Evaluation activities and ICT initiatives.  
Learning and documentation of experiences under the economic transformative investments and institutional 
strengthening programs will be emphasized. 

 
E. Implementation 

 
1. Institutional and Implementation Arrangements:  The MoRD through National Rural Livelihoods Promotion 

Society (NRLPS)/National Mission Management Unit (NMMU) will be responsible for overall technical 
assistance, guideline formulations, National level partnerships, coordination, monitoring, supervision and 
release of funds to thirteen participating States. At the State level, the project will be implemented by the 
State Rural Livelihoods Missions (SRLMs) set up under NRLM as per the agreed framework detailed out in 
Project Implementation Plan (PIP). Each participating States will carry out a diagnostic study of pro-poor 
agriculture value chain and potential of cluster based enterprise development based on which they will 
prepare their Annual Action Plan (AAP) or multi-year State Perspective and Implementation Plan (SPIP).

F. Project location and Salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 
 

The additional finance would cover about 100 districts in the current 13 states. The states are spread across 
different agro climatic zones with varied natural and geographical features ranging from wet and humid to 
dry and deciduous as well as include some coastal areas. All the states have previous experience in 
implementing NRETP (NRLP AF) supported livelihood activities in varied agro climatic zones. There is also 
prior experience of working in different geographies and with environmental and social setting of the rural 
areas, which are primarily agrarian. The expected locations influenced by additional financing are likely to 
be similar to those covered under the ongoing NRETP (NRLP AF), and therefore, poses no significant risks of 
potential cumulative and localized significant adverse environmental impacts. Livelihood activities would 
continue to centre around the sustainable use of natural resources, where these are available at project 
locations. NRETP (NRLP AF) NRETP (NRLP AF) The additional financing will be spread across 100 Districts in 
13 high poverty states. The states and project areas were identified based on their high incidence of rural 
poverty and socioeconomic backwardness as well as higher concentration of marginalized population 
groups such as scheduled tribes (indigenous peoples) and scheduled castes. States like Bihar and UP have 
substantial population of Scheduled Castes (SC) and Other Backward Castes (OBC) who are more vulnerable 
and marginalized compared to general population. On the other hand, states like Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, 
Odisha and parts of Rajasthan, MP, and Maharashtra are dominated by tribals. Within these geographies, 
the NRETP (NRLP AF) will prioritize districts/blocks with higher levels of social mobilsation and financial 
capitalization, which will overlap with pockets of higher tribal and marginalized populations.

KEY SAFEGUARD POLICY ISSUES AND THEIR MANAGEMENT 

 OPS_SAFEGUARD_SUMMARY_TBL 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential 
large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
The project proposes to scale-up the existing livelihoods promoted through dedicated special funds. The livelihoods 
include varies use of natural resources and linked processes, such as, Agriculture, Dairy, Small ruminants, Fisheries, 
Non-Timber Forest Produce (lac culture, hill broom, tamarind etc.). The project will also support Non-farm enterprises 
including small processing units and value addition. The project has been consciously promoting special initiatives for 
environmental sustainability of livelihoods such as community managed sustainable agriculture, fodder cultivation and 
stall feeding of milch animals and goats etc. However as the project proposes to scale-up the same interventions 
through additional financing, improper management of any of these livelihood activities and unawareness among the 
SHG members may result in negative impacts, such as: (i) indiscriminate use of chemical inputs in agriculture leading 
to contamination of soil, water and surroundings; (ii) degradation of common grazing lands due to increased pressure 
of grazing and improper pasture management practices; (iii) decreased regeneration capacity of NTFP species in forest 
areas; and (iv) over use of water resources, particularly ground water etc. Most of these activities are small-scale 
interventions, spread over wide areas in several villages. Further, any potential adverse environmental impact and risk 
from these activities can be mitigated, contained and even reversed. Therefore, no potential large scale, significant 
and/or irreversible impacts are envisaged. In addition to Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01), the safeguard policies 
on Natural Habitats (OP/BP 4.04), Forests (OP/BP 4.36) and Pest Management (OP/BP 4.09) have been triggered 
recognizing the importance of integrating sustainable management practices in forest-dependent and agriculture-
based livelihoods. The safeguard policy on Safety of Dams (OP/BP 4.37) has not been triggered as the project funds are 
unlikely to be used for community-level civil works such as small dams, embankments, etc. (Project funds would not 
support activities involving excavations, etc., that may impact physical cultural resources. Therefore, OP/BP 4.11 is not 
triggered. The key social safeguard issues and impacts associated with the NRETP (NRLP AF) are: ensuring project 
interventions and implementation processes are aligned with the socio-cultural context in tribal areas and respond to 
their development priorities; inclusion of traditionally marginalized social groups such as scheduled castes, migrant 
labor, and other households identified under socioeconomic census survey (SECC); promoting strategies that reduce 
gender gaps and advance women’s economic empowerment; and mitigation of any localized, adverse impacts from 
small scale infrastructure that would be coming up in project areas. No adverse long terms impact on tribals and 
indigenous population are expected from this project. OP 4.10 is triggered as states and districts having substantial 
tribal population are included in Project areas. OP. 4.12 (Involuntary Resettlement) is not triggered as involuntary land 
acquisition is not envisaged. Small scale community level, infrastructure such as citizen service centres, training 
centres and custom hiring centres are expected to come up largely in pre-existing facilities. However, some of these 
may require small land parcels that are expected to be leased or donated by Panchayats or local government 


departments or individual donors with proper MoUs and due diligence. Given the size of small scale infrastructure, a 
large portion of which is expected to be rented/leased with no or minimal construction, the risks of labor influx are 
not going to be significant. Project interventions are not expected to cause any adverse livelihood impacts and 
restriction of access to land and resources as a result to land taking by the project.  
  
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area: 
Describe any potential indirect and/or long-term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area: No 
severe or long-term impacts are expected due to proposed livelihood activities, mainly implemented through the 
women Self Help Groups. Agriculture, livestock, fisheries, non-timber forest produce and non-farm sectors are the 
predominant sectors in which rural poor households are involved and individual and household level investments in 
these sectors generally do not result in potential indirect and/or long-term impacts in the project areas. Further, as 
the experience of existing Bank projects has shown, the nature of activities/works taken up by the SHGs and 
federations under the ongoing project is likely to remain so during the additional financing. No adverse long term 
social impacts are envisaged from the AF interventions and investments. The potential long-term positive impacts are 
expected to be: social, economic and financial empowerment of the poorest households, especially of Scheduled 
Castes and Scheduled Tribes, and women. The poorest and most excluded households would have greater access to, 
security and sustainability of livelihood resources, and enhanced household incomes. The project villages would most 
likely see greater cohesion amongst the poorest social groups, greater capacity and assertiveness among the poor in 
claiming their rights and entitlements, and better participation in local government structures and processes. Gender 
relations could improve as collective action gives women self-esteem and confidence to voice their needs and 
priorities in both the public and private spheres. Overall, the social dynamics and rural institutional environment are 
expected to be much more supportive of the livelihood needs of the poorest households.  
 
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts. 
Since this is an additional financing aiming to scale up successful interventions, no analysis of alternatives was 
undertaken. However, based on implementation experience during the ongoing project, the safeguards strategy will 
continue to mainstream the environmental best practices into the Package of Practices (PoP) of the livelihood 
activities (e.g.: stall feeding in goatary, non-chemical pest control measures in agriculture). In addition, Promotion of 
alternate green solutions like use of renewable energy, Community Managed Sustainable Agriculture are planned 
during the additional financing. 
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower 
capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The measures taken during the ongoing project for addressing safeguard policies issues will continue throughout the 
implementation of the additional financing. EMF compliance with the mandatory regulatory requirements list would 
apply to all the clusters in the project and appropriate capacity building support for compliance with regulations and 
awareness building on better environmental practices in livelihood activities would be provided. Efforts will be made 
to develop and apply a sustainability index for funding potential activities through the dedicated fund. The index will 
be based on the principles of resource efficiency, minimal adverse impacts and post-investment support continuation 
of the livelihood. An assessment of the EMF in select states was undertaken during the ongoing project .There is mixed 
experience in terms of borrower’s capacity to plan and implement the measures required for addressing safeguards 
issues. Most of the states (Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan) have had previous experience 
in implementing livelihood projects and other states have also implemented EMF and SMF under NRETP (NRLP AF). 
States that have implemented World Bank-supported livelihood projects as well as NRETP (NRLP AF) have a higher 



 

level of readiness and competency to implement the EMF. Some of these states (e.g. Bihar) have implemented the 
green solutions at a considerable scale. The above findings from these assessments are being incorporated into the 
updated EMF To streamline these capacities, it has been agreed with the Ministry of Rural Development that the 
National Mission Management Unit (NMMU) will have the Livelihood Specialists as the anchor person for EMF to 
support and monitor the implementation in the participating states. Further, the State Mission Management Unit 
(SMMU) of the State Rural Livelihoods Missions (SRLM) would have Environmental Focal Points at the state level 
(Livelihood Managers), district levels and among the block level project facilitating teams to streamline the EMF 
requirements at all levels. The Technical Partners on different value chains will be taken on board for integration of 
the best practices and regulatory requirements into the Package of Practices and Capacity Building programs. The 
NRETP (NRLP AF) social management framework (SMF), including OP 4.10 on Indigenous Peoples (Scheduled Tribes), 
will continue to apply to the AF. The SMF comprises strategies for targeting and inclusion of scheduled castes and 
schedule tribe groups/areas, consultation and participation, gender & women’s economic empowerment, citizen’s 
engagement, grievance redress and safeguard screening/mitigation planning for community projects involving 
land/infrastructure. The SMF addresses the issues and needs of tribal people and incorporates the key requirements 
of O.P. 4.10 especially with respect to free, prior and informed consultations and broad community support. The SMF 
includes specific provisions for informed consultations, participation and inclusion of the SC/ST and other excluded 
households, with a special focus on tribal people. The SMF also provides for institutional arrangements and capacity 
building activities of project staff, community institutions and partner agencies. Community projects involving 
productive infrastructure and land donation would follow consultative, transparent and voluntary procedures. MORD 
and the 13 SRLMs have implemented the SMF and its constituent strategies with varying levels of intensity and quality 
in the ongoing NRLP satisfactorily. Under the NRETP (NRLP AF), the capacities and performance of the social 
development staff and partners would be strengthened through a range of measures. NRETP (NRLP AF) aims to 
intensify interventions, financing & technical support for high value agriculture, rural value chains, skills and 
enterprises, producer organizations, innovative livelihood approaches, digital financial inclusion as well as productive 
infrastructure for post-production processes and value addition. Technical Assistance will also be provided to 
convergence (Mission Antoyodaya). Partnerships with technical resource agencies from private and non-profit and 
public sector will be strengthened. Increased investments in high value agriculture, enterprises, productive 
infrastructure and financing of producer organizations would need more explicit criteria for inclusive beneficiary 
targeting and benefit sharing as well as social safeguard screening to minimize elite capture and social exclusion. 
Dedicated HR and Capacity building program on socially inclusive and gendered value chains/enterprises, social 
safeguard screening and risk mitigation and social sustainability will be supported to ensure satisfactory social 
performance of project counterparts. To respond to these focus areas in the AF, MORD has updated the existing SMF 
especially with respect to social inclusion protocols, social safeguard screening mechanisms and inclusive beneficiary 
targeting and benefit sharing criteria for financing of producer organizations and productive infrastructure. Additional 
measures on staffing, capacity building, technical assistance, knowledge programs as well as citizen engagement and 
grievance redressal would be implemented. The results framework will continue to track and report on gender, 
inclusion, citizen’s engagement and women’s economic empowerment. NRETP (NRLP AF) will significantly advance the 
gender mainstreaming and women’s economic empowerment agenda through strategies/specific interventions on 
women led producer organizations and enterprises, Start-up Village Entrepreneurship Program (SVEP) and upgrading 
of skills in selected self-employment occupations for women SHG members and youth. Interventions on digital 
payments, financial inclusion/literacy, Business Correspondents (BC) and enterprise financing will lead to significant 
financial empowerment of rural women. Support to Mission Antoyodaya will strengthen women’s advocacy and 
agency in delivery of social safety net and entitlement services for the rural poor. Nutrition sensitive agriculture and 
interventions on food handling and hygiene will benefit the women disproportionately. The results framework will 
continue to track and report on gender, inclusion, citizen’s engagement and women’s economic empowerment. Client 
has also been organizing regular reviews and lesson learning events on the gender, social inclusion and vulnerability 



reduction dimensions of the SMF. A discrete stocktaking review was undertaken at Midterm stage of the project. 
Overall the project has been performing satisfactorily on mobilsation, inclusion and financial and economic 
empowerment of women and marginalization communities particularly tribals and SC households. SMF 
implementation and reporting would need to improve further on safeguards, GRM and benefit sharing dimensions of 
productive infrastructure and economic clusters. As described above, these are the aspects that are being updated in 
the SMF  
 
 
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, 
with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
The key stakeholders in the proposed project include the SHG members, groups and federations of rural poor in the 
project districts, technical partners, relevant government departments etc. The existing safeguards arrangements will 
continue to apply. If required, the existing EMF document will be updated based on a short field assessment and 
would be disclosed in English and the local language (Hindi) on the websites of the NMMU, State Departments of Rural 
Development and on the Bank’s InfoShop. The most important stakeholders of the project are the rural poor and their 
organizations, including SHGs, federations, producer organizations and government and non-governmental 
organizations working on rural poverty reduction and livelihoods advancement. The MoRD has held stakeholder 
consultations to inform the design and implementation of the project and address the limitations of existing rural 
development programs that target the poorest and most excluded groups. The following field consultations were also 
held.

 Country Context 

1. Pakistan has achieved continued GDP growth and substantially reduced poverty. 
GDP growth was 5.3% in FY16/17, largely owing to gains in the agricultural and services 

sectors. The national poverty headcount declined from 64.3% in FY02 to 29.5% in FY14.  

 

2. Amid these gains, evidence is emerging that Punjab—a major driver of the national 
economy and an agricultural stronghold—is experiencing rising inequality. Punjab accounts 

for more than half of Pakistan’s GDP, and the majority (63%) of Punjab’s population of 110 

million is rural. Although poverty declined even more within Punjab than nationwide over 2002–

14 (from 61% to 25%), Punjab is the most unequal province in Pakistan, with a Gini coefficient 

of 29.7 in FY14. Four out of five of Punjab’s poor live in rural areas, where 8.7 million 

households earn an average of PKR 28,517 per month through farming alone (35%), a mix of 

farm and non-farm employment (31%), and non-farm employment (34%). The average rural 

household has 6.49 individuals but merely 1.66 income earners. Farm size continues to decline. 

Two-thirds of farms were smaller than 2 hectares in 2010 (versus less than half in 1990). 

 Sectoral and Institutional Context 

3. Agriculture is a key contributor to the economy in Pakistan in general and Punjab 
in particular, yet agricultural growth is languishing. Nationally, agriculture—crops, 

livestock, fisheries, forestry—accounts for 21% of GDP, employs 44% of the labor force, and 

directly and indirectly delivers nearly 80% of the total value of Pakistan’s exports (worth about 

US$ 12 billion). Growth is evaporating in the sector; it was 3.3% over the last decade but nearly 

zero in FY16 (0.3%). Crop and livestock productivity are lower than in other Asian countries. 

Except for maize, crop yields have barely risen in decades. In Punjab, where agriculture 


contributes 26% of GDP and provides 40% of employment, growth in agriculture has been 

highly erratic as well as low, although the livestock subsector has exhibited encouraging signs. 

Punjab encompasses 72.6% of national cropped area and 77.7% of national irrigated area. 

Approximately 62% of Punjab’s area (20.63 million hectares) is cultivated, and about 60% of 

cultivated area lies within the Indus Basin Water System. The province provides large shares of 

the country’s primary crops: maize (78%), wheat (77%), cotton (73%), sugarcane (63%), and 

rice (52%). The factors limiting agricultural growth include poor adoption of modern 

technologies, poor service delivery, and poorly functioning agricultural markets.  

 

4. Above all, however, flagging agricultural and economic growth in Punjab can be 
traced to current agricultural and irrigation policies. Ample evidence confirms that 

subsidies, agricultural support prices, caps on meat and milk prices, low investment, and 

weakening institutions support investment in traditional crops at the expense of high-value 

agriculture (HVA), discourage efficient water use, and ultimately suppress agricultural growth.  

 

5. Subsidies dominate public spending on agriculture in Punjab. These subsidies—US$ 
1.25 billion in FY17 (Table 1)—are largely regressive, generate significant negative 

environmental externalities, and focus almost exclusively on major crops rather than HVA. The 

provincial government (GoPunjab) pays more than 40% (US$ 515 million) of these subsidies, 

which are about 2.5 times higher than the funding for agriculture in the provincial Annual 

Development Plan (ADP). Not all of this largesse reaches the producer; for example, a 

substantial share of fertilizer subsidies benefits fertilizer companies and the bulk of wheat 

subsidies goes to banks. Few subsidies target small-scale producers.

Total subsidy on electricity for tubewells is US$ 257 million, and 85% of tubewells are located in Punjab. e Total subsidy for imported fertilizer 
is budgeted at US$ 48 million, of which 70% can be assigned to Punjab. f Total subsidy is US$ 14.3 million, of which 70% is Punjab. 

 

6. The costs of current policies and subsidies extend beyond their fiscal cost. Because 
most subsidies are embodied in inputs or input prices, they promote excessive or imbalanced use 



3 

 

of inputs such as water and fertilizer, resulting in negative externalities and sustainability issues 

(for instance, salinity, sodicity, and waterlogging from water pumping or overuse have degraded 

about 25% of formerly fertile land in Punjab). Wheat subsidies are embodied in the wheat price, 

which is governed by a procurement price set far above import parity, to the detriment of net 

wheat buyers (Box 1). Current policies and subsidies encourage farmers to produce more of the 

same surplus commodities rather than to provide a more diverse range of other products 

demanded by the market. Ninety percent of the cropped area in Punjab remains under major 

crops (dominated by wheat), while only nine percent is planted to higher-value crops. Significant 

benefits are sacrificed by this misallocation of resources: export earnings; the jobs that would 

otherwise be created downstream through value chains; the value added by agro-processing 

beyond milling alone; the higher incomes for producers; the production of nutrient-dense crops 

that reduce malnutrition; and the efficiencies in water use that promote diversification, 

sustainable use of scarce water (Box 2), and resilience to climate shocks and climate change. 

 

Box 1: The high costs of wheat procurement in Punjab  

Since the late 1950s, the government has purchased up to 25% of the wheat crop and up to 50% of the marketed 

wheat surplus. The costs of this procurement system are passed on to urban consumers and to the rural poor who 

are net buyers of wheat. Patronage and rent-seeking are endemic, particularly in the distribution of gunny bags, 

delivery of wheat to purchase points, and releases to flour mills). The system has other enormous costs. The 

direct costs of buying, storing, and releasing wheat at a fixed price over the year are estimated at US$ 333 million 

per year, of which more than 90% consists of interest payments on current borrowing and accumulated debt. As 

of July 2017, the wheat debt of GoPunjab to the State Bank of Pakistan stood at US$ 3.36 billion, against a 

collateral wheat stock worth half of that amount at best. Efforts to dispose of excess wheat stocks in export 

markets have been largely unsuccessful, despite generous export subsidies. Indirect costs include physical losses 

owing to poor storage, high spoilage, and pilferage; over-production of wheat and the consequent under-

production of higher-value commodities; diversion of credit from the banking system; and a lack of incentives for 

private actors to build storage facilities that could also serve other crops. The high procurement price has caused 

wheat production to surpass domestic needs, even as annual average per capita consumption of wheat continues 

to decline. 

 

Box 2: Irrigation price policy and inefficient water use in Punjab 

Irrigation has delivered notable agricultural productivity gains to Punjab in the past, but the irrigation sector 

suffers from major financial deficits. Water charges (abiana) fail to reflect actual water use or cover maintenance 

and repair (M&R) costs. Abiana rates typically represent less than 0.2% of crop budgets. The flat water rate per 

acre implemented in 2003/04 gives farmers little reason to conserve water and use it more efficiently. At best, 

current M&R spending (about US$ 65 million per year) is one-third of the minimum amount required. 

 

7. Now that Pakistan has achieved self-sufficiency in wheat, it seeks to spur further 
agricultural growth and transformation, a process in which Punjab will have a major role. 

The goal of becoming self-sufficient in food grain (especially wheat) production has long 

underpinned policies, investment priorities, and public expenditures in agriculture, but now 

Pakistan must evaluate options for future growth in light of: (1) the rapid shift in domestic 

demand away from food grains to high-value agricultural products; (2) the significant yet largely 

unexploited comparative advantage for several of those products, which can provide 

opportunities to generate export revenue and jobs; (3) the exhaustion of options for new sources 

of irrigation water (productivity improvements depend on obtaining “more crop per drop”); and 

(4) the need for production systems to become more resilient as climate change progresses. 



4 

 

 

8. Agriculture requires a paradigm shift in Punjab to unlock opportunities for future 
growth. Punjab should restore its agricultural competitiveness through innovations that renew 

growth in on-farm productivity and improve efficiency and quality throughout the post-harvest 

value chain. At 0.18% of agricultural GDP, Pakistan’s public expenditures on agricultural 

research are the lowest in a region that is already lagging others. Most agricultural research 

expenditures still go to food grains and other “major” crops (rice, maize, sugarcane, cotton) 

rather than to high-value crops and livestock products. Few resources are dedicated to post-

harvest management, including value addition, quality, food safety, and nutrition. A high 

potential pay-off is associated with redirecting public expenditures and associated policies 

toward the best potential investments for outcomes, with a focus on reforms in wheat, irrigation, 

fertilizers, and marketing, and concomitant investments to improve service delivery, agricultural 

R&D, and insurance. 

 

9. The rural non-farm sector is a neglected source of overall economic growth for 
Punjab. Half of Punjab’s 14.6 million households are classified as agricultural (5.3 million farm 

households and 2 million livestock households). These farm households on average earn almost 

half of their income from non-farm activities, including agriculture value adding and 

agribusiness. But poor access to and high cost of finance, inefficient markets, limited skills, 

insufficient power (electricity), and a weak enabling environment hinder growth in the rural non-

farm sector, including agribusiness. Most rural non-farm employment (77%) remains informal. 

 

10. Lack of funds limits the size of most rural enterprises and 30-40% of them make 
very small fixed investments. Lack of credit at reasonable interest rates and appropriate 

maturities, is also a key constraint for most rural enterprises including agribusinesses. Major 

barriers to institutional credit include lack of collateral, poor financial records and an inability to 

prepare business plans. 

 

11. In assessing sources of economic and agricultural growth, the issues of gender and 
climate change cannot be overlooked. Agriculture in Pakistan suffers from serious gender 

inequality and discrimination. According to the Global Gender Gap Report 2016, Pakistan ranks 

143
rd

 out of 144 countries for women’s economic participation (labor force participation is 22% 

for women, compared to 68% for men). Agriculture is the main source of income for 75% of 

economically active women in Pakistan, yet women are less likely than men to own income-

generating assets (land, equipment), obtain credit, and exercise power in financial or economic 

decisions. Poor access to new farming technologies and techniques, the lack of female extension 

workers, and high illiteracy among rural women further discourage success in agriculture.  

 

12. Punjab agriculture is increasingly feminizing. The share of female employment in 
agriculture has grown steadily as male employment has shifted to more productive sectors. In 

2014, women accounted for 47% of agricultural employment. Anecdotal evidence suggests that 

women work mostly on small farms and engage predominantly in horticultural and livestock 

production. It is vital to recognize how much of this agricultural work is unpaid (67% in 2014 

based on Labor Force Survey data). The Punjab Livestock & Dairy Development Department 

recognizes women’s primary role in livestock production and has invested in improving the 

capacity of female producers (including training and hiring 45,000 young extension assistants 

http://reports.weforum.org/global-gender-gap-report-2016/economies/#economy=PAK


5 

 

who will work on a part time basis, half of them women), but often women’s significant 

contributions to agriculture are poorly reflected in plans and programs. 

 

13. Pakistan’s climate change risk is magnified by growing water scarcity, uncontrolled 
urbanization, and rapid population growth. The Global Climate Risk Index places Pakistan 

among the top 10 most climate-vulnerable countries. Pakistan increasingly experiences droughts 

and cyclones; since 2010 floods have caused damages approaching US$ 14 billion. Climate 

change heightens the pressure to manage water resources with utmost care. The melting Hindu 

Kush–Karakoram–Himalayan glaciers could affect water flows into the Indus River system, with 

implications for energy and food security. Agriculture produces approximately 41% of all GHG 

emissions in Pakistan, mostly through livestock production, and Pakistan has a growing 

population with an increasingly animal-based diet. To continue to reduce poverty and increase 

shared prosperity, Pakistan requires technologies and practices for climate-smart agriculture 

(CSA), which will sustainably improve productivity in agricultural systems (particularly 

livestock systems), enhance resilience, and reduce GHG emissions. 

 

14. The proposed SMART Punjab Program aligns with the World Bank objectives of 
private sector development and inclusion in the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 

(FY2015–19) and the twin goals of ending extreme poverty and promoting shared 

prosperity. The CPS recognizes that proper water resource management is the next key 

development challenge in Pakistan, particularly Punjab. The SMART Punjab Program 

specifically supports CPS Outcomes 2.2 (Increased Productivity in Farms), 3.1 (Increased 

Financial Inclusion for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Women), 3.2 (Reduced 

Vulnerability for Groups at Risk), 4.1 (Improved Public Resources Management), and 4.4 

(Adoption of Performance and Transparency Mechanisms in Selected Institutions). The Pakistan 

Performance and Learning Review 2015–20 approved by the Board on June 15, 2017 also 

recognizes the need for additional attention to agricultural productivity and creating markets for 

high value commodities. 

 

15. A Program for Results (PforR) is the most suitable instrument for the SMART 
Punjab Program. A coherent package of policy change, institutional strengthening, and 

reorientation of public investments in agriculture is required to attain fundamental improvements 

in the policy regime, stronger institutions in the agricultural sector, and improved post-harvest 

value addition through increased private investment in agribusiness. The PforR instrument 

appears uniquely suited for delivering this kind of package through a clearly articulated results 

chain, while further building the GoPunjab’s capacity and deepen and develop its own systems. 

The US$300 m provided by the PforR will be co-financing a much larger government program 

of US$1.6 billion This PforR mobilizes experience from World Bank Global Practices and 

solution areas (Agriculture, Trade & Competitiveness, Water, Social Development, Environment 

& Natural Resources, disaster risk management/climate change) and the International Finance 

Corporation. Although the PforR is a comparatively new instrument, GoPunjab is familiar with it 

under the Bank-supported Jobs & Competitiveness PforR (P155963). 

 Program Scope 
 

16. The GoPunjab program for agriculture and rural transformation (the “broader 
Government program”) emphasizes enabling productivity, increasing competitiveness in 



6 

 

agricultural marketing and trade, and enhancing resilience as reflected in planning 

documents
1
 and the Medium-Term Development Framework (MTDF). The broader Government 

program is supported by a capital investment for agriculture, livestock, farm to market roads, and 

irrigation of US$3.797 billion over five years (FY18–22), including US$1.145 billion to 

agriculture and livestock. In addition, there is a recurrent budget allocation of US$0.330 billion 

for irrigation M&R and US$0.115 billion for human resources, bringing the size of the 

expenditure framework of the broader Government program to US$4.242 billion. Recall that the 

GoPunjab also spends an estimated US$515 million each year on agricultural subsidies including 

wheat (US$333 million) as part of its recurrent expenditures. 

 

17. The SMART Punjab PforR will support selected parts of the broader Government 
program over a five-year period (Table 2). These selected parts will be referred to as the 

“PforR-supported Program” and consist of 14 out of the Government’s 25 focus areas with a 

focus on increasing crop and livestock productivity, research and extension policy, transition 

towards HVA and CSA, improving the functioning of crop as well as livestock markets 

including food safety, livestock breed and preventive care, agribusiness, and enhancing resilience 

and inclusiveness. 

 

18. There are several GoPunjab investments that are part of the broader Government 
program but not part of the PforR-supported Program. These include the Extension 2.0 

program; agricultural finance, mechanization and education; livestock census, feed, marketing, 

and women programs; government farms and experiment stations; the on-going rural roads 

program; development and rehabilitation of irrigation infrastructure; and on-farm water 

management (including high-efficiency irrigation systems) which is already funded by the Bank 

through the Punjab Irrigated-agriculture Productivity Improvement Project (PIPIP – P125999). 

 

19. The SMART Punjab PforR will help the government promote transformational 
change in the crop and livestock subsectors by focusing on activities contributing to three 

Results Areas: (1) increased on-farm productivity and value of agriculture and livestock; (2) 

increased value addition and competitiveness of agriculture and livestock; and (3) enhanced 

resilience of smallholder farmers to climate change and natural disasters. Each Results Area 

involves a specific combination of policy reforms, institutional strengthening, and public 

investments.

 Program Development Objective 
 

20. The development objective for the SMART Punjab Program (referred to here as the 
“Program Development Objective” or PDO) is to increase the productivity of crop and livestock 

farmers, improve their climate resilience, and foster agribusiness development in Punjab. Box 3 

lists the PDO-level indicators by Results Area. 

Box 3: PDO-level indicators for the SMART Punjab Program, by Results Area 

Results Area 1—Increased on-farm productivity and value of agriculture and livestock 

PDO Indicator 1: Farmers reached with agricultural assets or services 

PDO Indicator 2: Annual increase in Punjab AgGDP 

Results Area 2—Increased value addition and competitiveness of agriculture and livestock 

PDO Indicator 3: Beneficiaries reached with financial services 

PDO Indicator 4: Number of private wholesale markets and collection centers established 

Results Area 3—Enhanced resilience of smallholder farmers to climate change and natural disasters 

PDO Indicator 5: Number of farmers covered by agricultural insurance 

PDO Indicator 6: Number of farmers adopting CSA packages 

PDO Indicator 7: Improvement in irrigation water service delivery 

 

21. To achieve the PDO, the SMART Punjab PforR supports the implementation of a 
coherent package of policy reforms, institutional change, and reorientation of public 

resources toward productive public investments and smart subsidies. Specific key reforms 

include a shift from universal to targeted subsidies through an E-voucher Scheme for 

smallholders (< 5 hectares), modernization of wheat marketing by phasing out public wheat 

procurement, reducing strategic wheat reserves from 4 million metric tons (MT) to 1 million MT, 

removing distortions in output markets for crops and livestock products, and reforming 

provincial crop and livestock research. SMART Punjab will also improve the financial 

sustainability and efficient use of irrigation systems, promote agribusiness, and improve the 

resilience of producers by designing and implementing an area yield index-based crop insurance 

system, which could potentially leverage access to production credit. 

 

22. Progress toward each of the three Results Areas that contribute to the PDO will be 
measured through 12 Disbursement Linked Indicators (DLIs). Each DLI involves one or 

more specific actions required for agricultural and rural transformation in Punjab. Each DLI was 

selected based on: (1) the criticality of the activity, output, or outcome in the results chain; (2) 

the need to introduce a financial incentive to deliver the activity, outcome, or output; (3) 

measurability and ease of verification; and (4) the capacity of GoPunjab to achieve the DLIs over 

the period that SMART Punjab is implemented. Table 4 represents the Results Area and brief 

description of DLI.  

 

23. The four DLIs under Results Area 1 (increased on-farm productivity and value of 
agriculture and livestock) will be achieved by supporting SMART reforms in the policy regime 

for agriculture (crops and livestock) and reorienting public expenditures from subsidies toward 

targeted investments to improve crop and livestock productivity.  
 DLI 1: Improving access to quality farm inputs. Better targeting of subsidies, particularly for fertilizers, to 

small-scale farmers would increase overall production; it would also help smallholders to close the yield gap 



11 

 

with larger producers and reduce poverty. This DLI will be measured by tracking the number of small farmers 

(<5 hectares) enrolled in the E-voucher Scheme for fertilizers. 

 DLI 2: Revitalizing provincial crop and livestock research and extension systems. A comprehensive, 
strategically relevant policy for agricultural and livestock research and extension will be designed. Over time, 

funding for public research would increase (measured as the percentage of AgGDP spent on research), along 

with the role of the private sector (measured by the composition of the Punjab Agriculture Research Board and 

the percentage of research grants awarded on a competitive basis).  

 DLI 3: Improving livestock health and breeding. Resources will shift from curative to preventive animal 
healthcare (measured by the ratio of expenditures on preventive and curative medicine) to reduce losses to 

disease. Good breeding stock is essential to improve productivity (measured by the number of breeding animals).  

 DLI 4: Modernizing the wheat marketing system and transitioning to high-value agriculture. Deregulating 
the wheat market would reduce wheat and flour prices and free land for HVA (substantially raising farm incomes 

and employment)—measured by the official notification that GoPunjab is withdrawing from the wheat market, 

subsequent phasing out of government wheat procurement, and the percentage of the Agriculture allocation in 

the ADP to HVA schemes. An additional measure is approval of the Punjab Agriculture Policy, which is 

expected to provide further strategic directions for agricultural policy.  

24. The four DLIs under Results Area 2 (increased value addition and competitiveness 
of agriculture and livestock) will be achieved through policy and institutional reforms, as well 

as by marshalling public support for private investors, mainly through a matching grant scheme. 
 DLI 5: Providing incentives to agribusiness for investment in value addition. SMART Punjab will contribute 

US$ 10 million to an Agribusiness and Innovation Fund to be set up by GoPunjab. The fund will award matching 

grants, with particular consideration for women and young people, on a competitive basis (measured by the 

number of matching grants awarded for agribusiness). 

 DLI 6: Deregulating the livestock sector. Removing meat and raw milk price caps (measured by the 
discontinuation of notification of meat and milk prices) would stimulate production and marketing of better 

quality and safer livestock products, raising producers’ incomes and increasing supplies for urban areas.  

 DLI 7: Modernizing agricultural markets. Reforming wholesale market legislation to allow greater private 
sector participation and enhance transparency (measured by approval and notification of the Punjab Agricultural 

Marketing Regulatory Authority Act) would reduce margins taken by middlemen and commission agents and 

reduce the government’s role in controlling these markets.  

 DLI 8: Improving food safety. Better food and agricultural standards, backed by testing and enforcement 
mechanisms, would improve the quality of food products and public health, and address concerns about 

contaminated or adulterated products. This DLI will be measured by tracking progress in establishing and 

operationalizing a provincial food testing reference laboratory as well as regional and mobile laboratories.  

25. The four DLIs under Results Area 3 (enhanced resilience of smallholder farmers to 
climate change and natural disasters) will be achieved by improving the management and 

sustainability of water resources, designing and extending the coverage of improved agricultural 

insurance products for different kinds of producers, and public investment in CSA. 
 DLI 9: Improving sustainability of irrigation M&R. More equitable access to water and better assessment and 

collection of abiana would encourage producers to use water more efficiently with no increases in overall water 

use, and increase funds for M&R. Adoption of a provincial water policy and groundwater act are important first 

steps in addressing the overexploitation of water, falling groundwater tables, and increasing salinization. This 

DLI would be measured by approval of the Punjab Water Policy, notification of the 2017 Punjab Groundwater 

Act, improvements in the area assessed for abiana, tracking abiana collection rates, and water delivery 

performance ratios (defined as actual amount of water delivered divided by amount delivered as per canal 

design, measured at different points along the canal and relative to the delivery performance at the head of the 

canal). 

 DLI 10: Rolling-out an agricultural insurance system. Crop insurance can help crop producers stabilize 
incomes and sustain resilience when natural events deplete harvests. The World Bank submitted a feasibility 

report detailing a suitable crop insurance scheme to GoPunjab in July 2017. This DLI will be measured by 

official government approval of the report, development and notification of a workplan aligned with the report’s 

recommendations, piloting a crop insurance scheme in two districts, and rolling out the scheme in all districts.  



12 

 

 DLI 11: Increasing public investment in CSA. Enhancing public investment in CSA would help farmers adopt 
new technologies and approaches and reduce potential losses related to climate change, measured by tracking the 

percentage allocation of Agriculture in the ADP for CSA schemes. 

 DLI 12: Communications, capacity building, and monitoring and evaluation (M&E). A substantial 
communications strategy and capacity-building program will mobilize support for agricultural and rural 

transformation among stakeholders into the future. Strengthening M&E capacity in participating departments 

will facilitate monitoring of progress. This DLI will be measured by development and implementation of annual 

capacity development plans. 

 

 Environmental and Social Effects 

26. An Environmental and Social Systems Assessment (ESSA) was prepared for 
SMART Punjab. The assessment incorporates feedback from all stakeholders (governmental, 

non-governmental, producers) and presents recommendations and actions to address 

environmental and social risks associated with the Program. The main actions are included in the 

PAP and some of these constitute dated legal covenants. 

 

27. Environmental risks are Moderate. In general, the expected environment impacts from 
Program activities are assessed as medium to low. Environmental concerns include the 

possibility of increases in use of chemicals due to the shift from conventional crops to HVA; 

institutional capacity for effective environmental management; and environmental compliance 

by micro and small enterprises and food safety testing laboratories. SMART Punjab promulgates 

reforms and related actions that promote balanced fertilizer use, improved water resource 

regulation and efficiency, increased land productivity, agricultural insurance, and CSA. The 

Program is not expected to support large infrastructure except wheat storage facilities which are 

subject to EIA preparation. The Program will involve no expansion of the irrigation network but 

rather promote water resource efficiency. The Program will also not support expansion of 

agricultural land but contribute to increased land productivity. Improvements in animal health 

combined with deregulation of livestock prices would benefit public health. Improvements in 

animal breeding will relieve pressure on rangelands. Crop residue burning and application of 

untreated wastewater for irrigation are important environmental issues related to agriculture but 

not targeted by the proposed Program. 

 

28. Social risks are Substantial. The key social risks include (i) access to program benefits 
for vulnerable and marginalized groups, and (ii) potential social conflict. Smallholders and 

marginalized or vulnerable groups may find accessing some elements of SMART Punjab more 

challenging than other stakeholders — e.g. HVA, the E-voucher scheme, and matching grants. 

These groups may require special support, ranging from technical assistance, training, two-way 

communication, and social mobilization strategies. Phasing out of the wheat procurement system 

while lowering the wheat price thus benefiting the >90% of households who are net wheat 

buyers, may face strong opposition from large wheat growers. The Bank has agreed to provide 

significant technical assistance to assist the Food Department in mitigating social risk associated 

with wheat market reform. Attempts to improve abiana assessment and increase abiana 

collection are likely to meet resistance. Removal of price caps while having beneficial impacts 

on public health and incomes of livestock owners (most of them women), may also negatively 

impact consumption of fresh milk in low income households, unless preceded by an engagement 

strategy in which stakeholders are informed of the benefits of deregulation well in advance and 

milk producers can move towards increasing supply capacity in anticipation of better prices. An 



13 

 

effective conflict mitigation and awareness strategy must be in place to ensure that reforms do 

not lead to marginalization and conflict. No significant land acquisition is envisioned under the 

Program. 

 

29. With regard to grievance redress mechanisms, communities and individuals who 
believe that they are adversely affected as a result of a Bank-supported PforR operation, as 

defined by the applicable policy and procedures, may submit complaints to program grievance 

redress mechanisms or the World Bank Grievance Redress Service. The Grievance Redress 

Service ensures that complaints are promptly reviewed to address pertinent concerns. Affected 

communities and individuals may submit their complaint to the Bank’s independent Inspection 

Panel, which determines whether harm occurred or could occur as a result of the Bank’s non-

compliance with its policies and procedures. Complaints may be submitted at any time after 

concerns have been brought directly to the World Bank's attention, and Bank Management has 

been given an opportunity to respond. To submit complaints to the World Bank’s corporate 

Grievance Redress Service, visit www.worldbank.org/grs. To submit complaints to the World 

Bank Inspection Panel, visit www.inspectionpanel.org.  

 

30. In sum, although the proposed operation will undertake or support no activities of high 
risk from an environmental or social perspective, and although federal and provincial 

environmental and social management systems are appropriate, social management procedures 

require strengthening with respect to gender and the poor, conflict management, and two-way 

public engagement. Certain departments need to strengthen their grievance redress systems. The 

Environmental Section of P&D should be strengthened because P&D, having primary 

responsibility for coordinating and monitoring the Program, is in charge of environmental 

screening. For activities that require an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) or an Initial 

Environmental Examination (IEE), the relevant implementing agencies should coordinate with 

District Environment Officers. 

 Financing 

31. The financing framework for the activities under the three Results Areas includes 
two sources of finance: (i) GoPunjab budget; and (ii) SMART Punjab PforR (Table 3). 

32. In addition, a significant portion out of 
GoPunjab’s spending on subsidies is expected to 

be diverted towards investment in agriculture 

and livestock when the program is fully 

implemented by 2021. The GoPunjab has already 

substantially increased the capital investment 

allocation for agriculture and livestock in 

anticipation of such savings becoming available. 

33. Budgetary allocations for agriculture and livestock are considered sufficient and 
together with acceptable historical budget execution rates provide enough confidence that 

the intended results of the SMART program will be achieved. The government’s expenditure 

framework is sufficiently aligned with the SMART program to achieve the intended results.

 Program Institutional and Implementation Arrangements 

34. The Departments of Agriculture, Livestock & Dairy Development, Food, Irrigation, 
Industries, Finance, and P&D are responsible for implementing the SMART Punjab 

Program. Each department will have a dedicated Program Delivery Unit (PDU) or a Focal 

Person, depending upon the workload. Each PDU will include current departmental staff, 

supplemented by consultants as needed. Some departments have dedicated PDUs; others will 

establish them.
2
 The Member Agriculture (P&D Department) will act as the Program 

Coordinator for SMART Punjab in the Program Coordination and Monitoring Unit (PCMU), 

assisted by the Chief Agriculture as Deputy Manager. The PCMU which has been established 

under the Punjab Resource Management Program in the P&D Department and also coordinates 

the Jobs & Competitiveness PforR, will coordinate with the seven implementing agencies, 

monitor and evaluate implementation, and report to the Bank in accordance with the terms and 

conditions of the Financing and Program Agreements. It will consolidate reports of all 

implementing agencies and communicate them to the Bank; to do so, it will develop a standard 

template for monitoring and reporting progress. The PCMU will also coordinate with the 

Independent Verification Agency for verifying achievement of DLIs and reporting, and will 

establish an Assignment Account to manage technical assistance funding supported by the 

PforR. The Finance and P&D Departments will ensure that PforR resources are adequately 

budgeted for in their annual budget and disbursed in line with the expenditure framework to 

accomplish the DLIs.   

 

35. A SMART Steering Committee (SC) was established in September 2016. The SC has 
played a constructive role throughout preparation, especially in guiding and confirming policy 

reforms and institutional changes. Headed by the Chief Minister, Punjab, it includes 

administrative heads from all implementing agencies, other key stakeholders, and representatives 

from the Bank (including the Senior Director and Country Director) as observers. The SC will 

provide strategic guidance and direction, facilitate coordination between the seven implementing 

agencies, and oversee progress in all three Results Areas and DLIs on a quarterly basis as 

reported by the PCMU. To ensure effective implementation, the SC may refer any major 

implementation challenge or matter requiring a policy decision for guidance to the three high-

level committees (Secretaries’ Committee, Commissioners’ Conference, and DCO Committee) 

chaired by the Chief Secretary. 

 

36. SMART Punjab will coordinate and collaborate with other programs. It will create 
synergies with Bank projects in Punjab—including the Punjab Irrigated-agriculture Productivity 

Improvement Project (PIPIP) and the Jobs & Competitiveness PforR (P155963)—and operations 

of development partners.
3
 National entities with supporting roles include: (1) the Auditor 

                                                 
2
 The Agriculture Delivery Unit (ADU) will act as PDU in the Agriculture Department; the Statistical Planning and Reform Unit will act as PDU 

in the Irrigation Department; and the Food and Livestock & Dairy Development Departments will establish PDUs or (in the case of the Industries 

and Finance Departments) Focal Persons before appraisal. At a minimum, PDUs will be staffed by a Procurement Specialist, Financial Specialist, 

Communications Specialist, M&E Specialist, and Internal Audit Specialist, aside from the appropriate technical specialists. PDUs are responsible 
for procurement (tender documents, advertising, bid evaluation and award of contracts), FM, internal audit, communications, M&E, and 

environmental and social management. PDUs will report as required to the PCMU, including: (1) an annual investment plan for their department; 

(2) Terms of reference (ToRs) for consultancy services; (3) an annual procurement plan; (4) reports on implementation progress for each DLI 
under the Program; (5) Program Financial Statements, including procurement, if any; (6) internal audit reports; and (7) implementation of the 

communications strategy. 
3
 For example, the Food and Agriculture Organization (with the recently approved Technical Cooperation Project—Support for the formulation 

of projects for Strengthening Markets and Rural Transformation (SMART) Initiatives in Punjab, Pakistan), USAID (particularly the Punjab 



16 

 

General of Pakistan for the annual external audit of the Program; (2) the Punjab Public 

Procurement Regulatory Authority, which will provide technical guidance on public 

procurement and monitor compliance with procurement standards and practices; and (3) the 

National Accountability Bureau, which will investigate complaints on fraud and corruption (if 

any) relating to the Program.

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 

 
Since start of the reforms China has embarked successful rural transformation, which has stimulated economic growth 
and urbanization. On the other hand, broad-based economic growth, urbanization and industrialization have further 
enhanced rural transformation.  Over the last two decades over 200 million rural people have moved to urban areas to 
engage in labor-intensive industrial jobs.  Today about 58 percent of the Chinese population lives in urban areas, up from 
just 16 percent in 1960.  More than one billion Chinese – that is, 70 percent of the projected 1.5 billion population – are 
expected to live in urban areas by 2030.  Urbanization will increase aggregate demand for food as urban population 
consume more higher value products, especially meat, dairy, fruits and vegetables, as well as processed food.  
 
However, urbanization is also expected to increase the pressures on the agri-food systems in China through increasing gap 
between food demand and environmental supply limits. Addressing the latter requires managing pressures on intensive 
margins to increase productivity per unit of land, and on extensive margin to produce more high value food.  The largest 
environmental pressures come from primary agricultural production stage, which is dominated by large number of small-
scale production units. China is the world’s largest producers and user of synthetic nitrogenous fertilizer, both on an 
absolute and per hectare basis.  The consumption of agricultural fertilizers in China was 58 million tons in 2017.  Grain 
production is the leading user of chemical fertilizers at aggregate level, although the highest rates of fertilizer application 
generally occur in fruit and vegetable production. It has been estimated that only around 25% of nitrogen is taken up by 
crops in China compared to 50% in Europe and almost 70% in the U.S. and Canada, with the remainder running off into 
water sources or entering the air as nitrous oxide.  Ammonia emissions from inefficient use of N fertilizers contribute 
around 10% of the air pollution (PM2.5) over the North China Plain and Pearl and Yangtze River Deltas. According to the 
first census on national pollution source in 2010, Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Total Nitrogen (TN) and Total 
Phosphorus (TP) are major sources of pollutants from agriculture sector. While COD mainly comes from livestock sector, 
accounting for 96% the total emissions, TN and TP are primarily attributable to overuse of fertilizers in crop sector, 
accounting for 38% and 59% of the total emissions. The consumption of pesticides in China was about 1.8 million tons per 
year in 2015, and it has been estimated that only about 30% of it was utilized by crops. Soil and water pollution are also 
threat to the environment and food safety.  While industrial pollution is a leading source of soil and water contamination, 
the overuse of pesticides is also a significant contributor (about 10 million hectares of farmland are affected by overuse 
of pesticides). Heavy use of pesticides has been especially common in rice, vegetable, and tea production. Addressing 
above environmental management and pollution control in agriculture, requires thus a simultaneous attention on the 
modernization of farming systems, while meeting increasing consumer demand for nutrition, high quality and safe food.  
 
Chinese agriculture is also the largest producer of agriculture related greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the world, accounting 
for about 13% of total global agricultural GHG emissions. Overall, primary agriculture sector accounted for about 11% of 



China’s GHG emissions - third largest source of GHGs in China after energy and industry. Agriculture is major source of 
methane (from rice and livestock manure) and nitrous oxide (from manure and use of N fertilizers). Livestock, particularly 
cattle and pig rearing, is single largest sub-sector contributing to nearly 15.5 percent of total human induced GHG 
emissions in the country. There is evidence that climate change itself is contributing to increasing pressures on Chinese 
food production systems and already limited water and land resources. Further, climate change is also expected to 
exacerbate exposure of agricultural produce to pathogens and toxins that will increase the risk of food borne diseases. 
 
Henan is an important agricultural province in China. It is the largest producer of livestock and the second largest producer 
of grains (6.8 million ha of arable land) in China. It produces also a significant quantities of oil crops, fruits and vegetables.  
The total manure discharges from livestock industry has risen since 1990, reaching about 253 million tons per year. The 
increase is largely contributed to the rapid growth of pig and cattle production since 1990s as a response to increasing 
demand for meat. Pork industry accounts for 50.1% of the total manure discharges, followed by cattle 28.1%, and poultry 
with 12.6%. The consumption of pesticides in Henan was 128,700 tons in 2015 (the second largest after Shandong 
province), while the consumption of chemical fertilizers reached 7.06 million tons in 2017 (the largest in China). Grains, 
fruits and vegetables are the major users of fertilizers, accounting for 82.8% of total crop fertilizer consumptions.  Total 
COD discharges in Henan were 10.2 million tons, most of which come from livestock sector, while crop sector mas a major 
contributor of TN with 93,500 tons and TP discharges with 5,300 tons (NBS, 2017). Total GHG emissions from agriculture 
in Henan increased from 16.6 million tons in 1999 to 18 million tons in 2015 (9%).  Livestock sector was the biggest 
contributor to GHG emissions, followed by fertilizer use and soil management.  Henan has thus a good potential to reduce 
environmental footprint from agriculture (both at national level and globally) and contribute to the production of safe, 
high quality and nutritious food. The proposed project aims to support the transformation of Henan agriculture sector 
towards more resource-efficient, environmentally sustainable, and climate smart development path, which is expected to 
reduce agriculture’s environmental footprint and increase agri-food safety. 
 

Sectoral and Institutional Context 
 
Transformation of Chinese agri-food systems towards more sustainable development path requires massive financing 
from financial institutions (both public and private) and private sector (e.g. agribusinesses, capital funds, etc.). However, 
financial sector institutions in China have lent a disproportionately lower share of their loan portfolios to agriculture, 
compared to agriculture sector’s share of GDP. The growth and deepening of agriculture finance markets is constrained 
by a variety of factors which include: (i) low profitability, (ii) collateral requirements, (iii) covariance of production, market, 
and price risks and absence of adequate market-based instruments to manage risks, (iv) fragmentation of value chains, (v) 
high perception of risks, etc.  
 
China has put in place policy environment which is conducive for the development of green agriculture financing to 
encourage transformation of its agri-food systems towards more sustainable development path. In 2018, the Government 
formulated its Rural Revitalization Strategy (RRS) which aims to create more modern and resource efficient production 
structures, while ensuring environmental sustainability and safety of agri-produce.  Promoting green agriculture is an 
important aspect of the RRS which provides the package of policies and incentives to encourage higher-quality agricultural 
development, strengthening environmental protection and pollution control in rural areas, while ensuring the quality of 
poverty-reduction efforts.  Other key goals of Government’s sustainable agriculture development plans include: (i) zero 
growth of chemical fertilizers and pesticides by 2020; (ii) control of methane emissions from rice fields and nitrous oxide 
emissions from farmland; and (iii) adoption of recyclable agricultural systems that includes reutilization of animal waste. 
These efforts also aim improved resource use efficiency (water, energy, natural resources) and improved environmental 
governance. The structural changes promoted through above policies, such as consolidation of livestock industry and 
transfer of farm land to more professional entities (agribusinesses, farmer cooperatives, etc.), better access to new 

 

technologies, and increasing resilience of production systems through more professional management practices could 
harbinger new opportunities for access to agriculture finance.  
 
China introduced Green Credit Policy in 2007 to encourage financial institutions to offer green credit for environmental 
protection, emission reduction, and energy conservation projects. However, little progress has been made in green 
agriculture finance, largely due lack of clarity in the definition of what constitutes “green”, the incipient nature of many 
potential innovations (e.g. enhanced efficiency fertilizers, etc.), and risk aversion towards the sector. Only few banks 
currently engage in green agricultural finance which is quite narrowly defined to cover organic agriculture and livestock, 
seed production, and animal breeding. The aggregate national level green finance portfolio is about $1.2 trillion of green 
credit and $ 89 billion in green bonds, most which has gone to energy, urban water, transport and industrial sectors where 
commercial investments options and technologies are relatively well defined. Total green finance for agriculture is about 
$9 billion or only 0.4% from aggregate national green finance.  Banks with larger loan portfolios in green agricultural credit 
are Agricultural Bank of China, Agricultural Development Bank and Postal Savings Bank.   
 
There are signs of emerging policy guidance for streamlining green financing for agriculture in China.  In 2018, the Ministry 
of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (MARA) issued the Notice on the Technical Guide for Green Agriculture Development 
(2018-2030) outlining range of investments to accelerate the pace of green input creation, improve green technology 
supply, establish green development system and low carbon model, build or enhance green standards system, formulate 
the monitoring and early warning mechanism of agricultural resources, environment and ecology. However, on the policy 
side, there are currently little incentives for financial institutions to increase their lending for green agriculture investments 
beyond showing adherence with the PBOC green finance guidelines and counting towards their CSR activities.   
 
The demand of agriculture and agribusiness for green financing will be driven either by commercial opportunities or by 
stringent regulations. Some investments that increase the environmental efficiency of agriculture and agri-processing such 
as investments in precision agriculture or investments in energy efficient processing facilities are profitable on their own 
right, requiring mainly technical assistance and access to financing to be adopted by farms and firms.   On the other end, 
some environmentally necessary investments such as those related to the treatment of residual waste, water pollutants 
and livestock manure do not generate significant private income, although they significantly contribute to public welfare. 
The adoption of such investments thus depends on the existence of adequate regulations and enforcement mechanisms 
to ensure that they are adopted. It is expected that the 14th 5YP will bring increased push for more stringent enforcement 
of environmental and pollution control regulations, including agriculture. This should generate important new policy 
incentives to foster the demand for environmentally sustainable growth models and investments. 
 
Increasing demand for high quality, nutritious and safe food has created renewed private sector interest to invest in 
Chinese agri-food sector, which provides scope to harness green agriculture finance.  This renewed interest is creating 
new opportunities for financial institutions which would need to develop the right skills to capture opportunities in 
investing in green agriculture.  At the same time, emerging evidence obtained from CBRC shows that while agricultural 
loan NPLs in China are around 7%, NPLs for organic agriculture (one type of green agriculture) are only 3.5% indicating 
that lending to green agriculture could potentially be less risky.  There is thus an opportunity to create new  financial 
markets for agriculture green investments by equipping financial institutions with global knowledge of green agriculture 
finance standards, financing instruments, innovative risk measurement and control systems, and providing them tools to 
build a pipeline of bankable green agricultural investments for financing which could enhance their capacity and risk-
taking ability for expanding  green finance to agriculture sector in China over coming years.    
 

 

Relationship to CPF 
 
The proposed Henan Green Agriculture Financing Fund Project is fully aligned with the World Bank’s Country Partnership 
Strategy (Report 67566-CN) for China (FY2013–16), discussed by the Board on November 6, 2012 and the new CPF under 
preparation consistent under its expected objective of demonstrating sustainable agriculture practices and improving food 
system quality and safety.  The relevant criteria from capital increase paper which apply to the proposed project include:  
 

• Strengthening of institutional capacities for the graduation (development of the capacity to identify and manage 
green agriculture investments); 

• Delivering regional and global public goods (e.g., financing climate smart agriculture, climate change mitigation or 
adaptation in agriculture, etc.); and 

• Introducing innovative institutional and technical solutions to emerging challenges that can provide lessons for 
other middle-income countries (e.g., financing climate smart agriculture and pollution control, etc.).  

 
The project places emphasis on institutional and financing innovations for inclusive and green growth agenda contributing 
to enhanced economic opportunities in rural areas, addressing environmental pollution and climate change under the CPF 
pillar of promoting more inclusive development. Further, the proposed project would have the potential for generating 
high climate co-benefits and contributing to the achievement of China’s agriculture-related Nationally Determined 
Commitments (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement. 
 
C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  

 
The proposed objective of the project is to strengthen the green agriculture initiatives in Henan.  
 
Key Results (From PCN) 

 
• Increased volume and value of green agriculture investments (particularly attracting more social capital); 
• Increased awareness among key stakeholders about green agriculture investment opportunities; and 
• Enhanced institutional capacity for managing green investments portfolio. 
 
D. Concept Description 

 
The selected lending instrument is an Intermediary Financing (FI). The proposed IBRD funding is $200 million, with at least 
same amount being raised from social capital and other funding sources. The proposed project will have two components, 
the first one providing the funding for investments in eligible green agriculture sub-projects and the second one providing 
technical assistance.   
 
Component 1: Green Agriculture Fund (GAF). The project will establish a dedicated investment facility to demonstrate the 
viability of a financing vehicle in Henan, which will operate in a transparent manner conforming to market principles on 
sustainable basis. This facility will provide direct support to eligible firms with ‘patient capital’ using ‘blended finance 
options’. Direct investments by GAF will aim to leverage to the extent possible private and commercial capital from social 
capital partners (i.e. local commercial banks, private investment firms and financial institutions).  
 
 
Component 2: Technical Assistance (IBRD financing $20 million). The project will support the Henan Agriculture 
Development Financing Investment Corporation (HADFIC) and its social capital partners in building their institutional 

 

capacity in managing green agriculture investment cycle including: pipeline development, investment policies, 
implementation guidelines and monitoring mechanisms meeting prudential and regulatory requirements under the 
framework for green financial system.

Summary of Screening of Environmental and Social Risks and Impacts 

 
Overall, the project will bring about positive environmental and social benefits in terms of reducing the pollution from 
agricultural productions, reducing the GHG emissions, and reducing health risk for consumers by improving the food 
safety and quality. As the project will involve small or medium size civil works for processing and/or storage facilities, the 
potential environmental impacts in construction phase may include the dust, noise, solid waste, and wastewater, and 
social disturbance, such as the traffic safety. Other potential adverse environmental impacts could include noise, dust, 
solid waste, wastewater generated from the manufacturing of equipment, high-efficiency fertilizers and biocides as well 
as processing of agro-products; occupational health concern regarding the mechanical damage by operating machine 
tools, inhaling fine particles in processing of agro-products, and toxicity by production, storage and use of biocides which 
is albeit low toxic to human beings. The probability for such risks is very low, and the impacts are small given their size. In 
addition, the use of multi-resistant varieties will cause a concern on both environemntal and social aspects. However, the 
specific information is not clear for these varieties at current concept stage. The criteria for assessing and excluding any 
invasive species and screening for risk categorization will be developed in the ESMS. The potential environmental 
impacts are mostly temporary, predictable and/or reversible, and the nature of the Project does not preclude the 
possibility of avoiding or reversing them. They are medium in magnitude and/or in spatial extent. These adverse impacts 
can be readily and reliably managed through the environmental mitigation hierarchy. As per the Environmental and 
Social Directive, the environmental risk for this project is classified as Substantial.  
 
The main social risks and impacts for the project are related to (a) land acquisition and resettlement for establishing 
facilities and structures by targeted enterprises, (b) leasing of land use rights (LUR) and land consolidation for 
appropriate-scale farming, (c) management of direct workers and primary supplier workers, and (d) community health 
and safety and (e) social implications (positive, negative or perceived) relating use of multi-resistant varieties. Land 
acquisition and resettlement would happen upfront before determination of the sub-projects; however, documentation 
should be provided to ensure compliance with national regulations. According to ESS9, the FIs will categorize any sub-
project which involves resettlement as High or Substantial risk (unless the risks or impacts of such resettlement are 
minor). Leasing of LUR, different from involuntary land acquisition and resettlement, is carried out at village level and 
Henan has put in place relatively sound laws and regulations to facilitate this process. However, the level of regulation 
enforcement could vary from one village to another in terms of public consultation, and arrangement of rental 
payments. Adequacy of current system is subject to further assessment. The project would introduce a few direct 
workers and the number of primary supplier workers, which could potentially increase the risks related to working 
conditions and community health and safety, if not well managed. Use of multi-resistant varieties would induce social 
implications which will be further assessed when “green agriculture” is defined under this project and there are more 
information on project activities. Based on possible social risks associated with the leasing of LUR and until relevant 
national and provincial systems and practices governing such activities are fully assessed, the overall social risk of the

B. Introduction and Context

Country Context
India in recent years witnessed impressive economic growth and poverty alleviation. During the 
past decade, India's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew at 7.6% annually and poverty incidence 
reduced on average by 1.5 percentage points per year during 2005-10. Also,improvements in key 
development indicators have been remarkable: life expectancy increased from 31 years in 1947 to 
68 years in 2015 and adult literacy increased from 18% in 1951 to 71% in 2015. 
 
Despite such impressive progress in economic growth, poverty alleviation, and improved human 
development indicators, India remains home to 263 million poor people (80% of whom reside in 
rural areas) living on less than US$1.90/day and the country is still at the bottom of the group of 
middle-income countries. To address these challenges, the Government of India (GoI) through its 
12th Five-Year Plan (FY2013-17) put forward an ambitious goal for economic growth, poverty 
reduction, job creation, and environmental management. The plan foresees during this period an 
annual GDP growth of 8.2%, a reduction in poverty rate by 10 percentage points, and 50 million 
of new jobs.
Sectoral and Institutional Context
Tamil Nadu is the second largest state economy in India with one of fastest growth rates: over the 
past three years its Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) grew at 9.2% per annum.  The average 
annual per capita income of the state is around INR 61,500 (at 2010/2011constant prices), which 
is around 42% higher than the national average. Tamil Nadu is also the most urbanized state in 
India with around 48% of population living in cities. 
 
Agriculture and allied sectors in Tamil Nadu account for 12% of the state's GSDP. About 40% of 
state's population is dependent on agriculture for their employment and more than two thirds of 
state's poor people live in rural areas and are engaged in predominately in agriculture activities. 
The majority of farmers are small and marginal with average family landholdings of 0.83 ha. The 
main crops are rice, maize, pulses, groundnut, sugar cane, vegetables, and banana. Rice dominates 
both consumption and agriculture production accounting for 34% of total gross cropped area and 
60% of irrigated area. Due to seasonality and scarcity of water supply, cultivation is mostly 
limited to only one crop per plot per year. 
 
Tamil Nadu is one of the driest and most water stressed states of India with average annual 
rainfall of 925 millimeters, which is well below the national average of 1,200 millimeters. Per 
capita availability of water in the state is around 900 cubic meters a year compared with the 
national average of 2,100 cubic meters.  The agriculture sector in Tamil Nadu is highly exposed 
to climatic risks, especially droughts, floods, cyclones, and erratic rainfall, which have frequently 
affected the performance of agricultural sector in the past. The dry season lasts five months 
(January through May) even in good years, and droughts occur in three out of ten years.  Climate 
change is likely to exacerbate the vulnerability of agricultural sector with increasing erratic 
weather patterns and climatic shifts.  A clear example is the consequence of devastating floods 
that occurred in November-December 2015, which severely damaged irrigation infrastructures in 
three districts and affected Chennai, the capital city of Tamil Nadu as well. 
 
The state is heavily dependent on irrigated agriculture and over the years an impressive inventory 
of irrigation and water infrastructure was built in the state. There are 89 major reservoirs, 39,000 
tanks (traditional water harvesting structures) and 3 million wells. Irrigated agriculture is the 


largest consumer of water in the State accounting for 75% of total water usage. About 3 million 
ha of land (54% of total crop land) is under irrigation with different sources of water: 30% of total 
irrigated area is under canal irrigation, 21% is under tank irrigation, and 49% is irrigated by wells. 
 
In recent years the state's agriculture sector has grown modestly at less than 3% per annum 
compared with 6-9% growth of the state's economy. The productivity of major crops has largely 
stagnated:  the current average yields of rice and maize are slightly higher than the national 
average, the average yields of vegetables, cotton, and pulses are lower than the national average. 
To unlock the full potential of agriculture sector growth, there is a strong need for policies and 
programs to focus on: (i) improvement of water use efficiency; (ii) intensification of cropping 
systems and diversification into high value crops; (iii) enhancement of post-harvest management 
and value addition; and (iv) improvement of the resilience of agriculture system in order to deal 
with increasing threats of climate change. 
 
The Bank-supported Tamil Nadu Irrigated Agriculture Modernization and Water-Bodies 
Restoration and Management Project (TN IAMWARMP), which was concluded in 2015, has had 
a significant development impact in the state by modernizing irrigation infrastructure, improving 
water use efficiency, enhancing yields and productivity of agriculture, livestock and fisheries, and 
promoting diversification to high value crops. It also supported the introduction of participatory 
irrigation management in the state and the establishment of water users associations (WUAs). 
Under the project 5,300 tanks and irrigation supply canals were rehabilitated and modernized, and 
2,800 WUAs were established resulting in increases of fully irrigated areas by 39% and water 
conveyance efficiency by more than 30%. The total area under high value crop was also doubled. 
Moreover, the project helped the state improve its water resource planning and implementation 
capacities.  These achievements and lessons learned during implementation of TN IAMWARMP 
serve as a good base for further enhancing the performance of irrigated agriculture in the state 
through the proposed project.
Relationship to CAS/CPS/CPF
The proposed project is fully consistent with the India Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for 
FY2013-17 to support poverty reduction and shared prosperity in India. In line with the pillar for 
Transformation, the project promotes inclusive rural growth, development and dissemination of 
new agricultural technologies, climate-resilient agriculture, enhanced market linkages for small 
and marginal farmers, and improved water and natural resource management. Further the 
proposed project will have a positive impact in terms of environmental protection, and reduced 
greenhouse gas emissions by disseminating high efficiency irrigation systems, and promoting 
diversification into high value crops, which significantly reduce water consumption. 
 
The proposed project will contribute to the Inclusion pillar of CSP by enhancing the livelihoods 
of small and marginal farmers through crop diversification, enhanced market access, and also by 
improving disaster management abilities of GoTN and the local communities through the 
enhanced design and restoration of irrigation infrastructure with better flood protection features.

C.  Proposed Development Objective(s)

Proposed Development Objective(s) (From PCN)
To enhance agriculture productivity, water use efficiency, climate resilience of irrigated 
agriculture and increase post-harvest value-addition for smallholder farmers and agro-
entrepreneurs in Tamil Nadu. 

The project beneficiaries are farmers, including small and marginal, water users associations, 
farmer producer organizations, and other entrepreneurs.

Key Results (From PCN)
The key project indicators (KPI) will be: 
 
(i) Increase in water use efficiency (resilience, water use efficiency); 
(ii) Increase in agricultural productivity (productivity); 
(iii) Increase in areas cultivated by non-paddy crops (diversification and value added);  
(iv) Adoption of resilient technologies and practices (resilience); and  
(v) Total number of project beneficiaries (including number of female beneficiaries).

D.  Concept Description

The design of the proposed project will include innovative aspects that build on lessons learned 
from TN IAMWARMP and also reflect the evolving needs of the state when it comes to 
modernization of irrigated agriculture. These include improved designs of irrigation 
infrastructure, stronger focus on the demand-side of irrigation with aim to improve water-use 
efficiency, further advances in agricultural diversification, agri-entrepreneurship, and movement 
toward climate resilient agriculture with relevant agriculture-water related investments and 
substantial improvements of participatory irrigation management practices by beneficiaries.  
Improved resilience of agriculture production systems is expected to be achieved under the 
project through e.g. higher water use efficiency, increased adoption of sustainable technologies 
and practices, and enhanced diversification of production systems. Activities under the project 
will be duly complimented by use of innovative ICT and new media technologies for enhanced 
efficiencies and faster turnaround time for delivering services to project beneficiaries.  As 
requested by GoTN, the project is also expected to finance on-retroactive basis, rehabilitation and 
modernization of tanks and other irrigation infrastructures damaged by the flooding of 
November/-December 2015 floods in three districts of Tamil Nadu. 
 
The total project cost is expected to be around US$454 million, of which the Bank will finance 
$318 million (70% of total project cost) and the GoTN will finance US$ 136 million (30% of total 
project cost). The project activities will cover the entire state of Tamil Nadu (its individual 
components will cover different geographic areas) and will be implemented over seven year 
period.    The project activities would be grouped into three main components: (i) Agriculture 
Water Management; (ii) Agriculture Productivity Enhancement, Diversification, and Value 
Addition; and (iii) Project Management Support. The individual components are summarized 
below: 
 
Component A: Irrigation and Water Management 
 
This component addresses irrigation and water management in a holistic fashion by covering both 
supply and demand simultaneously.  It consists of four inter-related sub-components, including: 
(i) institutional strengthening and capacity building of water management; (ii) irrigation systems 
modernization; (iii) participatory irrigation management;   and (iv) converged service delivery at 
the grass-root level.     
 
Sub-component A.1: Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building of Water Management 
 


This subcomponent aims to assist the GoTN in addressing the pressing water sector issues, 
including: (i) need for integrated water resources planning, bulk water allocations  and 
management in a basin context, involving all water using sub-sectors to improve the efficiency 
and productivity of limited water resources; (ii) need to improve the knowledge base and 
instruments; (iii) need to improve the financial sustainability of water sector assets, and cost 
effective reliable service delivery; and (iv) need to promote participatory irrigation service 
management. These will be done through strengthening of capacities for enhancing policy 
analysis and implementation, knowledge base, analytical capacity, staff mobility, filling of subject 
matter specialists/experts gap, technology induction, office facilities, and related technical/
logistical support.  
 
Sub-component A.2: Irrigation Systems Modernization 
 
This sub-component will modernize irrigation infrastructures, including tanks, and irrigation 
canals.  The modernization of irrigation infrastructure will focus on improving the bulk water 
delivery to irrigation systems through rehabilitation and modernization of approximately 4,800 
tanks, and 477 anicuts in 66 sub-basins out of total 127 sub-basins.  Activities under this sub-
component will be carried out based on individual sub-basin development plans specifically 
developed and tailored to local conditions, and will aim to revive traditional water bodies (tanks) 
that are either part of or outside the state➢❨ s irrigation systems network.  The sub-component 
will finance civil works, equipment, consultancies, training and incremental operational costs 
associated with modernization of the schemes, and the work will be carried out by WRD, and as 
required  with direct involvements of WUAs.  
 
Sub-component A.3:Participatory irrigation Management 
 
This sub-component aims to integrate participatory irrigation management (PIM) practices into 
the operations of the Water Resource Department as a distinct unit within the Department in order 
to improve Operation and Maintenance (O&M) of modernized and rehabilitated irrigation 
infrastructures.  The sub-component will assist in strengthening and establishing new water users 
associations (WUAs), including operationalizing WUAs to undertake O&M, water distribution, 
and asset rehabilitation works within their command areas.  
 
Sub-component A.4: Converged Service Delivery at Grass-Root Level 
 
For effective service delivery to farmers, all departments involved in the water sector need to 
collaborate. This convergence for service delivery will be promoted through establishing and 
strengthening Single Window Information and Knowledge Centers (SWIKCs), and facilitating 
Community Collaborative Water Management (CCWM) at village level. CCWM will sensitize 
local communities about the water situation and enable them to draw community level action 
plans for sustainable use of water in their villages for all water users. 
 
The overall component will be supported by information and communication technology (ICT) 
Innovative ICT and new media solutions coupled with robust monitoring and evaluation systems 
for real time submission of information related to the project activities will be designed, 
developed and deployed under Component A in addition to leveraging on the existing ICT 
solutions developed during IAMWARM.  In particular, specific ICT interventions to be 
undertaken under this components will be:  (i) Operationalization and enhancement of Enterprise 


Information Managemenget System platform developed under IAMWARMP through retroactive 
financing and (ii) Implementation of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition systems based 
upon sensors based inputs for automation of at least one canal network. 
 
Component B: Agriculture Productivity Enhancement, Diversification, and Value Addition 
 
The interventions of this component are aimed at increasing productivity, promoting 
diversification of agriculture production systems, and improving farmers➢❨  access to markets in 
project sub-basins. The component will adopt climate-resilient approaches that promote 
sustainable use of land and water resources. The component will consist of two sub-components:  
(i) sustainable intensification and diversification of agriculture production systems; and (ii) 
marketing, value-addition and post-harvest management.  
 
Sub-component B.1: Sustainable intensification and diversification of agriculture production 
systems 
 
Sustainable intensification and diversification of agriculture production systems will be achieved 
through a large scale program of awareness creation and on-farm demonstrations on new seeds 
and promising technologies, capacity building and training activities; and by leveraging private 
sector investments in water management and farm mechanization.  Climate risk resilience will be 
built into crop and horticulture production systems by:  (a) promoting cultivation of short 
duration, high yielding, drought-, pest- and disease-tolerant crops/varieties of pulses, maize, 
oilseeds, millets, vegetables and fruits; (b) installation of micro irrigation drip and fertigation 
systems; and (c) promoting water saving agronomic practices like the system of rice 
intensification and the sustainable sugarcane initiative.  For linking production with market 
demand, farmers will be supported and trained to grow those crops and commodities for which 
significant market demand exists, including a shift from paddy to crops with low water 
consumption in which Tamil Nadu is deficient.  ICT-based leveraged activities will be introduced 
like E-velanmai, Farmer Cropping Advisory.  
 
Animal husbandry activities will aim at improving production potentials of livestock through 
adoption of sustainable and climate resilient animal husbandry practices (including fodder 
cultivation) technologies, strengthening of input, extension, and service delivery systems, 
establishing ICT based MIS and infrastructure strengthening and capacity building in breeding, 
disease surveillance and food safety. 
 
Fisheries activities will aim at improving fish productivity mainly in reservoirs, tanks and ponds 
through demonstration of climate resilient modern technology packages such as: short production 
cycle models involving improved fast growing fish varieties; improved reservoir fisheries 
management; introduction of suitable formulated fish feed using locally available ingredients; 
promotion of innovative technologies such as cage fish culture and pen fish farming in an 
environmentally sustainable manner; and facilitation of suitable market linkages for better access 
to markets.   
 
Related to above activities, the project will finance the incremental requirements of contractual 
subject matter experts and support staff, goods and equipment, consultancies, studies, trainings, 
civil works, and incremental operating costs. The Project will also support the GoTN in 
improving existing policies, regulations, and procedures to achieve a climate-resilient and 



sustainable agriculture system by commissioning feasibility studies, preparing detailed action 
plans and implementation guidelines.  
 
Sub-component B.2: Value Addition and Post-Harvest Management 
 
This subcomponent will aim at enhancing farmers' linkages to markets by providing alternative 
marketing channels and improving farm level post-harvest management and value addition.  The 
project will support the setting up of an Agribusiness Promotion Facility, development of farmer 
producer organizations/companies, integration of commercial value chains of agricultural 
commodities, and will facilitate public-private partnerships to enable direct buying arrangements.  
Support will also be provided for modernization and upgrading of selected Regulated Markets 
dealing with project produces and weekly farmers➢❨  markets/rural markets (Varashanthais) on 
cost sharing basis, innovative pilots, institutional strengthening and capacity building of 
Agriculture Marketing and Agribusiness Department. The GoTN is currently in the process of 
amending the Agriculture Produce Market Act of 1987, which would bring in substantial reforms, 
and among others, would create a conducive environment to development of more efficient 
markets with extensive usage of latest ICT technologies. 
 
Component C: Project Management Support 
 
The project will adopt the model of multi-departmental coordination and convergence, and will 
follow the general institutional structure of IAMWARM. The Multi-Disciplinary Project Unit 
(MDPU) established under the IAMWARM will also serve as the management and coordination 
unit for the proposed IAMP, with modifications as needed to be considered during project 
preparation. The MDPU will be responsible for ensuring support to preparation and 
implementation of overall project budget, sub-basin development plans, and implementation 
progress reports by the line departments. The MDPU will provide M&E, procurement and 
fiduciary support as needed to the project implementing agencies. 
 
The activities to be undertaken under the component will also be supported by: i) implementation 
of mobile application and associated back-end software tools for Geo Tagging and remote sensing 
based monitoring of project outcomes and  ii) Implementation of GIS based data acquisition and 
analysis system for studying emission of Methane and other Green House Gases (GHG) in project 
area. Citizen Engagement including Grievance Redressal is to be done by respective department 
as per agreed system.

II. SAFEGUARDS
A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis (if known)
The project will be implemented in 66 sub-basins, including the areas experiencing droughts, floods 
and other climate/natural shocks, particularly in coastal areas. The project activities might  influence 
a diverse set of habitats/ecosystems, including, coastal, plains, hilly, wetlands, rivers and sub-river 
basins as explain below.

B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
The primary implementing agency has developed some capacity in managing social and 
environmental impacts under IAMWARM Project, which is the first phase to this project    but 
remain weak when it comes to monitoring and reporting of environmental and social manageent 




aspects. Moreover, officials, particularly engineers, who were engaged in the previous project may 
move out due to transfers and this may require additional capacity building measures for the current 
staff. The implementing agency has some familiarity in preparing secondary data based 
environmental atlas for sub-basins, undertaking minor Social and Environmental Assessments, 
preparing Environmental Status Reports and contracting special studies of the river basins in the 
State. However, the second phase project will cover new sub-basins, a fresh full environmental and 
social assessment would be required for which the borrower will prepare and share with the Bank a 
detailed Terms of Reference. A multi-disciplinary project unit (including environmental and social 
experts) is being set up to facilitate the preparation and implementation of this project and based on 
experience of the previous project, will require additional support of external experts to facilitate the 
assessment both during preparation and then during operational phase for implementing the 
mitigation measures.

D. POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional)
Environmental Assessment 
OP/BP 4.01

Yes Significant physical investments are expected under 
the project and although the nature of these 
investments would be largely rehabilitation of 
existing assets, improper construction could result in 
adverse impacts. An Environmental and Social 
Assessment will be undertaken and an 
Environmental and Social Management Plans would 
be developed for managing risks and maximize 
environmental and social opportunities. These will 
take into account earlier work and experiences of the 
TN WRCP project and consideration of new 
activities proposed in the TN IAMWARM project.

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 Yes This is triggered, as a large number of tanks will be 
rehabilitated, including carrier system, which may 
impact natural habitats, particularly wetlands. 
Careful mapping using remote sensing will be 
undertaken as part of conducting the environmental 
assessment.

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No No impacts on forests are expected and the project 
will not affect existing forest management practices.

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes No pesticides and fertilizers are expected to be 
financed directly by the project; however, there may 
be induced impacts of increased fertilizer and 
pesticide use due to improved agricultural 
intensification and diversification. The project will 
support scaling-up state-wide Integrated Pest 


Management and Integrated Nutrient Management 
efforts and support for safer and organic food 
production and marketing. A pest management plan 
will be prepared as part of the EA.

Physical Cultural Resources 
OP/BP 4.11

TBD No significant adverse impacts on cultural property 
expected, but this issue will be examined during the 
ESA (particularly in relation to proper management 
of any religious and other physical cultural property 
associated with tanks during rehabilitation).

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 
4.10

TBD A Tribal Mapping of 66 sub-basins to identify areas 
in the sub-basins that are categorized as belonging to 
Schedule 5 areas where GoTN's Tribal Sub-Plans 
and where Forest Rights Act are implemented  will 
be undertaken as part of Social Assessment to 
determine whether or not the OP/BP 4.10 is 
triggered.

Involuntary Resettlement OP/
BP 4.12

Yes Modernization of irrigation systems and 
rehabilitation and required civil works are likely to 
involve involuntary resettlement. Though efforts will 
be made to avoid this, necessary structures and 
processes to mitigate adverse impacts, if any will be 
put in place in the Social Management Plan.

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 Yes The dam safety policy is triggered as some tanks 
may have embankments higher than 15 m, though it 
will be confirmed once tanks are identified. The 
proposed project will draw technical resources from 
the ongoing World Bank funded Dam Rehabilitation 
and ImprovementProject (DRIP) in the State of 
Tamil Nadu, including the participation of the Dam 
Safety Review Panel. During preparation, the 
specific needs for supporting safety of Dams and 
tank systems will be assessed comprehensively and 
interventions needed will be determined. This 
includes the necessary monitoring system.

Projects on International 
Waterways OP/BP 7.50

No The project does not fall on any international 
waterways.

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/
BP 7.60

No The project is not in any disputed areas.

E. Safeguard Preparation Plan
1. Tentative target date for preparing the PAD Stage ISDS
29-Dec-2016
2. Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be 
needed. The specific studies and their timing should be specified in the PAD-stage 
ISDS.
An Environmental and Social Assessment (ESA) shall be completed by November 30, 2016, which 


will be for the entire project period. A number of safeguards instruments are expected to be 
prepared. An Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) will be prepared, as all 
investments and their locations would not be known by appraisal. An Environment Management 
Plan (EMP) and a Social Management Plan (SMP) will be prepared by appraisal for at least one 
large infrastructure sub-project. In addition, a Pest Management Plan (PMP) will be prepared that 
will be applicable through the project period. Based on the assessment to trigger the policy on 
Indigenous Peoples, an Indigenous Peoples Framework may be prepared.  Finally, A Resettlement 
Action Plan (RAP) will also be prepared.

B. Introduction and Context 

 


Country Context   
China’s success in reducing extreme poverty since the economic reform period is widely recognized as an 
event of global significance. Based on the international poverty line of US$1.90 per day (expressed in 2011 
purchasing power parity), the World Bank estimates that the incidence of poverty in China declined from 
877.8 million in 1981 to 87.4 million in 2012 (or from 88.3 percent to 6.5 percent of the total population).  
These World Bank estimates indicate that about 790 million Chinese escaped poverty during this period, 
representing about 72 percent of global poverty reduction. These estimates of declining poverty have 
been matched by broad-based improvements in nutritional status, educational attainment, longevity and 
other health outcomes, as well as other indicators of well-being. In fact, China was the first country to 
achieve the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of halving the number of people living in poverty by 
2015, and it did it ahead of schedule. This highlights the country’s leading role in global poverty reduction. 
 
In its Thirteenth Five Year Plan (13th 5YP), Chinese government made an ambitious commitment to 
eliminating rural poverty by 2020, ten years before the WBG’s target of 2030. The Plan includes an explicit 
poverty eradication goal: “All rural residents falling below China’s current poverty line will be able to lift 
themselves out of poverty” and underlines the importance of focusing poverty efforts: “We will identify 
and register those living in poverty throughout the country …(and) will strengthen dynamic statistical 
monitoring of these populations….”. Poverty eradication in China refers not only to help people earn more 
than a minimum income threshold, but also have access to basic goods and services. Consequently, the 
plan includes a list of anti-poverty programs in eight fields: locally viable industries, labor services, finance, 
relocation from inhospitable areas, transportation, ecological conservation, education, health care and 
social security. 
 
The Chinese government has established a comprehensive poverty reduction strategy to achieve the goals 
of the 13th 5YP. Central to this strategy are two institutional innovations which have the potential to 
provide important global lessons to other countries. The first is accurately targeting poverty households, 
villages and counties with the establishment of the National Poverty Registration System (NPRS).  The 
NPRS, established in 2013, is a census of all poor people and villages in China which timely tracks a wide 
range of detailed data about the characteristics of the poor and their main causes of poverty. The first is 
accurately targeting poverty households and villages through the establishment of the National Poverty 
Registration System in 2013.  The NPRS is a census of poor villages and people in China (about 70 million 
at its inception), which timely tracks characteristics of the poor and their main causes of poverty. The 
database is closely integrated into the reporting, prioritization, and accountability lines running upward 
from the village, county, region, and national levels. It provides critical information from the annual 
assessments of which households or villages have exited poverty, are at risk of falling back into poverty, 
or face challenges exiting from poverty. It thus plays a key role in both the identification of the remaining 
poor and the monitoring of programs to eradicate poverty.  
 
Secondly, since 2016, China has introduced the concept of decentralization of poverty reduction efforts 
with the aim to empower county governments to achieve their poverty targets. It consolidates large 
number of earmarked poverty reduction funds into a program-based budgeting system tailored to local 
context. and hold local governments accountable for achieving their poverty reduction targets. It works 
through consolidation of dozens of rural and agricultural earmarked funds which county governments are 
now authorized to use to develop a poverty reduction program tailored to local context.  The designated 
poverty counties have now been put fully in the driver’s seat for achieving poverty reduction goals. 



 

Nevertheless, the program development and implementation remains to be a great challenge for the 
county governments, as little technical guidance and support is provided to them from higher authorities.   
 
The proposed Program for Results operation (PforR) enhances these institutional advancements through 
connecting planned activities more closely to poor households and villages in the NPRS database, and 
aligns fiscal inputs with results by introducing improved planning, budgeting and monitoring systems for 
poverty programs in Guangxi. It also aims to help to improve the monitoring of poverty reduction 
programs in one of the most impoverished regions of the country. The lessons from adopting these 
innovations in Guangxi can serve as learning experience to similar complex settings in the rest of the world 
and will help the WBG in supporting other countries eradicate extreme poverty by 2030. 

 
Sectoral and Institutional Context  

Guangxi poverty reduction program is a continuing success, which is supported by strong government 
leadership, substantial and increasing funding, and broad assistance from society. In the areas of more 
intense poverty, it has brought about 18 percent annual reduction in rural poverty from 4.68 million poor 
in 2013 to 2.61 million poor in 2016.  However, Guangxi is still one of the 10 provinces in China with rural 
poverty rates above the 7 percent and, given its population size, is one of the six provinces with more than 
3 million rural poor (as of 2016), partly due to low soil fertility in the karst mountain areas and low levels 
of infrastructure and connectivity to other regions in China.   Moreover, as of 2013, the poor in Guangxi 
represented approximately 0.8 percent of the global poor. In this regard, helping the region to achieve its 
poverty eradication goal, would have a noticeable contribution to global poverty eradication. 
 
The Guangxi 5YP aims at achieving poverty eradication not only through households having a regular 
source of income above the minimum poverty threshold, but also in terms of access to housing, basic 
health care, compulsory education, appropriate roads to villages, safe drinking water, access to electricity 
and access to telecommunications. This is akin to a multi-dimensional definition of poverty, and is defined 
in Guangxi as the 8+1 “haves”. Despite of rapid poverty reduction in recent years, projections indicate 
that, to achieve poverty eradication, poverty reduction rates for the period 2016-2020 will have to be 
faster than the ones experienced in 2013-2016. Analysis of data indicates that poverty reduction is closely 
linked to rural net incomes, and that agricultural activity is the main driver of growing rural incomes. 
Moreover, data from the NPRS shows that when asked about the main cause poverty, lack of income was 
the cause mentioned more often by interviewees. Nevertheless, in some counties, other gaps such as lack 
of access to roads or safe drinking water can be the significant cause of poverty. 
 
Mountainous areas of Guangxi are exposed to extreme events, such as heavy rains and floods and to a 
lesser extent longer dry spells on a seasonal basis, as well as climate variability. In addition, Guangxi is also 
classified with high river flood risks and with medium water scarcity risk, especially in karst mountain areas 
where majority of the rural poor are located.  Areas with medium water scarcity could potentially 
transition to more adverse condition with climate-induced drought, affecting crops and/or resulting in 
agriculture competing with drinking water requirements. Mountainous conditions combined with average 
annual rainfall of 1,500-2,000 mm could result in floods and landslides, which could cause damages to 
rural roads.  Guangxi’s present hazard level may increase in the future due to the effects of potential 
climate change. For example, rainfall intensity (which is already above the national average) is expected 
to increase across a range of climate scenarios (Ying et al, 2014 and Wang et al 2015, respectively).  
Knowledge about, and adoption of, climate resilient and climate smart agronomic practices and 



technologies among Guangxi farmers and farmer cooperatives needs to be strengthened to address these 
climate change vulnerability issues in rural areas.   
 

PforR Program Scope  
Guangxi 13th 5-Year Plan (5YP), sets a target of lifting all rural people out of poverty by 2020. Specifically, 
the 5YP sets its main goals to lift: (i) all 4.52 million registered rural poor people out of poverty (end-2015 
figure); (ii) some 5,000 remaining poor villages out of poverty status; and (iii) 54 poverty counties out of 
poverty status. Guangxi Rural Poverty Reduction Program (GRPRP) is summarized in the document: 
“Guangxi Tackling Poverty Thirteen Five Year Plan”, issued in December 2016. It defines the poverty 
reduction strategy for the region to achieve the poverty eradication objectives of the National 13th 5YP. 
 
Within the GRPRP lies the Guangxi Consolidated Poverty Reduction Program (CPRP). The CPRP represents 
a sub-set of the GRPRP in the following ways: (i) it covers 54 designated national and provincial level 
poverty counties; (ii) over 40 earmarked funds from national, regional, municipality and county sources 
are pooled together to constitute the Consolidated Poverty Reduction Fund (CPRF); (iii) expenditures are 
prioritized by the counties in conformance with the 13th 5YP Poverty Reduction Plan priorities; and (iv) 
program activities are targeted at poverty households and villages identified in the national poverty 
registration system. At the heart of the CPRP’s more integrated and locally-driven approach is an annual 
mechanism of bottom-up budgeting in the designated poor counties for meeting their poverty reduction 
targets, coupled with transparent and accountable financing, monitoring and evaluation support from 
higher levels of government. 
 
The proposed PforR will support a sub-set of the activities, funded under CPRF with some exclusions and 
in a circumscribed geographic area. Moreover, the proposed PforR will also support enhanced 
expenditure monitoring efforts that the region will be able to report on budget allocation and execution 
by its major subprograms.  
 
The timeline of the proposed PforR is 2018 – 2021, which are the remaining years of the 13th 5YP, and 
one additional year for verifying results.  
 
The geographic boundary of the proposed PforR is circumscribed to 28 selected counties out of 54 poverty 
designated counties. The subset of 28 counties have high poverty rates (above 11 percent) or large 
poverty headcounts (above 60,000) and is representative of the rural poor in Guangxi. As of 2016, the 
selected 28 counties account for 12.6 million rural population (some 30 percent of rural population); and 
for 1.8 million rural poor, approximately 52.5 percent of the rural poor in the region. Moreover, the 
selected counties are diverse in several dimensions. Most of them are located in mountain areas -usually 
associated with high poverty rates- and a few in the river plains at the center of the region. Among the 28 
counties, there are 20 so called “deep poverty” counties, with poverty incidence rate of about 18 percent 
in 2016. There are also 9 autonomous counties (which sit specific ethnic minorities) and the proportion of 
ethnic minorities among the poor is 67.6 percent, slightly higher than in non-selected counties, 63.9 
percent. The age and gender distribution is like in the rest of the poverty-stricken counties in the region 
(i.e., lower share of adult females and higher share of elderly than the region’s average). 
To ensure the sharper focus on achieving the Government 2020 poverty reduction targets, the Result 
Areas (RAs) of the proposed PforR cover a key subset of the Government program activities, which are to 
the extent feasible, aligned with the government’s own targets. The RAs were selected considering that 
they: (i) make a strong contribution to achieving the government’s 2020 poverty alleviation targets; (ii) 

must be linked to specific measurable results; (iii) provide “value added” in terms of interventions that 
are innovative, scalable or expand upon on-going and planned piloted initiatives; and (iv) incentivize 
behavioral changes.  
 
Results Area 1: Improved Income Generation for Rural Poor. The goal is to increase the direct impact of 
the CPRP on the incomes of the targeted poor households through enabling rural poor to engage in 
agriculture-related economic activities and skills development. The proposed PforR would encourage: (i) 
increased allocation of the CPRF funding towards development of farmers cooperatives and poverty 
reduction leading enterprises; (ii) enhance institutional mechanisms associated with these two programs 
for improved poverty targeting and fund-use efficiency through introducing poverty reduction 
accreditation mechanisms for the enterprises and improved operational and governance standards and 
poverty targeting of farmer cooperatives; and (iii) significantly scale selected vocational skill training 
activities, and improving poverty and gender targeting of these programs.  
 
Results Area 2: Improved Infrastructure for Rural Poor. This results area supports the delivery of basic 
rural infrastructure for the designated poor villages in the targeted poverty counties under the CPRP 
funding arrangements. The goal is to ensure that the registered poor households have access to adequate 
rural drinking water supply and rural roads, which are required to meet Guangxi eight plus one "haves", 
multi-dimensional poverty eradication criteria needed to graduate households from poverty. The types of 
measures to be supported under the PforR include drinking water supply and rural roads. In addition, the 
proposed PforR would strengthen Guangxi infrastructure project management capacity with an aim to 
improve the efficiency and effectiveness of CPRF expenditures, and thus their poverty reduction impact 
through developing and adopting an IT-based pipeline project management system.   
 
Results Area 3: Cross-cutting Issues for Enhanced Program Implementation.  This Result Area supports 
the improvement of institutional arrangements and capacity through the introduction of poverty 
reduction program budgeting and enhanced monitoring and evaluation systems, with an aim to enable 
the governments to better align budget allocation with the expected output/outcomes and timely 
monitor the progress, efficiency and effectiveness of program implementation. The key activities are 
clustered around two themes: (i) enhancement of the CPRF program-based budgeting systems; and (ii) 
strengthening of the monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of poverty reduction activities. 

 
C. Proposed Program Development Objective(s)  

 
Program Development Objective(s)  

The proposed PforR development objective is to enhance the impact and efficiency of the Guangxi 
Consolidated Poverty Reduction Program in the targeted counties.   

 
D. Environmental and Social Effects 
 

The Environment and Social Systems Assessment (ESSA) finds that, in general, the existing legal and 
regulatory framework of environmental, health and safety, and social in China, and in Guangxi are 
consistent with the World Bank’s PforR Policy and Directive. During the PforR preparation, initial 
environmental and social screening was conducted based on the whole 13th 5YP in order to provide 
insights for the definition of the PforR boundary. Activities with potential significant adverse 



environmental and social impacts were excluded from the PforR boundary. These include ecological 
resettlement, major infrastructure construction projects (i.e. class 4 and higher roads), extractive 
activities, disaster relief and preparedness, and returning farmlands to forests. In addition, there are some 
activities subject to limitations, such as rural tourism development, which is limited to guest rooms, 
catering and agri-tourism, without involving physical cultural resources. In addition, the PforR excludes 
any activity subject to EIA Report, especially those located in natural forests; in or near physical cultural 
resources at/above county level; or in or near significant natural habitats. 
 
Some activities supported under the PforR may have potential negative impacts or risks. Pest 
management and livestock waste management are considered the main issues from an environment, 
health and safety perspective. Guangxi is promoting livestock farms to be established and run by farmers’ 
cooperatives under the context of poverty reduction. Livestock waste management is handled by 
individual farmers, who often have inadequate capacity of livestock raising. The ESSA thus recommends 
enhancing the technical capacity of staff in county livestock bureau and enhance technical training and 
support to farmers (PAP action). The current pest management system is aligned with the international 
good practices. The key aspects in the pest management system, such as mandatory system for 
production and sales permits for pesticides, pest disease monitoring and forecasting, and trainings for 
farmers, are satisfactorily performed by relevant institutions. 
 
The assessment of social risks of the activities to be supported under the PforR, concluded that there 
would not be significant social conflicts caused by its activities. However, the PforR would have limited 
social risks in terms of land acquisition or voluntary land donations and land transfers, effective 
participation and consultation, and grievance redress mechanism. The ESSA recommends developing a 
community participation and consultation manual, which will be the PAP action. 
 
OP 7.50 on International Waterways is triggered as the Program activities could potentially involve water 
extraction for rural water supply systems and irrigation from the Pearl River Basin, which is regarded as 
an international waterway, as certain tributaries of the basin originate or flow through Vietnam.  
 
Consultations and information disclosure. Between November 2017 and January 2018, meetings were 
held with representatives from Guangxi region, and three counties government institutions to discuss 
policies and procedures on land acquisition and resettlement, land use right transfer, ethnic minority 
development, among others. Formal public consultation meetings were held during April 14-15, 2018, in 
Nanning and in Du’An county. An electronic copy of the draft ESSA report was uploaded on Guangxi 
government official website and hardcopies were made available together with the consultation 
announcement to key stakeholders prior to formal consultations.

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 
 
1. India is one of the fastest growing economies in the world, ranked among the top ten highest GDP countries, and is 

the world’s second most populous country. During the past two decades, India’s GDP grew at an average of 7 

percent annually. Poverty incidence declined on average by 1.5 percentage points per year during 2005–10 and 

improvements in key development indicators have been remarkable. However, following years of impressive 

economic growth and poverty alleviation, India is now at a critical juncture in its paths towards becoming an 

economic powerhouse and is facing important development challenges and structural constraints to a more 

inclusive growth and a more sustainable development. India remains home to 263 million poor people (most of 

which reside in rural areas) living on less than US$1.90/day and the economic growth has not generated jobs fast 

enough to absorb labor out of agriculture and low productivity rural jobs. To address these challenges, the 

Government of India (GoI) through its 12th Five-Year Plan (FY2013-17) put forward an ambitious goal for accelerated 

economic growth, poverty reduction, job creation, and environmental management. The plan foresees during this 

period an annual GDP growth of 8.2 percent, a reduction in poverty rate by 10 percentage points, 50 million new 

jobs – and an annual growth in the agriculture and allied rural sectors of 4 percent. 

 
2. Climate change may impede socioeconomic development within India and increasing investment in adaptation 

measures to reduce vulnerability will be essential to maintaining economic growth. India’s rapid growth has 

increased its prominence on the global stage and drawn attention to its climate mitigation and adaptation efforts. 

The country has shown leadership in global efforts to limit climate change and is among the early countries to have 

ratified the Paris Agreement on Climate Change (in October 2016). Analyses of the country’s historic climate data 

support the extent of the change taking place: an increase in mean annual temperature (0.56°C between 1901 and 

2007), as well as a decrease in seasonal mean rainfall with more frequent extreme rainfall events. Looking ahead, 

temperatures are projected to increase further and at a faster rate than before (by 1.7-2.0
o
C by the 2030s), coupled 

with an overall increase in monsoon rainfall (with an increase in geographic variability) and extreme precipitation 

events (with an increase in rainfall intensity). India shows an increasing trend in its per capita emission of GHGs, 

though current per capita levels are still among the lowest in the world (2.44 tCO2 equivalent per capita in 2012, 

against global average of 5.5 tCO2 equivalent). In absolute terms, India remains one of the largest GHG emitters, 

with its agriculture sector the second largest contributor (around 18 percent of the country’s total GHG emissions).  

 
3. Agriculture sector growth is essential in achieving India’s development goals: the sector currently accounts for 14 

percent of national GDP and is a source of livelihood for more than half of the population. More than two thirds of 

the country’s poor live in rural areas, and their chance of getting out of poverty directly depends on the 

performance of agriculture and allied rural sectors. The success of ongoing massive rural-urban transformation will 

also depend on improved connectivity of rural areas to cities, enhanced agriculture productivity and value chains for 

agricultural products and off-farm job creation in rural areas, which would temper down current massive migrations 

to urban areas. The agriculture sector also has a major potential for reducing GHG emissions and improving 

environmental management through enhanced soil and water conservation and climate-resilient farm management 

practices.  

 
4. Over the past two decades, the agriculture sector has performed below its potential and has not yet met the 

envisaged growth targets. In the 1990s and 2000s, the annual agriculture growth rate was around 3-3.5 percent, and 


dropped even below 2 percent per annum during 2013-15, due to low productivity, growing water and land scarcity, 

rising labor costs, and declining international commodity prices, exacerbated by the late onset of monsoon rainfall 

and increase rainfall intensity. While overall rainfall is projected to increase, its distribution over time and space is 

likely to become much more erratic, thereby leading to increasingly frequent droughts and floods. Unless significant 

efforts to capitalize on the projected increase in rainfall are made to improve water conservation and soil moisture 

management, water scarcity at farm level will remain a key impediment to achieving higher levels of crop and water 

productivity. 

 
5. Going forward, five inter-related and strategic shifts are required to achieve the 4 percent annual growth target 

set by GoI for agriculture and transform the sector into a modern food system: (i) a shift away from food grain 

production targets towards diversification into high-value horticulture and livestock products; (ii) a shift away from 

pure focus on physical productivity (yields) towards resilience and stability of agriculture to deal with the effects of 

climate change and short-term weather anomalies; (iii) a shift away  from a focus on on-farm production towards 

value addition in the post-harvest segments of the food value chains; (iv) a shift away from a calorie focused 

production structure towards nutrition sensitive agriculture, and (v) a shift away from increasing irrigation water 

supply towards improved water use efficiency. The proposed project is designed to directly contribute to this 

structural transformation process by supporting several of those strategic shifts with a focus on building climate 

resilience in the agriculture sector in the State of Maharashtra.  

 
Sectoral and Institutional Context 
 
6. The State of Maharashtra is one of the economic growth engines of the country:  it is the top-ranked state in terms 

of contribution to the national GDP (14.4 percent, 2014-15) and has witnessed an average economic growth rate of 

over 8 percent per annum over the last decade. With 9.3 percent of country’s population and 9.4 percent of the 

country’s geographic area, Maharashtra is also the second largest state in India. Structurally, Maharashtra is more 

urbanized and industrialized compared to the rest of the country and economic contributions of the industries and 

of the services sectors are much larger than that of agriculture and allied sectors (which account for only 11 

percent). However, the agriculture sector remains central to Maharashtra’s economic and political landscape, and 

growth in the sector is critical for the state as over 50 percent of its population depends on agriculture.  

 
7. In Maharashtra, agriculture has grown at an annual average of 6.4 percent from 2004-05 to 2011-12, but growth in 

the sector fluctuates heavily and is depending on highly erratic rainfall during any particular year and rainfall 

variability over time. The distribution of rainfall is highly uneven within the state and ranges from over 4,000 mm per 

annum in coastal areas to less than 400 mm in some of the most arid districts. Agriculture remains the highest user 

of freshwater, withdrawing more than 80 per cent of the surface and groundwater (“blue water”) available to the 

state. Since the continuation of the State’s strong economic growth performance would have to be supported by 

higher water availability in all three sectors of the economy, there is a need for Maharashtra to better manage its 

water resources and in particular to enhance the efficiency of the water used for agriculture and focus on increasing 

the availability and use by the agriculture sector of “green water” (rainwater stored in the soil as soil moisture). 

Severe consecutive droughts experienced in large parts of Maharashtra over the last two years have considerably 

affected the state’s agricultural performance and social fabric in rural areas, and have prompted the highest-level 

state authorities to declare “drought-proofing” of agriculture a key development priority for Maharashtra. 


8. Maharashtra’s agriculture is dominated by small and marginal farmers with an average farm size of 1.44 ha. Most 

of the agricultural production is rain-fed, with less than 20 percent of the arable land under irrigation. Farmers’ 

annual production covers two seasons: kharif crops planted at the onset of the monsoon rainfall and ravi crops 

planted at the beginning of the winter season. Due to the broad range of agro climatic zones and soil types 

encountered, the state’s agricultural production is fairly diverse. Crop production is dominated by food grains, i.e. 

cereals (mostly rice, sorghum or jowar, maize) and pulses (chickpea or gram, pidgeon pea or tur). For oilseed crops, 

soybean remains by far the most important commodity. Cotton and sugarcane, whose production is relatively 

water-intensive, are the two cash crops most commonly found in Maharashtra’s farming systems (the State is 

among the largest producers of cotton and sugarcane in the country).  

 
9. The area under cultivation for cereals has declined since 2000, with a considerable drop in the production of 

sorghum (though naturally better adapted to dryer conditions than other cereals) and a shift from food grains 

towards cash crops has been observed, with an increase in the area for cotton and sugarcane. Since 2000, an 

upsurge in the production of high-value horticulture crops has been observed, and today, the State of Maharashtra 

has emerged as one of the country largest producers of fruits (mango, citrus, grapes, pomegranate) and vegetables 

(onion, tomato). Overall, crop productivity has increased over time but remains at relatively low levels (2013-14, 

non-drought year:  sorghum 814 kg/ha; soybean 1,214 kg/ha; cotton 361 kg/ha). Yield gaps for several key crops are 

still significant, reflecting the need for a mix of sector policies and investments to promote research on climate-

adapted varieties, irrigation for a more efficient on-farm use of water, and extension services for the adoption of 

climate-resilient agronomic practices and technologies – i.e. for building climate resilience in Maharashtra’s farming 

systems.   

 
10. In 2008, GoI released the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC), and directed the States to develop 

State Action Plans on Climate Change guided by and consistent with the structure and strategies of the NAPCC. The 

GoM took a pioneering step towards formulating the Maharashtra State Adaptation Action Plan on Climate Change 

(MSAAPCC) by commissioning a comprehensive vulnerability assessment study which included the task of 

generating model-based climate projections specific to the State’s geography. The MSAAPCC seeks to address the 

urgent need to integrate climate change concerns into the State’s overall development strategy, thus assisting in 

building long term climate resilience and enabling adaptation to the likelihood of risks arising from climate change. 

The MSAAPCC climate modelling results for 2030, 2050 and 2070, show that temperature and rainfall are projected 

to increase across the State of Maharashtra, with important regional variations – resulting, on balance, in potentially 

significant adverse impacts on agriculture performance.  

 
11. The annual mean temperature in Maharashtra is projected to increase by around 1.3-1.5

o
C by the 2030s; the 

projected increase in monsoon rainfall by the 2030s ranges from 13-30% across the state. These analytical findings 

from the MSAAPCC are consistent with the findings of the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel 

on Climate Change (IPCC). The effects of these longer term climate trends on sectors like agriculture or water, 

effectively signaling a shift in climatic conditions, will be further aggravated by the projected increase in the 

frequency of extreme climate events (droughts, hailstorms, floods, delays in the onset of monsoons, higher rainfall 

intensity) already experienced in Maharashtra over recent past, as illustrated by the 3 severe droughts that hit the 

state over the past 5 years.  

 


12. The GoI has designed a number of policy initiatives and programs aligned with the recommendations from the 

NAPCC program and the state-level action plans, including the National Initiative on Climate Resilient Agriculture 

(NICRA) to promote the development of climate-resilient villages; the Pardhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana 

(PMKSY) Program to promote efficient irrigation practices and improve water use efficiency; the Jalyukt Shivar 

Abhiyan (JSA) Program on watershed and drought management; the Integrated Watershed Management Program 

(IWMP) on natural resources conservation; as well as India’s Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) as 

presented to the COP21 in Paris to address the adverse effects of climate change. Against this background, the GoM 

is committed to further support and implement those policies in Maharashtra and sees the proposed project as an 

opportunity to contribute to the implementation of policies in support of the climate agenda. 

 
13. Higher level authorities in the state of Maharashtra have recently embraced a new paradigm for the agricultural 

sector which now needs to be mainstreamed across institutions and stakeholders. It is built around the recognition 

and understanding of climate change and climate variability as the “new normal”; this in turn, requires a structural 

shift in the approach to sustainable agriculture growth based on longer-term adaptive interventions (reforms, 

investments, capacity development) to build climate-resilience in agriculture – in addition to focusing primarily on 

shorter-term emergency responses to recurring natural disasters. The Bank is very well placed to provide value-

added to the GoM in establishing this new paradigm through its experience with climate-resilient agriculture 

elsewhere, its capacity to work multi-sectorally, and to apply cutting-edge knowledge at scale in support of changes 

in policies and strategies to promote climate adaptation and mitigation, and generate climate co-benefits.  

 
Relationship to CPF 
 
14. The proposed project is fully consistent with the India Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY2013–17 to 

support poverty reduction and shared prosperity in India. In line with the pillar for Transformation, the project 

promotes inclusive rural growth, development and dissemination of new agricultural technologies, climate-resilient 

agriculture, enhanced market linkages for small and marginal farmers, and improved water and natural resource 

management (Outcome 2.4). Further, the proposed project will have a positive impact in terms of: (i) environmental 

protection by enhancing the management of soil and water resources, (ii) reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 

disseminating high efficiency irrigation systems, and (iii) promoting diversification into high value crops (Outcomes 

2.5 and 2.6). The project will also contribute to the Inclusion pillar of the CPS by enhancing the livelihoods of small 

and marginal farmers through crop diversification, enhanced market access (Outcome 3.6), and by improving local 

communities’ ability to manage droughts and floods through enhanced design and restoration of irrigation 

infrastructure with better flood protection features (Outcome 3.8).  

 
15. The project is fully aligned with the Bank’s Climate Change Action Plan (CCAP) which explicitly highlights climate-

resilient agriculture and water management as key priorities for climate adaptation in the South Asia Region (SAR). 

CCAP also advocates that transformative action on climate change requires partnerships with client countries to 

mobilize additional capital for mitigation and adaptation action, which the project proposes to achieve with 

potential co-financing from the GoM as well as from the Green Climate Fund (GCF) through IFC’s 2030 Water 

Resources Program. The project will directly contribute to WBG’s commitment to increase the climate-related share 

of its portfolio from 21 to 28 percent by 2020 in response to client demand.  

  

16. The project is based on a multi sector approach and will require close collaboration across the Bank’s Global 

Practices and Units (Agriculture, Water, Trade & Competitiveness, Climate Change, and Disaster Risk Management) 

in the design and throughout implementation. Close collaboration during planning and implementation will be 

sought with thematically related on-going/pipeline projects and initiatives (e.g. Maharashtra Agricultural 

Competitiveness Project - MACP, P120836; India Climate Change Mitigation Action Support, P162119; National 

Groundwater Management Improvement Program, P158119). Collaboration with IFC is secured through the 

inclusion on the project team of technical staff from IFC’s 2030 Water Resources Group (2030WRG) and efforts to 

develop co-financing arrangements with possible funding from the Green Climate Fund (GCF).  

 
C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  

 
17. The PDO is to enhance climate-resilience and profitability of smallholder farming systems in selected districts of 

Maharashtra. 

 
18. Direct project beneficiaries will be small farmers (households with 1.0 to 2.0 ha of farm land) and marginal farmers 

(less than 1.0 ha), who will gain from knowledge and technology transfer, and access to assets to enhance climate 

resilience on their farms, as well as increased revenue from crop diversification and participation in emerging value 

chains. Farmer producer companies (FPCs) and small and medium agro-entrepreneurs (SMEs) will also benefit from 

the project through climate-resilient investments in value chain development, support with the promotion of 

backward and forward linkages, and access to business development and incubation services. The project will also 

directly benefit local institutions and agencies (e.g. agricultural research and extension, technical advisory services) 

through capacity development on climate resilience. State Agriculture Universities (SAU), various line departments, 

government agencies and other institutions at district and sub district level will also benefit through a strategic 

partnership with the project towards mainstreaming climate resilience in agriculture.

D. Concept Description 

 
20. Project area. The proposed project will be implemented in the 15 districts of the Mrathwada and Vidarbha regions 

that have been most affected by the recurrent monsoon failures of recent years. These districts account for a total 

population of 30.2 million people and a project area of around 3.5 million ha. Out of a total of 18,000 villages in the 

districts selected, the project will cover 5,000 villages characterized by a high climate-vulnerability index and low 

HDI; this includes about 1,000 villages located in the Purna river basin tract and showing very high levels of soil 

salinity and sodicity. Managed spill-over effects are expected for a range project activities and outputs to villages not 

covered by the project. Most of the project area is located in Maharashtra’s semi-arid agro climatic zones. The vast 

majority of rural households in the project districts are small and marginal farmers whose livelihood depends for 

more than 90 percent on rainfed agriculture.  

 
21. Cropping patterns in the selected districts are dominated by cereals (mostly sorghum and millet), pulses and 

oilseeds (soybean). While cotton remains the main cash crop, more and more farmers are growing fruit trees to 

secure their farm income. Unlike in some other parts of Maharashtra where groundwater shortage has become an 

acute problem, in the project area only 55 percent of the total groundwater potential has been harnessed. However, 

poor management of surface water and lack of in situ storage in the project area have aggravated the impact on 

agriculture from the severe consecutive droughts that have hit Maharashtra in the past couple of years. 

 
22. Project rationale and alternatives considered. The proposed project results from a clear understanding at the 

highest level of authority in the state that Maharashtra needs a comprehensive, long-term and systematic approach 

to managing and coping with climate change and variability. In the past, emergency responses to increasingly 

frequent climate events have yielded only limited results: such short-term approach did not significantly boost 

agriculture sector performance, prevent further deterioration of the socio-economic fabric in rural areas (exodus, 

farmer suicides), or lead to an increase in farmer income and prosperity. Thus, given the climate projections that 

indicate severe impact on the agriculture and water sectors in Maharashtra under status quo, the new paradigm to 

addressing climate adaptation and mitigation in the agriculture and food system is essential.  

 
23. In addition to the short-term disaster management approach, a policy-based project approach was considered to 

address the impact of climate change on agriculture. Such approach would aim at reforming policies, including those 

that encourage the rapid expansion of water-intensive crops resulting in the depletion of groundwater resources. 

This approach was not pursued, since the selected project area presents distinct agro-hydrological features (e.g. no 

rice is grown in the project area and the sugarcane grown in the selected districts represents less than 3 percent of 

the state-level production). Importantly, the key policies impacting the selected project area relate to markets, and 

on these, Maharashtra has been among the most progressive states in terms of implementing policy reform. The 

remaining policies are beyond the State mandate, controlled by the central government, and these mostly relate to 

the distorting minimum support prices for selected commodities, which by and large are not growth in the project.  

 
24. Finally, a watershed-based approach was considered for the project, with a stronger focus on natural resources 

management. This approach was eventually discarded since it would not sufficiently focus on farm-level adaptation 

and mitigation issues nor would it provide the support for value chain development, a key part of the 

comprehensive approach needed to provide the market outlets and input supplies required to incentivize farmers to 

adopt resilient crops and agronomic practices. 

 
25. In line with GoM request, the proposed project, as represented in the graph below, is built around a comprehensive, 

multi sector approach that focuses specifically on building resilience in agriculture through the scaling up of tested 

technologies and practices, while generating the following interdependent triple win solutions:  

a. enhanced water security at farm level - through the adoption of technologies for a more efficient use of 

water for agriculture, and the increase in water storage capacity (surface and sub-surface) and 

improvement in water distribution structures to address on-farm water availability and reduce the risks 

associated with intra- and inter seasonal climate variability;  

b. improved soil health - through the adoption of good agricultural practices to improve soil fertility, soil 

nutrient management, and promote soil carbon sequestration; and  

c. increased farm productivity and crop diversification - through the adoption of climate-resilient seed 

varieties (short maturity, drought and heat resistant, salt tolerant) and market-oriented crops with a 

clear potential for income security derived from the integration of farmers in corresponding value-

chains.  

 

Strategic Overview, Thematic Linkages and expected Achievements of the PoCRA  

 

 
26. Sustainable pathways to resilience. Enhancing climate-resilience in agriculture involves the integration of 

adaptation, mitigation, and other practices in agriculture that increase the capacity of the farmer and his/her 

production system to respond to various climate-related disturbances by resisting or tolerating the damage and 

recovering quickly. To ensure the sustainability of the comprehensive on-farm and off-farm interventions required 

to build resilience in agriculture, there is a need to strengthen institutions, in particular at the local level, and 

improve their capacity to plan for adaptation to evolving climatic conditions and induce a change in local practices.  

 
27. In addition, the successful adoption of climate-resilient farming practices will largely depend on the farmer’s 

perception of income gains from the new technologies, as profitability remains the most important incentive for 

change at farm level. To that effect, crop diversification, access to knowledge and farm assets needs to be 


accompanied by more market opportunities, which can be achieved through improved participation of organized 

smallholders in the corresponding value chains and the mobilization of private sector (e.g. agri business SMEs).  

 
28. Finally, generating cutting-edge knowledge on climate change and its impact on key sectors such as agriculture and 

water is key to providing strong analytical underpinnings for policies on climate adaptation and mitigation – which 

still need better implementation in Maharashtra (and the rest of the country), despite the state being a frontrunner 

in India on the reform agenda for climate change.      

 
29. Leveraging financial resources. Implementing climate-resilient practices at a scale to cover the targeted 5,000 

villages in a saturation mode with watershed treatment and on-farm technologies requires an estimated total costs 

of well over US$2 billion. The tentative budget for the proposed project is US$600 million, with US$480 million from 

IBRD and US$120 million from GoI/GoM. This represents an average budget envelope of US$20,000 per village and 

year. A contribution from project beneficiaries towards technologies adopted and assets acquired from the project 

will be subsequently factored in, on the basis of the cost-sharing norms applied in other GoM programs and 

projects. Therefore, a major task during project preparation will consist in strategically prioritizing interventions 

planned in each cluster of around 10 villages, selecting results-based investments to be financed, and phasing in 

activities to be implemented in a given cluster.  

 
30. Against this background, the GoM is seeking to leverage its own resources and the IBRD funding with 

complementary funding from the Green Climate Fund (GCF). IFC’s 2030 Water Resources Group is currently 

supporting the GoM’s efforts to access GCF grant funding in the range of US$250 million to scale up climate 

adaptation in Maharashtra rain-fed agriculture. During project preparation, Bank and 2030WRG staff will work as 

one project team and explore with counterparts possible co-financing arrangements between the IBRD funding and 

the GCF grant.  

  
31. Project overview. The proposed project seeks to introduce transformational changes in the agriculture sector by 

scaling-up proven technologies and good agricultural practices that contribute to building climate resilience and 

enhancing farm income. The project will promote the transfer of technologies for climate adaptation and mitigation 

at farm level and will support targeted interventions and limited physical investments in the catchment area to 

promote the use of surface water over groundwater. To enhance farmer income, the project will support activities 

aimed at linking organized smallholders with agri-food SMEs and accessing new market opportunities enhancing 

their participation in commodity value chains.  

  
32. Finally, for the sustainability of the comprehensive approach proposed to build resilience in agriculture, the project 

will enhance the capacity of institutions and agencies at various levels to mainstream resilience (in particular in 
agricultural services for smallholders), develop strategic partnerships with national and international entities, and 
help generate evidence-based knowledge to advance the policy agenda on climate change and vulnerability.  To 
achieve the PDO and KPI targets, the project is designed around the four components described below.    

 
Component A: Promoting Climate-resilient Agricultural Systems (US$ XXX million) 
  

33. The objective of this component is to build climate-resilience in agricultural production systems through a series of 
activities at farm level, complemented by interventions in catchment areas. Mini watershed plans will be developed 
early to provide a road map for investment priorities and the implementation of related activities. This component 



will focus on: (i) scaling-up the adoption by farmers of climate-resilient agricultural practices aimed at improving soil 
health and water-use efficiency; and (ii) catchment area treatment to promote the use of “green water” for 
agriculture over “blue water”, and improve the availability of water at farm level. This component contributes 
directly to the PDO by promoting the transfer of climate resilient technologies at farm level (KPI #1), supporting the 
development of micro-irrigation systems (KPI #2) and encouraging farmers to adopt practices that enhance soil 
health (KPI #3). 

  
34. Participatory development of mini watershed plans. In line with the Maharashtra Groundwater Development and 

Management Act (2009, effective from 2013) which promotes the watershed as participatory planning unit, this 
component will finance the development of some 500 mini watershed plans, each covering a cluster of 8 to 12 
villages and an area of around 5,000 ha. Mini watershed plans are comprehensive multi-year activity and local 
investment tools for planning and monitoring. They include a comprehensive resource mapping, a rapid appraisal of 
stakeholders taking into account gender specificities, and participatory water budgeting to inform on possible 
investments in irrigation and drainage, and water resources management. Those plans will serve as a road map for 
the implementation of subsequent activities and investments under the proposed project. 

  
35. Technology transfer and climate-resilient agriculture practices for a sustainable soil and water management.  To 

enhance increase water productivity and achieve water security at farm level, the component will scale-up the 
adoption of technologies and practices aimed at maximizing the use of surface water for agriculture, at managing 
groundwater resources in a sustainable manner, and at getting “more crop per drop”. To that effect, the component 
will finance the adoption of in-situ soil moisture conservation practices, and the expansion of micro irrigation 
systems (primarily drip and sprinkler irrigation), including water supply structures and drainage facilities. The 
component will also help improve on-farm water availability through selected investments at catchment level (as 
prioritized in the mini watershed plan) to increase surface and sub-surface water storage capacity. To that effect and 
in close coordination with the Chief Minister’s Program on watershed and drought management (Jalyukt Shivar 
Abhiyan), the project will finance drainage line treatment, the improvement of water courses, the construction of 
new and desilting of existing water harvesting structures (e.g. farm and community ponds), and the construction of 
groundwater recharge structures. Agronomic practices promoted under this component in support of improved soil 
moisture management will include, among other, contour bunding, broad-bed furrow and conservation furrow 
cultivation. The component will also support efforts towards a more rigorous monitoring of the quality of the water 
available for agriculture. 

 
36. To improve on-farm soil fertility and micronutrient management, the component will scale-up the adoption of 

climate-resilient agricultural practices aimed at: (i) increasing the soil organic matter content, and (ii) sustaining a 
viable agriculture on the naturally saline and sodic farm soils prevailing in parts of the project area. Conventional 
methods to address soil salinity and soil sodicity (i.e. land reclamation with widespread application of gypsum or 
lime) will be reviewed for their economic sustainability and financial viability in the local context, and used only 
where significant and long term net benefits can be expected. Good agricultural practices aimed at improving soil 
health have been successfully tested in other programs in Maharashtra and beyond (e.g. NICRA) and include 
biomass mulching, residue recycling, manure management, conservation tillage, in-situ moisture conservation and 
others.  

  
Component B: Climate-resilient Post-harvest Management and Value Chain Promotion (US$ XXX million) 
 

37. The objective of this component is to enhance climate resilience beyond farm gate and provide end-to-end solutions 
in selected commodity value chains. To ensure successful crop diversification, the component will help: (i) develop 

smallholder-inclusive value chains for climate-resilient commodities, and (ii) overcome constraints in the seed supply 
chain. In line with GoM priorities, this component will focus on Farmer Producer Companies (FPCs) as major drivers 
of change in the agri-food system. An increase in farm income remains the key driver of change and a pre-
requirement for the adoption of the climate-resilient technologies and good agricultural practices promoted under 
Component A. Thus, this component will directly contribute to the PDO by creating opportunities for increasing the 
revenue of small and marginal farmers (KP #4) through crop diversification and their participation in selected value 
chains.  

   
38. Promoting Farmer Producer Companies. This component will build on the outcomes of other GoM programs and 

projects that have focused on FPCs as agent of change (e.g. MACP). A rapid appraisal exercise, with mapping, 
profiling and capacity needs assessment of the 420 FPCs in the project area (most of them in early development 
stage), will provide the basis for a series of activities tailored to the growth potential of existing FPCs. The 
component will also support the development of farmer-group based organizations into entrepreneurial, market-
oriented, financially sustainable companies with the capacity to perform selected value-adding activities and deliver 
a range of services (e.g climate-related technical advisory services, training on climate adaptation and mitigation 
practices in post-harvest management). The component will support viable mechanisms to further consolidate and 
set up new business linkages for FPCs with private sector (e.g. exporters, seed companies, farm machinery, agro-
input suppliers, and financial institutions). For the professionalization of FPCs, the project will explore a 
collaboration with IFC’s Agribusiness Leadership Program and/or Business Edge Program. Eligible FPCs will also 
benefit from participating in the incubation program of the proposed Climate Innovation Center (see Component C). 

  
39. Strengthening emerging value-chains for climate-resilient commodities. The selection of agricultural value chains for 

end-to-end solutions (from agricultural research to consumer markets) will be finalized by the PMU during project 
preparation. Pulses and oilseeds are emerging as potential priority commodities for end-to-end solutions. In 
addition, the component will support value-chains emerging in the project area following farmers’ production 
diversification to include higher-value commodities, in particular fruit trees (more climate-resilient than annual 
crops given their deeper root system). The component will also support viable investments in product aggregation, 
handling, transformation and marketing (e.g. collection centers, grading and packaging units, cold storage facilities, 
ICT-based market information systems). Priority will be given to investments that promote the use of green 
technologies (including solar energy). Value-chain financing and specifically access to finance and financial services 
for value chain actors will be explored under this component 

  
40. Improving the performance of the supply chain for climate-resilient seeds. The adequate supply of seeds with short 

duration, drought-, salinity- or heat-tolerant features, is a key priority for the GoM’s in its strategy to build climate 
resilience in the agriculture sector. The seed industry in MH is largely segmented, with private seed companies 
mainly focusing on the high value, low volume seeds (e.g. cotton, sugar cane, GM and hybrid varieties), while public 
sector seed corporations dominate the market for low value, high volume seeds (e.g. cereals, pulses and oilseeds). 
The component will address the need for increasing the availability of seeds, given farmers’ evolving demand 
resulting from the recommendations of the district-level contingency plans triggered by climate events (e.g. delays 
in onset of monsoon rains call for different crop mix). To address the shortage of breeder seeds, the component will 
assess the SAU’s breeder seeds programs and support solutions aimed at enhancing their performance (including 
developing linkages with FPCs for seed multiplication). This component will also seek to support key actors in the 
seed supply chain such as the Maharashtra State Seed Corporation who plays a unique role in the production and 
distribution of climate-resilient certified seeds for small and marginal farmers (e.g. pulses and oilseeds). It will also 
finance the development of a limited number of seed processing and storing hubs in strategic locations of the 
project area. 

 
Component C: Institutional Development, Knowledge and Policies for a Climate-resilient Agriculture (US$ XXX million) 
 

41. The objective of this component is to ensure sustainability in the approach proposed for building climate resilience 
through a longer term adaptive management of agriculture, soil and water resources, by: (i) strengthening the 
capacity of existing institutions to design and deliver agro-technical and climate advisory services, (ii) establishing a 
Climate Innovation Center, and (iii) promoting an evidence-based policy dialogue on climate resilience. Successful 
implementation of the activities in this component will contribute to achieving the PDO by increasing the outreach 
of institutions and agencies promoting climate-resilient agriculture in the project area (KPI #5) and generating 
spillover effects to farming communities from other villages in the project area not covered by project activities.   

 
42. Sustainability and institutional capacity development. To ensure the sustainability of the comprehensive approach 

on climate-resilient agriculture proposed in this project, this component will support the development and 
implementation of a capacity development program for district and local level stakeholders. This component will 
mainstream climate-resilience in the strategic objectives of institutions and agencies involved in the delivery of 
services to small and marginal farmers. At district level, the project will work closely with the Superintendent District 
Agricultural Offices (SDAOs) and build their capacity to coordinate and monitor the implementation of the climate-
resilience agenda on the ground. At state level, the project will develop partnerships with the SAUs and support 
existing programs for the development and field-testing of emerging agricultural technologies and practices for 
climate-adaption of dryland farming systems. The component will also promote knowledge and learning exchanges 
on climate-resilience with national/international entities such as ICRISAT, CRIDA, the Indian Institute of Science, the 
Indian Meteorological Department, the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR), the 
Australian Water Partnership (AWP), and the Carbon Management and Sequestration Center (CMASC, Ohio State 
University).  

 
43. Maharashtra Climate Innovation Center (CIC). This component will finance the planning, launch and start-up phase 

for a CIC until it operates in a self-sustained manner. The CIC will support local private sector capacity – with focus 
on entrepreneurs and SMEs – to commercialize and deploy emerging technologies and business models in growing 
climate sectors (e.g. climate-resilient agriculture, water, energy) to provide local solutions to climate change. The CIC 
will offer services tailored to local needs and conditions among a suite of tools which includes: access to latest 
technology information and market intelligence, fee-based business advisory and other incubation/coaching support 
services, and tailored proof-of-concept grant and seed investment financing to prove and scale early-stage firms and 
concepts. The CIC will draw on local and international expertise to support the GoM with the review and formulation 
of policies and strategies relevant to climate change and climate resilient, in particular as linked to the agri-food 
sectors. During project preparation, the PMU will commission a feasibility study for the CIC; it will be followed up 
during early project implementation with the development of a detailed CIC business and financial plan to be 
submitted for approval to the relevant authorities.  The CIC will be established with technical guidance from the 
Bank’s Climate Technology Program. 

  
44. Knowledge and policies. This component will finance a range of analytical studies aimed at updating and 

disseminating existing knowledge on a range of issues related to climate resilience and agriculture. Such studies will 
provide the analytical underpinnings to improve the policy and strategy framework required to further enhance 
resilience in the agri-food system in Maharashtra (and beyond). This component will support efforts towards a multi 
stakeholder dialogue on policies promoting climate resilience in agriculture, as well as direct payments to farmers 
for environmental services (e.g. soil carbon sequestration, groundwater conservation). This component will also  
look at reliable ways to quantify potential mitigation benefits from activities promoted by the project and aim at 



providing a pathway to carbon financing. The component will also finance the development of a state-of-the art 
climate and agro-hydrological model that supports policy-makers Maharashtra by: (i) making projections on the level 
of sustainable withdrawal of surface and groundwater in a given watershed under various climate and land use 
scenarios, (ii) generating suitability maps for Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR), and (iii) assessing the magnitude of 
MAR in the project area.  

  
Component D: Project Management (US$ XXX million) 
 

45. This component will primarily finance the project’s incremental operating costs.  A PMU has been set up by the 
Department of Agriculture (GoM) and tasked with the overall management of the project, while ensuring smooth 
coordination of activity implementation by various agencies and strategic partners. Given the transformative nature 
of the project, institutional coordination within and across the relevant sectors is emerging as a critical task in 
developing an effective project implementation mechanism. The PMU will be responsible for compiling an annual 
Activity Plan and Work Program and develop the corresponding budget proposal to be submitted for approval to the 
Project Steering Committee.  

 
46. The PMU will ensure that all project activities are implemented in line with the provisions in the official project 

documents; in particular, the PMU will be in charge of financial management, project procurement, and safeguards 
compliance. The component will support all activities related to project communication, public awareness and 
outreach, including the development of a comprehensive project web site. It will finance the services of specialized 
consultant firms to develop and implement a comprehensive project impact evaluation (including all surveys). 
Further, the project will promote the intensive use of ICT across components; to that effect, this component will 
finance both ICT goods and specialized consultant services. The project’s M&E system will be ICT-based, enabling the 
PIU to access project information and data from the field in real-time. ICT will also be used to facilitate the feedback 
from project beneficiaries on project activities planned/under implementation (citizen engagement), and will be 
mainstreamed in the project’s grievance and redress mechanism. 
 

 
    

  SAFEGUARDS 

 
A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 

 
Maharashtra is one of India’s most prosperous states, with a population of 114 million. Yet, it has some of India’s poorest 

people, four of its 36 districts are among India’s 106 most backward. Agriculture and industry form the mainstay of the 
state's economy. Most of the cultivable land is still rain-fed, relying heavily on the southwest monsoon rains. Districts in 
eastern Maharashtra on the Deccan plateau are particularly prone to drought. The net irrigated area is only 30.77 million 
Ha or about 16% of cultivable land. In Maharashtra, main crops include rice (although not grown in the project area), 
jowar, bajra, pulses, vegetables and onions. The main cash crops include cotton, sugarcane (though the project area 
accounts for only 3 percent of the state sugar cane production), turmeric, and several oilseeds. Amravati and Yavatmal, 
respectively in Vidharba region are the largest orange and cotton growing districts. 
The Project will be implemented in two main regions:  Vidharbha  and Marathwada comprising some 5,000 villages - 

selected for their high climate vulnerability index and low HDI; in addition, about 1,000 of these villages are characterized 
by high levels of soil salinity and sodicity. The project area is characterized by a substantial spatial and temporal rainfall 
variation and scarcity of water resources . These are increasingly exacerbated by frequent droughts associated with 
climate change and high human pressure on natural resources.  


The proposed project is premised on the fact that climate changes are quite inevitable and that it affects all the 
households  much more on the livelihoods of the poor and vulnerable sections. Further, it is well recognized that the 
households/ communities in the rain fed agriculture are quite diverse and heterogeneous with several sub groups 
identifiable based on several factors – resource endowment, gender, ethnicity ( scheduled tribes), castes (scheduled 
castes), religious minorities and geographical setting ( forests, hills, coastal areas). Each of these subgroups gets affected 
differently and has differential capacity for participation. Lastly, to ensure a village/ community spread resilience, group / 
collective action would be essential which demands substantial outreach efforts. Given this scenario, following issues 
emerge as significant: local participation, institutional linkages and communication outreach. 
 

 
B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 

 
GoM has established a PMU, with a full time environmental specialist, to guide and coordinate preparation of 

environmental and social management framework (ESMF) of the project. A consultant firm has also been brought on 
board by GoM to prepare the ESMF together with the project implementation plan (PIP). During project implementation, 
there will also be environment specialists at the District PMUs in Akola and Aurangabad. GoM has experience with 
implementing World Bank funded projects, in similar sectors, such as Maharashtra Agriculture Competitiveness Project 
and Maharashtra Water Sector Improvement Project. For these projects, GoM is already implementing various tools for 
managing environmental and social issues, such as ESMF. Therefore, there is good borrower orientation and sensitivity to 
implement Bank’s safeguards. 
The project, through the safeguards instruments, will also put in place a capacity building program for staff, and project 

beneficiaries to ensure successful implementation of ESMF and IPM plan, and compliance with the Bank’s safeguards 
policies. A full understanding of the capacity-building need is expected once the draft ESMF is prepared.

D. Policies that might apply 

 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

OP 4.01 is triggered because the project involves a 
series of interventions for increasing productivity, 
enhancing resilience, and agriculture value chain 
development.  Investments to be supported under the 
project will not lead to any major irreversible impacts, 
however, if not designed effectively,  may generate 
impacts such as soil degradation, water pollution, 
biodiversity conservation, labor safety issues. (these 
are mostly temporary by nature and site specific).  
 
The project will also have positive impacts on the 
environment and natural resource base of the project 
area such as drought-proofing rain-fed agriculture in 
the semi-arid regions, prevention of soil degradation, 

increase of soil moisture and in biomass and organic 
matter of soil, decrease of run-off and soil losses, 
increased climate resilience and annual water 
availability. All mitigation measures would be carefully 
designed in order to enhance the positive impacts, and 
ensure sustainability of investments. 
 
Overall, the project related impacts are mostly 
positive, hence it has been classified as category B. At 
this very juncture, the scope and location of the 
interventions are not known. Hence, an Environmental 
and Social Management Framework (ESMF) is being 
prepared which outlines the process for future 
subprojects to ensure that they are environmentally 
and socially sound, sustainable, and in line with GoM 
and World Bank operational safeguards policies. 

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 Yes 

Project financed investments are not expected to 
intervene in any critical natural habitats. The project 
areas contain some essential ecosystems with rich 
biodiversity, and a number of wildlife sanctuaries such 
as Jayakwadi Bird Sanctuary, in Marathwada, and 
Bhamragarh, Bor, Charpala, Chikhaladara Wildlife 
Sanctuary. There are also a number of tiger habitats 
such as Tadoba Andhari Tiger Project, Melghat Tiger 
Project, Pench Tiger Reserve located in Vidarbha 
region. 
 
As details of the exact sites of the proposed 
investments are yet to be known, and investments 
involving civil works may be located within the 
proximity of these areas OP 4.04 is triggered. The 
ESMF would include all adequate measures for 
avoidance, mitigation of impacts and preventive 
measures for negative effects on natural habitats.  
 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No 

Project financed activities will not support 
afforestation, reforestation or pasture improvement 
activities. The project will not encroach on forest land 
or change the management of forest resources. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

The policy is triggered because investments targeted 
at increasing agricultural productivity and climate-
resilient agronomic practices may encourage the use 
of pesticides. There is therefore a need to promote the 
use of integrated pest management techniques, 
including the safe use, storage and disposal of agro-
chemicals. The ESMF will aim at providing as much 



information as possible on biological approaches to 
pest management. The project will prepare and 
promote an Integrated Pest Management Plan. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 TBD 

The project is not expected to have an impact on 
physical cultural resources, as it will be implemented 
in areas where agriculture is already practiced. 
However, the project area comprises of Aurangabad 
district, which contains many historical structures and 
UNESCO world heritage sites.  
The project will ascertain through preparation, if there 
is evidence that the project location sites would 
contain features of archeological, historical or cultural 
significance.  Following which, the ESMF would include 
provisions of chance finds to be followed by 
implementing partners, on the proper management of 
physical cultural resources if discovered during project 
implementation.  
 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 Yes 

There are 2.7 million Scheduled Tribe population in 
the 15 project districts which account to about 8% of 
the total population. Further, 27 Tehsils spread across 
11 districts are covered under the Fifth Schedule of 
the Indian Constitution which provides a variety of 
safeguards for the tribals. Given this, the project 
triggers the Bank’s Operational Policy (OP) 4.10 on 
Indigenous Peoples.  However, the next step on 
deploying the instrument- Tribal Peoples Plan (TPP) or 
Tribal Peoples Planning Framework (TPPF)— needs to 
be decided. 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 TBD 

Once the project interventions are firmed up and the 
Social Assessment Study is completed, a decision can 
be made on whether lands are required and the 
methods of scuring thereof. 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 No 

OP 4.37 is not triggered as the project investments will 
not support construction, or rely on performance of an 
existing dam >15m height. The project will not  
support rehabilitation of existing or building any new 
irrigation schemes originating from existing dams in 
the State 
 
The project may include construction of small check 
dams. The potential adverse safety and security 
impacts will be addressed in the ESMF which will 
include adequate measures to ensure that the design, 
construction and the maintenance of the small dams 
will be done by qualified engineers.  

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

No 
OP 7.5 is not triggered as no international waterways 
are involved. 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No NA 

 
E. Safeguard Preparation Plan  
 
Tentative target date for preparing the Appraisal Stage PID/ISDS 
 
May 05, 2017 
 

Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed. The specific studies and 
their timing should be specified in the Appraisal Stage PID/ISDS 
 
Project has initiated efforts towards the conducting a comprehensive Environmental and Social Assessment. This is 

expected to result in: (i) Integrated Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF); (ii) Tribal People Plan/ 
Framework, as appropriate; (iii) Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF), if need be; (iv) IPM/IPNM plans.  A Terms of 
reference (TOR) for the conduction of assessments and preparation of the ESMF  has been prepared by the PMU.  
 
The ESMF will provide essential baseline data, confirm policies that are triggered, assess likely impacts of the project 

interventions. The ESMF will also propose mitigation measures for any adverse impacts that may be envisaged through 
the design and construction phases of various interventions. Recommendations for strengthening institutional capacity, 
and estimate the budget required for the implementation will also be included. While the assessments will be 
participatory with due and extensive consultations with all the stakeholders, especially, the poor and vulnerable farming 
community. Further, the ESMF will also outline arrangements for consultations with the stakeholders and disclosures 
thereof both during preparation as well as implementation phases.   
 
 All safeguards studies shall be completed and the ESMF publicly disclosed by April 15, 2017.
