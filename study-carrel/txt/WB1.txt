B. Introduction and Context 

 

RDP II is the largest rural development investment in the Solomon Islands, and the only one with national coverage. To 
date, the Project has benefitted 66,642 people (11 percent of the population) through 123 completed sub-projects. In 
addition, linkages to markets are being strengthened for more than 7,000 people through 35 agribusiness partnerships 
currently under implementation. Under the disaster risk recovery activities 2,846 beneficiaries affected by the floods of 
April 2014 have received agriculture and livestock recovery assistance – exceeding the expected number of beneficiaries 
for this activity. 

The Project was approved by the World Bank Board on November 21, 2014 and is scheduled to close on February 28, 
2020. The Project was approved for a total of US$46.9 million (including SDR6 million (US$9 million equivalent) in IDA 
financing). However, based on prevailing exchange rates, the amount available for the Project is now US$39.4 million. 
Project financing includes IDA - Financing Agreements IDA-55740 (Credit) and IDA-D0220 (Grant); parallel co-financing 
by IFAD C1360 (COFN); trust fund co-financing grants by the European Union (EU) TF-A5083 and Australian Department 
of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) TF-19256; and SIG counterpart financing. To date, the Project has disbursed 100 
percent of the IDA financing and 80.26 percent of the trust fund financing (received in the trust fund account to date).

Overall Implementation Progress has been rated ‘Moderately Satisfactory’ for the past 12 months. The Project is making 
substantial progress and is on track to implement all planned activities provided timely financing is available.  The 
Project Development Objective (PDO) rating was rated ‘Moderately Unsatisfactory’ between April 2017 and November 
2018 primarily due to concerns about financing shortfalls. The PDO rating was upgraded to Moderately Satisfactory in 
November 2018 to reflect SIG’s reaffirmation of its intention to provide the remaining counterpart funding, which made 
it likely that the project would meet the revised PDO targets indicators in the Results Framework (following a 
restructuring in early 2018). Apart from a financing shortfall, the Project has been performing at satisfactory levels on 
all fronts within a low capacity and logistically challenging fragile and post-conflict environment.  

Financial audits received to date have all been unqualified, and there are no outstanding financial audits for the Project. 
The project is rated ‘Moderately Satisfactory’ for overall safeguards. 

 

Rationale for Additional Financing 

 

The Project was restructured in January 2018 to address a financing gap of approximately US$5.8 million dollars 
(approximately 12% of the original Project amount) caused by the depreciation of the relevant financing currencies 
(AUD, EUR, and SDR).  The restructuring included reductions in the scope and target areas of some Project activities, as 
well as adjustments to the Results Framework.  At the time of the restructure Government counterpart funding was 
still anticipated.  

However, due to fiscal constraints the Solomon Islands Government’s (SIG) annual budget for 2018—approved in April 
2018—did not include the counterpart allocation anticipated for the project.  To date SIG has contributed SBD26.3 
million in counterpart financing (53 percent of the original commitment), leaving a financial shortage of SBD23.7 million 
(approximately US$3 million equivalent). In addition, the scope for utilizing EU co-financing, which only became 
available in May 2018 and closes in August 2019, is limited due to administrative complexities. This has further 
compounded the risks of a financial shortfall for the planned range of activities. These uncertainties and complexities 
have resulted in postponement of some activities meaning resources to make up the financing shortfall are urgently 
required to avoid further delays in undertaking these activities.  Due to these delays an extension of the Project closing 
date is also required to allow enough time to complete all of the activities necessary to achieve the PDO (the extension 
of closing date will be applicable for sources of funding from IDA and EU). 

SIG has indicated its intention to budget and transfer the remaining counterpart financing by early 2019. To date, the 
budget plan for 2019 by SIG (Care-taker Government at the time of decision) has shown an amount of SBD20 million 
(approximately USD2.5 million) allocated to the project.  However, no funds have been transferred to the project. 
National elections held in April 2019 means that a new Government will be formed. As a consequence of the election 
cashflow delays are expected and these could further delay Project implementation and jeopardize achievement of the 
PDO.  

In order to address the financing shortfall and also to deliver some of the activities that had been scaled down through 
the project restructuring of January 2018, SIG made an official request to the Bank for additional financing, as well as 
for an extension of the Project’s closing date by 12 months to February 28, 2021. The request resulted from the partial 
cancellation of IDA financing for the Solomon Islands Pacific Islands Regional Oceanscape Program (PROP, P151777), for

which SIG requested the Bank reallocate the SDR 1.58 million (approximately USD2.23 million at the time of 
cancellation) of national IDA.  

Therefore, the additional financing will allow the Project to finance the remaining round of support under Component 
1 – Community Infrastructure and Services and Component 2 - Agriculture Partnerships and Support; and help to reduce 
the financing gap (if SIG funds fall through or the closing date of the EU grant is not extended). This AF and restructuring 
will also support extension of the project closing date by 12 months to allow enough time to complete project activities. 
There will be no change to the current PDO.  

 
 
C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  

  
The proposed development objective for the additional financing is the same for the parent project which is to improve 
basic infrastructure and services in rural areas and to strengthen the linkages between smallholder farming households 
and markets. 
 
Original PDO  
The project development objective of the parent project is to improve basic infrastructure and services in rural areas and 
to strengthen the linkages between smallholder farming households and markets. 
 
Current PDO  
The current PDO of the parent project is the same as the original PDO which is to improve basic infrastructure and services 
in rural areas and to strengthen the linkages between smallholder farming households and markets. 
 
Key Results 

The Result Framework (RF) has been revised to reflect the new annual and end targets enabled by the AF and proposed 
extension.

D. Project Description  

 

The Project consists of three components: Component 1 – Community Infrastructure and Services; 
Component 2 – Agriculture Partnerships and Support; and Component 3 – Program Management. The 
Project operates in all 172 rural wards of the country and provides subgrants comprising: (a) Community 
Development Grants; (b) Disaster Recovery Grants; (c) Agribusiness Partnership Grants; and (d) 
Agriculture Supplemental Equity Facility (ASEF) Grants.  

The primary focus of the AF is to fill the financing gaps caused by the depreciation of various financing 
sources and delay in counterpart financing, no changes are expected for PDO, PDO indicators, nor will 
there be any new types of activities. The proposed changes include: 

a. Additional IDA financing of SDR 1.58 million (USD2.23 million) (50 percent grant and 50 
percent credit) to fund the project activities, thus updating the total project amount to 
USD41.6 million (noting that this is still less than the original appraised project cost of 
USD46.9 million).   

b. Adjustments to the financing plan to reflect the actual IDA and RETF financing received 
taking into account the exchange rate fluctuations between project appraisal and the 
receipt of these sources of financing. 

c. Adjustments to the project costs to reflect the available financing. 

d. Extension of project’s closing date for 12 months, from February 28, 2020 to February 28, 
2021 (for IDA as well as that of EU co-financing) 

e. Adjustments to the Results Framework to reflect changes in the scope and timing of 
project activities (amendments to the values for annual and end targets).

E. Implementation 

 
Implementation arrangements for the additional financing will follow that of the parent project. Overall program 
coordination and implementation responsibility would still be with the MDPAC, as currently under RDP II. A 
Project Steering Committee (PSC) will continue to provide project oversight, guidance and monitoring, and would 
be comprised of the Permanent Secretaries, or their delegates, from the Ministries of: Finance and Treasury; 
Agriculture and Livestock; Infrastructure Development; Provincial Government and Institutional Strengthening; 
Education and Human Resource Development; Health; Rural Development; Development Planning and Aide 
Coordination and Provincial Secretaries (representing participating provinces). The Permanent Secretary in 
MDPAC (Program Coordinator) will be assisted by a full time national Program Manager and a full time 
international Program Advisor responsible for the daily coordination of program activities, and: (i) for fiduciary 
aspects, finance and procurement specialists, (ii) coordinators and other support staff for component 1 (based in 
MDPAC) and Component 2 (based in MAL) and (iii) for additional cross-component implementation support, an 
M&E/MIS officer, and an environment officer. The Program Manager (reporting to the PS MDPAC) will coordinate 
implementation of program activities managed by the provincial governments and by MAL (as regards component 
2). 
 
Component 1 management and coordination at the provincial level would still be the responsibility of the 
Provincial Secretary assisted by a Provincial Team Leader, Finance Officer and Community Helpers operating at 
the ward and village level. These will all be national positions. Central Province activities will be managed from 
Guadalcanal, and due to the small number of community grants, the Renbel Province Team Leader will also be 
responsible for finance. The provincial government will continue to be responsible for activities in the province, 
through MOUs with MDPAC. Technical support would be engaged from line agency staff at provincial level (e.g. 
Environmental Health; Works; Agriculture; Home Affairs; Education). Management of Component 2 activities will 
be the responsibility of MAL. A Component 2 Manager will be responsible for coordinating all Component 2 
activities and report directly to the Undersecretary, Technical of MAL. In addition to reporting directly to the PS 
MAL, the C2 Manager will work together with the RDP Program Manager and Program Advisor as an overall 
program management team. Two national consultants will be hired to support the partnership and training 
aspects of Component 2, two staff will be hired to provide M&E support, and MAL will assign a Program Assistant 
to support the C2MU team. 

 
 
 .    
F. Project location and Salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 
 
The additional financing does not involve changes to the project location. 

The project will be implemented in the 9 provinces including: Makira, Isabel, Guadalcanal, Central, Choiseul, 
Malaita, Western, Temotu and Rennell and Belona. Choiseul and Temotu are small provinces with a 
population of approximately 20,000 each and Rennell and Belona province has a combined population of 
approximately 3,000; all four island groups are remote from the capital city, Honiara; while Malaita is the 
most populated province (population approximately 120,000) and centrally located, and Western province 
has a population of approximately 60,000.

A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential 
large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
 
The additional financing does not entail changes to project activities and will not trigger additional safeguards policies.

The project’s Environmental and Social Management Framework does not require revision and will continue to be 
used for management of the project’s environmental and social risks. Regarding the safeguards performance to date, 
the Project is compliant with social and environmental safeguards requirements. Land commitment letters are 
secured prior to construction to ensure the sustainability of subprojects. Each subproject has prepared social and 
environmental mitigation measures as part of the Technical Design Form. During the ESMF implementation, there 
have been several cases where enhanced oversight and support were required. The project team has satisfactorily 
addressed those cases with support and guidance from Bank team. Safeguards issues have related to staffing, 
monitoring and training and have therefore been addressed without revision of the ESMF. 
 
Environmental impacts or issues associated with Component I and II subproject investments are not expected to be 
significant. They are expected to be temporary and can be mitigated. Likewise, social risks will continue to be minor, 
with small portions of land needing to be acquired for infrastructure subprojects and Indigenous Peoples to be 
engaged with during subproject preparation and implementation. The Environmental and Social Management 
Framework (ESMF) and Pest Management Plan (PMP) used for RDP II will continue to be applied, and incorporated 
into procedures within the Project Implementation Manual.  
 
The potential impact of any subproject will depend on the nature, location and specific characteristics of the 
investment. In most cases, adverse environmental impacts are expected to be temporary and limited to the 
construction phase. They could include temporary disturbance of drains or streams, noise and dust during 
construction, small-scale vegetation loss, and pollution from inappropriate construction materials waste disposal. 
 
Most adverse impacts will be highly localized (construction work site), temporary, and easily mitigated through 
appropriate siting of the sub-projects and good construction and operation practices. The subproject screening 
process described in the ESMF, and the use of standard construction practices and mitigation measures will ensure 
adequate mitigation of those risks. 
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area: 
As with the parent Project, there are no long-term impacts anticipated due to the small scale and dispersed nature of 
the planned activities. 
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts. 
To minimize adverse impacts, a screening process and standard mitigation practices has been established in RDP II and 
will continue to be used in the additional financing. The screening process will include considerations for alternative 
subprojects and/or alternative siting as appropriate. The procedures to be followed are included in the ESMF. The 
project promotes good agricultural practices, including disaster and climate resilience. 
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower 
capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The project aims to address social and environmental issues through the planning and subproject selection process for 
each Component. Guidelines for environmental assessment, including screening for forests and natural habitats 
issues, of proposed subprojects and activities managed by the communities and the private sector agribusiness 
partners have been developed and they are integrated in the planning, selection, appraisal, monitoring and audit at 
the time of project completion. 
 
With regards to Component 2, OP 4.09 the Pest Management Plan (PMP) which was implemented under RDP I has 
been revised and included in the ESMF.

Indigenous Peoples: OP/BP 4.10 is also triggered for the additional financing. However, since virtually all of the 
beneficiaries of the project are rural Solomon Islanders who are living on their ancestral lands and are indigenous (as 
defined by the policy), the project documentation itself constitutes the Indigenous Peoples Plan (IPP). Relevant 
aspects include: 
 
(a) Free, prior and informed consultations during preparation: As with RDP II, community consultations will be 
conducted in all participating provinces in local languages, with separate discussions with vulnerable groups (such as 
women and youth). 
(b) Free, prior and informed consultations during implementation: Under RDP II, activities under both Components of 
the project are demand-driven and have to follow a rigorous process of identification, appraisal and approval. This will 
be followed under the additional financing; Consultations will be systematically carried out as part of the project 
design, and decision-making structures at the community level include representatives of traditional authorities, 
women, youth and churches. The project will include a comprehensive set of communication activities, with the use of 
various media to increase outreach (local radio talk-talks, village-based facilitators, NGOs, pamphlets explaining 
safeguards policies and project mechanisms, etc.) at all stages. This also includes complaint mechanisms and 
independent monitoring of project activities and processes. 
 
Involuntary Resettlement: Like the parent Project, this policy is also not triggered as the additional financing does not 
finance any activity that requires involuntary resettlement, and any “new” land acquisition is done only on a voluntary 
basis. The “Land Commitment Letter” will continue to be obtained and used as the main mode of land acquisition. 
However, it must be noted that the experience of RDP II with regard to such is that the process of consultation that 
takes place in accomplishing the Land Commitment Letter makes land acquisition successful more than the document 
itself. With the Borrower having learned from past experience with RDP I and II on land acquisition, it is expected that 
very minimal issues will be encountered, if at all. 
 
Physical Cultural Resources: The objective of OP/BP 4.11, Physical Cultural Resources, is to avoid, or mitigate, adverse 
impacts on cultural resources from development projects that the World Bank finances. Cultural property includes 
monuments, structures, works of art, or sites of significance, and are defined as sites and structures having 
archaeological, historical, architectural, or religious significance, and natural sites with cultural values. This includes 
cemeteries, graveyards and graves. The project poses limited risks of damaging cultural property since sub-projects 
are identified by the communities themselves who are most likely aware of their own cultural property in the area of 
operation. The Safeguard Screening, Monitoring and Audit Form, which is included in the PIM, includes questions that 
assist the community in deter mining what to do if cultural property is identified. While there have yet to be any 
“chance find” (when project activities discover unanticipated cultural artifacts) events during the parent project, a 
simple set of procedures have been incorporated into the PIM, and provided in the ESMF Supplement, in case such 
events should occur during the construction of sub-projects during the period of additional financing. 
 
The borrower has demonstrated an effective ability to manage environmental and social safeguards under RDP I and 
II. A qualified safeguard specialist is in the Project Coordination Unit who is responsible for screening and resolving 
safeguard issues both prior to a sub-project being included in the program and during sub-project implementation. 
Through RDP I, the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock has built its capacity to regulate agriculture-related 
environmental safeguards, including the formation and regular convening of a Pesticide Registration Advisory 
Committee (PRAC) to regulate the use of pesticides. Periodic training will be conducted for safeguard and other 
project staff as well as for funding recipients under Components 1 and 2.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, 
with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
Key stakeholders of the additional financing will still be rural Solomon Islanders who are residents of the villages in the 
wards and provinces covered by the project, specifically farming communities, with respect to Component II. In 
addition to individual farmers and their associations and farmer groups, stakeholders include agribusiness dealers, 
national research and extension service providers, national and local institutions. To reiterate, the ESMF for the 
original project remains valid for the AF activities and therefore requires no changes, and will continue to be used. The 
document will not be re-disclosed. The ESMF was last disclosed on 24 August 2014. 
 
Community consultations are an integral part of the selection and appraisal of subproject activities in RDP II and this 
will be carried over in the additional financing. Project beneficiaries will participate through public consultation 
meetings and discussions of local development priorities, representation in ward development committees and 
provincial development councils, and representation in the Subproject Implementation Committees (SICs). No 
subproject will be selected that does not flow from this planning process. This includes the social and environmental 
information, training and the screening process described in detail in the ESMF. Village-based facilitators (Community-
Helpers) are trained on the project's environmental and social guidelines. Since environmental and social criteria will 
be fully integrated throughout the planning, selection and appraisal process, stakeholder participation and 
information disclosure will be assured at every stage of project implementation.
