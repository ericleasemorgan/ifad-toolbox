B.   Introduction and Context

Country Context
Djibouti is extremely water scarce with conditions set to be exacerbated by population growth and 
climate change. As a consequence, access to safe drinking water is a daily challenge for the 
majority of the population, particularly for people living in rural areas. Poverty and food 
insecurity affect more or less the entire country and both are recognized to be highly correlated 
with water access issues. The extreme aspect of the geo-climatic profile leads to low erratic 
annual rainfall that averages hardly 150 mm, to the absence of perennial surface freshwater flow, 
and to the slow renewing of its aquifers. The current situation shows that more than 70 percent of 
the rural population and its herds do not have access to water within a reasonable distance. During 
the three-to four-month dry season, pastoral households are subject to the lack of access to water 
that represents a major constraint to human and livestock mobility, and to the proper use of the 
limited and sparsely distributed agro-pastoral resources.
Sectoral and institutional Context
Climate change impacts are projected to exacerbate these already precarious water resource 
challenges. Climate change is expected to induce an increase of the temperatures by 1.7-2.1 C by 
2050, while precipitation is set to decrease by 4-11 percent . This could lead to an increase of both 
severity of dry spells and intensity of wet extremes, thus accelerating land degradation, floods and 
erosion. Sea level rise is also projected to further exacerbate these impacts through saltwater 
intrusion of coastal aquifers. 
 
The Government of Djibouti (GoD) considers securing access to water and energy as the foremost 
major challenges that are prerequisites to reducing poverty and ensuring a nation-wide sustainable 
socio-economic development. To tackle the country’s structural gap in water resources demand 
and supply, the GoD is in quest of support from key partners for the development of non-
conventional water resources mobilization facilities including desalination plants, sewage water 
treatment plants and transboundary water transfer from Ethiopia.

C.  Proposed Development Objective(s)

Original Project Development Objective(s) - Parent
The objective of the Project is to increase access of rural communities to water and enhance their 
capacity to manage water and agro-pastoral resources in the project areas using a participatory 
approach to community-based development.

Key Results 
� Increase in the number of rural households with access to drinking water within a 
reasonable travel time (two hours round trip) in the project areas   
� Increase in the number of heads of livestock with access to water within a reasonable 
distance (20 km radius) in the project areas; 
� Increase in available grazing biomass  in the targeted rangelands in the project areas.  
� Communities in the project areas are organized in community-based structures (CPLs, 
CGEPs and women/fishermen associations) that actively prepare and implement SAAHPs

D.  Project Description

The AF-2 investments will aim to upscale up activities under the parent project to surrounding 
naturally and socially linked pastoral areas, including (i) Community investments (water 
mobilization and soil conservation; agriculture, livestock and Fisheries development; and income-
generating activities), (ii) capacity building and technical assistance and (iii) Project management 
and coordination.

Component Name
Priority Community Investment Subprojects
Comments (optional)
The proposed AF-2 would finance US$4.0 million (57%), to scale-up existing activities, e.g. 
priority community investment sub-projects. The funding covers consultant services for carrying 
out the detailed design and supervision, as well as goods and civil works for the implementation 
and the operation of the community sub-projects. Community investments will be demand-driven 
and will comprise the following sub-projects: (i) water mobilization and soil conservation; (ii) 
agriculture, livestock and Fisheries; and (iii) income-generating activities.

Component Name
Capacity Building and  Provision of Technical Assistance
Comments (optional)
A total of US$1.6 million (23%) will be allocated to scale-up existing activities, e.g. capacity-
building activities and the provision of technical assistance. the AF-2 will finance capacity-
building activities for the PMU, the grassroots organizations such as Water Users Associations 
(WUA) and community groups to support the formulation and the implementation of 
participatory schemes, while improving local contingency planning to better face the impact and 
challenges in the aftermath of extreme events. The component will sensitize and mobilize 
beneficiary communities and other stakeholders to facilitate effective involvement in the planning 
and the project implementation process as well as their awareness on nutrition, sanitary and water 
quality issues. The use of ICT.

Component Name
Project Coordination and Management
Comments (optional)
A total of US$1.1 million (15.7%) will be allocated to further support project coordination and 
management activities. This component will support the PMU through the provision of goods, 
works, consultant services, training and incremental operating costs associated with project 
management, implementation, monitoring and evaluation, and audits. Incremental costs to be 
financed include incremental contractual staff costs, office rehabilitation works, equipment and 
operations, transportation equipment and operations, and domestic travel, to name a few.

E.  Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis (if known)

The geographic targeting principles of the proposed AF-2 area of interventions consist mainly in 
scaling-up the activities of the parent project in the neighbor pastoral areas and new fishing areas, 



Page 4 of 8

while consolidating current achievements in the already covered areas. The unit of project 
intervention is based on traditionally recognized local communal grazing areas or "parcours", 
shared by a particular group of localities and communities who possess traditional grazing rights 
over a common area of rangeland. In total, the project area will cover in addition to the 12 
"parcours" already covered by the parent project, six additional with the AF-2 financing: three in 
Obock, (Fididiss-Allaylou, Moulhoulé-Andoli, and Saday-Waddi), one in Tadjoura (Garabtissam-
Balho) and two in Dikhil (Kori-Gagadé and Dawdaya-Der Ela). Two additional fisheries sites will 
also be included in the project areas, e.g. Goubet and Arta-Plage. The extension of PRODERMO 
project activities to the socially linked neighbor pastoral routes  and new fishing areas through 
additional financing will not require additional environmental assessment beyond that which is 
already provided in the current Environmental and Social Impact Assessment Framework 
(ESIAF) prepared for PRODERMO. The existing Environmental and Social Management 
Framework (ESMF) will be updated to address issues related to agricultural inputs, to ensure 
proper management and minimize any adverse impacts.

II. Implementation
Institutional and Implementation Arrangements
No changes are introduced to the institutional, implementation, procurement, or financial 
management arrangements. The Ministry of Agriculture, Water, Fisheries, Livestock and Halieutic 
Resources (MAEPERH) through its existing PMU will continue to be the implementing agency 
responsible for the AF-2 implementation. As indicated previously, the PMU’s Regional Office 
located in Obock, Tadjourah and Dikhil will be reinforced with Staff and vehicles in order to support 
the implementation of the AF-2 activities in the new and additional project area. The other entities 
involved in the AF-2 implementation include the beneficiary communities organized into 
Community Management Committees (CGEPs); the Local Development Committee (CPLs); and 
other community groups, as well as the existing National Steering Committee which was established 
under the original project.

IV. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify 

and describe any potential large scale,  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
While the project might not have significant or irreversible negative impacts, the main risks can be 
controlled by the design and the operation of sub-projects. Groundwater depletion through 
increased used of boreholes can be mitigated through close groundwater monitoring and strict 
adherence to defined recharge regimes.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities 
in the project area:
There are no expected long-term negative social impacts.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse 
impacts.
N/A

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
Under the parent project and the AF-1, the recipient has satisfactorily implemented the 
requirements of the existing ESMF. The project has designated focal points for the Environmental 
and Social Management Plan (ESMP) implementation in the regions where the project is being 



Page 6 of 8

implemented. Beneficiary communities have also received training on Environmental and Social 
requirements in order to ensure that implementation continues along the various levels of the 
project. Environmental and social screening is carried out regularly with the requisite 
documentation. The PMU prepares monthly reports on the implementation of the Environmental 
and Social Management Framework (ESMF) requirements and shares these with the Bank for 
review. 
 
The project triggers OP/BP 4.01. To meet the requirements of the policy, the recipient has 
prepared an ESMF. The ESMF outlines the screening procedures for the sub-projects, as well as 
the institutional implementation arrangements. 
The project does not trigger OP/BP 4.12. For the parent and the AF-1 operations, the recipient 
prepared documentation tools to ensure that choice and mobilization of land parcels are voluntary 
and participatory.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure 
on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The revised ESMF was consulted upon in 18 localities, one for each pasture, including women.
