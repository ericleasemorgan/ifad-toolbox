B. Introduction and Context 
Country Context 
 
1. Despite a stable macroeconomic framework, Guatemala struggles with low rates of economic growth and 
high poverty compared to its neighbors. Measured by per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Guatemala is the fifth 
poorest economy of Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) and remains one of the region’s countries with the highest 
rates of social and economic exclusion. GDP growth averaged only 3.3 percent over 2015-2018, with real GDP per 
capita growth stagnating and falling behind its Central America peers over the same period. Guatemala’s ability to 
provide basic public services and respond to changing conditions and demands is hampered by low collection of taxes 
by the Central Government (tax revenues are close to 10 percent of GDP) and highly rigid expenditures, as well as 
significant gaps in knowledge and job skills. For example, around two-thirds of Guatemalan children at late primary age 
today do not possess basic literacy skills.  
 
2. Poverty, inequality, and rurality are high and persistent.  Guatemala has one of the highest poverty rates in 
LAC, and deep inequality persist across various dimensions. In 2014, an estimated 60 percent of the total population 
of 17 million was estimated to live in poverty, up from 55 percent in 2000. Almost 80 percent of Indigenous people  
live in poverty (2014), and 50 percent live in extreme poverty. Income inequality is high, and the Gini coefficient rating 
stood at 0.49 in 2014. Vulnerability is particularly high among the Indigenous peoples, with almost 80 percent living in 
poverty in 2014, and half in extreme poverty. In 2017, about 48 percent of the total population was estimated to live 
in rural areas, where poverty is significantly higher (76 percent) than in urban areas (42 percent). Assessing more recent 
changes in poverty and inequality is difficult, due to the scarce availability of socio-economic data (Guatemala has had 
the second-lowest number of household surveys available in the region (after Haiti), in the period since 2000). 
However, qualitative evidence, available data and recent developments, do not point to progress on these metrics.  
 
3. Guatemala is among the highest rates in the Gender Inequality Index and has the lowest rate of female labor 
force participation in Latin America and the Caribbean. Many indicators of women’s economic opportunities have not 
improved since 2000 and are worse than the average in LAC and similar countries. Only 4 out of 10 women are in the 
labor force, less than half the corresponding rate of men. Similarly, female youth unemployment is almost twice that 
of men. Women are at a disadvantage with respect to their male counterparts also in terms of technical and soft skills, 
as well as business opportunities and access to information, technology, and markets for inputs and outputs – all of 
which translate into lower income levels. In terms of Gender-Based Violence (GBV), Guatemala registers one of the 
highest rates of violent deaths among women in the world: 6.4 in 100,000 in 2018, almost 5 times the global rate. An 
estimated 628 women lost their lives to violence in 2018, almost two deaths per day. Lack of education, inclusion, and 
gender inequality are among the most relevant triggers of GBV.  

 
4. Guatemala has the sixth highest rate of chronic malnutrition in the world and the highest in LAC, with 
Indigenous and rural populations disproportionately affected. In 2019, Guatemala ranked 68th in food security out of 
113 countries, with only 40 percent of Guatemalan families enjoying food security. Some 77 percent of families have a 
poor or inadequate diet, characterized by high consumption of cereals (maize) and low consumption of foods of animal 
origin, fruits, and vegetables. Chronic child malnutrition (stunting) is very high according to the World Health 
Organization (WHO), affecting 47 percent of all Guatemalan children under five, 58 percent of Indigenous children, and 
66 percent of children in the lowest income quintile. On the opposite side of the spectrum, overweight and obesity are 
on the rise, affecting over 50 percent of the adult population. 

 
5. Guatemala is extremely affected by climate and weather events and its poorer populations are particularly 
vulnerable. Guatemala is the ninth most at risk country worldwide from climate change. By 2050, economic losses

from drought, flooding, and other extreme weather events are projected to reduce GDP by between 1.3 percent and 
3.7 percent. On the other hand, Guatemala's contribution to global Green House Gas (GHG) emissions is low compared 
to other countries: in 2011 the country emitted 3.4 tCO2e/capita (half of the average per capita emissions of LAC).  
Agriculture is one of the strategic sectors for climate change mitigation and adaptation goals under Guatemala’s 
Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC). 

 
6. On March 11, 2020, the WHO declared the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak a pandemic. and the 
impacts on Guatemala are expected to be severe. The economic impacts of the disease outbreak are envisaged to 
lead to a significant decline in GDP in 2020, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has revised the country’s 
economic growth projections for 2020 to negative 2 percent.  Impacts are starting to be felt mainly through reductions 
in exports and tourism, and through reduced remittances (12 percent of GDP in 2018). The COVID-19 outbreak will 
have significant effects on the external accounts, inflation, and government balances, with expected higher financing 
needs and public deficit. On March 18, 2020, in preparation for the spread of COVID-19 in Guatemala, the Government 
launched the “National Program for Emergency and Economic Recovery” to respond to the crisis. 

 
Sectoral and Institutional Context 

7. Agriculture plays a significant role in Guatemala’s economic performance and employment. Primary agriculture 
accounts for about 10 percent of the country’s GDP with a significant multiplier when accounting for the full backward 
and forward linkages in the agri-food system and employs around 30 percent of the population. In 2015, the broader 
food sector represented 45 percent of the country’s total merchandise exports. Secondary processing activities also 
create opportunities for job creation and diversification of local production. Market-linkage programs in the sub-sectors 
of vegetable and fruit preparation for exports have in some cases, proven particularly beneficial for small-scale 
organized producers. 
 
8. Limited market access and inefficient value addition/preservation capacity and lack of market information 
result in low productivity and variable sales and incomes, for Guatemala’s micro, small and medium agro-industrial 
enterprises and small producers.  Within the domestic markets, smaller producers and SME agribusinesses face a 
number of challenges. Limited market transparency, lack of investment in on-farm and post-harvest technologies and 
other logistical market-access barriers lead to an abundance of middlemen, who capture a large portion of the value 
of any transaction. In addition, the quality of infrastructure varies greatly across Guatemala, which exacerbates regional 
income inequality, particularly between urban and rural areas. This also has severe impacts on access to agricultural 
markets, including contributing to high food losses (on-farm and throughout the VC and affecting food quality and 
safety.  

 

9. In particular, the Guatemalan agri-food sector faces the challenge of substantial post-harvest food losses, due 
to insufficient investment in storage facilities, limited market information and low uptake of good post-harvest 
practices.  According to the United Nations Environment Programme, 52,000 tons of post-harvest food is lost or wasted 
annually in Guatemala. More than 35 percent of beans and maize are spoiled due to poor harvest management, pests 
and animals, salmonella and aflatoxins. In addition, lack of information about market location and prices leads to high 
levels of food loss at the farm level and additional upstream loss in the value chain. Food Loss and Waste (FLW) also 
significantly contributes to GHG emissions 

 

10. To build toward its anti-poverty and growth potential as part of the new Government’s “economic wall of 
opportunities,” the agri-food system must improve significantly its productive and post-harvest efficiency while 
mitigating the deleterious impacts of the recent COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 is expected to impact in

unprecedented ways the productivity and food security of producers and consumers within Guatemala’s food systems, 
as well as agri-food exports. While the sector has clear potential for continued expansion and diversification in export 
and domestic markets, the urgent challenge related to COVID-19 threatens producers, agribusiness micro-, small- and 
medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), other supply chain actors, markets, and domestic and international demand. To 
improve access to markets and build resilience in the system, especially given the current dual health and economic 
emergencies, the proposed Project offers an opportunity to make investments that contribute to strengthening and 
improving efficiency in productive and post-harvest capacity, and to promoting food safety, food quality, 
competitiveness and broader resilience considerations. 

 
C. Proposed Development Objective(s)

D. Project Description  
 

11. The proposed Project will prioritize investments in select, strategic Value Chains (VCs) pre-identified by 
the Ministry of Economy (MINECO).  Project-supported beneficiaries will be eligible micro, small and medium 
agribusinesses and agro-industry, producers’ associations, and producers’ groups (hereinafter referred to as 
MSMEs).  

12. Component 1: Emergency Response to COVID-19 Impacts on Agro-industrial Economic Activities. This 
component will invest in two strategic priority areas (i) Emergency relief to MSMEs through a MINECO partial 
guarantee fund, and (ii) Skills development for greater employability through training and an on-line labor-

International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI), and thirteen partner projects 
in IFPRI’s GAAP2 portfolio, Pro-WEAI is composed of twelve indicators of women’s empowerment in agriculture: autonomy in income, self-
efficacy, attitudes about domestic violence, input in productive decisions, ownership of land and other assets, access to and decisions on credit, 
control over use of income, work balance, visiting important locations, group membership, membership in influential groups, and respect among 
household members.

matching platform. 

13. Component 2: Investments to Enhance MSMEs Efficiency and Resiliency. This component will operate 
at a national level, focusing on subprojects in select, strategic VCs. Eligible beneficiary MSMEs will receive 
financial support based on approved business plans to improve the quality of their productive processes through 
investments in post-harvest practices, including activities such as storage, agro-logistics, aggregation, and 
transformation of harvested products along the selected VCs. The Project will provide grants and beneficiaries 
will be expected to provide contributions.  The grants will be provided by MINECO with both IFAD and World 
Bank resources.  

14. Component 3: Institutional strengthening in support of Guatemala’s agri-food system.  The objective of 
this component is to strengthen public sector institutions that are considered strategic in supporting the 
efficiency of the country’s agri-food system.  It is divided into two sub-components: (i) improving public 
infrastructure to enhance SPS standards, food safety, food quality and traceability and (ii) institutional 
strengthening of key public sector institutions, including MINECO, MAGA, and National Quality System and INE.  

15. Component 4. Monitoring, Evaluation and Project Management. This Component will finance the overall 
project management, monitoring, and implementation of Components 1 to 3.  

16. Component 5. Contingent Emergency Response Component (CERC). The objective of this component is 
to support the Government’s emergency response to disasters. This will be activated upon request of the 
Borrower, upon the official declaration of a national emergency.

Summary of Assessment of Environmental and Social Risks and Impacts 
. 

 
17. Whereas the environmental risk rating is assessed as moderate, the combined Environmental and Social risk 
rating is considered SUBSTANTIAL, particularly driven by contextual social factors and borrower’s capacity: (i) the 
inherent challenges of implementing projects with multiple and diverse Indigenous groups with their own governance 
structures, languages and socio-cultural characteristics dispersed nationally; (ii) potential implementation of 
subprojects in remote and difficult to access areas due to inadequate and limited infrastructure, particularly during 
the rainy season, as well as potential overlapping with high crime and violence areas, creating challenges for providing 
technical support and effective monitoring; (iii) use of a guarantee scheme that triggers participation of financial 
intermediaries with no previous experience working with the World Bank; and, (iv) no existing institutional capacity in 
MINECO to develop and monitor Environmental and Social (E&S) instruments and no previous experience with the 
new areas covered by the Environmental and Social Framework. 
 
18. Given that the exact scope and location of subprojects will be defined only during project implementation, 
based on demand and subject to the specific eligibility criteria, and because specific risks are unknown, the project has 
adopted a framework approach to environmental and social management. The framework approach and phased

preparation of E&S instruments is also required to accommodate project preparation with condensed procedures 
under paragraph 12 of the Investment Project Financing policy in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. The E&S 
instruments will be developed in two phases. The Government of Guatemala (GoG) will develop, consult with key 
stakeholders, and disclose prior to appraisal a draft Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP), including a project-level 
Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM) and an Environmental and Social Commitment Plan (ESCP). Consultations for 
these instruments took place in the context of country-wide quarantine with strong mobility restrictions, following the 
recommendations set forth in the WB’s Technical Note, avoiding in-person gatherings, and using virtual interactive 
meetings, emails, online surveys, WhatsApp and traditional telephone calls, when stakeholders did not have access to 
online channels or were not used to them. The results of these consultations have been documented in the draft SEP 
and integrated into the design of the project and the SEP. 
 
19. The Borrower will also develop, consult with stakeholders and disclose within 30 days of effectiveness: an (i) 
Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF); (ii) Labor Management Procedures with a dedicated GRM 
for project workers; (iii) an Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework (IPPF); and, (vi) a final SEP, including a project-
level GRM. The ESCP reflects the GoG’s requirements to implement the above-mentioned instruments at the site-
specific level and to complete periodic reporting to the Bank on its compliance. During implementation, as business 
plans are approved, Environmental and Social screenings will be carried out for each subproject. Environmental and 
Social Management Plans (ESMPs) covering environmental, social, health and safety (ESHS) issues, as well as 
Indigenous Peoples Plans (IPPs), will also be developed when applicable. All required construction phase mitigation, 
management and monitoring measures identified in the ESMF will be reflected in bidding and contracting documents. 

 

20. The PIU will include dedicated environmental, social and gender specialists and will be responsible for 
complying with environmental and social commitments, supervising firms and contractors to ensure application of 
mitigation measures, monitoring implementation and reporting to the Bank and relevant national authorities. MINECO 
will submit semiannual implementation reports to the Bank, including a dedicated section on compliance with the 
environmental and social requirements set forth in the ESCP and specified in each of the E&S instruments developed 
for this Project. 

 
E. Implementation 

 
Institutional and Implementation Arrangements  

21. The Project will be implemented by MINECO. MINECO is the entity in charge of formulating and executing 
consumer protection and competition promotion policies. Specifically, it formulates and executes policies for 
national and foreign investment, promotion of competitiveness, industrial and commercial development. In 
addition, by delegation of the President of the Republic, it is the entity in charge of carrying out the negotiations 
of bilateral and multilateral international trade agreements and treaties. It also proposes, in coordination with 
the other ministries and State agencies, the specifications and technical and quality standards of national 
production; and facilitates the competitive development of micro, MSMEs through the provision of financial 
services and business development. The Project will be headed by the Vice Ministry of Investment and 
Competition of MINECO and the National Program on Competitiveness (PRONACOM).  
 
22. As part of the support to the agriculture sector, MINECO will provide technical support and capacity 
building for the other key institution in the sector - the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Food (MAGA). 
Among its functions, MAGA is in charge of implementing the food and nutrition security policy, as well as 
promoting community organization through productive agricultural projects by means of extension services,

training, and technical assistance. In addition, it is responsible for generating, processing and disseminating 
geographic, cartographic, food security and risk management information to prevent and mitigate the effects 
caused by natural disasters. MAGA will receive technical support and capacity building through project activities.

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 
 
Advancing inclusive, sustainable and productive territorial development is one of the salient objectives in Colombia’s new 
National Development Plan (NDP) for 2018-2022. Historically, gaps in the frameworks and institutions for territorial 
planning and subnational public management have contributed to important challenges to equitable regional 
development in Colombia, as reflected in poor service delivery indicators and inequality measures. Recognizing the 
importance of addressing these challenges, the Government’s 2014-2018 NDP outlined a program of reforms targeted 
at establishing the enabling environment and regulatory framework for integrated territorial development, actions that 
were supported by the First Programmatic Territorial Development Development Policy Financing (P158520). Important 
milestones - including approval of a new territorial planning policy, a comprehensive cadaster policy, and the 
strengthening of investment agreements between the national and subnational governments, among others - were 
achieved under this Program. Under the framework of the new 2018-2022 NDP, the Government is now advancing on 
the next generation of policies aimed at strengthening the institutional frameworks needed to further consolidate 
territorial development in Colombia.  
 
Relationship to CPF 
 
The proposed operation is well-aligned with Pillar 1 (Fostering Balanced Territorial Development) of the 2016-2021 CPF, 
which recognizes the important role of subnational governments in supporting territorial development.  
 

C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  
 
The objective of this operation is to support policies to strengthen the institutional frameworks for coordination, 
planning and resource allocation, and capacity building that promote strategic investments at the regional level, as 
well as to  foster efficient rural and urban land markets to leverage regional development.  

 
Key Results  

 
Key results are expected from improved coordination, planning and resource allocation that promote strategic 
investments at the regional level, more efficient rural and urban land markets such as increased coverage of cadastral 
information for improved multisectoral public management, and improved public management capacity at the 
subnational level.  
 

D. Concept Description 
The proposed operation aims to achieve its objective in supporting policy actions under three pillars. As the design further 
develops, these may be consolidated into two pillars.  
 
Pillar 1: Coordination, Planning and Resource Allocation that Promote Strategic Investments at the Regional Level -  
Despite recent advances in the implementation of Colombia’s frameworks for effective territorial development, 
challenges related to weak inter-institutional coordination at the territorial level and investment atomization continue.  
Thus, further efforts are needed to consolidate these reforms and address persistent regional inequalities in territorial 
development. As such, reforms under this pillar focus on strengthening the institutional framework for multi-level 
governance, enhancing coordination within and between regions, and incentivizing regional investments aimed at 
supporting strategic regional development needs.

Pillar 2: Fostering Efficient Urban and Rural Land Markets - Rural and urban land markets in Colombia have operated 
inefficiently, in part due to the lack of reliable and current information about land parcel demarcation, land ownership, 
land prices and overall land economic potential. As a result, land disputes have multiplied exponentially, complicated by 
the country’s long civil conflict which impeded access to the entirety of the territory. The operation will support 
government policies to establish efficient land information systems and processes and more dynamic land management 
at the urban level. 
 
Pillar 3: Improving Public Management Capacity at the Subnational Level - The effectiveness of the Government’s 2018-
2022 NDP in achieving its regional development objectives will depend, to a great extent, on the capacity of subnational 
governments to effectively manage the underlying processes essential for operationalizing and implementing policy, as 
well as for the central government to effectively monitor the process and provide subnational entities with relevant 
incentives and support.  As such, the operation supports reforms that build on previous and existing efforts to strengthen 
institutional capacities in subnational governments.  
 

E. Poverty and Social Impacts and Environmental Aspects 
 
Poverty and Social Impacts 

The Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) will be organized around the pillars outlined in the DPF. In particular, the 
policies in Pillar 1 aimed at strengthening policies and institutions to enable integrated territorial development are 
expected to have positive effects on territorial management and planning at the subnational level, as well as on the 
enhancement of territorial development. The effects on welfare are likely to be mostly indirect and moderately positive 
overall, operating through a better provision of public services and local public goods. Actions under Pillar 2, supporting 
policies to improve the efficiency of rural and urban land markets are expected to have moderate positive effects in the 
long-run through tenure formalization, and the improvement of efficiency and performance of sub-national entities that 
could help to reduce socio-economic gaps. The impact on poverty and shared prosperity of policy actions under Pillar 3, 
aimed at supporting the strengthening of management capacity in the public sector at subnational level are expected to 
be positive; it will, however, depend on the way those savings will be allocated and the elasticity between local public 
investment and poverty. Further analysis and a more extensive literature review will take place as the team moves forward 
to determine the distributional impact of these prior actions. 
 
Environmental Impacts 
 

The policy actions supported by this operation will likely contribute to more adequate management of local resources and 
a better planning of territorial development, which, by way of integrating environmental preservation and conservation, 
can generate better contributions in information, institutional coordination and allocation of budgets for environmental 
management. To expand the coverage of cadastral information should contribute to increased tenure security and secure 
access of local communities to forest and natural resources and to strengthen local governments’ ability to generate 
resources, improve public service delivery, and potentially develop environmental enforcement capacity; those 
improvements can help to reduce illegal deforestation and degradation of rural landscapes, maintain vital ecosystems 
services, reduce greenhouse emissions, and improve agricultural productivity. Policies supporting strong environmental 
requirements for urban permits and urban land regulations could bring about climate change co-benefits in cities. The 
environmental analysis identified a potential risk for possible indirect negative environmental effects from some policies 
supported under the DPF, which are not considered to be significant, as long as government applies existing environmental 
legislation and best practices.

B. Introduction and Context  
 
Country Context  
 

1. The COVID-19 outbreak is expected to push Uruguay’s economy into a recession for the first time in two 
decades. Over the past years, real GDP growth had been on a downward trend, declining from 4.6 percent in 2013 to 0.2 
percent in 2019, the lowest level since 2002. Prior to the outbreak, it was expected that this trend would be reversed in 
2020 as result of the implementation of the new Government’s reform agenda as well as the prospect of large 
infrastructure investments associated with a paper mill project of historic proportions coming on stream. The economic 
fallout resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak has changed this scenario dramatically. Total exports contracted y-o-y by 
10.9 percent1 as early as February, due to a drastic drop in exports to China, Uruguay’s largest trading partner. The 
domestic lockdown mandated in March then triggered a sharp decline in economic activity, affecting both demand and 
supply. Real GDP growth projections are nearly 6 percentage lower than they were at the beginning of 2020; they are 
projected to register at -3.7 percent, from an originally projected growth of 2.0 percent.  

 
2. The economic fallout will result in a significant increase in poverty and will generate an enormous strain for 
many Uruguayan families, with children and youth being particularly vulnerable to the shock.  Although the Government 
swiftly adopted emergency measures to mitigate the impact on the most vulnerable, building on existing social safety nets 
and adding temporary measures to expand the protection to those that do not qualify to existing programs, notably 
informal workers, Bank staff estimate that poverty will increase from 8.8 percent in 2019 to 11.8 percent in 2020, 
annihilating the major progress witnessed over the past decade. This is due to the economic impact of the pandemic 
layered over the effects of the drop in agricultural productivity from the drought as well as contagion from both 
Argentina’s economic crisis and Brazil’s recession. The increase in the poverty incidence translates into 106,000 additional 
people falling into poverty, disproportionately affecting households with children. Afro-descendants (1 in every 5 people 
in the poorest decile) and informal workers (7 in every 10 workers in the poorest decile) are disproportionately exposed 
to the shock. People in the bottom 40 percentile of the income distribution face higher risks of unemployment and labor 
income losses and make up a disproportionally large share of the workforce in the sectors most affected by the crisis, such 
as retail and hospitality. The expected increase in poverty incidence and severity threatens to erode human capital with 
lasting negative effects, and to raise concerns about perpetuation of disadvantages and social exclusion which stands in 
contrast to Uruguay’s societal preference for equity and social cohesion.  
 
3. To spur a strong economic recovery, Uruguay will have to set the foundations for a robust growth trajectory, 
notably by strengthening policies and institutions to enhance resilience to different types of shocks. The unprecedented 
economic shock caused by the COVID-19 outbreak is hitting Uruguay at the time of multiple risks pressing on the economy. 
First, Uruguay is confronting an increasingly adverse regional economic scenario, notably the protracted economic crisis 
and high market volatility in Argentina. Second, Uruguay is faced with a growing exposure to climate variability that is 
putting at risks major sectors of its economy, particularly agriculture. The different risk dimensions - health, fiscal and 
environmental - are mutually reinforcing and have the potential to create a “perfect storm” for the Uruguayan economy. 
The COVID-19 outbreak highlights the need for a more comprehensive and integrated approach to risk management, at 
the core of which is restoring prudent fiscal policy making. In order to put the economy back on a strong recovery path, 
the new authorities will need to embark on their ambitious medium-term reform program once the crisis abates, with a 
focus on the following dimensions: (i) fiscal consolidation, (ii) development of the private sector and (ii) resilience to 
climate and weather-related shocks.  
 

 
1 Although exports began to recover in March (in line with the rebound in industrial activity in China), they still were 23 percent lower than in 
March 2019.

Relationship to CPF 
 

4. The proposed operation is fully aligned with the 2016-20 Country Partnership Framework (CPF), and the 2018 
PLR, notably as it supports Uruguay in “building resilience to shocks.” The 2015 Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) had 
identified the need to “build resilience to face economic volatility and extreme weather events” as one of the three main 
challenges for Uruguay. Accordingly, the first of the CPF’s two Focus Areas is dedicated to “building resilience to shocks.” 
This operation responds to the immediate needs to cushioning the impact of the pandemic on the most vulnerable 
workers and firms (Pillar 1) and lays the ground for a strong recovery (Pillar 2), through enhanced resilience to future 
shocks. The SCD update, currently under preparation, deepens the analysis of the vulnerability of the Uruguayan economy 
to multiple, reinforcing shocks (i.e. fiscal/financial, sanitary and environmental) and identifies key institutional weaknesses 
in this regard.  
 

C. Proposed Development Objective(s) 
 
5. The development objective of the proposed operation is to support the Government of Uruguay in (i) mitigating 
the economic and social impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and (ii) laying the foundations for a strong and resilient 
economic recovery.  
 
Key Results  

 
6. Following corporate guidance on new IBRD financing for countries with an income above the Graduation 
Discussion Income (GDI), this operation addresses critical institutional shortcomings. At the core of the operation are 
policy and institutional reforms that will lay the foundations for a strong and resilient economic recovery, notably through 
enhancing resilience to multiple shocks. It supports measures that aim at mitigating the economic shock caused by COVID-
19, helping weather the impact on public finances, and restoring a robust fiscal outlook in the medium term. The operation 
thereby also contributes to safeguarding access to external capital markets on reasonable terms, an additional key feature 
of corporate guidance on GDI countries. This is critical given that the COVID-19 crisis has rendered access to sovereign 
financing more challenging for emerging economies, including Uruguay. Uruguay is currently rated just above the 
investment grade2, with a negative outlook in recognition of its large fiscal consolidation needs in a time of economic 
downturn. In addition, through its objective of enhancing resilience of the economy against climate shocks, the operation 
supports the provision of regional and global public goods.   
 

D. Project Description   

7. The proposed DPL is a stand-alone operation aimed at mitigating the economic and social impact of the COVID-
19 outbreak and improving policies and institutions for a strong and resilient economic recovery. The policy matrix of 
the operation includes key priorities in the Government’s emergency response to the COVID-19 crisis and in the medium-
term reform program. The first pillar is focused on supporting efforts to cushion the expected strong social and economic 
impact of the crisis, with a focus on the most vulnerable households and firms that would otherwise by financially viable. 
The second pillar is reflective is reflective of the ambitious medium-term reform commitments of the Government to 
support a strong and resilient economic recovery through: (i) instituting a fiscal policy framework that safeguards fiscal 
and debt sustainability, (ii) improving business climate for private sector development, (iii) enhancing disaster and 
environmental risk management and, (iv) transforming agricultural production towards higher resilience to climate 
change and increased productivity.  

 
2 Uruguay’s sovereign credit rating, according to Fitch, is the lowest possible rating within the creditworthiness band, i.e., BBB- with a negative 
outlook. The other two major credit rating agencies place Uruguay at BBB.

8. The proposed DPF will support important reforms along two pillars:  
 

• Pillar 1 of this operation aims at supporting a series of temporary countercyclical measures to protect the most 
vulnerable and avoid the destruction of productive assets in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. These measures 
include: (i) the enactment of a series of countercyclical measures, including the creation of the COVID-19 Fund to 
swiftly respond to the sanitary crisis (PA#1), (ii) the strengthening of three important social assistance programs to 
(partially) offset temporary income losses of lower income groups (PA#2), (iii) the creation of a temporary 
unemployment insurance scheme to protect workers against effects of lay-offs or partial suspensions (PA#3), (iv) the 
strengthening of the institutional response to the expected rise of violence in the context of the COVID-19 quarantine 
(PA#4), and (v) the adoption of emergency measures to support access to finance for MSMEs (PA#5). In the 
presentation of these emergency measures, the Government emphasized their temporary and countercyclical nature 
and committed to rolling them back once the crisis will have passed.  

 

• Pillar 2 of this operation aims at laying the foundations for a strong and resilient economic recovery. The COVID-19 
outbreak brings to the fore how the deteriorating fiscal position over the past years has limited the scope of a 
countercyclical fiscal crisis response. The Government is committed to reversing the trend of rising fiscal deficits and 
debt levels by instituting a fiscal policy framework that safeguards fiscal and debt sustainability and allows for 
conducting countercyclical policies in times of economic downturns. This agenda is at the heart of the medium-term 
reform program, as reflected in the Urgent Reform Bill, and will be implemented in full once recovery sets in. The 
commitment to fiscal consolidation has already manifested itself by measures adopted soon after the Government 
started its mandate, such as the elimination of certain tax expenditures in VAT (as reflected under the PA#6). Pillar 2 
also reflects the Government’s commitment to continue advancing on structural reforms for private sector 
development and on institutional strengthening for better protection of the economy against climate-related shocks. 
Both agendas were initiated under the previous Government and have been endorsed by the current administration 
as critical foundations for a dynamic and sustainable recovery after the COVID-19 pandemic. The Government will 
pursue a broader reform effort aimed at improving Uruguay’s regulatory environment, such as by easing requirements 
and costs for firm registration (PA#7). Uruguay also needs to strengthen its capacity to shelter its economy against 
climate variability to avoid jeopardizing its recovery post-COVID. Addressing disaster and environmental risks is by 
nature a complex and multi-sectoral endeavor, transmitting through various channels to the entire economy, and 
requires differentiated yet coordinated interventions at various levels of government. In this sense, the operation 
supports the institutional strengthening of the emergency response system, with enhanced coordination (both 
horizontal and vertical) between public and private stakeholders (PA#8) as well as the transformation of the 
agriculture model that increases resilience to climate variability, while enhancing productivity (PA#9). 

 

E. Implementation  
 
Institutional and Implementation Arrangements  

 
9. The Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) will be the main responsible agency for the monitoring, evaluation, 
and results framework and will coordinate actions across relevant ministries and agencies involved in the operation. 
The agencies responsible for the implementation of the prior actions supported by the operation include: (i) Pillar 1: 
Ministry of Social Development (MIDES), Ministry of Labor and Social Security (MLSS), Ministry of Public Health (MPH), 
National Institute for Women (InMujeres) and MEF; (ii) Pillar 2: MEF, SINAE and Ministry of Livestock, Agriculture and 
Fisheries (MGAP). The World Bank will be monitoring the implementation of the DPF program through regular supervision

missions. The World Bank will maintain close dialogue with counterparts throughout preparation and collaborate with 
MEF for the monitoring of indicators.  
 

F. Poverty and Social Impacts, and Environmental, Forests, and Other Natural Resource Aspects 
 
10. The policy measures supported by this DPF series are aimed at mitigating the short-term social and economic 
impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the most vulnerable, while implementing structural reforms aiming at building 
enhanced resilience to multiple shocks (sanitary, fiscal and environmental). As such, the overall reform package 
supported is expected to contribute to mitigating the effects of the pandemic shock on the poor, both directly through 
strengthening the social safety net, but also by facilitating a faster and more sustainable recovery. By strengthening the 
social protection systems, the policy program under the first pillar is expected to mitigate the impact of the Covid-19 
shock on the most vulnerable by providing emergency relief as part of a time-bound countercyclical economic stimulus 
package. Policies supported under the second pillar of the operation are aimed at strengthening the foundations for a 
strong economic recovery with an emphasis placed on enhancing institutional capacities in reducing the country’s 
exposure to future shocks, which tend to affect disproportionally the most vulnerable groups of the society. 

 

Environmental, Forests, and Other Natural Resource Aspects 
 

11. The policies supported under Pillar 1 of this DPL are not likely to cause significant negative effects on the 
environment, forests, or other natural resources. The policies supported under the second pillar of this operation aim at 
strengthening the foundations for private sector development and are expected to increase overall economic activity. 
Spurring economic recovery after the COVID-19 pandemic does not imply a relaxation of environmental standards, given 
the strong environmental management framework in Uruguay. The adoption of a policy on emergency and disaster risk 
management and institutional strengthening of the National Emergency System-SINAE (PA#8) is expected to reduce 
adverse impact to the environment including degradation of natural resources and the human urban environment from 
exposure to disease and effects of infrastructure loss. The adoption of the national plan of adaptation to climate 
variability and climate change (PA#9) is expected to have significant positive environmental effects.  
 
12. Uruguay has a strong legislative and regulatory framework and relatively effective public-sector environmental 
agencies. The limited negative environmental effects that could result from the operation will be well managed and 
mitigated by the existing laws and regulations. Agencies such as the DINAMA and DINAGUA and DIGESA (under the 
Ministry of Health) provide oversight and regular monitoring of environmental indicators, especially pollution. 
Environmental impact assessment and licensing has been a requirement since 1994 (Ley 16,466) and is considered among 
the top ranked countries based on environmental performance.3 

 

G. Risks and Mitigation 
 

13. The overall risk to achieving the PDO is assessed as Moderate. Given the severe economic impact of the COVID-
19 outbreak around the globe, the macroeconomic risk is rated as Substantial: if the projected recovery path that foresees 
a return to positive growth rates at end-2020 does not materialize, the country may be stretched beyond its fiscal capacity 
to support the businesses and households affected by the crisis. The temporary COVID-19 response measures supported 
through this operation would help the economy withstand the shock, while the medium-term institutional and policy 
reforms also contained in the policy matrix will be critical for embarking as swiftly as possible on a sustained recovery

trajectory. The risks related to Sector Strategies and Policies are rated Substantial because the timing of this operation, 
(prepared shortly after the new Government took up its mandate, as well as the enormous amount of personal and 
financial resources needed to respond to the COVID-19 crisis) may affect the ability to implement effectively the measures 
contained in the policy matrix and meet the result targets. These risks are however mitigated by supporting through this 
operation the reforms falling under the Government’s priority areas, as set by the COVID-19 response package and policy 
package put forward in the Urgent Reform Bill. The risk categories for the Technical Design of the Program, Institutional 
Capacity for Implementation and Sustainability and Stakeholders are rated as Moderate. In terms of technical design and 
institutional capacity, Uruguay has a strong track record in terms of implementing programs, and a long trajectory of 
successful DPL programs with the Bank and similar programs with other IFIs. On risks related to Stakeholders, the DPL 
series supports further strengthening of the policies underpinning this social contract, notably those captured under Pillar 
1.  .
