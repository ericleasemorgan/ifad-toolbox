Project Summary  

 

Overview. 2PAI BÉLIER was identified during the dialogue with the Government of Côte 

d’Ivoire to transform the agricultural sector, using an innovative approach. It aims to lay down 

the prerequisite conditions for the emergence of an agro-industrial pole in the country’s 

heartland and as the first agropolis for the transformation and modernization of Ivorian 

agriculture. It concerns the Bélier administrative region and the Autonomous District of 

Yamoussoukro - a once prosperous zone that has experienced economic decline for three 

decades despite its significant potential. The project prioritizes the integrated approach to 

revive promising value chains and tackle a number of impediments to the development of the 

agricultural and agro-industrial sector. This innovative approach is a clean break from the 

sector-based approach, and is reflected in a critical mass of diversified actions capable of 

sustainably transforming economic activity at the grassroots. The project’s sector objective is 

to contribute to food and nutritional security. The specific objective is to contribute to the 

emergence of an agro-industrial pole in Bélier Region by revitalizing promising agricultural 

sub-sectors (rice, maize, cassava, vegetables, pork and fish) and further involving the private 

sector, youth and women.  

 

The UA 97 million project cost will be financed by an EUR 64.36 million ADB loan, a UA 

26.04 million ADF loan, a UA 3.4 million ADF grant (a total of UA 80 million to be borne by 

the Bank) and by the Government and beneficiaries to the tune of UA 17 million. The project 

has three components: (i) Restoration of productive capital; (ii) Development of value chains; 

and (iii) Project management. The first component aims to endow the region with key 

infrastructure for the development of agricultural and agro-industrial activities (irrigation 

schemes, roads, storage and marketing facilities, livestock infrastructure, electric lines, ICT), 

while also ensuring the best living conditions for the population concerned (DWS 

infrastructure, classrooms, school canteens, health structures). The second component aims to 

support all actors for them to operate dynamically around value chains in a more integrative 

and inclusive environment. The concern will be to: strengthen land security; better structure 

farmers’ organizations and build their technical and managerial capacity; support 

mechanization; develop employment and the recruitment of young graduates, by supporting in 

particular INP-ESA; promote agri-business especially by strengthening the Yamoussoukro 

industrial zone and ICT development; ensure better access to agricultural financing and enable 

better contribution to nutrition. The last component will ensure that the project is managed 

according to schedule and through sound implementation and monitoring arrangements. 

  

The project will benefit 461,600 people (64% of project area residents), 112,000 of them 

directly, 800 young graduates and 200 SMEs (including 50 in produce processing). It will 

benefit about 230,000 women, including 4,300 farmers, 400 young girls and 25 processing-

operators and traders. With estimated additional production of 465,000 tonnes per year, 

additional income per beneficiary is estimated at about CFAF 1.2 million for Model 1 

(representing rice farmers), CFAF 7.2 million for Model 2 (representing market garden 

operators), CFAF 2.5 million for Model 3 (representing rain-fed activities), CFAF 4.8 million 

for Model 4 (representing young farmers), and CFAF 20 million for Model 5 (representing 

SMEs), CFAF 2.5 million for Model 6 (representing pig farmers) and CFAF 4.5 million for 

Model 7 (representing fish farmers). The project will benefit about 112,000 persons directly, 

107,000 of whom would be lifted out of poverty. Thanks to the setting up and organization of 

processing units (50% run by women), 120,000 tonnes of cassava tubers will be processed into 

several by-products. The project will help to raise the agricultural produce processing rate from 

119,000 tonnes currently (51% of total production) to about 581,000 tonnes (85%). It will 

create the equivalent of approximately 19,000 permanent jobs.   

 



 

v 

Needs Assessment: The project area has a population of about 702,000 and covers a land area 

of 11,695 km2. Average population density is 60/km2. It is about 200 km to the North of 

Abidjan. Two out of three people in Bélier Region live with less than one dollar a day (the 

poverty rate in the region is 61.8%, compared to 46.3% nationally). The rationale for the 

intervention is the high level of poverty and the need to revive the region around the once 

prosperous administrative capital that is now in the throes of economic decline, due mostly to 

insufficient investments linked to the socio-economic crisis of the 2000 decade (PADER-Lakes 

approved by ADF in 2000 was not implemented). Therefore, this intervention is urgent since 

it will contribute to establishing a development pole to tap the area’s high potential and meet 

the great expectations and pressing needs expressed by the youth and women.  

 

Bank’s Value Added: The establishment of a technical and financial framework to support 

agri-business is consistent with the Bank’s Medium-Term Intervention Strategy in Regional 

Member Countries, Pillars 1, 2, 3 and 5 of the High 5s (Light up Africa, Feed Africa, 

Industrialize Africa and Improve the quality of life for the people of Africa) and the Bank’s 

new “Feed Africa: Strategy for Agricultural Transformation in Africa, 2016-2025”. The Bank 

provided the Government technical assistance to identify and prepare the project, and expertise 

to develop financial inclusion and technical support in line with CSP 2013-2017. Besides, 

through this operation, the Bank will support Côte d’Ivoire’s efforts to rebuild the country and 

transform its economy - a priority objective of Government’s National Development Plan 

(PND 2016-2020). Unlike previous standard agricultural interventions, this Bank intervention 

will in particular fulfil all necessary conditions for setting up an agro-industrial pole to ensure 

the dynamism of promising agricultural sub-sectors in a given territory. Tangible and intangible 

infrastructure will be integrated to create local value added, improve the productivity of 

agricultural sub-sectors, and spur the produce processing dynamic to ultimately establish a true 

agro-industry as a prerequisite for agricultural sector development.  

 

Knowledge Management: The project will widely disseminate experience and good practice 

garnered during the management of units for agricultural produce production/processing. Thus, 

farmers of both sexes, artisans, processing operators, traders, youths and girls, as well as local 

authorities will acquire new techniques and skills enabling them to better manage their affairs 

and improve their living conditions. Thanks to the project, actors will gain experience on 

managing sub-sectors around inter-professions at the local level. INP-ESA’s involvement in 

helping young graduates to settle will help to endow it with new expertise and offer 

beneficiaries new opportunities in operational and managerial fields. The dissemination of 

knowledge via the monitoring/evaluation system will be done with the involvement of value 

chain actors. State officials involved will have the opportunity to be trained and broaden their 

experience in promising and innovative intervention sectors currently inexistent in the region 

(financial inclusion and framework of technical support to private initiatives).

BÉLIER REGION AGRO-INDUSTRIAL POLE PROJECT (2PAI-BÉLIER) 

 

Management hereby submits this report and recommendations concerning a proposal to extend 

an ADF loan of UA 26.04 million, an ADF grant of UA 3.4 million and an ADB loan of EUR 

64.360 million to the Republic of Côte d’Ivoire to finance the Bélier Region Agro-Industrial 

Pole Project. 

I STRATEGIC THRUST AND RATIONALE  

1.1 Project Linkages with Country Strategy and Objectives  

1.1.1 After a period of economic recession caused by the armed conflict of 1999-2011, the 

Ivorian economy gradually picked up thanks to political stability and the support of International 

Technical and Financial Partners. After a negative growth of -4.7% in 2011, GDP growth rose 

to 9.8% in 2012 and 8.3% in 2013, 2014 and 2015. Concurrently, the poverty rate at the national 

level dropped slightly from 48.9% in 2008 to 46.3% in 2015. The National Development Plan 

(PND 2016-2020) that followed the previous PND 2012-2015, is a unique frame of reference 

for public action. It hinges on five strategic thrusts: (1) Strengthen the quality of institutions and 

good governance; (2) Speed up human capital development and promote well-being; (3) Speed 

up structural transformations and industrialization; (4) Develop infrastructure spread 

harmoniously across the country and preserve the environment; and (5) Strengthen regional 

integration and international cooperation. In the area of gender, it intends to promote enrolment 

and literacy among young girls/women and women’s empowerment. Strategic Thrust 3 involves 

developing the agricultural sector as a means for the structural transformation of the country, 

especially by: (i) improving the quality of agricultural produce; (ii) speeding up the 

modernization and enhanced productivity of the agricultural sector; and (iii) speeding up 

product processing. The project is in line with Pillar 2 (Development of support infrastructure 

for economic recovery) of the CSP (2013-2017), confirmed during the March 2016 mid-term 

review.  

1.1.2 The National Agriculture Investment Programme (PNIA-2010-2016) covers priority 

activities in the crop, livestock and fisheries development sectors. It fits into a common global 

ECOWAS Agricultural Policy Framework and Comprehensive African Agriculture 

Development Programme (ECOWAP/PDDAA). On 13 October 2016, Government launched 

the process to prepare the second-generation PNIA (2017-2025) with NEPAD and ECOWAS 

support, to be implemented by PND 2016-2020. The authorities aim to guide and support 

regional and national efforts in the agricultural sector to guarantee that the 6% growth target is 

met and at least 10% of the budget is allocated to the sector (Maputo Commitment). The 

Government plans to increase this allocation rate from 5.4% in 2016 to 7-8% from 2017, and at 

least 10% from 2018. The Government adopted the agropoles development approach in 

designing this new programme and intends to organise a Donors’ Roundtable to ensure its 

financing.  

1.2 Rationale for the Bank’s Intervention 

1.2.1 During the implementation of PNIA, the Government identified a programme jointly 

with the Bank for the transformation of the agricultural sector based on the agropoles approach. 

Given the availability of resources, the country’s absorptive capacity and the security situation, 

dialogue with the authorities led to the planning of this programme, which is divided into three 

agropoles projects whose order of priority was adopted by common agreement during the 

preparation of CSP 2013-2017, and confirmed during the mid-term review. The first project 

titled “Bélier Region Agro-Industrial Pole Project” benefited from a Project Preparation Facility 

(PPF) advance. The second, the Agro-Industrial Support Project in the North of Côte d’Ivoire, 

will be the subject of a PPF advance being studied. The third project concerning the Tonkpi 



 

2 

Region will be studied subsequently. This report is for the first selected project covering the 

Autonomous District of Yamoussoukro (Yamoussoukro and Attiégouakro Départements) and 

the Bélier administrative region (Didiévi, Djékanou, Tiébissou and Toumodi Départements). 

This zone is about 200 km to the North of Abidjan, covers 11,695 km2 and has 702,000 

inhabitants. It has significant agricultural potentials that is yet to be fully tapped, highly 

degraded infrastructure and several private agro-industrial initiatives being developed. This 

zone has been marked by economic recession for three decades, after the decline of the cocoa-

coffee sub-sector (1980s and 90s) and the military-political crisis of 2000 to 2010, then the post-

electoral crisis of 2010-2011 (see Annexes A, B and C).  

1.2.2 Various Bank missions to the project area and the concerted approach highlighted a 

number of major constraints: (i) serious degradation and insufficiency of irrigation and pastoral 

infrastructure (dams, schemes) as well as socio-economic infrastructure (roads, markets, storage 

facilities, schools, drinking water, etc.); (ii) insufficient social cohesion and organization of 

actors, making it impossible for farmers/processing operators/traders to optimize their joint 

activities; (iii) weak land security; (iv) poor mastery of production techniques; (v) inadequate 

access to the factors of production (e.g. quality seeds); (vi) poor mechanization of agricultural 

activities; and (vii) inexistence of a framework of technical and financial support to private 

initiatives, industrialization and value chains integration, particularly those that are promising 

for youths. A few development projects exist in the region and private initiatives are emerging 

(SIPRA, INTERVALLE, Aurore, etc.). These offer opportunities for ultimately developing 

PPP-type operations. Although local development is constrained by farmer/grazier conflicts and 

climate change, the region (whose headquarter is Yamoussoukro, the country’s administrative 

capital) has first-class infrastructure suitable for economic revitalization, particularly with the 

commissioning of the Abidjan-Yamoussoukro motorway in 2014, the existence of an 

international airport and the presence of a world-class university complex. By virtue of its 

integrated approach, the project is consistent with four (4) of the Bank’s High 5s: (1) Feed 

Africa; (2) Light up Africa; (3) Industrialize Africa; and (5) Improve the quality of life for the 

people of Africa. In particular, it is in line with the Bank’s new Feed Africa: Strategy for 

Agricultural Transformation in Africa, 2016-2025, which implements Pillar 1 focused inter alia 

on higher investments in tangible and intangible infrastructure, mobilization of agricultural 

financial flows, agricultural produce processing, youth employment, the development of 

agropoles and agro-food industry. It is also consistent with the Bank’s Gender Strategy (2014-

2018), especially its second pillar aimed at strengthening women’s economic empowerment, 

and the Bank’s Strategy for Addressing Fragility and Building Resilience, 2014-2019. 

1.3 Aid Coordination  

1.3.1 The Agricultural Infrastructure Development Support Project in Indénié-Djuablin 

Region (PAIA-ID) is the Bank’s only active project in the agricultural sector. It was approved 

in March 2012 (UA 21.6 million grant) and, since October 2016, benefited from a 

supplementary NTF loan of UA 4 million to strengthen agri-business activities. The project 

status is satisfactory since the disbursement rate in November 2016 was 57%. Apart from the 

Bank, many development partners have interventions in the agricultural sector in Côte d’Ivoire 

including the FAO, the World Bank, WADB, the EU, AFD, WFP, IsDB, IFAD, BADEA, JICA, 

GIZ, Spanish Cooperation, Chinese Economic Cooperation and the Indian Government. These 

partners belong to the “Agriculture, Rural Development and Environment” Sector Group, which 

seeks to facilitate consultation and dialogue with the Ivorian Government. Another partner 

group, the Nutrition Sector Group, also works closely with the Agriculture Sector Group.  

1.3.2 FAO supported the Government in several post-crisis operations as well as in the 

design of development thrusts and operationalization of PNIA, especially in the area of rural 

land. In particular, the World Bank finances a multi-national Research Programme in West 

Africa (PPAAO/WAAPP, 2013-2016) that promotes agricultural sector productivity. Its 



 

3 

innovative outcomes can be capitalized in 2PAI-Bélier, especially in terms of new food 

processing technologies for vegetables and cassava. Since 2013, AFD has been financing the 

Project for the Acceleration of Agricultural Sub-Sectors in Côte d’Ivoire (PARFACI) and co-

finances with the World Bank the Agricultural Sector Promotion Project in Côte d’Ivoire 

(PSAC). PARFACI supports the market gardening, pork and fish sub-sectors as well as the land 

sector in Bélier, Gontougo, Poro and Tchologo regions. On completion in mid-2017, it will be 

relayed in its foodstuff component in Bélier region by 2PAI-Bélier especially by supporting the 

market gardening, pork and fish sub-sectors. The EU interventions are in the cash crop/food 

crop sub-sectors, rural land security, agricultural training, the fight against infectious animal 

diseases (epizooty), as well as the health safety of export products. JICA intervention in Bélier 

Region via the Local Rice Promotion Project (PRORIL) is in the form of a technical assistance 

operation to strengthen the capacity of actors in the local rice sub-sector. JICA also supported 

Government to prepare an agricultural mechanization strategy and is preparing a project for its 

operationalization. 2PAI-BÉLIER will forge synergies with all ongoing projects, including 

PARFACI, PRORIL and PPAAO/WAAPP. 

1.3.3 FAO and AFD play a leading role in the “Agriculture, Rural Development and 

Environment” Technical and Financial Partners Group (TFPG). This group has an internal land 

security sub-group with the EU as lead agency and the AfDB, AFD, WB and FAO as members. 

As part of the TFPG, regular consultations are organized in Abidjan, with Bank participation.

II PROJECT DESCRIPTION  

 

2.1 Project Objectives and Components 

 

2.1.1 The project’s sector objective is to contribute to enhancing food and nutritional 

security. The specific objective is to contribute to the emergence of an agro-industrial pole in 

Bélier Region through the revitalization of promising agricultural sub-sectors and greater 

involvement of the private sector, youths and women.  

 

2.1.2 Project Design Elements. The project aims to put in place the prerequisite conditions 

for the emergence of an agro-industrial pole to transform and modernize agriculture in the 

erstwhile prosperous Bélier Region, which has experienced economic decline for three decades, 

despite its significant potential. To revive agriculture around promising value chains, the project 

prioritizes an integrated approach to resolve the many impediments to the development of the 

agricultural and agro-industrial sector (infrastructure, factors of production, organization of 

actors and sub-sectors, market integration, access to financing, etc.). The paradigm underlying 

the project’s design is to consider the agricultural and rural sector as a system with mutually 

inter-acting constituent elements. The novelty of this approach, which represents a clean break 

from the sector-based approach, lies in the critical mass of diversified actions capable of 

reviving and sustainably transforming economic activity at the local level. The project is 

founded on the value-chains and sector-integration approach to create a conducive environment 

for private sector involvement, development of community initiatives and employment of 

youths and women. It will bring about the region’s industrialization through the creation of a 

technical assistance framework, a financial arrangement, the promotion of private investments 

and the implementation of several ambitious mechanization, technical innovation, youth 

employment and human capital development programmes. The financial arrangement to 

accompany the approach will comprise: (i) financial support to strengthen the financial capacity 

of banks and decentralized financing systems through a refinancing line; (ii) a Guarantee Fund 

to contribute to mitigating the risk; (iii) an interest rate improvement fund; and (iv) technical 

assistance to financing institutions and targeted beneficiaries (the details of this component are 

given in paragraphs C3.47 to C3.52 of Annex C3 of Volume 2). 

 

2.1.3 Summary of Components: Project implementation will span five years. It will have

2.2 Technical Solutions Adopted and Alternatives Explored  

 

2.2.1 The technical solutions adopted for infrastructure are based on standards ensuring the 

sustainability of investments at acceptable costs and targeting good beneficiary ownership. 

Rural roads will be rehabilitated in accordance with the technical standards defined by the Road 

Management Agency (AGEROUTE). Special attention will be given to the treatment of critical 

points as this will allow for an uninterrupted flow of traffic in all seasons to and from most 

localities. For irrigated areas, the project prioritized the rehabilitation of existing gravity-based 

structures upstream the dam, extending somewhere available water so allows. Some degraded 

dams will also be consolidated to avoid the risk of submersion or rupture. As regards the 

development of marshy areas and market gardens, the traditional techniques used will be 

improved and modernized to lighten the work and introduce greater efficiency. For marshy 

areas, the concern will be to better regulate high-water levels and gravity-based distribution of 



 

6 

water through suitable works. For gardens, this will involve ensuring water drainage while 

promoting localized irrigation techniques (drip method, spray irrigation, etc.). New areas will 

be irrigated to encourage private community initiatives and meet different market needs. 

Marketing buildings will be constructed according to standards usually applied in the country 

through various projects. 

 
Table 2.2: Alternative Solutions Explored and Reasons for Rejection 

Alternative Solution Brief Description 

 

Reason for Rejection 

 

Construction of new dams 

with schemes downstream 

Creation of new retention dams by 

developing irrigated areas. 

 Numerous existing dams with under-developed schemes 
downstream whose rehabilitation is priority, considering 

the available financial resources. 

 Costly investments not justified given the potential already 
in place but not fully tapped. 

Laying out of large 

schemes fed via pumping 

Develop new irrigated areas of 

several hectares while ensuring 

water supply through pumping 

 High cost of maintaining schemes than for gravity-based 
networks. 

 Priority given to medium-sized and insufficiently 
developed gravity-based schemes. 

Light re-profiling of roads Light treatment of wearing course 

in place 

 Life cycle generally below one year. 
 Unsuitable solution for roads not having been the subject 

of initial rehabilitation. 

 Accessibility not assured because of many critical points 
and crossings. 

 

2.3 Project Type 

 

2PAI-BÉLIER is an autonomous operation in the form of a Loan/Grant for an investment 

project. The country is far advanced in the PDDAA process with the existence of PNIA and 

preparation of a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF). Pending completion of the 

process, most donor interventions in the sector are undertaken through targeted investment 

projects.  

 

2.4 Project Cost and Financing Arrangements  

 

2.4.1 The project’s total cost, net of taxes and customs duty, is estimated at UA 97 million 

(approximately CFAF 80.99 billion), including UA 32.50 million (CFAF 27.14 billion) in 

foreign exchange and UA 64.49 million (CFAF 53.85 billion) in local currency. A rate of 5 to 

10% for physical contingencies on works and equipment, making a total of UA 4.4 million for 

this heading or 4.5% of the total project cost, was also factored in. A provision of 3% for 

composite price escalation was applied to all components. Summary cost estimates by 

component and by expenditure category are presented in the tables below. Detailed tables of 

project costs and the list of goods and services are attached as Annexes D5 and D6 of Volume

2.4.2 Project Financing. The project will be financed by: (i) an ADB loan of EUR 64.36 

million (UA 50.56 million), an ADF Grant of UA 3.4 million and an ADF Loan of UA 26.04 

million, making a total of UA 80 million (82.5% of total cost); and (ii) the counterpart 

contribution by the Government and beneficiaries amounting to UA 17 million (CFAF 14.1 

billion), or 17.5% of the total cost. The grant includes the Bank’s UA 998,000 PPF advance to 

the Ivorian Government in February 2015 as well as the service fee. This advance will be 

reimbursed in accordance with PPF’s operational guidelines. Government’s counterpart 

contribution will finance the cost of irrigation schemes, the routine maintenance of roads 

(RMF), the settlement of customary rights in the industrial zone, the rehabilitation/extension of 

the erstwhile PADER-Lakes buildings to serve as project offices and part of operating costs. 

Beneficiaries’ contribution of UA 267,000 (CFAF 223 million), or 3% of the total project cost, 

will be used for irrigation scheme and human water works. The distribution of project financing 

is indicated in Table 2.5 below while Tables 2.6 and 2.7 show the distribution of the grant and

2.5 Project Target Area and Beneficiaries  

2.5.1 The project area covers the Autonomous District of Yamoussoukro (Yamoussoukro 

and Attiégouakro Départements) and Bélier Administrative Region (Diediévi, Djékanou, 

Tiebessou and Toumodi Départements). It is about 200 km to the North of Abidjan and covers 

11,695 km2. The climate is of the humid tropical or Sudano-Guinean type. Recent studies on 

rainfall in this region over a period of 30 years (1980-2010) show an irregular distribution of 

rain with annual values ranging between 1,000 and 1,200 mm. The effects of climate change 

are increasingly felt, leading to disruptions in the planting/harvest calendar. Nevertheless, the 

project area has high agricultural and water potential, characterized by a fairly flat relief crossed 

by a dense hydrographic network (Bandama, N’Zi and Kan Rivers) This hydrography offers the 

region good opportunities for rice cultivation, fishing and fish-farming, which remain untapped. 

According to the 2014 General Population and Housing Census (RGPH 2014), the project area 

has a population of 702,000 of which 51% male and 49% female. Poverty rose from 41.4% in 

2002 to 61.8% in 2015 in Bélier Region and from 25% to 39.4% in Yamoussoukro District 

(INS-ENV2015). Average annual income per capita is CFAF 373,504 in urban areas and CFAF 

246,122 in rural areas. These values are lower than at the national level where they are CFAF 

467,080 and CFAF 256,538. The prevalence of chronic malnutrition stands at 30.4% (SMART 

2011) and underweight at 17.3% (EDS 2012). These ratios reflect a very preoccupying 

nutritional situation, considering that the acceptable threshold of chronic malnutrition is 20%.  

2.5.2 Due to the major constraints for the region’s development and economic recovery (see 

1.2.2), Bélier Region was prioritized during the identification mission undertaken with Bank 

support (see Annex B of Volume 2). This choice was also guided by the significant potential 

that exists but which remains untapped, the existing anchor infrastructure (motorway, airport), 

the existence of a world-class university complex (INPHB), the need to revitalize the region 

around Yamoussoukro, the country’s administrative capital, which has experienced economic 

decline for several decades. It was also guided by the urgency to help the region’s population 

who expect a far-reaching development intervention (the Lacs Region Rural Development 

Support Project assessed by ADF in 2000 was not implemented because disbursements were 



 

9 

suspended in 2002 at the start of the armed conflict in Côte d’Ivoire). The project’s beneficiaries 

are value chain actors, organized as groups or cooperatives, as well as private operators with 

SME status. The project will directly benefit about 112,000 people in all. Its impact on 

employment is significant due to the creation of the equivalent of about 19,000 permanent jobs 

(approximately 4.8 million workdays). 

2.6 Participatory Approach in Project Identification, Design and Implementation  

The project was the subject of wide consultations at all stages of its study. Contacts made during 

the identification mission in March 2013 were continued during the preparatory (June 2015) 

and appraisal (June 2016) phases in Bélier Region, Yamoussoukro District and Abidjan. 

Meetings were held with the administrative authorities, local communities, technical structures, 

farmers’ organizations, women’s groups, private partners, ongoing projects and TFPs involved. 

Several workshops were organized during PPF implementation to select irrigation sites and road 

sections to be rehabilitated. Moreover, the project’s implementation will require the putting in 

place of mechanisms closely involving and empowering the various value chain actors. Since 

the sustainability of interventions, especially those concerning irrigation infrastructure, would 

require the full ownership of the parties concerned, the option was taken to target in priority the 

most committed communities that also fulfil the selection criteria (explicitly made request, land 

security, organization method, contributions and commitments, etc.). For the different sub-

sectors affected, the project will support the establishment of platforms to facilitate synergy 

among stakeholders and by systematically involving those of the private sector. Periodic 

meetings and information campaigns will be financed by the project to ensure proper 

communication and enable participatory decision-making by the actors. 

2.7 Consideration of Bank Group Experience and Lessons Learned in Project Design 

The Bank finances the Agricultural Infrastructure Development Support Project in the Indénié-

Djuablin Region (see 1.3.1). Lessons drawn from the project’s mid-term review were considered 

in the design of 2PAI-BÉLIER, including: (i) greater consideration of the value chains approach 

and promotion of private investment; (ii) optimization of the performance of delegated 

contracting authorities through a better definition of roles and tasks; (iii) expected improvement 

of the procurement process by enhancing the quality of procurement dossiers with a view to 

recruiting competent contractors and firms; and (iv) establishment of competent human 

resources for an efficient management of activities, including cross-cutting aspects 

(environment and gender). The table in Annex C1 details measures taken to reflect the lessons 

learned. An additional NTF financing in the form of a UA 4 million loan was approved by the 

Bank Board of Directors on 21 October 2016 to support agri-business activities. Value chains 

and the role played by the private sector was reflected in the project design. Overall, the project 

design benefited from the pilot initiatives of the Feed Africa Strategy in terms of the 

development of agropoles, youth employment and agriculture financing with shared risks.  

2.8 Key Performance Indicators  

2.8.1 The key performance indicators presented in the logical framework will be refined 

through the project’s baseline situation. The outcome indicators include: (i) outputs and 

production; (ii) additional production processed and marketed; (iii) higher revenue and income 

generation for farmers and settled youths; (iv) the number of women and youths having 

benefited from project support; (v) the average time of electricity cuts in the industrial zone and 

in the town of Didiévi. The main output indicators are: (i) the irrigated surface area laid out, 

rehabilitated or developed; (ii) the number of infrastructure constructed or rehabilitated 

(consolidation centres, rural markets, storage facilities, etc.); (iii) the number of bore holes and 

pumps for rehabilitated DWS; (iv) the linear distance of roads and electric lines restored; (v) 

the number of agricultural groupings and professional organizations (OPA), youths and women 



 

10 

trained or settled in various fields; (vi) the effectiveness of support systems in place 

(mechanization programme, development fund, ICT, etc.); and (vii) the number of senior staff 

and agents of technical services trained.  

2.8.2 Other gender-specific indicators will be added during finalization of the 

monitoring/evaluation system and establishment of the baseline situation, according to the 

results-based management approach. These include: (i) the proportion of women in each 

beneficiary group; (ii) the involvement of women and youths in farmers’ and infrastructure 

management groupings; (iii) the number of land certificates issued to women and youths; (iv) 

the number of women and young graduates settled; and (v) the number of people benefiting 

from the bio-fortification programme. Special emphasis will be laid on the monitoring of socio-

economic impacts (gender- and youth-disaggregated data, monitoring of FO performance, 

turnover of very small enterprises, etc.).  

III PROJECT FEASIBILITY 

3.1 Economic and Financial Performance 

3.1.1 The project’s financial and economic performance was assessed over a 25-year 

period. The calculation of project benefits was based on an estimation of additional outputs 

under the project combined with the effects of an increase in the sown land surface due to works 

(Component A) and the technology package adopted (Component B). The analysis took into 

account the characteristics of agricultural plantations in a without-project and with-project 

scenarios, and the trend of the technical level illustrated by activity fact sheets. More precisely, 

the project benefits come from: (i) the increase in productivity (rice, maize, cassava, vegetables, 

pork and fish); (ii) the increase in the productivity and surface area of rain-fed cultivation; (iii) 

and the increase in the income of youths and SMEs benefiting from the project’s technical and 

financial support.  

3.1.2 In terms of economic profitability, the project has an economic rate of return (ERR) of 

30% and Net Present Value (NPV) of CFAF 123 billion at an opportunity cost of capital of 

12%. These results are deemed satisfactory in light of project activities. The project is more 

sensitive to a decrease in production than to an increase in investment costs. A 10% decrease in 

expected production induces an ERR of 26.8% and a 10% increase in investment costs gives an 

ERR of 28.7%. A 10% decrease in production at the same time as a 10% increase in investment 

costs gives an ERR of 24.9%, which is still above the opportunity cost of capital (12%). The 

assumptions and detailed calculation of financial and economic analyses are presented in Annex 

E1 of Volume 2.  

Table 3.1: Main Economic and Financial Data 

Outcome Assessment Economic 

NPV (baseline scenario: discount rate: 12%) CFAF 123 billion 

Economic Rate of Return (ERR) 30% 

3.1.3 The analysis of the project’s financial performance shows positive additional income 

for all operating models studied. The project will benefit about 11,900 farmers including about 

1,600 for irrigated areas, 8,500 for rain-fed crops and 800 young graduates, as well as 200 SMEs 

(50 of them in produce processing), 150 pig breeders and 100 fish farmers. The project’s impact 

is significant for all plantation types studied, returns being higher for models representing 

irrigated agriculture. The additional income by model are as follows: CFAF 1.2 million for 

Model M1 representing farmers in rice-growing areas (about CFAF 1.2 billion in all), CFAF 7.2 

million for Model M2 representing market gardening farmers (CFAF 4.9 billion in all), CFAF 



 

11 

2.5 million for Model M3 representing rain-fed activities (CFAF 22 billion in all), CFAF 4.8 

million for Model M4 representing young farmers (CFAF 3.8 billion in all), and CFAF 20 

million for Model M5 representing SMEs (CFAF 2 billion in all), CFAF 2.5 million for Model 

M6 representing pig breeders (CFAF 375 million in all) and CFAF 4.5 million for Model M7 

representing fish farmers (CFAF 450 million in all). The project will directly benefit about 

112,000 people with 107,000 of them are expected to be eased out of poverty. It will create the 

equivalent of about 19,000 permanent jobs in the region (see Annex E1 of Volume 2).  

3.2 Environmental and Social Impact 

3.2.1 Environment. The project was classified in Environmental Category 2 since it has 
negligible impact on the environment and will not require population displacement. The 

Environmental and Social Management Plan was approved by ORQR and published on the Bank’s 

website on 18 November 2016. The project will have both positive and negative environmental and 

social impacts. The rehabilitation of irrigated areas (dykes and networks) will cause little 

destruction to ecosystems. Possible scheme extensions will lead only to the felling of a few 

shrubs and uprooting of secondary bushes made up largely by pennisetum purpureum. The same 

is true for impacts of the construction zone of the Raviart mini-dam where: (i) the water storage 

area has deteriorated greatly due to frequent bush fires and illegal logging of the gallery forest; 

and (ii) the poor exploitation of marshy areas by farmers who are not accustomed to it; the few 

cashew nut trees planted close to the marshy areas cover small areas that can easily be 

compensated by the activities of the Climate Change Based Project undertaken concurrently in 

the 2PAI-BÉLIER zone. Socially, the rehabilitation of structures can lead some land owners, 

most of whom are settlers, to over-price agricultural plantations in marshy zones. The 

rehabilitation of rural roads will not cause significant environmental impacts. The same is true 

of the rehabilitation and extension of socio-economic infrastructure (markets, health centres, 

schools and canteens, energy and ICT, fishing and livestock infrastructure, etc.). This 

infrastructure can only improve and ensure the sustainability of the positive impacts expected 

from the implementation of 2PAI-BÉLIER Project activities. The analysis of negative impacts 

reveals two major observations: (i) project activities will neither cause population displacement 

nor seriously undermine biological diversity; and (ii) negative impacts can be mitigated or 

minimized through the measures defined in the 2PAI-BÉLIER ESMP that was prepared during 

the appraisal mission (Annex E of Volume 2). 

3.2.2 Climate Change: Spatial and temporal variations in rainfall patterns are a real cause 

for concern for the conduct of activities in the project area as well as across the country. 

Activities directly concerned are rain-fed agriculture and activities undertaken in lowlands 

developed as water catchment in case of pronounced water shortages. For lowlands on dams to 

be rehabilitated, technical measures will be taken during works to minimize the effects of high-

water level in case of abundant rains (overflow for excess water and networks of drains). To 

mitigate erosion of the banks of lowlands, the project will ensure that good agricultural practices 

are applied, while encouraging farmers to build anti-erosion strips. Tools for implementing alert 

procedures (i.e. collection and processing of climate data and mechanisms for their 

communication to actors) are inadequate and/or obsolete. The project will contribute to 

improving these procedures in the region by: (i) increasing the number of rain gauges in the 

sub-prefectures and villages hosting project sites; and (ii) providing more equipment, 

strengthening capacity to collect and process data and means of communication. The emphasis 

on the rehabilitation of irrigation schemes is in itself a contribution to build the resilience of 

agricultural production systems. The project will support all activities already undertaken in the 

region by WAAPP/PPAAO and CNRA concerning the dissemination of reputedly drought-

resistant plant varieties. The energy component will help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 

by resorting less to diesel generators (the alternative source when power supplied by the national 

grid becomes unavailable). Besides, as part of the Global Climate Change Initiative (FIP, 

REDD+) financed by the Climate Strategy Fund (SCF), the Bank will support agroforestry and 



 

12 

the creation of forest plantations in the Centre, including in Bélier Region. This intervention 

will be in the form of a project whose appraisal will take place in the first quarter of 2017. This 

project is to be implemented in synergy with 2PAI BÉLIER. It will help to reduce greenhouse 

gas emissions, increase carbon sequestration and build the resilience of production systems. 

3.2.3 Gender Impacts. Women make up 49.6% of the population in the project area. Most 

of them engage in agriculture, in particular in the food value chains (cassava production and 

processing, market gardening produce production and marketing, rice steaming, etc.). Women 

are often confined to less fertile and less irrigated parcels due to the difficulty they encounter in 

accessing landed property. In general, women farm extensively on small areas (about one ha), 

practicing shifting cultivation with few factors of production. Often, agricultural outreach is 

undertaken at their expense because it targets cash crops and organized sub-sectors that are 

dominated by men. Women use old and precarious processing equipment. Most of them do not 

know their rights, are poorly organized and are victims of all manners of violence (sexual, 

physical, psychological, economic, harmful traditional practices, denial of opportunities). 

3.2.4 Considering these constraints and the concentration of 2PAI Bélier on food sub-

sectors, the project’s gender strategy will promote women’s empowerment and gender equality 

in access to project services and resources, the implementation of each of its components, 

community representation and decision-making. In this regard, the project will facilitate 

women’s access to land by facilitating the access of close to 2,200 women to the restored 

irrigated areas. Furthermore, 50% of land certificates, the issuance of which will be facilitated 

by the project, will be set aside for women. The project will lay special emphasis on promoting 

women’s equitable access to technologies, mechanized equipment, inputs (seeds, fertilizers and 

pest-control products), supervision services and financing on a par with men. It will support 

women to procure modern cassava processing and rice-steaming equipment. Rehabilitated 

markets will take into account the specific needs of women, especially cold rooms, and include 

gender-separate sanitation facilities, day care facilities and literacy centres. The project will 

facilitate the evacuation and sale of agricultural produce by establishing platforms, setting up 

farmer/trader contracting systems and rehabilitating rural roads. The project’s “Youth training 

and settlement programme” component will reach about 400 young girls, or 50% of the 

beneficiaries of the said programme. In addition, at least 40% of enterprises managed by women 

will be integrated in the project’s “SME support” component.  

3.2.5 At the strategic level, specific measures and actions will be taken to develop women’s 

leadership and remedy the significant illiteracy rate. A package of integrated services aimed at 

building suitable technical and social capacity, as well as life skills (family planning, HIV/AIDS 

control and violence against women, etc.) necessary for their empowerment will be provided. 

The project will also work to better structure women’s organizations around selected sites by 

ensuring that woman represent 50% of members of various committees and bureaus of 

cooperatives or professional organizations targeted. The project will also work to endow the 

selected support, supervisory or training structures and agricultural professional organizations 

and management units with real technical capacity in gender mainstreaming/inclusion based on 

a gender organizational audit. The Ecole Supérieure d’Agronomie (Advanced School of 

Agronomy, ESA) will be supported to incorporate gender-based modules in its training 

curriculum to enable the country have agronomy and agricultural specialists who are sensitive 

to gender issues. The project will produce the gender profile of the Bélier Region agricultural 

sector, including Yamoussoukro District, which will serve to define indicators for measuring 

gender equality. A gender specialist within the Project Management Unit will monitor gender 

activities. 

3.2.6 Achieving this project’s gender-mainstreaming objectives depends on the knowledge 

and capacity of different sector actors. Therefore, it is necessary from project commencement, 

to undertake training, sensitization and communication actions for a change of behaviour. 



 

13 

Furthermore, the project must sustain the achievements of women in their sectors of activity. In 

this regard, a strict monitoring must be undertaken so that women are not excluded in their 

production sectors (these sectors are bound to become more attractive for men due to the 

modernization of factors of production and an increase in income accruing therefrom).  

3.2.7 Women will benefit from all project activities for a cost amounting to approximately 

UA 58 million. Moreover, a budget of CFAF 1.4 billion (or UA 1.7 million) will be allocated 

specifically to implement targeted actions to empower women and promote gender in the project 

area’s agricultural sector. 

3.2.8 Youth Employment and Inclusion: The project area had 702,000 inhabitants in 2014 

(RGPH data), a third of whom are youths. Despite their predominance in the labour force, 

youths are less occupied and the most vulnerable on the labour market. The national 

employment situation prepared by AGEPE based on 2014 employment data reveals that youths 

are the least active in terms of occupation (59.2% against 66% for the entire labour force), the 

most unemployed (8.3% against 7% for the whole) and the most inactive (32.7% against 2.7%). 

Young men are relatively more occupied (53.5%) whereas young woman are relatively more 

unemployed (58.6%). The level of education of youths is higher (average duration of studies of 

8.8 years against 6.6 years for the entire population of working age). Furthermore, the level of 

education is higher among unemployed youths than among active employed youths (average 

duration of studies is 9.9 years against 7.9 years). Further, youths aged 14-24 years constitute a 

significant percentage of labour in the informal sector compared to the entire population 

(91.1%), more so for young men (94.1%).  

3.2.9 The project will contribute to improving youth employment indicators. It will also 

enhance production and marketing conditions (irrigation infrastructure, roads, markets, etc.), as 

well as access to innovative technologies and factors of production (inputs, equipment, etc.). 

This material capacity building, coupled with stronger technical and financial capacity, will 

boost the productivity of activities undertaken, increase income and prompt the youths to return 

to farming. Besides, during the establishment and/or rehabilitation of irrigation schemes, youths 

will be called up to provide labour. The young artisans of the region will also see their capacity 

strengthened and will thus ensure better services to the satisfaction of producers. This capacity 

building will be undertaken jointly with the Regional Trades Chamber. The platforms envisaged 

by the project for different sub-sectors will help to increase the number of clients and young 

artisans, and resolve issues of unpaid services due to poor produce sales. The project will 

facilitate the implementation of a specific study on the situation of artisans in Bélier Region, 

including Yamoussoukro District. This will provide exhaustive and relevant data for the 

professionalization of the sector, and a better participation of artisans in the establishment of 

the envisaged agro-industrial pole.  

3.2.10 Under its “Support to entrepreneurship” component, the project will foster youth self-

employment. Ongoing initiatives in different local communities (Yamoussoukro Autonomous 

District, Tiébissou mayor) to establish young entrepreneurs will be supported by the project. To 

that end, grants for the establishment of youths will awarded for the conduct of short-duration 

(at most three months) qualifying training programmes. For that, the project will build on the 

expertise of École Supérieure d’Agronomie (ESA). A consultancy firm will be solicited to 

support young entrepreneurs to prepare their feasibility studies. Young girls will make up at 

least 30% of young entrepreneurs supported. The installation of agro-industrial units will also 

contribute to increasing youth employment, as is the case with the Toumodi cassava industrial 

processing unit. Therefore, the project should support access to financing to develop ongoing 

initiatives and facilitate the establishment of new operators.

IV IMPLEMENTATION  

4.1 Implementation Arrangement 

4.1.1 Implementation Arrangements: The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development 

(MINADER) will be the project executing agency. The day-to-day management of the project 

will be ensured by the project coordination team, which will be under the supervision of the 

General Directorate of Planning, Statistics and Projects (DGPSP) based in the vacant premises 

of defunct PADER-Lakes that will be enlarged. The project is in line with Presidential Directive 

No. 02/2015 particularly paragraphs 3, 4 and 4.1. Staff for the coordination team are being 

recruited and studies and BDs of flagship components (rehabilitation of irrigation schemes and 

roads) are available, thanks to activities undertaken under the PPF advance (see Annex C). 

4.1.2 The main tasks of the team are the coordination, control and monitoring of all project 

activities, as well as the information and contact of the different actors. The team will comprise 

a Coordinator, a specialist in charge of technical operations, an Administrative and Finance 

Specialist, a Monitoring/Evaluation Specialist, a specialist responsible for the farmers’ 

organizations support service, a Procurement Specialist, a Rural Engineering Specialist, a 

Specialist in Agri-business, a Specialist in the Livestock and Fisheries Sub-sector, a Specialist 

in Agricultural Credit, an Environmentalist Specialist, a Gender Specialist and support staff. 

The members of the coordination team being recruited as part of the PPF advance will sign 

performance contracts with the implementation unit. Renewal of such contracts shall be subject 

to annual review. Only senior staff whose performance is deemed satisfactory will be 

maintained. The Borrower will submit to the Bank evidence of appointment of the project 

coordinator (“Condition Precedent to First Disbursement”) within at most six months after 

effectiveness and evidence of the designation of the rest of the team (“Other Condition”). A 

technical committee will support DGPSP in activities to render the loan effective and implement 

the project (monitor the recruitment of the coordination team, etc.). It will comprise members 

from MINADER, technical directorates of Ministries in charge of youth employment and 

livestock/fishery resources and technical advisers from Ministries in charge of the Budget, 

Economy and Finance. The committee’s mandate shall not exceed six months following the 

signature of Agreements. The travel expenses of members of this committee will be borne by 

the State’s counterpart contribution to PPF.  

4.1.3 Steering: The project will be steered by a national committee bringing together the 

representatives of the following Ministries: (i) Ministry of Planning and Development; (ii); 

Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development; (iii) Ministry in charge of the Economy and 

Finance; (iv) Ministry in charge of the Budget; (v) Ministry of Trade; (vi) Ministry of Economic 

Infrastructure; (vii) Ministry of the Environment and Sustainable Development; (viii) Ministry 
of the Family, the Woman and the Child; (ix) Ministry of Livestock and Fishery Resources; (x) 

Ministry of Youth Promotion and Employment and Civil Service; (xi) Ministry of Industry and 

Mines; (xii) General Confederation of Enterprises of Côte d’Ivoire; (xiii) the National 

Association of Agricultural Professional Organizations; and (xiv) the Group of Women’s 

Organizations for Gender Equality. The Steering Committee will be chaired by the 

representative of the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, and its technical 

secretariat will be managed by the Directorate in charge of Planning in the DGPSP. An inter-

ministerial order will be signed in this regard. This committee will meet at least twice yearly to 

consider the outputs and outcomes obtained, approve progress reports and annual work 

programmes and budgets, clear possible blockages and constraints, and ensure that activities 

implemented are consistent with national strategies and policies. The Borrower will submit to 

the Bank evidence of creating a National Steering Committee latest six months following 

effectiveness of the loans. This constitutes the “Other Condition”. 

 



 

15 

4.1.4 Regional Consultative Framework (CRC): This framework targets the harmonization 

of development interventions, local arbitration and the quest for regional balance. It will be 

chaired by the Préfet of the region. The Regional Director of Agriculture will handle the 

technical secretariat. A ministerial order will be signed to that end (Annex D1.3 of Volume 2). 

4.1.5 Associated Agencies: The project will forge partnership or delegated supervisory 

(MOD) relations, through agreements, with specialized experienced agencies to execute or 

monitor tasks falling within their spheres of competence. These include the National Rural 

Development Support Agency (ANADER) for agricultural supervision and outreach; ONDR 

for monitoring works in rice-growing areas; the Foodstuffs Marketing Assistance Authority 

(OCPV) for marketing related arrangements; the Roads Management Agency (AGEROUTE) 

for the delegated supervision of roads; the Territorial Directorate of Human Water Management 

(DTHH), for the supervision of drinking water works; the Investment Promotion Centre of Côte 

d’Ivoire (CEPICI) to monitor the projects of agricultural enterprises; the National Polytechnic 

Institute – Ecole Supérieure d’Agronomie (INP-ESA) and the Youth Employment Agency for the 

implementation of the youth training/incubation/settlement programme and some technical 

directorates of MINADER, MIRAH, Ministries in charge of the environment, women’s 

advancement and the child and the Ministry of Industry for activities falling within their 

respective spheres of competence.  

4.1.6 Procurement Procedures: The procurement of goods (including services other than 

those of consultants), works and consultancy services financed by the Bank as part of this 

project, will be done in accordance with the Procurement Policy for Bank Group Funded 

Operations, October 2015 edition and pursuant to the terms of the Financing Agreement. 

Specifically, procurements will be done in accordance with: (i) Côte d’Ivoire’s procurement 

system (SPM): Procurement methods and procedures (MPA) as part of the procurement system 

of Côte d’Ivoire comprising its laws and implementing decrees (Decree No. 2009-259 of 6 

August 2009 instituting the Public Procurement Code as amended and supplemented by 

Decrees No. 2014-306 of 27 May 2014 and No. 2015-525 of 15 July 2015 and various 

implementing orders), using standard national bidding documents (DNSAO) or other bidding 

documents approved during project negotiations for various types of activities envisaged; (ii) 

Bank Procurement Methods and Procedures (BPM): standard Bank procurement methods, 

based on relevant standard BDs for consulting service contracts deemed to be most suitable.  

4.1.7 Risk Assessment and Procurement Capacity (RAPC): The risk at country, project 

and sector level, and executing agency’s capacity in project-related procurements were assessed 

and the results are reflected in Table D2.20 of Annex D2. Deemed moderate, the risk guided 

the choice of the procurement system (Borrower, Bank or Third Party) used for given activities 

or all similar activities under the project. The appropriate risk mitigation measures identified 

were included in the PERCA action plan indicated in para. D.2.30. of Annex D2. 

4.1.8 Waiver of Eligibility: Considering that part of this project’s financing is through the 

ADB Window and that some procurements will be done pursuant to the Côte d’Ivoire 

procurement system, a formal request is made to the Board of Directors of the Bank to waive 

the rule of origin for procurements made pursuant to the national procurement system. Since 

the public procurement eligibility rules in Ivorian law are not the same as those of the ADB 

Window, it is necessary to prevent any practical incompatibility. For project procurements using 

the national system, the eligibility rules are national ones in addition to the provisions of 

paragraph 5.c of the Bank Policy on Procurement. Consequently, even using the national 

system, Bank resources cannot serve to finance a contract awarded to a bidder under sanctions 

by the African Development Bank Group. If or in spite of these provisions, a contract is 

concluded with a bidder under sanction by the Bank Group, such contract shall not be financed 

with Bank resources. However, procurements made pursuant to the Bank’s Procurement 

Methods and Procedures will comply with the rule of origin as defined in Article 17 (1) (d) of 

the Agreement Establishing the African Development Bank.

4.1.9 Financial Management and Disbursement: The overall fiduciary risk of the 

project executing agency was assessed and deemed moderate. Côte d’Ivoire issued Decree 

No. 2015-415 in July 2015 to organize the preparation, implementation and closing of projects 

co-financed with Technical and Financial Partners (TFPs). It is in line with the Paris Declaration 

on Development Aid Effectiveness, especially the use of the recipient’s national procedures. 

The decree determines all administration and management structures that must be established 

before the Bank Board of Directors rules on the project, especially the Project Coordination 

Team (ECP) and the recruitment or appointment of its members as well as the National Steering 

Committee (CNP). The project budget will be incorporated fully in the State budget and 

implemented following the simplified expenditure procedure. Project accounts will be kept with 

the SIGFIP (Integrated Public Finance Management System) software, which handles only the 

budgetary module. To have complete accounts bringing together budgetary, cost and general 

accounting modules, a private management software will be procured. Financial reports and 

statements will be published for the public as well as private systems. A procedures manual 

harmonizing public and private procedures will be prepared for the project’s management and 

financed by PPF funds.  

4.1.10 Disbursements. Project resources will be disbursed using the reimbursement, direct 

payment and revolving fund methods, pursuant to the provisions of the Bank’s Disbursement 

Manual. Four accounts will be opened in a bank acceptable to AfDB Group to receive ADF 

resources: a special account to receive revolving funds serving for the operation of the project 

coordination and three accounts to receive resources for the Value Chains Development Fund: 

(i) a dedicated account for the operations and operating expenses of this Fund; (ii) a 

“Refinancing Facility” account meant to refinance banks and project partner SFDs, and to 

guarantee loans granted to beneficiary SMEs; and (iii) an account meant for interest rate 

subsidies. These accounts have only one signatory, the public accountant who is personally 

responsible for funds entrusted to him. He/she must be sworn-in and pay a deposit in the public 

Treasury before assuming duty. Expenses linked to the services of consultants, contractors and 

suppliers will be settled by direct payment. Counterpart funds will be used to pay for expenses 

either by direct payment or by a project account opened for that purpose. 

4.1.11 Audit: An independent auditor will be recruited through competitive bidding for the 

annual audit of project accounts. He/she will be recruited based on terms of reference approved 

by the Bank for a maximum period of three years. The auditor’s continued services will be 

contingent on the approval of his/her first report. Audit reports must reach the Bank latest six 

(6) months after the close of the fiscal year. In parallel, the project is subject to control by the 

General Inspectorate of Finance (IGF) and verification by the Court of Auditors, as indicated in 

Decree No. 2015-475. 

4.2 Monitoring 

4.2.1 Project implementation will span five years from the second quarter of 2017. Once the 

project team is recruited, the Bank will organize the start-up mission to put in place all 

requirement for a rapid and efficient commencement of project activities. 

4.2.2 The project’s internal Monitoring/Evaluation Service (SSEI) will monitor the project 

internally at the physical and financial level, and by expenditure category as well as assess the 

project’s impact on beneficiaries and the environment based on relevant and jointly established 

indicators. It will be aligned on a geographic information system (GIS) included in the project’s 

ICT components. At start-up (PPF budget), SSEI will be supported by a consultant to set up the 

baseline situation and establish a monitoring/evaluation system, including verifiable indicators. 

The baseline situation study will include the gender profile in agriculture, to deepen knowledge 

of beneficiary groups especially with regard to socio-economic aspects (income, capital, 

agricultural activities). This system is expected to be functional latest six months following 



 

17 

project commencement. On that basis, the project will produce quarterly and annual progress 

reports indicating especially the implementation rates and outcomes of the different 

components, linked to the performance indicators of the logical framework. 

4.2.3 External monitoring/evaluation will be undertaken by the Directorate of Projects 

Evaluation (DEP), working closely with the directorates in charge of projects of technical 

ministries involved as well as the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF). Half-yearly 

external monitoring/evaluation reports will seek to measure progress made, identify possible 

constraints and make recommendations to resolve problems encountered. DEP will involve 

technical directorates of ministries in external monitoring missions to consider particular 

technical problems and compliance with sector strategies. Considering the project’s linkages 

with ECOWAP, external monitoring/evaluation will ensure harmonization with indictors 

selected for PNIA. The project will place at the disposal of DEP, DPPF of MINADER, the 

Directorate of Public Debt and the directorates of technical ministries involved, the necessary 

means to enable them accomplish this mission. A mid-term review is planned to establish the 

interim implementation situation, ensure the overall good progress of the project and, if 

necessary, propose adjustments. A final joint evaluation is also programmed towards project 

completion to draw lessons and build on project achievements. 

4.2.4 The project implementation schedule is presented in Table 4.7 below.

4.3 Governance 

Under Pillar I of the Bank’s CSP 2013-2017, the Bank supports the connection of the Integrated 

Local Government Management System (SIGESCOD) to the Integrated Public Finance 

Management System and the Integrated Public Procurement Management System within the 

framework of the Economic and Financial Management Support Project (PAGEF 2017-2019). 

The aim is to reduce the risk of financial loss during the management of public finances and 

support the capacity building of actors of sector ministries and local governments. This project 

will also support local governance by better securing land tenure systems, establishing concerted 

systems to limit farmer/grazier conflicts, and strengthening the capacity of local communities 

and organs to manage infrastructure whose competencies are sometimes weak. The other 

measures adopted concern: (i) the conduct of annual financial audits; (ii) efficient coordination 

by the Project Coordination Team (ECP); and (iii) the conduct of at least two supervision 

missions per year. 

4.4 Sustainability 

4.4.1 The project aims to initiate truly sustainable development by placing local 

stakeholders, including farmers, at the heart of decision-making while also strengthening their 

capacity to assume new responsibilities. During PPF preparation and site identification studies, 

an intervention process was adopted governed by a number of eligibility criteria to ensure the 



 

18 

effective commitment of the farmers concerned and the absence of potential conflicts. The 

communities concerned will provide financial or in-kind contribution for all support 

infrastructure, based on good governance mechanisms in force. The project will accompany 

them to engage a process aimed at sustaining infrastructure put in place. They will be supported 

to strengthen their capacity at the technical and organizational level, which will create expertise 

and greater ownership at their level. In particular, committees will be created or revitalized at 

each of the sites to ensure sound management and regular maintenance of community 

infrastructure. Mayors will be involved and accompanied in the management of communal 

infrastructure (markets, slaughter areas, etc.). Private sector involvement in processing and 

marketing actions is also a guarantee of the sustainability of actions undertaken through value 

chain dynamics and actor networking. 

4.4.2 The issue of the sustainability of actions implemented, especially infrastructure 

maintenance and management, is a central concern in the project’s design. For each type of 

infrastructure, specific measures will be taken to ensure management and maintenance under 

good conditions: (i) the maintenance of rehabilitated rural roads is ensured by budgeting related 

works on counterpart funds (FER financing) and piloted programming by AGEROUTE (global 

agreement with 2PAIA-Bélier); (ii) gravity-based operation of rice cultivation works, limiting 

management and maintenance costs; (iii) involvement and training of local structures to manage 

markets with higher receipts due to increased activities and sensitization; (iv) training and 

revitalization of committees for the management of HVA systems and irrigation sites, including 

water rates based on recognized practices and activities; (v) support of settled young farmers 

with tracking of trading accounts etc. Regarding the conservation of the physical environment, 

targeted actions will not have negative effects on the environment, which will foster the 

sustainability of actions undertaken. 

4.5 Risk Management 

4.5.1 The main risks that might limit results and measures for mitigating them are as follows: 

climate change related risk: Bélier Region faces serious climatic impacts, including: (i) 

recurrent flooding; and (ii) drought and its repercussions on the farming calendar and choice of 

varieties. The project will undertake mitigation measures including: (a) structures that can resist 

high intensity swells; (b) promotion of varieties and practices suited to drought cycles; (c) the 

dissemination of knowledge of climate-related risks and data; and (d) sensitization and 

communication at the level of the population of zones concerned. 

4.5.2 Risk of land-related conflicts: To ensure non-discriminatory access to works 

undertaken (gravity-based irrigation works, lowlands, market gardens, stores, etc.), the project 

will support the process of social evaluation on all sites to be developed before any intervention 

is undertaken. On development sites with full water mastery and lowland sites, the project will 

finance the land security of sites to be developed. Capacity-building support will also be 

provided to communes for better dissemination of land transaction tools and issuance of 

exploitation certificates.  

4.5.3 Risk of transhumance-related conflicts: With regard to the prevention of 

transhumance-related conflicts, the project will support devolved structures and communes to 

accompany endogenous transhumance-related conflict management mechanisms by setting up 

consultative frameworks and drafting local agreements for natural resources management. Two 

pilot sites integrating structuring works will also be selected in the region. 

4.6 Knowledge Building 

Particularly through its development of the value chains component, 2PAI-Bélier will contribute 

to train different actors and disseminate new knowledge primarily to farmers, thanks to the 



 

19 

support and training offered by operators and technical services in advisory support, structuring 

and organization. It will come up with technical innovations based on research outcomes and 

also enable youths and women inclusively to develop technical and entrepreneurial capacity and 

settle on land equipped with infrastructure and modern means of operation. As part of training 

and settling of youths, the project will support agricultural training centres and INP-ESA by 

introducing new curricula and training modules to better respond to the requirements of 

agricultural entrepreneurship and promote the emergence of technological innovations. Lastly, 

the project will set up an integrated system for managing and sharing knowledge on project 

activities through the regular dissemination of knowledge and experience acquired on its 

website and that of MINADER.
