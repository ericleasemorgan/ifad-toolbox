Project Summary  

Project Overview: In Burundi, agriculture and livestock are among the priority sectors set out 

in the PND (2018- 2027) which aims to promote intensive and modernised agriculture to ensure 

food security and foster market agriculture. The Agriculture and Livestock Value Chains 

Development Support Project in Burundi (PADCAE-B), financed by the African Development 

Bank, is in line with this dynamic. The project will be implemented in Gitega, Kirundo and 

Muyinga Provinces in northern Burundi, with a total population estimated at 2,956,784 people 

(24% of the national population), a land area of 1,671 ha (or 18% of the national total) and a 

population density of 553 inhab/km².  

The overall objective of PADCAE-B is to contribute to the sustainable improvement of food 

and nutrition security and increase in the incomes of the populations. Project interventions will 

focus on a limited number of value chains (rice, maize, goats, pigs and fish) identified by 

beneficiaries, articulated around 4 components: (i) land development, integrated land 

management, land restoration and security; (ii) development of climate-resilient agriculture 

and support for nutrition (iii) institutional, capacity building and agricultural entrepreneurship 

support.; and (iv) project management and coordination. When implemented, the project will 

help to fight food and nutrition insecurity, promote youth employment and gender, boost 

agricultural output through resilient and sustainable agriculture, encourage the structuring, 

organisation and capacity and building of cooperatives, private sector stakeholders and 

operational State structures, and improve land management. PADCAE-B, to be implemented 

over a period of 5 years (2020-2025) for a total cost of UA 16.39 million will affect 138,060 

individuals, 56% of them women.   

Needs Assessment: In Burundi, over 90% of the population and 80% of women practise 

agriculture. This sector accounts for 44% of the country’s GDP and 95% of its export earnings. 

Close to 90% of developed land is used for food cultivation (banana, cassava, sweet potato, 

maize, beans, peas, sorghum and rice). These crops contribute 80% of the Agricultural GDP, 

with the farmers themselves consuming 80% of their production. Despite its many strengths (a 

hardworking agricultural workforce, the possibility of having several crop cycles annually, 

varied ecosystems and abundant watercourses), agriculture is fraught with both structural and 

functional constraints (poor soil fertility, inadequate use of agricultural inputs, fluctuating 

agricultural production due to climate change, insufficient technical and technological 

innovations, strong demographic pressure, limited human resources, and unsuitable regulatory 

and policy instruments, etc.). 

Bank’s Value Added: This added value stems from its experience through its interventions in 

the rural and agricultural sector. The project is consistent with the Bank’s Ten Year Strategy 

(2013-2022) and will help to achieve 3 of its 5 strategic priorities, namely Feed Africa, Improve 

the quality of life for the people of Africa and Industrialise Africa. The project is also in line 

with “Feed Africa: Strategy for Agricultural Transformation in Africa” (2016-2025); the Multi-

Sectoral Nutrition Action Plan; the Jobs for Youth in Africa Strategy; and the Feed Africa 

Response to COVID-19 (FAREC). It is also aligned with the ADF 15 operational and strategic 

priorities. Lastly, the project has adopted the objectives of the Technologies for African 

Agricultural Transformation (TAAT) Programme which aims to deploy technologies to boost 

output and production in the targeted agriculture and livestock value chains. The project 

activities through increased productivity will contribute to (i) improve food and nutrition 

security through crop diversification and promotion of high nutritional value crops, and (ii) 

secure and reduce post-harvest losses thus contributing to increase the income of the 

beneficiaries in the 3 provinces. Finally, the project will help promote agricultural 

entrepreneurship, gender, youth employment, digitalization of agriculture and land governance. 



 

v 

Knowledge Building: Thanks to TAAT compacts, the project will ensure the transfer of 

technology and knowledge to national R&D structures and onward to the field actors of the 

agriculture and livestock value chains. These technological aspects include the development of 

resilient seeds, the rational use of fertilisers and improvement of genetics and nutrition of 

livestock. To improve beneficiaries’ livelihoods and build their resilience to recurrent external 

shocks and crises, the project will adopt the Centre de Rayonnement C Collinaire 

(CRC)approach and Resilience Fund (CdR) which encompasses three dimensions: a 

productive/technical dimension, financial/economic dimension, and a social dimension.  

Lastly, the project will promote the digitisation of agriculture and land tenure by (i) setting up 

an Automated and Decentralised Monitoring and Evaluation (SEAD) mechanism and an 

agricultural database in MINEAGRIE, (ii) digitising agricultural advisory services, (iii) 

interconnecting different value chain stakeholders (production, processing and marketing), and 

(iv) strengthening good governance (control of supply channels, tracking of inputs supplied to 

farmers) and setting up land management system. One of the project aspects will be the 

promotion of youth entrepreneurship articulated around training (nurseries) and opening an 

employability support fund and a guarantee fund to resolve the acute problem of youth 

financing.

MANAGEMENT REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 

CONCERNING A PROPOSAL TO AWARD A GRANT TO THE REPUBLIC OF BURUNDI TO FINANCE 

THE: 

 

AGRICULTURE AND LIVESTOCK VALUE CHAINS SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 

SUPPORT PROJECT IN BURUNDI (PADCAE-B)  

 

Management hereby submits this report and recommendations concerning a proposal to award a Grant 

of UA 15 million (9.37 million under the ADF Window and 5.63 million from the Pillar 1 of the TSF 

resources) to the Republic of Burundi to finance PADCAE-B. 

I –  STRATEGIC THRUST AND RATIONALE 

1.1 Project Linkages with the Country Strategy and Objectives  

1.1.1 In Burundi, over 90% of the population practise agriculture which accounts for around 40% of 

the country’s GDP and 80% of export earnings1. Despite numerous assets (a hardworking agricultural 

workforce 80% of whom are women, the possibility of several crop cycles in one year, the existence of 

varied ecosystems and abundant watercourses), agriculture is constrained by structural and functional 

factors (lack of fertile soils, marginal use of agricultural inputs, fluctuating agricultural production due 

to the effects of climate change, insufficient technical/technological innovations, high demographic 

pressure, limited human resources, and unsuitable regulatory and policy instruments). Agriculture is 

characterised by complex traditional systems of hill polyculture (banana, beans, root crops and tubers, 

maize) and congested marshy valleys where tuber crops, beans, maize and rice are grown using 

exclusively manual techniques. Indeed, the agrarian landscape is saturated in very densely populated 

provinces and communes. The country is characterised by high demographic pressure and rapid 

population growth (3.1 to 3.3% yearly), one of the highest in the world. This induces: (i) a decrease of 

average farm sizes, (ii) a larger number of landless farmers, and (iii) the degradation of natural resources. 

This is compounded by the impact of climate change which not only disturbed the farming seasons but 

also impacted agricultural productivity in the country. As a result, yields are low and, despite three 

annual crop cycles, production is insufficient to cover the food needs of an ever-growing population. 

1.1.2.  The project is consistent with the country’s economic and social development policy papers. It 

is in line with the National Development Plan (2018-2027) under Thrust 1 (Development of agriculture, 

livestock and strengthening of food security2) of Strategic Area 1 (Revitalise growth-bearing sectors), 

whose actions target intensive and modernised agriculture to ensure food security and promote market 

agriculture. The project is also consistent with the National Agricultural Investment Plan in force (PNIA 

2012-2017 updated to 2016-2020) which comprises four (4) priority programmes: (i) Sustainable 

increase of food production and security; (ii) Professionalisation of farmers and promotion of 

innovation, (iii) Development of subsectors and agribusiness; and (iv) Strengthening of public 

institutions. Lastly, the project is in line with the objectives of strategic livestock guidance documents 

(DOS, 2014) which set out guidelines for the sector by 2030 and the National Employment Policy 

through Strategic Areas 1(Develop skills and employability) and 4 (Promote the employment of young 

people, women and persons living with disabilities and labour market inclusion). Finally, the climate 

change resilience component of the project is in line with the nationally determined contribution (NDC) 

of the country, as part of the implementation of the Paris agreement on climate change. 

 

 
1  Thus, nearly 90% of the developed land is allocated for food crop cultivation (banana, cassava, sweet potatoes, maize, 

beans, peas, sorghum and rice) which account for 80% of Agricultural Gross Domestic Product (AGDP) with farmers 

themselves consuming 80% of their production. 
2  Thrust 1 is divided into 3 strategic objectives: SO1: Strengthen institutional and organisational capacity, SO2: 

Sustainably increase agricultural, animal and fishery production, and SO3: Promote market agriculture.

 1.2 Rationale of the Bank Intervention  

1.2.1. The Bank’s Strategy in Burundi aims to build the country’s resilience by creating conditions 

for strong inclusive growth induced by greater buoyancy of the productive sectors of the economy. The 

Country Strategy Paper (CSP) for 2019-2023 has two pillars: (1) support for agricultural development 

and transformation; and (2) improvement of transport and energy infrastructure. The project is in line 

with the objectives of Pillar 13.  

1.2.2 The project is also in line with the Regional Integration Strategy Paper for the period 2018-2022 

(DSIR) in its Pillar II (Strengthening institutional and strategic frameworks for market integration, 

investment and value chain development). Indeed, the project promotes a value chain development 

approach and aims at strengthening institutional capacity to equip the country with frameworks and 

institutions contributing to economic transformation and value chain development. 

1.2.3.  The targeted operation is well anchored in the Bank Strategy for Addressing Fragility and 

Building Resilience in Africa for quality engagement in States in transition. Poverty was aggravated by 

the intensity of the drivers of fragility in Burundi.  

1.2.4  The project is consistent with the Bank’s Ten Year Strategy (2013-2022) and is expected to 

contribute to achieving 3 of its High 5s, namely, Feed Africa, Industrialise Africa, and Improve the 

quality of life for people in Africa. The project is also in line with the Bank’s Feed Africa: Strategy for 

Agricultural Transformation in Africa (2016-2025); the Multi-Sectoral Nutrition Action Plan; the Jobs 

for Youth in Africa Strategy; and the Feed Africa Response to COVID-19 (FAREC) which builds on 

the broader foundations of the COVID-19 Rapid Response Facility (CRF). Lastly, the project 

encompasses the goals of the Technologies for African Agricultural Transformation (TAAT) 

Programme that aims to apply technology to boost productivity and production in the target agriculture 

and livestock value chains.  

1.2.5  The project is in line with the ADF-15 operational and strategic priorities which aim to create 

a conducive environment for inclusive and sustainable transformation, decent jobs and stronger 

resilience. It integrates the two strategic pillars of ADF-154. 

1.3 Aid Coordination  

1.3.1 After over a decade of inaction, sector consultation frameworks are gradually being re-

established. These rely on PND’s institutional monitoring and evaluation arrangement built on sector 

groups, common consultation and programming platforms. The "Agriculture and rural development" 

Group is being formalised. The Bank, in association with other key partners of this sector, namely FAO, 

IFAD and the World Bank, is playing an active role in its restoration. Pending the effective 

commencement of the group, regular consultations are still held with TFPs to improve the 

complementarity of their interventions, and thus create synergy to maximise project impacts on 

economic and social development.  

1.3.2  The following table shows the main amounts currently committed by sources of financing in 

the agricultural sector in Burundi.  

 

 

 
3 PADCAE-B replaces PIPARV-B which was an agricultural project included in the CSP while keeping the same 

objectives. 
4 The 2 strategic pillars of ADF 15 are: (i) Develop quality and durable infrastructure to lend impetus to job-creating 

private sector investments and foster sustainable development, and (ii) Build human, governance and institutional 

capacities to enable individuals to participate in and benefit from job-creating opportunities for inclusive growth.

II PROJECT DESCRIPTION  

The sector objective is to help to sustainably strengthen food and nutrition security and build the 

resilience of the rural populations of Ngozi, Kirundo and Muyinga Provinces. The specific objectives 

are: (i) land development, integrated land management, land restoration and security, (ii) development 

of climate-resilient agriculture and livestock value chains and support to nutrition and (iii) institutional, 

capacity building and agricultural entrepreneurship support. 

2.1 Project Components  

2.1.1 Project Design: It is based on developing or adopting innovative integrated practices and using 

climate-resilient technology and systems associated with the development of agriculture and livestock 

value chains. The TAAT approach was used since it helps to significantly boost agricultural productivity 

and production through the dissemination of low-carbon eco-friendly technologies. Synergy and 

complementarity will be created with other partners operating in the agriculture and livestock sector5.  

2.1.2 Summary of Components: Project implementation will span a period of five years (2020-

2025) and comprise three components whose main outputs are detailed in Annex B3 and summarised 

in the following table: 

 
5 It was agreed that synergy and complementarity will be strengthened with (i) FAO to support the opening of resilience 

funds, and (iii) IFAD through their PIPARV-B project which is in the same project area and has similar activities.

2.2 Technical Solutions and Alternatives Explored  

2.2.1  Inclusive Value Chains: Project interventions will focus on a limited number of value chains 

(rice, maize, pigs, goats and fish) based not only on priorities defined by stakeholders and existing 

demand, but also on their contribution to the national economy and potential impact on (i) food and 

nutrition security, (ii) agriculture household incomes, and (iii) youth and women’s employment. The 

project aims to increase the output of agriculture and livestock products, optimise processing operations 

and facilitate farmers’ access to markets.  

2.2.2  Agricultural Intensification and Land Management: Burundi is characterised by a high 

population density and no agricultural land reserves. Due to these two factors, increasing agricultural 

productivity must necessarily require the intensification of agricultural practices. This intensification 

will be through (i) a rational use of land resources, (ii) the promotion and use of improved seeds and 

fertilisers, (iii) the genetic improvement of livestock through the introduction of improved breeds, (iv) 

improved animal feed and environmental protection through the promotion of fodder and the 

production of food with a high nutritional value, (v) the setting up of Centre de rayonnement  

collinaireand resilience funds at the level of cooperatives to train farmers on good agricultural 

practices and facilitate access to financing.     

2.2.3  Digitisation of agriculture and land tenure: The project will lay special emphasis on digitising 

this sector, notably through support for the monitoring and evaluation mechanism, the collection and 

analysis of agricultural data, the dissemination of weather information, the introduction of agricultural 

practices driven by agricultural information, stakeholders’ access to agricultural information to facilitate 

decision-making and strengthening of links among stakeholders. Digitising land tenure will help to 

strengthen good governance in the sector and promote private investments therein. 

 
6 To support youth entrepreneurship development in the three provinces, an incubator will be recruited to: (i) support the 

establishment of provincial hubs, (ii) ensure the technical and vocational training of young people in various crops and 

value chain segments, (iii) provide technical support to young people in setting up SMEs, (iv) offer support in preparing 

business plans, and (v) facilitate marketing and interconnection with markets etc.

Table 2.2.1: Alternatives solutions and reasons for rejection 

 

 Alternatives Succinct Description Reason for Rejection 

 

Soil fertilisation  

This involves using organic fertilisers 

prepared with natural animal or plant 

material. Organic fertilisers are 

obtained from livestock or 

agricultural products or sub-products 

without adding any mineral or 

chemical substances 

Stockbreeding is not practised in the PA 

to facilitate the collection of sufficient 

quantities of animal dung to treat all 

areas to be exploited. This option is 

sometimes considered on a small scale 

for secondary crops with a high 

nutritional value. Training will be done 

through CRC. 

 
Intensive stockbreeding of pig 

and goat pure breeds 

This consist in importing high yield 

exotic breeds 

This alternative is costly, unsustainable 

and not suited to stockbreeders’ low 

level of technicity. 

 

E-voucher, paper version 

The e-voucher helps to enhance good 

governance in the agriculture sector 

by guaranteeing the traceability of 

inputs 

The disadvantage of the e-voucher, 

paper version, is its impact on the 

environment. It also does not guarantee 

sustainable conservation and the real 

time  transmission of data. 

2.3 Project Type  

PADCAE-B is a stand-alone investment project in the form of an ADF and TSF-financed Grant.  

2.4 Project Cost and Financing Arrangement  

2.4.1 The total project cost, net of taxes and customs duty, is estimated at about UA 16.47 million 

(USD 22.73 million) including 27% in foreign exchange and 73% in local currency. The project will be 

financed thus: UA 9.37 million in the form of an ADF Grant; UA 5.63 million in the form of a TSF 

Grant and the remainder, UA 1.39 million, being the counterpart contribution of the Government and 

beneficiaries. Project activities will span a period of five (5) years. The summary of project cost, funding 

allocation and expenditure schedule are presented in Tables 2.4 -2.6.2.4.2. The Bank Grant will finance 

100% (tax exclusive) of works, including infrastructure. Goods and services will be financed 100% 

following the attached Financing Plan, while Government will take charge of staff salaries and part (1/3) 

of office rental costs. The counterpart of the beneficiaries will be represented by their contribution to 

the National Fertilizer Subsidy Program as well as by their participation in the earthworks on the ridges 

of the hills.

2.5 Project Area and Beneficiaries  

2.5.1 The project area (PA) covers Kirundo, Muyinga and Ngozi Provinces situated in northern 

Burundi with a total estimated population of 2,743,366 people, making 24% of the national population, 

and covering a land area of 1,671 ha (or 18% of the total land area of the country). It spans across 18 

hills and the following 9 communes: (i) Kirundo Province: Busoni, Vumbi and Bwambarangwe; (ii) 

Ngozi Province: Gashikanwa, Kiremba and Tangara; (iii) Muyinga Province: Giteranyi, Gasorwe and 

Gashoho. These three provinces are among those with the highest population density in the country, 

estimated at 553 inhab/km. 

2.5.2 The provinces and communes were selected by common agreement with the populations and 

provincial/communal authorities, based on the following criteria: (i) prevalence of chronic malnutrition7, 

(ii) rural population density8, (iii) potential for development through watersheds and marshlands, (iv) 

per capita investment from other projects9. The PA population are among the poorest in the country; the 

monetary poverty rates in Kirundo and Muyinga Provinces are higher than the national average (64.6%). 

2.5.3 The project has several beneficiaries at the central and decentralised levels. It will benefit 

directly 138,060 people, 56% of them women, and indirectly all 2,743,366 inhabitants of the 3 

provinces. At central level, the key beneficiaries are the Ministry in charge of Agriculture and its 

technical departments and allied structures such as R&D and training institutions. At the devolved and 

communal level, project implementation will benefit provincial departments of agriculture and 

livestock, sector cooperatives and value chains stakeholders’ organisations, agricultural households, 

particularly very vulnerable groups including young people and women, hill-agriculture 

supervisors/monitors, animal health workers as well as private enterprises. 

2.6 Participatory Approach in Project Identification, Design and Implementation 

2.6.1 At all study stages (identification, preparation and appraisal), PADCAE used a broad participatory 

and inclusive approach. Consultations were held with governmental authorities, the technical services 

of ministries involved (MINEAGRIE, Ministry of Finance, Budget and Development Cooperation, the 

Ministry of Health, the Ministry of National Education and Scientific Research), the relevant agriculture 

value chain stakeholders including the private sector (FOMI, Edenred, Mediabox) as well as Technical 

and Financial Partners with interventions in the agriculture sector (WB, FAO, IFAD, UNDP, UNICEF, 

WFP and the EU). Field visits paid during various project design missions revealed realities on the 

ground and made it possible to consult directly with stakeholders concerned (producers’ associations, 

women’s cooperatives, youth groups, local authorities and devolved technical services). Due to COVID-

19, the appraisal mission was conducted remotely via videoconferencing in which all stakeholders 

participated. However, the PATAREB coordination was able to have meetings and discussions in the 

field with the beneficiaries.

9 

2.6.2 These visits and consultations spotlighted major weaknesses in (i) production (difficulties 

obtaining input supplies, limited advisory support, weak organisation, unsuitable cultural practices, 

under-equipment, etc); (ii) processing (poor organisation, under-equipment, limited access to 

financing); and (iii) marketing segments. These were compounded by the absence of communication 

among value chain stakeholders. Consultations will continue with them during project implementation 

to ensure that interventions are efficient, effective and sustainable.  

2.6.3 This participatory, inclusive and holistic approach is based on lessons learned from similar 

projects and aims to lay a common foundation for participation in the project implementation stages, 

promote sustainable practices, facilitate the exchange of views among stakeholders, leverage 

information and generate supplementary knowledge within stakeholders. It helps to create a body of 

knowledge for informed and responsible decision-making, provide robust support for such decisions 

and collective ownership of problems and solutions, build local capacity, and facilitate experience 

exchanges and collaboration with other TFPs’ interventions for greater synergy.   

2.7.  Bank Group Experience and Lessons Reflected in the Project Design  

2.7.1  On 30 June 2020, the Bank’s active portfolio in Burundi comprised 19 ongoing public sector 

projects for a total commitment of UA 282.77 million. Its distribution is aligned with the priority thrusts 

of the Country Strategy Paper (CSP 2019-2023) and Burundi’s National Development Plan (PND) and 

covers the following areas: Transport (58.47%), Agriculture (4.24%), Energy (33.03%), Social (3.24%), 

Multi-sector (1.02%). According to the CPR, the performance of the active public sector portfolio is 

deemed satisfactory with an IP score of 3.3 on a scale of 1 to 4 for 8 operations. However, this score 

hides a poor performance resulting from multiple extensions of the implementation timeframes of most 

portfolio projects. The performance rating fell slightly (from 3.36 to 3.34) between March 2019 and 

March 2020. 

2.7.2  The portfolio review revealed persistent difficulties that negatively affect public portfolio 

performance: (i) poor quality of technical studies which led to a few adjustments of the initial design of 

some projects during the implementation phase ; (ii) weakness in mainstreaming cross-cutting issues 

(environment, gender and fragility) in project design, BDs and contractors/consultants’ contracts and 

during implementation of road and energy projects; (iii) late commencement of projects; (iv) weak 

capacity of the Administration’s technical structures to support the project design and implementation 

process; (v) poor performance of PIUs; (vi) poor performance of some contractors and consultants; (vii) 

long time taken to response to requests for the Bank’s NOO; (viii) long procurement time frames; (ix) 

multiple extensions of project closing deadlines; (x) late submission of audit reports; (xi) lateness in 

reimbursing and/or justifying special accounts balances; (xii) late submission of quarterly financial 

monitoring reports; (xiii) late payment of Government’s counterpart contribution. 

2.7.3  The project design reflects lessons learned from difficulties with PATAREB being 

implemented, including the known weaknesses in project governance and file processing delays 

attributable to the Bank and PMU. In order to speed up the processing of files, the Government has 

undertaken an institutional evaluation of the PATAREB with a view of taking appropriate measures for 

better functioning. At the level of project management, fiduciary-related risks will be mitigated mostly 

by using the fiduciary management system within PATAREB and building PMU’s procurement and 

financial management capacity10. 

2.7.4  Lastly, the project study process factors in the lessons learned from the IDEV11 evaluation of 

the Bank’s support for agricultural value chain development, whose recommendations concern five core 

principles: (i) analyse the entire value chain; (ii) prepare a strategy to ensure inclusiveness ; (iii) nurture

capacity to adapt to market trends; (iv) think in terms of profitability with value added; and (v) prepare 

plans to create lasting impact. 

2.8 Key Performance Indicators  

2.8.1. The key performance indicators to be monitored from the baseline situation to project 

completion are described in the following paragraphs: 

2.8.2.  Agriculture and value chains: the key indicators are the following: (i) area of marshland or 

watersheds rehabilitated/developed; (ii) area covered by hill irrigation, (iii) level of additional 

production (tonnes) and crop yields (t/ha); (iv) level of food insecurity and malnutrition, (v) number of 

infrastructure constructed (storage facilities of products and inputs, processing and development units 

etc.); (vi) number of farmers per type of gender-disaggregated works supported; (vii) area of new export 

crops; (viii) area covered by fruit plans; (ix) animal weight gain rate, etc. 

2.8.3.  Income and employment: (i) poverty level, (ii) level of income increase including that of 

women and young people; (iii) number of jobs created for young people and women in entrepreneurial 

initiatives in the various agricultural, animal and fisheries sectors; (iv) number of producers, processing 

agents and traders trained and organised in cooperatives.  

2.8.4.  Environment and land management: (i) land area restored, (ii) number of land certificates 

issued. 

All selected project indicators were aligned to the key indicators of CSP, PND and PNIA. 

III – PROJECT FEASIBILITY 

3.1 Economic and Financial Performance  

3.1.1  A project financial assessment was conducted with the aid of activity models and based on 

market prices. The main assumptions underlying the analyses include: (i) 50,000 farmers actively 

engaged in agriculture at full project capacity; (ii) the project will generate an additional 25% increase 

in incomes, (iii) farmers will adopt a variety of improved maize and rice seeds as well as improved 

livestock breeds, (iv) a period of 20 years was used to measure incremental benefits from the project; 

(iv) the opportunity cost of capital used to update future benefits was estimated at 12%.   

3.1.2  For economic analysis, (v) the value of salaried work force was adjusted by a conversion factor 

of 0.75; (vi) the rehabilitation of the seedlings system will ensure national supply of quality seeds. These 

analyses were done with the financial and economic costs generated using Costab 32. The summary 

financial and economic analysis is attached as Annex VII and developed in Annex B4 of Volume II of 

the Appraisal Report. 

Table 3.1: Key economic and financial data 

IRR: 16.3% NPV (baseline scenario) equivalent to USD 17.24 million  

ERR: 25.2% NPV (baseline scenario) equivalent to USD 33.02 

million 

 

 Note: Calculations are detailed in Annex B7 

3.1.3 Financial Analysis: Based on the above assumptions, the financial analysis generated a Net 

Present Value of USD 17.24 million and an Internal Rate of Return of 16.3%, as indicated in the 

Technical Annexes (B4). As a result, the project is deemed financially viable. The IRR of 16.3% is 

higher than the opportunity cost of capital (12%). 



 

11 

3.1.4 Economic Analysis: The economic analysis used the same approach as the financial analysis, 

based on the negotiable reference prices of goods and the total project cost. Other indirect expected 

benefits were, among other things, smaller post-harvest losses, the provision of a service centre for 

agricultural equipment, a reliable system of information on soils for mixing fertilisers, an effective 

system of input distribution via the farmers’ database system and lower transport costs of goods and 

services. However, it was difficult to assess these supplementary benefits in monetary terms due to the 

limited scope of this report. Under such circumstances, the economic analysis revealed an NPV of USD 

33.02 and an IRR of 25.2%, as indicated in the Technical Annexes. 

3.2 Environmental, Social and Climatic Impact

3.2.1.1  Categorisation: The project categorisation, as confirmed and approved on 21 February 2010, 

is Category 2 based on the Bank’s Integrated Safeguards System and the national legal framework 

governing environmental assessment. This categorisation is justified by the project activities which will 

be implemented in an ecosystem dedicated to these types of activities and without major risk of 

destroying new natural spaces. The significant environmental risks will be the effects of the poor use of 

phytosanitary products. Resettlement issues are foreseen in the context of land acquisition for 

infrastructure and development, but it will affect a fairly limited number of people. 

3.2.1.2  Necessary Environmental and Social Assessments: Two environmental and social safeguard 

instruments were proposed for project implementation: (i) the Environmental and Social Impact 

Assessment (ESIA) to cover project risks/impacts linked to support for the improvement/increase of 

agricultural production and the livestock sector, in particular small-scale animal husbandry as well as 

aquaculture; and (ii) the Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) to cover project 

risks/impacts linked to the construction/rehabilitation of rural infrastructure for storage/conservation 

(sheds), processing, transport and marketing of products, and support for income generating activities 

(IGA) for women and young people. The implementation of these activities will require the acquisition 

of land, but the localities where they will be carried out in the selected provinces are still unknown. The 

ESMF will propose procedures for assessing various risks (environmental, social including relocation) 

during the project implementation phase. Public consultations took place in July 2020 during preparation 

of these instruments and involved all stakeholders (all institutions concerned, representatives of potential 

beneficiaries: farmers of marshlands, farmers’ cooperatives around Lake Rweru and the inhabitants of 

the expected site of the hillside reservoirs). Thanks to the consultation, the populations’ opinions and 

views were taken into account in the project’s environmental and social assessment process. The 

populations expressed concern mainly about: (i) land insecurity in the marshes, (ii) the risk of conflicts 

related to the sharing of water, (iii) the sustainability of irrigation infrastructures, and (iv) the fight 

against erosion. 

3.2.1.3.  Project’s Potential Environmental and Social Impacts: The project will have several positive 

environment and social impacts, including: (i) the creation of temporary jobs on development sites; (ii) fewer 

conflicts due to better circulation of water in marshlands and consultations among peers in the PIU and AVECs 

(Rural Thrift and Loans Associations); (iii) availability of water through hill irrigation; (iv) increase of 

agricultural production and farmer incomes; (v) better organisation of farmers and harmonisation of crops and 

sowing/planting dates in the marshes; (vi) reduction of soil erosion on hills, floods and silting in the marshes; 

(vii) improvement of farmers’ living conditions; (viii) better protection of the buffer zone of Lake Rweru. The 

project’s potential negative impacts concern: (i) the loss of land portions in the marshes and on the hillside 

reservoir; (ii) economic loss if development occurs during the crop season; (iii) pollution of soil and water 

resources through increased use of phytosanitary products; (iv) the risk of drowning at the hillside reservoir; 

(v) the risk of social conflicts due to the influx of workers in the area; (vi) the risk of poisoning following the 

use of pesticides; (vii) increased vulnerability of soils to erosion on hills; (viii) occupational health and 

industrial safety risks in processing units and development sites; (ix) more problems of gender-based violence; 

and (x) greater risk of the populations contracting STDs/HIV, malaria and Covid19 . 



 

12 

3.2.1.4.  Mitigation Measures: Measures to manage these impacts/risks are proposed in the 

Environmental and Social Management Plan and the Environmental and Social Management 

Framework. Some of these specific measures are: (i) prioritise local manpower; (ii) sensitise the 

population to wear protective equipment when using phytosanitary products; (iii) develop marshes 

during the dry season to limit economic losses; (iv) put hygiene, health and safety measures in place on 

construction sites; (v) secure the limits of water reservoirs; (vi) compensate the populations in case of 

economic loss; (vii) raise awareness on STD/HIV, malaria and Covid19  issues and aspects that can lead 

to social conflicts; (viii) carry out environmental and social screening of sub-projects and requisite 

studies when necessary; and (ix) prepare an abbreviated RAP, as appropriate, to manage the social 

impacts of infrastructure development sub-projects.   

3.2.1.5  Cost and Institutional Arrangement for the Implementation of Safeguard Measures: The cost 

of implementing environmental and social impact mitigation measures, building borrower’s capacity 

and strengthening the management mechanism stands at USD 390,000. It is included in the project cost 

and detailed in the attached project implementation cost matrix. The resettlement estimated at the current 

stage at 50,000 dollars will be borne by the national party. An Environmental Safeguards Officer and 

Social Development Officer should be recruited to support the Project Coordination Unit. There are 

plans to provide technical and financial support to the Office Burundais de Protection de 

l’Environnement (Burundi Environmental Protection Authority) to monitor environmental and social 

safeguard instruments. 

3.2.2.   Climate Change  

PADCAE is classified in Category II. Agriculture is one of the five most vulnerable sectors identified 

in Burundi, including forestry, water resources, energy and health. The climatic risks identified are 

linked to: (i) the availability of water for irrigation; (ii) soil erosion; (iii) the impact of extreme weather 

conditions (heavy rains and intense heat); (iv) the sustainability of physical infrastructure; (v) farming 

and irrigation techniques & systems; (vi) livestock feed (fodder/feed); (vii) sustainability of stock 

breeding systems; and (viii) the prevention and control of parasites and animal diseases. The potential 

impacts include: the modification of the farming seasons and calendar; lower crop yields due to 

increased erosion; faster land degradation and loss of soil fertility due to very heavy rains and more 

frequent disasters linked to extreme weather events (flooding of marshes and shallows, mudslides and 

landslides, hail, storms, etc.).  PADCAE will build climate resilience through the choice of agricultural 

technologies and climate-resilient seeds, the training of senior staff/agents of institutions and farmers as 

well as reforestation, thereby contributing to climate finance. 

3.2.3. Gender and Women’s Empowerment  

3.2.3.1  The project is classified in Category 2 according to the Gender Marker System since many of 

its key outcomes contribute to bridging gender inequalities. Since the project’s objective is to sustainably 

boost agricultural productivity and production, women, who form the bulk of the agricultural work force, 

should be its prime beneficiaries.   

3.2.3.2  Project activities aim to further empower women economically and socially. If implemented, 

the project will facilitate: (i) women’s better access to production tools (notably land), (ii) women’s 

socio-economic empowerment, (iii) a greater male/female participation in promoting agribusiness in the 

project area, (iv) the equitable access of women and young people to project resources; (v) women’s 

increased participation in the decision-making process, (vi) greater technical capacity of MINEAGRIE 

and other key stakeholders to mainstream gender in their policies, strategies and activities, and (vii) a 

better understanding of gender specificities through the Country Gender Profile with special emphasis 

on the links between poverty, the agriculture sector and women’s empowerment. The project will also 

support activities related to monitoring and evaluation information disaggregated by gender in the 

reports generated. The major risks concern: (i) domestic conflicts caused by land certification, (ii) the 

unequal distribution of project gains favouring men and/or exclusive male control of the project, (iii) 



 

13 

the risk that the training given to MINEAGRIE officials and other partners does not translate into 

gender-sensitive interventions, (iv) the risk that the pro-women access to credit is usurped by their 

spouses, and (v) resistance to women’s participation in highly profitable value chain segments or in high 

income crops, subsequently generating social conflicts. The solutions to optimally mitigate these risks 

are described in the Technical Annexes (Volume II). 

3.2.4 Social  

PADCAE’s contribution to improving the populations’ living conditions is undeniable. It contributes to 

higher productivity, better organisation/relations among various agriculture and livestock value chain 

segments, better access to basic infrastructure (agricultural tracks, storage facilities, market), improved 

nutritional value of agricultural and livestock products, and gender inclusion (56% of beneficiaries are 

women). Furthermore, it will foster better living conditions for beneficiaries and improve the nutritional 

status of the population, particularly women and children. Digitising agriculture and the land tenure 

system will help to strengthen good governance, reduce social tensions and promote private sector 

investments in agriculture. By creating jobs for young people through the promotion of agricultural 

entrepreneurship, the project will help to reduce unemployment, fight against migration and rural exodus 

among the youth, and reduce the social inequalities of which they are a victim. Finally, the project will 

help reduce the risks12 associated with the factors of fragility affecting the country, as identified in the 

study report on Burundi's fragility and make the agricultural sector the engine of growth and the fight 

against poverty 

IV – IMPLEMENTATION 

4.1.  Implementation Arrangements 

4.1.1.  Implementation Arrangements-Monitoring and Evaluation Mechanism  

4.1.1.1  The Ministry of Environment, Agriculture and Livestock (MINEAGRIE) is the oversight 

authority of the project. Project activities will be managed, coordinated, monitored and supervised by 

the Management Unit of PATAREB located in the DPAE of Kirundo which includes: a coordinator, a 

rural engineering specialist, a procurement specialist, an agronomy/value chain specialist, a socio-

economist, an administrative and financial officer, an accountant, and a cashier. The Bank's preparation 

mission conducted in June 2019 concluded that the profile and experience of these staff members was 

acceptable after reviewing and analyzing their resumes. However, it did identify communication 

problems among team members that impede the optimal functioning of the PMC. A recent performance 

evaluation of project staff led to the non-renewal of the contract of the Administrative and Financial 

Manager for lack of results. The Government has also recently launched an evaluation of the PMU, the 

results of which and the actions resulting from it will help improve the project's performance. The Bank 

will also conduct close supervision missions that will contribute to better operation of the PMC. In 

addition, the PMU will also be strengthened by additional staff recruited on a competitive basis and 

including a PADCAE-B Project Manager, an environmental expert, a procurement assistant and an 

accountant. The selected activities will be implemented by the MINEAGRIE Provincial Bureaux of 

Agriculture and Livestock (BPAE) and service providers under specific contracts. Project focal points 

will be designated in the two BPAEs (Ngozi and Muyinga) to ensure liaison and monitoring.. At the 

central level in Bujumbura, PADCAE-B will use the PATAREB Project’s antenna to liaise with the 

supervisory Ministry, the project’s Technical and Financial Partners, the Administration’s central 

services, and research and development institutions. 

4.1.1.2  For the sake of coordination and harmonization, the framing and orientation of the execution, 

review and approval of work programs, annual budgets (PTBA), and activity reports of the PADCAE-

 
12 The risks identified relate to (i) land tenure security, (ii) low productivity in the agricultural sector and food insecurity , 

(iii) weak land use planning and infrastructure, (iv) social inequalities and unemployment, particularly among young 

people and women, and (v) exposure to natural disasters. 



 

14 

B project will be ensured by the same Steering Committee as that of PATAREB which will be enlarged 

with : (i) the Governors of the Provinces of Ngozi and Muyinga; (ii) the Provincial Directors (BPEAE) 

of Ngozi and Muyinga; (iii) the representatives of producers or agricultural producer organizations 

(OPAOs) of the Provinces of Ngozi and Muyiga; and (iv) a representative of the Forum of Agricultural 

Producers' Organizations of Burundi (FOPABU). 

4.1.1.3  In designing the project’s monitoring and evaluation system, account will be taken of the 

targeted indicators selected for project components/activities as well as the expected impact, outcomes 

and output indicators. For better coordination and harmonisation, the Results-based management (RBM) 

monitoring and evaluation arrangement will be incorporated in the Automated and Decentralised 

Monitoring and Evaluation (ADME) system used by MINEAGRIE and the PNSADR-IM Project 

financed by IFAD. Internal monitoring and evaluation will be conducted by the project’s Monitoring 

and Evaluation Unit, while external monitoring and evaluation will be conducted by DGPAE and the 

Ministry of Finance. The Bank will field annual monitoring and supervision missions while its Country 

Office in Burundi will monitor the project, maintaining ongoing dialogue with the country’s authorities, 

and Technical and Financial Partners. According to Bank rules and requirements, quarterly, annual, 

progress and audit reports will also be prepared and submitted to the Bank, pursuant to agreements 

signed.  

4.1.2.  Procurement Arrangements  

4.1.2.1  The national public procurement system in Burundi is currently governed by Law No. 1/04 of 

29 January 2018 amending Law No. 1/01 of 4 February 2008 instituting the Public Procurement Code 

(PPC). The legislative and regulatory framework of procurement is made up of the law and decrees 

laying down the establishment, organisation and operation of the Public Procurements Regulatory 

Authority (ARMP), the National Directorate of Public Procurement Control (DNCMP) and Public 

Procurement Management Units (CGMP) as well as ordinances defining procurement thresholds, 

control and publication of contracts. The scope of the PPC covers all procurement by contracting 

authorities as well as all types of public contracts without waivers, with the exception of contracts which 

are of a secret nature incompatible with any form of competition or publicity, or where the protection 

of the fundamental interests of national security so requires.   

4.1.2.2  The assessment of Burundi’s national public procurement system (NPS) led to the qualification 

of its procurement risk as moderate. This generic country risk was reviewed in the context of 

implementation of activities under the Agriculture and Livestock Value Chains Sustainable 

Development Support Project in Burundi (PADCAE-B) to be considered in determining the project's 

global procurement risk. The overall project procurement risk rating (PPRR) at the time of the 

assessment is deemed moderate.   

4.1.2.3  Consequently, NPS will be used for the procurement of goods, works and consultancy services 

for amounts not exceeding the thresholds defined in Annex B5 of the Technical Annexes and the Public 

Procurement Plan and which do not entail a significant risk for the project considering their value, 

specificity and availability on the national market. Other procurements with a significant risk if NPS is 

used, will be awarded using the Bank’s Procurement Methods and Procedures (PMP) pursuant to the 

Procurement Policy for Bank Group-funded Operations, dated October 2015 and using the Bank’s 

relevant standard bidding documents (SBD). 

4.1.3. Procurement Capacity and Risk Assessment (PCRA)  

Risks at country, sector and project levels and the Project Executing Agency’s (PEA) procurement 

capacity were assessed. A market analysis was also conducted notably to obtain information on the 

market characteristics, bills that could affect competition and the key players on sector markets. The 

assessment results and market analysis served to guide the decision to choose NPSNPS for certain 

project activities and PMP for other activities entailing significant risk. They also made it possible to 



 

15 

plan procurements, structure contracts, choose the best procurement methods and procedures (MPA or 

NPS) suited to the goal sought, define the framework of Bank review and supervision. Appropriate risk 

mitigation measures were included in the Procurement Risks and Capacity Assessment (PERCA) action 

plan set out in Annex B5. A procurement audit will be performed by an independent firm under the 

supervision of ARMP. The project will also support ARMP to build the procurement capacity of the 

staff of MINEAGRIE’s Public Procurement Unit and the Project Implementation Unit. A Global Action 

Plan for Improving the Procurement System is detailed in Annex B5 of the technical annexes. 

4.1.4. Financial Management and Disbursement  

Financial Management: Responsibility for the project’s administrative, accounting and financial 

management will be entrusted to the coordination unit of PATAREB whose capacity will be built with 

the recruitment of additional staff whose qualifications are specified in the Technical Annexes (Volume 

II). The institutional analysis showed that the Project Management Unit’s current financial management 

systems are not satisfactory overall and that the overall fiduciary risk is significant due to the absence 

of: (i.) a budget coupled with the schedule of activities, (ii.) an administrative, financial and accounting 

procedures manual, (iii.) an accountant and cashier, (iv.) distribution of financial tasks, (v.) fixed asset 

register and fuel tracking table, (vi.) an improved missions tracking table, (vii.) room and metal cabinets 

for accounting vouchers, (viii.) a cost accounting plan and specific budget accounting plan for the 

project, (ix.) an accounting software, (ix.) a cashflow forecast plan, (x.) quarterly and biannual progress 

reports comprising interim financial statements, and (xi.) an external audit firm to audit the project. To 

address these constraints, the Project Management Unit will: (i) upon project launching and at the 

beginning of the year, prepare a budget plan coupled with a provisional schedule of activities; (ii) finalise 

before project commencement the contract of the consultant tasked with preparing the administrative, 

financial and accounting procedures manual. The consultant will also design templates of the fuel 

tracking table, missions tracking statement and maintenance/repairs monitoring statement; (iii) finalise, 

before Project commencement,  the recruitment of the Accountant and Cashier; (iv) after the recruitment 

of the Accountant and Cashier, distribute financial tasks as mentioned above; (v) after project 

commencement, assign an office and procure secured metal cabinets for accounting vouchers to be 

arranged by year and sequentially; (vi) immediately draw up a fixed assets register initialled and 

containing the number, designation, amount and location thereof; (vii) immediately draw up a weekly 

fuel tracking table; (viii) immediately improve the missions tracking table; (ix) upon project 

commencement, prepare specific cost and budget accounting plans for the project; (x) before project 

commencement, procure a software with built-in modules for general and cost accounting and budget 

management. The software contract should provide for staff training and technical assistance; (xi) upon 

Grant effectiveness, open a special foreign exchange account and two special accounts in Burundi 

Francs, one of which for the national counterpart contribution, in an acceptable bank in Burundi ; (xii) 

upon project commencement, establish a petty cash fund for amounts not exceeding BIF100,000, or 

EUR 50; (xiii) upon first disbursement, draw up a cashflow plan; (xiv) upon project commencement and 

at the beginning of the year, prepare a budget coupled with a schedule of activities; (xv) within three 

and six months of project commencement, prepare quarterly and biannual progress reports incorporating 

interim financial statements and transmit same to the Bank, the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock 

and the Steering Committee; and (xvi) upon project commencement, recruit an external audit firm. 

Lastly, during the launching of the project, the Bank (AfDB) is expected to train the Coordinator, Head 

of the Administrative and Financial Service, the Accountant and Cashier on Bank financial management 

procedures. 

Disbursements: Pursuant to the provisions of the Disbursement manual in force at the Bank. On ADF 

resources: the proposed disbursement methods are: (a) the special account method (for operating 

expenses, capacity building activities and the management of some partnership agreements) and (b) the 

direct payment method for payment of works, goods and service provision contracts. As concerns TSF 

resources: (a) the special account method (for operating expenses, capacity building activities, and the 

management of some partnership agreements) and (b) the direct payment method for the payment of 

works, goods and service provision contracts. The reimbursement method will be used when eligible 



 

16 

expenses for TSF Grant resources have been pre-financed by the Government with the Bank’s approval. 

The project will open the following special accounts in the name of PADCAE-B, in local currency (BIF), 

in financial institutions deemed acceptable to the Bank. One special account will be opened per source 

of financing. Disbursement arrangements are detailed in the Technical Annexes (Volume II)

4.3 Governance  

4.3.1 Since the 2015 crisis, the country has made significant progress in consolidating economic and 

financial governance. Several structural reforms to improve and consolidate the macroeconomic and 

budget framework in terms of resource mobilisation and streamlining of public spending were carried 

through. The new government scaled down the State apparatus by reducing the number of ministries 

from 21 to 15. However, improvements are needed to mobilise internal resources to tackle the ever-

growing expenditure and to programme and allocate public resources to achieve the PND objectives. 

The public procurement system was marked by several reforms to enhance the transparency of the 

system. Despite this progress, improvements are still necessary in the areas of implementation, slowness 

of procedures, and disputes management to make the system compliant with the relevant standards.  

4.3.2  The persistence of customs and traditions governing land access and inheritance in a modern 

economy context hinders investments in the agricultural sector. By digitising the land tenure system and 

issuing land certificates, the project will contribute to good governance in this sector, thus fostering 

private sector investments and easing social tensions. The digitised management of the fertilisation 

system will improve the efficiency of the supply mechanism and strengthen good governance. Lastly, 

the project will use an Automated and Decentralised Monitoring and Evaluation system to allow for the 

regular monitoring of field activities and launch of alerts and warnings whenever necessary following a 

vertical approach for all project stakeholders.  

4.4  Sustainability   

4.4.1  The project aims to initiate a truly sustainable development, by placing the targeted value chain 

players at the centre of decision-making and building their capacity to take on new responsibilities. The 

design of this project is based on value chain stakeholders’ demand jointly expressed throughout the 

process and which helped to guarantee their full ownership of the project. All the retained crops and the 

associated value chains exist in the project zones. The project intervention aims to amplify and 

perpetuate existing initiatives through technological innovations and link up the various value chain 

segments. 



 

17 

4.4.2  The sustainability of investments and expected benefits build on participatory entrepreneurial 

approaches involving capacity building. These include: (i) the structuring and professionalisation of 

farmers’ cooperatives and other value chain stakeholders based on expressed demand, (ii) the 

empowerment of provincial technical services to implement project activities; (iii) the inclusion and 

empowerment of women and young people through training and funding access mechanisms; (iv) the 

choice of tested technologies that can be controlled locally; (v) participation and empowerment of value 

chain stakeholders and local communities in the management of constructed infrastructure; (vi) capacity 

building and empowerment of provincial and communal technical Directorates of MINEAGRIE and 

other ministries and research and development institutions in the areas of implementation of project 

activities and monitoring; and (vi) the setting up of well-trained water users’ associations (WUA) in 

irrigated areas. This will allow for good sustainable management and regular maintenance of works.

swaps and ownership by all parties involved 

4.6 Knowledge Building  

4.6.1  The project ensures technology/knowledge transfer to national research and development 

institutions, and from them to agriculture and livestock value chain stakeholders in the field, via the 

TAAT stakeholder intervention mechanism. These technology aspects include the development of 

resilient seeds, the rational use of fertilisers and the genetic improvement and feeding of livestock. In 

collaboration with AfricaRice, the project will pilot the use of the digital RiceAdvice tool to help rice 

farmers to better monitor crops and improve yields and their incomes through personalised advice on 

management and good agricultural practices.  

4.6.2  The use of new technologies will be built into the project, thanks to the Digitisation for 

Agriculture (D4Ag) concept and approach. Through D4Ag, the project will contribute to: (i) the 

establishment of SEAD, helping to strengthen the monitoring and evaluation mechanism, (ii) the 

establishment of MINEAGRIE’s agriculture database and digitisation of the advisory support system, 

(iii) the connection of different value chain stakeholders (production, processing and marketing), (iv) 



 

18 

the strengthening of good governance ensuring control over supply channels and traceability of inputs 

supplied to farmers with the adoption of e-vouchers, and (vi) setting up of the land management system 

(land certification). 

4.6.3  To improve beneficiaries’ livelihoods and build their resilience to recurrent shocks and crises, 

the project will adopt the Farmer Field School (FFS) approach and Resilience Fund (CdR) that capitalise 

on individual and collective expertise, knowledge, skills and capacity to better understand and exploit 

agro-ecosystems. Bad habits are gradually transformed into springboards for good agricultural, 

nutritional, economic and social practice. The Resilience Fund approach is community-centred and 

contains three dimensions: a productive/technical dimension (use of sustainable agricultural practices), 

a financial/economic dimension (access to credit), and a social dimension (strengthening of social 

cohesion and solidarity by creating or strengthening farmers’ or women’s associations). This approach 

aims to gather and diversify the production assets and knowledge of vulnerable agro-pastoral 

smallholders facing food insecurity, especially women. The approach is innovative since the support 

provided targets the three dimensions in a complementary manner, which opens up more opportunities 

for beneficiaries and enables them to better prepare themselves for multiple risks.  

4.6.4  With regard to gender, the project will prepare an updated diagnosis of all gender disparities in 

different domains – Country Gender Profile, with special emphasis on the links between poverty, 

agriculture sector and women’s empowerment.
