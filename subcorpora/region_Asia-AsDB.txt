to the extent required to meet the estimated shortfall, amounts of the 
Loan which have been allocated to another Category but, in the 
opinion of ADB, are not needed to meet other expenditures, and (ii) if

extent required to meet the estimated shortfall, amounts of the Loan 
which have been allocated to another Category but, in the opinion of 
ADB, are not needed to meet other expenditures, and (ii) if such 
reallocation cannot fully meet the estimated shortfall, reduce the 
withdrawal percentage applicable to such expenditures in order that

Environment

6. The Borrower, through the Project Executing Agency, shall ensure that the 
preparation, design, construction, commissioning, implementation and operation of the project 
and all Project facilities comply with: (a) all applicable laws and regulations of the Borrower 
relating to environment, health and safety; (b) the Environmental Safeguards; and (c) all 
measures and requirements set forth in the IEE, the EMP, and any corrective or preventative 
actions (i) set forth in a Safeguards Monitoring Report, or (ii) which are subsequently agreed 
between ADB and the Borrower. In case of any discrepancy or inconsistency among the 
Borrower’s laws, regulations and procedures relating to environment, health and safety and the 
SPS, the SPS shall prevail.

7. The Borrower, through the Project Executing Agency, shall ensure that no 
Works shall be conducted for a subproject until domestic requirements for environmental 
assessment have been completed and approved by the relevant domestic agencies. This shall 
include, but not be limited to: (a) the preparation of an EBA for each subproject by a certified 
domestic agency, and the submission of this assessment to MET for review; (b) the issuance 
of a GEIA Letter by the MET, which endorses the subproject EBA and clarifies whether a DEIA 
is required; (c) the preparation of a DEIA for each subproject, as required; and (d) subsequent 
review and approval of the DEIAs by MET. The Borrower, through the Project Executing 
Agency, shall further ensure that any environmental safeguard conditions specified by MET for 
any subproject, through the GEIA Letter, DEIA, or other means, which are not covered under 
the project EMP, shall be (i) integrated in the EMP, and (ii) included in all bidding documents.

8. After completion of the EBA, GEIA, and/or DEIA for each subproject, the 
Borrower, through the Project Executing Agency, shall submit the following documents to ADB 
for review: (a) the summary findings of the EBA, GEIA Letter, and DEIA; and (b) English- 
language translations of the GEIA Letter and MET letter of conclusion following completion of 
the DEIA. The Borrower, through the Project Executing Agency, shall ensure that any findings 
or conclusions that represent new safeguard risks and/or mitigation tasks or costs which are

Schedule 4

9. The Borrower, through the Project Executing Agency, shall ensure that, in 
compliance with SPS, an ecological survey for rare, threatened and restricted-range species 
and their uses of the subproject area will be implemented, by a certified biodiversity

subproject. The resulted assessment shall (a) cover the ecological values of the specific 
subproject area, (b) strengthen the preliminary ecological impact assessment undertaken in 
the IEE, (c) develop detailed mitigation measures, and (d) conclude on the final net (residual) 
ecological impacts and whether these are acceptable under the SPS and/or national 
regulations. The Borrower, through the Project Executing Agency, shall further ensure that 
such assessment will be undertaken before the detailed engineering designs are completed 
and approved, and can be done as part of, or in parallel with, the DEIA. No works shall 
commence for the subproject before ADB and the Borrower have reviewed and approved the 
ecological survey, impact assessment, and detailed engineering designs.

10. The Borrower, through the Project Executing Agency, shall ensure that no 
pesticides or other chemicals classified as “hazardous" or restricted-use by the World Health

subproject) are included in detailed engineering designs and complied with. The Borrower, 
through the Project Executing Agency, shall further ensure that, for this purpose: (a) water 
extraction for each subproject will be monitored on a monthly basis by each soum government 
Project coordinator; (b) the monitoring results will be reported on a monthly basis to the 
subproject soum government and PIU, and compared against the monthly environmental flow 
rates calculated for each project river; (c) the monitoring results will be submitted at least 
annually to the relevant River Basin Administration responsible for the subproject rivers, for 
review and confirmation that extraction volumes comply with the permitted allocations; and (d) 
based on these comparisons, corrective actions will be identified in the event that irrigation 
water extraction is clearly exceeding the modeled acceptable extraction volumes.

12. For the associated facilities to the Project, as provided in the PAM, the 
Borrower, through the Project Executing Agency, shall ensure that they are maintained in 
accordance with domestic requirements for environmental management, including, but not 
limited to, environmental safety measures, water allocation approvals, and worker and 
community health and safety. In case any changes are made to such existing facilities which 
would significantly impact their capacity or function and as a result the viability of the Project, 
the Borrower, through the Project Executing Agency, shall immediately advise ADB of such 
changes, and the Borrower, through the Project Executing Agency, shall assess the Project 
impact and prepare a corrective action plan, if necessary, to be agreed with ADB.
