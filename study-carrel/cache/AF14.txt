Project Summary 

1. Project overview: The Rural Economy Integrated Development Support Project 
(PROADER) will be implemented in the rural areas of Kasaï-Central, Kasaï, Kasaï-Oriental, 

Kwilu, Kwango, Kongo Central and Mai-Ndombe Provinces. About 60% of the inhabitants of 

these provinces live below the extreme poverty line of USD 1.9 per day. The targeted corridor is 

an integral part of areas most severely affected by the humanitarian crisis in the Democratic 

Republic of Congo (DRC). The area has a huge agricultural, forestry, pastoral and fisheries 

production potential, and can serve as a vector for the promotion of agribusiness. It is the junction 

area between the West (Kinshasa border with the Republic of Congo), the Southwest (border with 

Angola) and the Southeast (Grand Katanga towards Zambia). The overall objective of the project 

is to promote a dynamic and prosperous rural economy by improving agricultural and rural 

socioeconomic services, and by diversifying and enhancing agricultural production. To achieve 

this objective, PROADER’s activities will be centred on the following components: (a) local 

governance and institutional capacity building; (b) promotion of productive and social 

investments; and (c) project coordination and management. The project cost is estimated at UA 

49,49 million, of which UA 39,99 million will be contributed by ADF Loan, UA 2,1 million by 

ADF grant from Loan cancellation, UA 6,84 million by the Government and UA 0.56 million by 

the project beneficiaries. The project will be implemented over a six-year period. 

2. PROADER will directly affect 380,000 households in the 30 selected agricultural, 
forestry and pastoral basins, representing nearly 10% of households in the seven targeted 

provinces, or about 2 million people, of whom 50% are women and at least 40% are young 

people. The project will indirectly affect nearly 500,000 households or about 2.6 million people. 

The expected project benefits are the increase in rural household income, the reduction in chronic 

malnutrition among children under five, the increased share of the agricultural sector in the 

national Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and the enhanced resilience of rural households. 

3. Needs assessment: The Bank’s intervention is justified partly by the considerable 

investment needs of the DRC agricultural sector, which must be met to allow the actors of this 

sector to fully play their roles in the structural transformation of Congolese agriculture. The 

project area is replete with natural resources that offer value-adding opportunities with the 

potential to generate wealth for the rural economy. However, agricultural/rural development 

continues to face problems that hinder the dynamism of the rural economy and should, therefore, 

be given special attention. These problems include: (i) the low productivity of traditional 

subsistence farming systems characterised by shifting cultivation and slash-and-burn practices, the 

use of degenerated local seeds, rudimentary farming techniques and high vulnerability to climate 

change. According to the E-QUIBB 2016 survey, 1.8% of households use modern farming 

techniques and 0.8% have access to agricultural machinery; (ii) weak local governance leading to 

significant inadequacies in the planning and maintenance of basic infrastructure required for 

economic development; and (iii) lack of development opportunities for small- and medium-sized 

enterprises in occupational areas related to the development of agricultural and rural services. The 

formal request of the DRC Government was made to the Bank in March 2019. 

4. Bank’s value-added: The Bank’s value-added stems from its experience acquired 

through its interventions in the agricultural and rural sector. Bank intervention will consolidate the 

gains of Bank-financed rural development sector projects under which several rural infrastructure 

facilities were rehabilitated. It will also revive the rural sector, which was left in utter shambles by 

the conflicts. This project lays special emphasis on the establishment of a sustainable mechanism 

for the management and maintenance of rural infrastructure, including roads, with the building of 

the institutional and financial capacity of Decentralised Territorial Entities (ETDs) and the 

involvement of economic actors and the communities concerned. 



iii 

 

5. Knowledge building: PROADER will generate knowledge on the development of the 

rural economy in the DRC, including the challenges, methodologies and benefits of local planning, 

integrated water management, digitisation of farms and registration of producers, the public-

private-producer partnership (or 4P)1 and the financing of gender mainstreaming innovations. As 

part of knowledge management, an electronic library will be set up to store all relevant documents 

from the agricultural and rural sector, which will be accessible to stakeholders and the public. To 

this end, an inventory of best practices, identification of local knowledge and innovations will be 

carried out. This activity will be developed as part of institutional support to the Department of 

Studies and Planning (DEP) of the Ministry in charge of Rural Development. The project's 

monitoring and evaluation system and the gender-sensitive social and institutional communication 

strategy that will be developed will facilitate the production of information for dissemination to 

stakeholders, particularly through partner community radio stations. The knowledge generated by 

the project will help to fuel policy dialogues, support and improve the design of new projects.  

 

                                                 
1  A 4P is a cooperation arrangement between a government, entrepreneurs and small producers, who agree to work together to 

reach a common goal or perform a specific task, while jointly assuming the risks and responsibilities and sharing benefits, 

resources and skills. An illustration of a 4P is presented in Annex B.1.4, Volume II, of the Appraisal Report.

BANK GROUP MANAGEMENT’S REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION TO THE 

BOARD OF DIRECTORS CONCERNING A PROPOSAL TO GRANT A LOAN TO THE 

DEMOCRATIC DEVELOPMENT REPUBLIC OF CONGO TO FINANCE THE RURAL 

ECONOMY INTEGRATED DEVELOPMENT SUPPORT PROJECT (PROADER) 

 

Management hereby submits this report and its recommendation concerning a proposal to grant a 

Loan of UA 39.997.947 and a Grant of UA 2.100.000 from Loan cancellations to the Government 

of the Democratic Republic of Congo to finance the Rural Economy Integrated Development 

Support Project. 

I. STRATEGIC THRUST AND OBJECTIVES 

1.1. Project Linkages with Country Strategy and Objectives 

1.1.1 The project is consistent with the DRC's 2016-2021 Strategic Development Framework 

(SDF), which seeks to achieve economic and social development by diversifying the economy 

through: (i) agriculture and the agro-food chain; (i) forest exploitation, timber processing and 

marketing industries; (iii) mining; (iv) construction and building materials; (v) the tourism and 

hotel business; and (vi) financial services. The project is also aligned with the National 

Agricultural Investment Plan (PNIA) for 2014-2020, whose overall objective is to stimulate 

sustained annual growth of the agricultural sector by more than 6% - an essential prerequisite for 

reducing poverty, ensuring the people’s food security and nutrition, and sustainably generating 

jobs and income. PROADER is in line with the country's Decentralisation Policy, which 

empowers the Provinces and ETDs to plan and assume responsibility for the economic 

development of their communities and to become real drivers of development from the grassroots. 

According to the 1-2-3 Survey (2016), 63.4% of the population, or 46 million Congolese, live 

below the poverty line and close to three-quarters of them below the extreme poverty line. In 

terms of the human assets index (HAI) and the human development index (HDI), the DRC ranks 

146th out of 157 countries, with an HAI of 0.37 (2017), and 176th out of 189 countries with an HDI 

of 0.457 (2018). The country offers very few formal job opportunities and overall 

underemployment affects 85.7% of the workforce (82% of men and 89.7% of women).  

1.1.2  PROADER is consistent with the 2013-2017 Country Strategy Paper (CSP), extended 

respectively to the end of 2018 and the end of 2020, the two pillars of which are: (i) development 

of private investment and regional integration support infrastructure; and (ii) building central 

government’s capacity to increase public revenue and create an enabling framework for private 

investment. The project will help to strengthen the structural transformation of the rural and 

agricultural sector, which offers a real opportunity to diversify the country's economy and create 

jobs. The project design is in line with the Bank's "Feed Africa" strategy, which is based on the 

value chain approach and seeks to improve productivity and resilience by adopting technology 

through two flagship programmes: Technologies for African Agricultural Transformation (TAAT) 

and Africa Climate-Smart Agriculture (ACSA). PROADER is also aligned with youth 

employment strategies, including the “ENABLE YOUTH” initiative. Lastly, the project will help 

to strengthen women's economic empowerment, and thus dovetails with Pillar 2 of the Bank's 

Gender Strategy, which is based on women's economic empowerment. 

1.2. Rationale for Bank Intervention  

1.2.1. The development of agriculture and agribusiness is an economic diversification pillar of 

the Strategic Development Framework (SDF), aimed at the economic and social development of 

the DRC. The DRC abounds in natural resources, which offer opportunities for the creation of 

value-added that could lead to the generation of wealth for the rural economy. However, 

agricultural/rural development continues to be handicapped by: (i) the low productivity of 

traditional subsistence farming systems characterised by shifting cultivation and slash-and-burn 



2 

practices, the use of degenerated local seeds, rudimentary farming techniques and high 

vulnerability to climate change; (ii) weak local governance leading to notable inadequacies in the 

planning and maintenance of basic infrastructure required for economic development; and (iii) the 

lack of development opportunities for small- and medium-sized enterprises in occupational areas 

related to the development of agricultural and rural services.. Therefore, the project will help to 

strengthen the structural transformation of the agricultural and rural sector, which offers a real 

opportunity to diversify the country's economy and create jobs, especially for young people. It will 

support the improvement of agricultural productivity and the organisation of small producers to 

guarantee regular and appropriate supply for agro-industries located in the selected production 

basins and operating in the priority value chains of the targeted areas. Moreover, this intervention 

will enhance and consolidate the major gains of previous Bank-financed projects in terms of rural 

development sector infrastructure, and will thus promote the revival of a rural sector that was 

completely in tatters due to lack of investments and as a result of conflicts in the project areas. 

Furthermore, the Bank's intervention will help to strengthen social cohesion and reduce the 

fragility of the intervention area, which is the focus area of the operational activities of the current 

CSP. 

1.2.2. The agricultural and rural sector requires significant investments to enable all actors in 

the sector to fully play their role in the transformation of Congolese agriculture. In this context 

and as a result of its experiences gained through the implementation of its strategies for 

transforming agriculture, overcoming fragility and building resilience in Africa, the Bank enjoys a 

real comparative advantage as far as this intervention is concerned. 

1.3. Aid Coordination 

1.3.1. The activities of the DRC's development partners are coordinated through the Aid and 

Investment Management Platform (PGAI), hosted in the Ministry of Planning. Technical activities 

are discussed and planned in thematic groups, including the Inter-Donor Group for Agriculture 

and Rural Development (GIBADER). PROADER will develop synergies and complementarities 

with ongoing investment projects in the agricultural and rural sector financed by other donors, 

which include: (i) the Government-funded Agricultural Voluntary Programme (PVA); (ii) the 

PAPAKIN project, financed by IFAD; (iii) the Kwilu/Kwango Districts Agricultural Development 

Programme (PRODAKK) and the Kwilu/Kwango Access Improvement Programme (PRODEKK), 

financed by the Kingdom of Belgium and implemented by Enabel (former Belgian Technical 

Cooperation); and (iv) the World Bank-funded Growth Pole Development Project (PDPC) in the 

Western Region. Lastly, the project will scale up successful public-private-producer partnership 

initiatives in village palm oil value chains (with the private concern known as Huilerie, 

Plantations, Élevage du Kwango Kwilu - HPEK) (Kwango Kwilu Oil Mill, Plantations and 

Livestock Company), maize with STRATEGOS, cassava with two private concerns: Entreprise de 

Consultance et de Services Agricoles au Congo (Consultancy and Agricultural Services Enterprise 

in Congo) (ECOSAC) and LAYUKA. The project will support the country in mobilising climate 

funds. Lastly, an expected partnership with the next IFAD project that is being designed for 

Kassaï Oriental and Central will maximise the project impact. The following table provides a 

summary of the coordination of the agricultural sector.

2.2. Technical Solution Adopted and Alternatives Explored  

2.2.1 Participatory local development. In accordance with the Constitution of 18 February 

2006, which confers on Decentralised Territorial Entities (ETDs) the responsibility of planning 

and overseeing the economic development of their communities, EDTs are required to manage 

operational activities in their territory. In this context, they play a key role in establishing good 

local governance, facilitating the development of the rural economy and the maintenance of rural 

infrastructure. Under PROADER, preference will be given to the demand-driven approach and the 

strengthening of local project management. In this regard, project investments will not only be 

based on the needs clearly expressed by the actors within the context of the development of value 

chains, but must also support the development of the local economy and be linked to local 

development plans.  

2.2.2 Development of public-private-producer-partnership (4P)3: There are specialised private 

agricultural enterprises in the project intervention area that offer small producers various services, 

including mechanisation, improved input supply and agricultural advisory services. The project 

will adopt the "subcontracting" approach by delegating services related to the improvement of the 

                                                 
2  Including physical and financial contingencies. 
3  A 4P is a cooperation arrangement between a government, entrepreneurs and small producers, who agree to work together to reach a common 

goal or perform a specific task, while jointly assuming the risks and responsibilities, and sharing benefits, resources and skills.

agricultural productivity to specialise agricultural enterprises located in the production basins and 

operating in the targeted value chains. These enterprises will be responsible for supporting 

producers by: (i) providing agricultural advisory services (application of good farming practices), 

(ii) ensuring access to resilient and good quality agricultural inputs (improved seeds and cultivars, 

fertilisers, pesticides, etc.); (iii) purchasing the surplus marketable production from small 

producers and/or unions, following an aggregation model, at a fair price that takes into account the 

cost of production and the market price. Specialised private agricultural enterprises will also 

process raw products into finished and/or semi-finished products for sale on the local, national and 

international markets, which will create value-added in the basins with spin-offs on the rural 

economy in terms of job creation. Specialised private agricultural enterprises will be remunerated 

based on the work actually carried out after the quality of such work has been assessed by all the 

parties concerned (the project/the Government, the private operator and the union). In this regard, 

PROADER will sign partnership protocols/contracts with the following specialised agricultural 

enterprises: (i) Huilerie, Plantation, Élevage de Kwilu/Kwango (HPEC) (Kwilu/Kwango Oil Mill, 

Plantation, Livestock Company), headquartered in Kikwit (Kwilu Province), to support farmers' 

unions in the production of palm oil from the village oil palm plantation covering an area of 2,000 

hectares; (ii) STRATEGOS, headquartered in Lusanga, Kwilu Province, to support 10,000 

producers in maize production. Its intervention will cover 350 villages within a radius of about 50 

km of Lusanga on the right and left banks of the Kwilu River; (iii) LAYUKA, headquartered in 

Madimba, Kongo Central, to support 200 producer associations, representing about 5,000 

households, in cassava production; (iv) Consultance et des Services Agricoles (ECOSAC Sarl) 

(Consultancy and Agricultural Services), to support small producers in the production of cassava. 

This company is currently operating in Bukango Lonzo, Kwango Province, where it is 

headquartered, but plans to set up operations in Kikwit and Bandundu City (Kwilu Province) to 

support the activities of small-scale cassava producers.   

2.2.3 Youth skills development and innovation.: The project will set up a competitive 

mechanism for innovation and promotion of youth entrepreneurship in rural areas. It will finance 

an innovation fund to support entrepreneurs, young people and producer organisations (POs) with 

innovative ideas and initiatives for improving the quality of life and income in rural areas. These 

innovations could concern: (i) the development of new products or new markets; (ii) equipment 

tests and processes; (iii) the use of alternative energy; (iv) new environment-friendly technologies; 

(v) expertise in food quality and safety; (vi) the use of new information and communication 

technologies in the marketing and promotion of products, including fortified cassava flour; and 

(vi) the certification and labelling of processed products. Annual competitions will be held at the 

national level to identify ideas and initiatives with potential for large-scale impact. The innovation 

selection process will include the following steps: Phase A, preselection of the best ideas in 

agricultural value chains based on project profiles submitted by potential candidates; Phase B 

intended to (a) identify potential applications of the technology, (b) learn to recognise the 

market(s) targeted, (c) guide research and development (R&D) taking into account market needs, 

and (d) conduct a technical and commercial proof of concept, to validate the business model and 

design the business plan. By means of a stringent selection process, candidates with the greatest 
potential to succeed will be selected; and Phase C dealing with the funding and close 

support/coaching/mentoring of candidates whose innovations were selected. Individual technical 

assistance will be mobilised for the development of operational procedures based on similar 

successful experiments (Tony Elumelu Entrepreneurship Program, AgriPitch, the Competitive 

Fund for Agricultural Innovation of Côte d'Ivoire, etc.). Financial institutions, telecommunications 

sector operators and private concerns will be encouraged to co-invest in this fund, including 

through acquisition of stakes in the identified micro-, small- and medium-sized agricultural and 

rural enterprises (MPMEARs).

2.2.4 Promotion of community agroforestry: Various agroforestry models have already been 

tested in many African countries with positive results and trials have also been conducted 

successfully in the DRC. The agroforestry system model that will be promoted by the project is 

based on the association between food production (cassava and maize, plus legumes/beans and 

soya beans), fruit trees and charcoal production with Acacia auriculiformis as flagship species for 

soil fertilisation. The model chosen is based on the success of the Mampu Agroforestry Project 

funded by the European Commission, which covers an area of 8,000 hectares. Agroforestry will 

aim to: (i) increase cassava production and yield from 9 tonnes per hectare to 15 tonnes per 

hectare, for a total area of at least 10,000 ha, while slashing production costs by about 30%; (ii) 

increase maize production and yield from 1.5 t/ha to 3 t/ha, for a total area of at least 5,000 ha, 

while slashing production costs by about 25%; and (iii) increase farmers' income by at least 20%.    

2.2.5 Sustainability of investments. The opening up of production areas will mainly concern 

targeted rehabilitation consisting of treatment of critical points (quagmires, low-lying areas, water 

crossing points, steep-slope areas, etc.) to allow the year-round use of a given road section. The 

structures will be made of durable materials and sized in such a way as to allow the proper flow of 

water. The project will support the establishment and operationalisation of multifunctional service 

platforms (PMS) for the promotion of women's economic empowerment. Each platform will 

include a Gender Multifunctional Centre (CMG) for rural job training, awareness raising, 

managerial and leadership capacity building for women. Each infrastructure promoted and 

implemented by the project will be accompanied by a service package (maintenance system, 

technical training in the use and management of the infrastructure, etc.).

2.5. Project Area and Beneficiaries  

2.5.1 PROADER will carry out its operations in seven provinces, namely Kongo Central. 

Kwango, Kwilu, Maindombe, Kasaï, Kasaï Occidental and Kasaï Oriental. This area has 

enormous potential for agro-pastoral and fisheries production. It is the main supplier of staple 

foodstuffs to the country's major cities (Kinshasa, Lubumbashi, Mbuji-Mayi, Kananga, Kikwit and 

Matadi). Moreover, about 70% of the population of this area is rural, having agriculture and 

related activities as their main source of livelihood. With a total population estimated at 

19,558,3054, the project area accounts for nearly 25% of the DRC's total population and covers 

about 22% of the national territory. The project area is part of the Government's priority 

development areas, the more so since the corridor targeted by the project, including the central 

region, is one of the areas most severely affected by the humanitarian crisis in the DRC. 

2.5.2 This area is crossed by the railway and National Road No. 1 (RN 1), which are the part of 

the regional network connecting Kinshasa to Johannesburg in South Africa. Until now, this vast 

territory did not enjoy the benefits of cross-border trade because of its isolation. The operations 

currently being carried out by the Bank on RN1 in coordination with other technical and financial 

partners (TFPs), in particular the European Union, for the extension of this road up to Mbuji-

Mayi, and the World Bank, for the rehabilitation of the Ilebo-Lubumbashi railway, will help to 

open up this major corridor. The project’s intervention area is a continuation of the Bank's 

previous operations in the agricultural and rural development sector in the Central Region and 

Kongo Central.   

2.5.3. Beneficiaries. The Project will target mainly small family farms, producer organisations 

(POs) and their unions, cooperatives and micro-, small- and medium-sized agricultural and rural 

enterprises (MPMEARs) upstream and downstream of the production chain. Of all these actors, 

special attention will be given to women, young people and MPMEARs owned by young people 

and women. The other PROADER beneficiaries are the EDTs, central and devolved State public 

entities, and specialised private agricultural enterprises operating in the targeted production basins 

that not only provide support services, including agricultural extension services and inputs, but 

also add value through the processing of agricultural products. PROADER will directly affect 

380,000 households in the 30 targeted agricultural, forestry and pastoral basins, representing 

nearly 10% of households in seven targeted provinces, or about 2 million people, of whom 50% 

women and 40% young people. Indirectly, the project will affect some 500,000 households or 

about 2.6 million people. PROADER will primarily target young people and women, by 

increasing employment opportunities and income from production and processing activities, 

supporting the development of agricultural entrepreneurship in activities related to production 

(ploughing service, transport, road maintenance, processing, marketing, etc.) and providing 

appropriate advisory support. 

2.6.  Participatory Approach for the Project Identification, Design and Implementation  

2.6.1 The project was designed using a participatory approach based on consultations with the 

various stakeholders throughout the formulation process. In this context, the Secretariat General 

for Rural Development set up a multidisciplinary team of national experts who worked closely 

with Bank experts during the project preparation and appraisal phases. The consultations included 

the Ministries of Rural Development, Agriculture, Decentralisation, Planning, Gender, Child and 

Family, Small- and Medium-sized Enterprises and Technical and Vocational Training, the private 

sector, represented by the Federation of Congolese Enterprises (FEC), non-governmental 

organisations, producer umbrella organisations, producers and processors of agricultural products, 

individually or in association, political and administrative authorities as well as devolved technical

services in the project area, private agricultural operators, ETDs, project managers, specialised 

private agricultural enterprises, microcredit institutions, and several NGO-led initiatives in the 

agricultural and rural development sector.   

2.6.2 These consultations, among other things, helped to identify and more clearly define: (i) 

production basins and priority sectors; (ii) market dynamics and trade flows; (iii) business and 

value-adding opportunities in value chains; (iv) previous project operations; (v) the business 

regulatory environment; constraints to the involvement and effective/proper private sector 

participation; (vi) innovations and technologies for the improvement of production and 

processing; (vii) the involvement and aspirations of women and young people in value chains and; 

(viii) experiences and constraints regarding access to funding, especially on a medium- and long-

term basis, for agricultural and rural development ventures, agribusiness and MPMEARs. 

Stakeholder consultations will continue during project implementation to ensure effective 

implementation and the sustainability of interventions.   

2.7. Consideration of Bank Group Experience and Lessons Learned in the  Project Design 

2.7.1. The portfolio performance as of 31 December 2018 is generally satisfactory, with a rating 

of 3 on a scale of 1 to 4. The average portfolio age increased from 3.8 years in 2017 to 4.4 years as 

of 31 December 2018. The national portfolio does not include any project-at-risk (PAR). 

Regarding the agricultural and rural sector in the DRC, the operations carried out over the past 

five years relate to: (i) the financing of the Rural Infrastructure Development Support Project 

(PADIR), scheduled to close on 31 December 2019. PADIR’s physical implementation rate is 

nearly 98%, with a disbursement rate of 92%. The project has made significant gains in the 

rehabilitation of rural roads (1,300 km) as well as the building of several other rural infrastructure 

facilities leading to the revival of the rural sector that was completely moribund; (ii) new projects 

including the Youth Entrepreneurship in Agriculture and Agri-Business Project, targeting young 

graduates and the Agricultural Value Chain Project in six provinces, which focuses on the 

dissemination of agricultural technologies developed by TAAT programme compacts. Recurrent 

problems have been highlighted by lessons learned from previous projects and the portfolio 

performance, including: (a) difficulty in ensuring the timely fulfilment of conditions precedent to 

loan effectiveness and first disbursement, (b) delays in the procurement process, with a negative 

impact on overall disbursement, and (iii) weak empowerment of beneficiaries of rural 

development projects. 

2.7.2. These weaknesses are addressed in the revised Portfolio Improvement Plan (PAP) 

2018/2019. Hence, the project design takes these lessons into account through: (i) support for local 

participatory development in terms of building the capacity of local actors in project planning and 

management; and (ii) encouragement of sustainable partnerships between public and private actors 

and producers to improve access to agricultural and rural services. Furthermore, the Bank will 

strengthen its presence on the ground to facilitate the close monitoring process. In addition, the 

project will draw lessons from the report of the internal audit conducted by the Bank in 2017 on 

projects financed in Central Africa, especially as concerns delays in the submission of audit 

reports and the low level of implementation of the environmental and social management plans.    

2.7.3 The project has taken into consideration the lessons learned from IDEV's assessment of 

the Bank’s support for the development of agricultural value chains (AVC)5, which recommends 

the following basic principles, among others: (i) analyse the entire value chain; (ii) develop a 

strategy to ensure inclusion; (iii) maintain the ability to adapt to market developments; (iv) think 

in terms of profitability with value-added; and (v) establish plans for creating a sustainable impact. 

Accordingly, the project design capitalised on the guidelines of the sub-regional forum on the

revitalisation of the rural economy in Central Africa, jointly organised by the Bank and the 

International Labour Office (ILO) in February 2019 in Brazzaville. These are: (a) increase 

investment and attractiveness of rural areas, (b) promote an integrated training and skills 

development system to address the challenges of innovative agriculture, (c) diversify the rural 

economy through the development of rural occupations and opportunities in rural areas, and (d) 

develop skills and approaches that take into account the crisis and resilience context. 

2.8. Key Performance Indicators 

2.8.1. PROADER’s impact indicators are: (a) improvement of farm household income from less 

than USD 2,000/year in 2018 to USD 3,500/year in 2025; and (b) reduction of chronic 

malnutrition rate among children under 5 in rural areas from 43% in 2019 to 38% in 2025 The 
project is expected to produce the following outcomes: (i) increase of the percentage of the 

population in targeted basins with access to all-season roads from 25 to 60%; (ii) improvement of 

the rate of access to mechanisation from 0.8 to 10%; (iii) increase of the percentage of the budget 

allocated by ETDs for the maintenance of access roads to production basins from 0 to 10%; (iv) 

improvement of the rate of rural women’s access to technological innovations in agriculture from 

0 to 30%; (v) improvement of the productivity of the following main crops: maize - from 0.8 to 2 

t/ha ; cassava - from 8 to 20 t/ha; palm nuts - from 2.5 to 20 t/ha/year; (vi) 40% increase in 

additional marketed volume; (vii) reduction of post-harvest losses from 30% to 20% for cassava 

and from 25% to 10% for maize; (viii) improvement from 8.4% to 20% the percentage of children 

between 6 and 23 months with a minimum acceptable diet; (ix) improvement of the rural women 

empowerment index from 1 to 3 (scale of 1 = low and 5 = high). The project’s detailed baseline 

situation, including the environmental and social baseline situation, will also be prepared by 

capitalising on the results of the household surveys to be conducted at the completion of PADIR in 

collaboration with the National Institute of Statistics (INS). To assess the progress achieved, 

surveys will be carried out at mid-term and at project completion in the same areas (project and 

buffer areas where the baseline surveys were conducted). 

III –  PROJECT FEASIBILITY 

3.1. Economic and Financial Performance 

3.1.1. Financial performance was assessed for four (4) typical model farms and enterprises that 

produce cassava, maize and palm nuts, and carry out cassava processing operations, reflecting the 

range of activities that the project plans to support. Financial analysis shows that these 

investments will lead to a substantial increase in the net profits of farms and enterprises, which 

means that the PROADER-supported activities will be profitable. As indicated by Table 3.1 below, 

these results show that the project support will improve the financial performance of farms, 

cooperatives, micro, small- and medium-sized agricultural and rural enterprises (MPMEARs) 

engaged in the production, processing and marketing of these food products.   

3.1.2. Financial analysis: Based on the above assumptions, the financial analysis generated a 

net present value of USD 86.4 million and a financial internal return rate (FIRR) of 18%, meaning 

that the project is financially feasible.  

3.1.3.  Economic analysis: The economic analysis was carried out using the same approach as for 

the financial analysis, which consisted in analysing the benefits generated by the farms and 

enterprises concerned, based on the reference prices of the tradable goods and the total project 

cost. The results of the economic analysis show that the benefits of the project are positive.  The 

project's economic return rate (ERR) is 19% and the net present value (NPV) is estimated at USD 

95.5 million. However, these benefits should be higher if account is taken of the unquantifiable 

gains derived from nutritional and financial education, access to clean water, sanitation, women's 

economic empowerment and improved accessibility of production areas. Nutritional education and 



11 

access to clean water will help to improve the health condition of households, which would result 

in improved labour productivity of household assets and a reduction in household medical 

expenses, among other benefits. Access to road infrastructure will not only increase the volume of 

marketed production but would also facilitate access to health and education services for 

beneficiaries. The improvement in the curriculum of technical and vocational training centres will 

enable the latter to offer young people quality training tailored to the needs of the job market.  

Sensitivity analysis confirms the strength of the project’s positive economic effects and impacts.

3.2.  Environmental and Social Impacts 

Environment 

3.2.1 The project is proposed for classification in Category 2 of the Bank's Integrated 

Safeguards System (ISS) and the Bank’s Climate Safeguard System, equivalent to Category B at 

the national level, although at this stage of preparation most of the sites and activities are yet to be 

determined. The activities under project component 2 are likely to have adverse impacts on the 

environment, namely: (i) the production of pollution and waste during infrastructure construction 

works; (ii) the production of pollution and waste during the processing of value chain products; 

(iii) the risks of land and water pollution by agrochemicals, endangering the health of users; (iv) 

the risk of plant and wildlife degradation during the operation of quarries and borrow pits for 

construction works; (v) the risk of accidents at construction sites and on the sites of processing 

units, and (vi) the risk of spread of communicable diseases on the sites.   

3.2.2 However, the expected negative impacts will be limited in scope and time. The "capacity 

building" component will contribute significantly to strengthen local governance and the ongoing 

decentralisation process, and to reduce conflicts over the use of natural resources (IWRM 

approach/support for the promotion of the green economy and the blue economy). The IWRM-

associated blue economy promotes the conservation of aquatic ecosystems, as well as the use and 

sustainable management of their resources. Given their nature, the planned activities are certainly 

not likely to generate any negative impacts or major risks, or lead to any significant asset losses or 

displacement. However, the building of certain production and processing support infrastructure 

facilities, depending on their size and the situation of the host environment, is likely to affect the 

environment, and possibly cause negative impacts on the biophysical and human ecosystems if 

preventive or mitigation measures are not considered at this project design stage and during 

implementation.   

3.2.3 Given that the siting and environmental and social characteristics of all investments are 

not known, an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) has been prepared in 

accordance with the requirements of the Bank's Integrated Safeguards System. The ESMF 

indicates the mitigation and management procedures and measures that will need to be 

implemented by the project once the sites and sub-projects are known. These measures are 

described in the Environmental and Social Management Framework Plan (ESMFP) and comprise, 

among others, sub-project analysis and screening procedures, consultation, communication and 

conflict management procedures; environmental and social management plans (ESMPs) and 

environmental and social clauses that should be included in competitive bidding documents and 

sub-project implementation contracts, forest and wetland management guidelines, and pesticide 

and pest management guidelines. The project activities will have many positive impacts on both 

the local communities and the environment. Thus, the participatory approach involving local 

communities in the rehabilitation of access facilitation infrastructure, the dissemination of more 



12 

sustainable and climate-smart agricultural practices, including community agroforestry, and the 

reduction of post-harvest losses, will enhance the resilience of the livelihoods of rural households, 

restore soil fertility and increase tree cover, thereby significantly reducing greenhouse gas 

emissions.   

3.2.4 Functions relating to environmental safeguard measures will include: (i) the screening of 

sub-projects and identification of their category based on the environmental and social selection 

sheets; (ii) the recruitment of firms/consultants for the ESMP preparation after validation of the 

process by the Directorate General of the Environment; (iii) the inclusion of environmental clauses 

in the process of recruiting works implementation contractors; (iv) monitoring and evaluation of 

the implementation of sub-projects; and (vi) audit coordination. The entire environmental and 

social function needs to be strengthened within the institutions involved in project 

implementation. Furthermore, measures should be adopted to support institutional and technical 

measures, training and awareness-raising in order to build the capacity of structures and human 

resources that will be set up. Such measures will aim to: (a) operationalise the PROADER Project 

environmental management strategy, (b) foster the emergence of local expertise and professionals 

in environmental and social management, (c) raise the level of professional consciousness and 

accountability among employees in production enterprises, and (d) protect the urban and rural 

environment and the health and safety of beneficiary communities. 

3.2.5. Consultations were held in the context of the ESMF at various phases of the project 

preparation and participants' observations were incorporated into the Environmental and Social 

Management Framework (ESMF). The ESMF was validated by the Bank's Safeguards Department 

and published on 2 October 20196.  

Climate Change  

3.2.6 The impacts of climate change can be seen in the DRC through the persistence of high 

temperatures, heavy rains, land degradation (particularly gully erosion), the prolonged dry season, 

increased sequences of dry spells during the rainy season, and floods, among others. Given that 

agriculture remains rain-fed, these phenomena exacerbate the vulnerability of the rural population. 

More frequent and longer seasonal droughts lead to disruptions in agricultural calendars. In terms 

of agricultural production, these climatic disturbances should have a direct impact on food 

security, which is already precarious for a large majority of the Congolese population. The project 

will contribute to the resilience of communities and ecosystems by improving the living 

conditions and food and nutrition security of rural communities. This is in line with the country's 

nationally determined contribution (NDC) in respect of climate change, which targets a 17% 

reduction in greenhouse gas emissions over the period 2021 to 2030. The project is classified 

under Category 2 of the Bank's Climate Safeguards System. Activities financed under PROADER 

will strengthen the resilience of ecosystems and communities to climate change by improving 

production systems, limiting the practice of extensive farming, restoring ecosystems through the 

application of good agricultural practices, institution building on climate change and green 

growth, and capacity building on climate change. The project plugs into the Bank's Climate 

Change Action Plan and contributes to domestic climate financing through the activities under 

Component 2. 

Gender 

3.2.7. The project is classified under Gender Category 27 of the Bank's Gender Marker System 

(GMS), since it will help to narrow the gender gap in terms of access to factors of production,

7  A project is classified in Gender Category 2, when gender equality (GE) and/or economic empowerment (EE) is one of the project outputs, but 

not the main one. PROADER is in this situation.

knowledge, innovation and income improvement. Women, who make up about 50% of Congo's 

population and 70% of the agricultural workforce, account for 80% of food crop production, 22% 

of commercial agriculture, and nearly 90% of agricultural processing, are more severely affected 

by poverty. Therefore, the project's targeting strategy takes this into account and will ensure that at 

least 50% of women benefit from project activities. The project will mobilise nearly USD 5 

million to finance (i) the construction and equipment of gender-specific multi-service platforms 

for rural women. These platforms will act as multipurpose incubators for technical and 

entrepreneurial capacity building, learning, advocacy and female leadership; (ii) the organisation 

of foras and exchange trips; and (iii) the promotion of essential activities in the areas of nutrition, 

hygiene and sanitation. Hence, the project will help to enhance the economic empowerment of 

women in the project area through a series of integrated actions, including building their capacity 

in that area of activity, establishing sustainable agricultural production systems, providing access 

to inputs in production basins and markets, easing their work and setting up a framework tailored 

to the conditions of women farmers. As much as possible monitoring indicators will be gender 

disaggregated to take gender aspects into account.   

3.2.8. In addition to the gender and age disaggregation of indicators, gender-specific indicators 

are included in the results-based logical framework for measuring women's empowerment index in 

agriculture. This index measures the increase in women's capacity to make strategic life choices in 

their households and communities, focusing on five areas of agricultural empowerment: (i) 

production (women's role in decision-making in the household context regarding agricultural 

production); (ii) resources (women's access to productive capital, access to and decision-making 

on credit); (iii) control over the use of income; (iv) leadership and individual influence of women 

in the community; and (v) time allocation for women. This index will be used as a diagnostic tool 

and as a monitoring indicator to measure the project’s impact on women's empowerment.   

Social 

3.2.9. The project will strengthen food and nutrition security, especially for children under five, 

and promote the creation of local employment opportunities. It will help to reduce poverty and the 

vulnerability of communities, while decreasing unemployment and the exodus of young people 

particularly through the development of 300 micro-, small- and medium-sized agricultural and 

rural enterprises in agricultural and rural occupations (product processing, manufacture of 

equipment and material, maintenance of agricultural equipment and machinery, supply of 

production factors, including inputs, etc.). PROADER will contribute to the enhancement of local 

governance through institution and capacity building for ETDs, as well as to the economic 

empowerment of women who, with their rising literacy rates, should be able to improve their 

participation in household decision-making concerning production, in addition to increasing their 

power over the distribution of household income. The project will improve access to socio-

economic services through the construction of about 100 social infrastructure facilities that will be 

identified in a participatory manner. As far as young people are concerned, they will be offered 
specific benefits through (i) the establishment and support of youth-oriented micro-, small- and 

medium-sized agricultural enterprises and the setting up of a competitive fund for innovation and 

promotion of youth entrepreneurship and agricultural start-ups; and (ii) the improvement of the 

skills and employability of young people.   

Forced Resettlement  

3.2.10. PROADER activities will not entail land acquisition or the forced resettlement of people 

and/or restriction of their access to resources or livelihoods. In terms of transformative 

infrastructure, the project will adopt an intervention approach that emphasises the participation 

and empowerment of sector and local community actors at all stages of implementation (from the 

planning of activities to the completion of works). Requests for support should come from ETDs 

or producer unions/cooperatives. The sites for infrastructure, such as markets and other buildings, 



14 

will be owned by ETDs or communes that will be responsible for their management and 

maintenance. The rehabilitation of agricultural feeder roads will be on an ad hoc basis and will 

focus on critical points (quagmires, low-lying areas, watercourse crossing points, steep-slope 

areas, etc.) with maximum reliance on local participation. The project will establish local and 

provincial complaint management committees that will also initiate and supervise the payment of 

any compensation that may be payable for the degradation of an asset or restricted access to a 

resource because of project activities. Financial allocation for these compensations will be 

provided for in the ESMP, particularly for infrastructure construction or rehabilitation sub-

projects.   

IV. IMPLEMENTATION 

4.1. Implementation Arrangements 

4.1.1 The project will be under the supervisory authority of the Ministry of Rural Development 

(MDR). PROADER will be managed by the existing Steering Committee (COPIL) responsible for 

agricultural and rural sector projects and programmes. COPIL will be expanded to include 

Secretaries-General of the Ministries in charge of Decentralisation, Planning and Land Affairs. 

COPIL shall meet at least twice a year and shall be mandated to: (i) review and approve the annual 

work plans and budgets (AWPBs) prepared by the project; (ii) review half-yearly, annual and mid-

term review and project completion reports; (iii) ensure that the activities of sector-based 

programmes/projects are in line with project objectives; (iv) review progress towards achieving 

project objectives; (v) facilitate the coordination of project activities carried out by the various 

entities involved in the implementation; and (vi) analyse the risks and obstacles related to the 

project implementation and formulate the necessary guidelines for achieving the expected 

outcomes.   

4.1.2 The Project Management Unit (PMU). On the operational front, PROADER will be 

anchored to the Directorate of Rural Economy, whose capacity will be strengthened by the project. 

This Directorate will be strengthened by the establishment of a Project Management Unit that will 

comprise a national coordination unit and three branches covering the three targeted economic 

hubs. To that effect, the Ministry of Rural Development will nominate the following staff: (i) 

Director of Rural Economic, Project Coordinator; (ii) Administrative and Financial Director 

(DAF) of the Ministry of Rural Development; (iii) Accountant; (iv) Monitoring and Evaluation 

Expert; (v) National Expert in Procurement; (vi) Administrative and Financial Assistant; (vii) 

Bookkeeper; and (viii) two drivers.  The qualifications and experience of the nominated staff 

should be prior acceptable by the Bank. The management tools (financial management software, 

database, etc.) that were developed in the context of the PADIR project and are already in use, as 

well as the monitoring and evaluation, financial management and accounting team will be 

capitalised on. The PMU will: (i) ensure inter-sector coordination; (ii) monitor the implementation 

of the recommendations of COPIL deliberations, the recommendations of audit, portfolio review 

and mid-term review reports; and (iii) oversee the fiduciary management of the project and 

undertake all other matters deemed of its competence.   

4.1.3 The PMU team will be strengthened by a project manager with sound knowledge of 

agricultural development and private sector issues, working under the authority of the Director of 

Rural Economy; an accountant and an assistant accountant working under the supervision of the 

Administrative and Financial Directorate (DAF) of the Ministry of Rural Development, a 

procurement expert who will be under the supervision of the Procurement Unit of the Ministry of 

Rural Development, a monitoring and evaluation expert (RPSE) and an IT specialist/database 

manager, a communication expert (RCOM), a skills development and entrepreneurship expert, 

who will also cover the woman’s empowerment component, a rural engineer, an environmental 

and climate change expert, and the necessary support staff (cashier, secretary, drivers, guards, 

etc.). The PMU will work directly with the Technical Directorates of the Ministries involved in 



15 

the project implementation. Each technical directorate will designate a focal point for the 

operational monitoring of the technical implementation of the component falling within its 

jurisdiction.   

4.1.4 Departmental branch offices. Three project branch offices will be established to cover 

the targeted provinces. They will be located in Matadi, Kikwit and Mbuji Mayi. Provincial Rural 

Development Inspectors will be the project focal points in each province. The provincial branches 

will be responsible for: (i) coordinating the project at the provincial level and establishing links 

with local authorities; (ii) developing the annual work plan and budget (AWPB), ensuring the 

monitoring and evaluation of AWPB-related activities at the provincial level and drafting progress 

reports; (iii) providing technical support for the implementation of the project’s technical 

components; (iv) monitoring and ensuring close supervision of the implementation of project 

activities and service providers; (v) participating in the tripartite (Government/private 

sector/producers) evaluation of agreements and service providers’ performance contracts; (vi) 

mobilising actors involved in the implementation of operations; and (vii) developing synergies and 

partnerships across their area of intervention. Each branch office will be headed by a Branch 

Manager and will comprise an expert specialised in one of the three sectors (animal, plant and 

fisheries), a capacity strengthening and gender expert, a decentralisation and local governance 

expert, an accounting assistant, a monitoring officer, a procurement assistant with expertise in 

civil or rural engineering, and support staff.   

 

4.1.5 The Project Manager and technical staff will be recruited based on an open invitation to 

bid, and following the Bank’s opinion concerning the recruitment report. The Secretary-General 

for Rural Development will set up an inter-ministerial recruitment commission for the assessment 

of applications. PMU staff will sign annual contracts, renewable if their performance is deemed 

satisfactory, following the annual evaluation. The evaluation of staff performance will be based on 

the following criteria: (i) disbursement rate; (ii) quality of the implementation of the components; 

(iii) compliance with good governance and transparency requirements; and (iv) the AWPB 

implementation rate. The Project Manager will be evaluated by the Director of Rural Economy, 

while the rest of the staff will be evaluated by the Project Manager.   

4.1.6 Technical assistance and start-up support: The experience and lessons learned from 

project implementation in the DRC highlight three major constraints: (i) delays in project start-up; 

(ii) weakness of implementation teams and operators; and (iii) bureaucracy surrounding the 

procurement process. To accelerate the implementation of PROADER, technical assistance from 

the Department of Rural Economy of the International Labour Office (ILO) in Turin will be 

mobilised. The ILO's technical assistance will focus on the preparation of planning and 

management tools for the rural economy of EDTs targeted in the context of DRC’s 

decentralisation. Therefore, pre-start-up activities should now be initiated. These activities 

include: (i) launching the technical staff recruitment competitive process; (ii) updating the 

administrative, financial and accounting procedures manual and the project implementation, 

monitoring and evaluation manual; (iii) preparing competitive bidding documents for the 

procurement of equipment and materials; (iv) raising awareness among stakeholders and preparing 

the AWPB and the Procurement Plan for the first 18 months of project implementation; (v) 

preparing partnership contracts with private specialised agricultural enterprises and agreements 

with various technical departments and services involved. The implementation of these activities 

can be supported by technical assistance. Expenditures relating to these activities will be 

coordinated by the Secretary-General for Rural Development and covered by PADIR resources. 

Moreover, the Bank, acting through the PADIR and PRISE projects, had recruited technical 

assistance services for procurement and financial management, one of whose missions was to 

build the capacity of national counterparts. Hence, the MDR has competent services and qualified 

financial management and procurement officers. In accordance with the Paris Declaration, these 



16 

structures will support the project in their areas of expertise, to ensure ownership of the project by 

these public entities.    

Arrangements for the Procurement of Goods, Works and Services  

4.1.7 Procurement of all goods and services through international bid invitations, as well as the 

use of consultants financed from Bank resources will be conducted in accordance with the Bank's 

Procurement Policy for Bank Group-Funded Operations, dated October 2015, using appropriate 

standard Bank bidding documents and in accordance with the project financing agreement clauses. 

In accordance with the Bank policy and in the light of several evaluations conducted, it was 

convened that: (a) works for agriculture, rural, social infrastructure and for the rehabilitation of 

administrative building as well as diverse goods, vehicles, and material for project management 

unit, provincial offices and local government offices, will be procured using national procurement 

system as stipulated in law 10/010 of April 2010 for public procurement; (b) all other works and 

goods different from the above will be procured in accordance with Bank’s procurement policy. 

Procurement of goods and works through national bid invitations will be carried out in accordance 

with national procurement legislation, using the country's standard bidding documents and the 

provisions set out in the financing agreement. A procurement plan for the first 18 months was 

prepared by the Government during the appraisal mission and will be regularly updated 

throughout the project implementation period. The procurement arrangements are detailed in the 

technical annex. 

4.1.8 Evaluation of Risks and Capacities in Procurement (ERCA).  In order to take into 

account project specificities, the bank evaluated: (i) the risks at national, sectoral and project 

levels; and (ii) the capacity of the implementing entity.  The results of these evaluations concluded 

that the risk level is substantial for the procurement under the project. Nevertheless, appropriate 

risks mitigation measures have been proposed in the technical appendix to ensure a satisfactory 

project execution.    

4.1.9.   Particular Modalities related to the Utilisation of National System. The use of national 

procurement system requires the setup of particular measures to allow the bank to continue 

ensuring its fiduciary responsibility even in this case.  These measures are described in paragraphs 

B.5.7 of technical appendix B5 and consist of the following aspects: (i) eligibility; (ii) audit of 

public procurement; (iii) complains management; (iv) publication of bid results; (v) control of 

reasonable price; and (vi) reports.    

Financial Management and Disbursement Arrangements  

4.1.10 The Bank's decision on whether to use the national public finance management (PFM) 

system or otherwise was reviewed based on: (i) the assessment of the country's PFM performance; 

(ii) the Bank’s guidelines, practices and risk tolerance; and (iii) other factors such as perception of 

the governance and corruption levels. This review indicates that the level of risk, as assessed under 

CSP 2013-2020, does not allow the Bank to adopt an approach based exclusively on national 

public financial management procedures and systems. However, the reforms initiated by the 

Government have provided the Secretariat General for Rural Development (SGDR) with an 

operational administrative and financial directorate, as per Decree No. 15/043, which 

decentralised public expenditure authorisation centres through the establishment of the 

Administrative and Financial Directorate (DAF). The assessment of the capacity of the Ministry of 

Rural Development was carried out in accordance with the Bank's policy, based on lessons from 

implementing the PADIR and PRISE projects. The fiduciary risk of PROADER’s financial 

management is deemed substantial. The financial management arrangements proposed to support 

the Project Management Unit (PMU) meet the Bank's minimum requirements, as defined by the 

policy on “financial management of projects financed by the African Development Bank”, issued 

in February 2014. The arrangements will help to improve the financial management of the project 



17 

through the risk mitigation measures agreed in the financial management action plan detailed in 

annex. These measures will maintain the fiduciary risk at a moderate level and provide, with 

reasonable assurance, reliable financial information consistent with the Bank's minimum 

requirements. 

4.1.11 The financial management system will rely on the DAF, which will be strengthened with 

the management tools acquired from previous projects, especially from the PADIR project 

currently drawing to a close. At the time of the mission, only the PRISE project regularly 

submitted audit reports deemed acceptable by the Bank. The DAF will be strengthened by 

bringing on board financial staff (accountant, assistant accountant, treasurer) dedicated entirely to 

PROADER. This directorate will oversee financial and accounting operations related to the 

financial and accounting management of the project and will co-sign payment requests and 

documents. This approach allows the Ministry of Rural Development, through the conduct of 

PROADER activities, to mobilise the counterpart resources to be used for local economic 

development, as well as ensure the effective management of external resources. The project will 

contribute to the training of DAF executives in the area of planning/programming and budgeting, 

financial management of development operations, monitoring of audits and financial supervision.   

4.1.12 Annual audits of project loan resources will be performed by the Court of Auditors, 

which will include PROADER's audit missions in its annual work programme. The Court of 

Auditors may be assisted by an external auditor whose recruitment will devolve on the PMU, in 

accordance with the terms of reference in force at the Bank. Audited financial statements will be 

forwarded (see table for frequency) to the Bank latest six months after the close of the fiscal year 

concerned. The capacity of the Court of Auditors will be strengthened to enable it to include audit 

missions of Bank-funded projects in its annual programmes while undertaking to forward reports 

of financial years to the Bank on schedule. A portion of the loan resources will be allocated to 

expenses related to missions that would be carried out for PROADER and other Bank-financed 

projects. The terms of reference of audit missions should be those in force at the Bank, which may 

be used subject to obtaining the Bank’s prior opinion.   

4.1.13 The planned disbursements from the loan resources will be made in accordance with the 

Bank's Disbursement Handbook upon effectiveness of the Loan Agreement and fulfilment of 

conditions precedent to first disbursement. Generally, three methods are used for the disbursement 

of funds at the Bank: (i) the direct payment method; (ii) the working capital or special account 

method; and (iii) the reimbursement method. A disbursement letter specifying project-specific 

disbursement arrangements will be negotiated between the Bank and the Borrower. Two special 

accounts will be opened in Kinshasa, of which one is to receive the loan resources intended for the 

financing of working capital needs and a second one to receive the loan resources intended for the 

financing of community activities. In addition, the Ministry of Finance will authorize the project 

to open sub-account for each PROADER provincial branch.    

4.2.  Monitoring  

4.2.1. The PMU will assume primary responsibility for the internal monitoring of activity 

implementation and the ensuing impacts. It will prepare quarterly and annual progress reports 

focused on the analysis of the technical (outputs, outcomes and impact) and financial outcomes 

relative to the AWPB forecasts and the progress towards achieving the final result. Information 

will be tapped from monitoring and evaluation tools (manual, database of household surveys 

conducted in the context of PADIR with the support of the National Institute of Statistics). 

Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) will include internal monitoring (implementation monitoring), 

external monitoring (outcomes and impact monitoring, and participatory evaluation and planning) 

and should enable the identification of problems, risks and measures taken to mitigate them, and 

the evaluation of the performance of project actors. The implementation manuals and the PADIR 

monitoring and evaluation system (including the manual, the database and the geographic 



18 

information system) will be updated and/or developed to take the specific features of PROADER 

into account.   

4.2.2. Half-yearly external monitoring missions under the leadership of the MDR Secretariat 

General, comprising three to four COPIL members and to whom may be added other experts as 

necessary, will be fielded prior to the holding of COPIL meetings. At the provincial level, under 

the coordination of Provincial Rural Development Inspectorates, quarterly monitoring missions 

will be carried out with the participation of other relevant provincial technical services. These 

missions are intended to review the progress of the project, evaluate its performance and the 

quality of its management and achievements and, if necessary, propose adjustments in 

consultation with the Bank.  All monitoring mission reports should be attached to the project 

progress report. A focal point of the Ministry of Environment in Kinshasa will be involved in the 

coordination of environmental and social safeguard activities. In addition to the close monitoring 

that will be carried out by the Bank's Country Office in the DRC (COCD), the Bank will also keep 

an eye on the project through half-yearly supervision missions leading to the preparation of aide-

memoires, reports on implementation progress and results (IPR), using the Bank’s template. These 

aide-memoires and IPR reports will be used to rate the overall project performance and conduct 

the project’s annual external technical and financial audits. 

4.3. Governance  

4.3.1. According to the 2017 Mo Ibrahim Index of African Governance (IIAG), the DRC 

ranked 47th out of 54 countries, with a score of 32.1 out of 100. Scoring 20 on a scale ranging 

from 0 (very corrupt) to 100 (very clean), the DRC ranked 161st out of 180 countries in 

Transparency International’s 2018 global Corruption Perception Index, representing a loss of 2 

spots compared with the 2015 raking. In addition, according to the Bank's Country Policy and 

Institutional Assessment (CPIA), the country's overall governance rating stagnated at 3.2 between 

2013 and 2015, before declining to 3.1 in 2016 and 3.07 in 2018. The public finance management 

reform process initiated since 2008 has led to: (i) the adoption of a Public Finance Reform 

Strategic Plan and a Public Finance Organic Law (LOFIP) introducing the results-based budget 

system; and (ii) the setting up of a Steering Committee for Public Finance Reform (COREF).   

4.3.2. The risks of poor governance related to this project mainly concern the procurement and 

implementation process. This risk will be mitigated by: (i) the presence of a senior procurement 

expert in the Project Management Unit (PMU) and three procurement assistants at the provincial 

branch offices; (ii) the holding of information, training and technical assistance sessions with the 

PMU, decentralised territorial entities and procurement committees, to allow better ownership of 

the Bank's procurement procedures; (iii) the existence of an administrative, financial and 

accounting procedures manual and a community procurement manual; (iv) ex-ante or ex-post 

control of the different stages of the procurement process; and (v) supervision and financial audits 

of the project. Furthermore, the DRC Country Office (COCD) will provide continuous support in 

procurement, contract and financial management. In addition, the participatory approach to local 

development with the involvement of ETDs, the private sector, non-governmental organisations 

and beneficiaries in the steering and implementation of activities will promote citizen control, 

thereby guaranteeing good governance.   

4.4. Sustainability  

4.4.1. The probability of sustaining and even scaling up the project’s gains in the long term is 

high. The sensitivity tests of the economic and financial analysis show that the project remains 

profitable despite the fall in profits, the escalation of input prices and the drop in commodity 

prices. The sustainability of investments and expected benefits is based on the existence of an 

institutional framework for rural infrastructure piloting and management, as well as participatory 

and entrepreneurial capacity-building approaches. Regarding rural infrastructure, especially rural 



19 

roads, there is a maintenance mechanism that depends on financing from the road maintenance 

fund and on local road maintenance committees (CLERs) for manual repair works, while 

monitoring is ensured by the Directorate of Agricultural Road Roads and the empowerment of 

decentralised territorial entities. Thus, PROADER will support this institutional arrangement by 

providing CLERs with road maintenance equipment and by assisting them in establishing small- 

and medium-sized labour-intensive enterprises. These road maintenance arrangements remain 

valid for all infrastructure built under this project. In collaboration with the ETDs, the project will 

support the establishment of a sustainable management and maintenance mechanism for each 

infrastructure provided, based on the promotion of micro-, small- and medium-sized maintenance 

enterprises. This principle will strengthen local governance and the sustainability of project 

achievements, thus enabling ETDs to play their roles in land-use planning and the inclusive 

management of the structures. ETDs will be strengthened to improve resource mobilisation. In this 

regard, all sub-projects carried out under the project will be selected through a participatory 

process, involving ETDs, economic actors and producer organisations of the relevant production 

basins at the local level. In addition, the development of public-private-producer partnerships with 

the participation of specialised private agricultural enterprises located and operating in the targeted 

production basins, the structuring and professionalisation of organisations and players in value 

chains based on an expressed request will help ensure the ownership and use of the infrastructure.   

4.5. Risk Management  

4.5.1. The main risks that the project could face are: (i) vulnerability to climate change; (ii) low 

sustainability of the infrastructure set up; (iii) reluctance on the part of public entities regarding the 

empowerment of ETDs; (iv) bad governance; and (v) poor knowledge of gender issues by actors 

and their impact on the performance of household activities. To mitigate these risks, the following 

measures will be taken: (a) dissemination of smart farming technologies (community agroforestry, 

short-cycle and attack-resistant seeds, etc.); (b) establishment of a local infrastructure maintenance 

mechanism with the empowerment of ETDs, private agricultural enterprises, small- and medium-

sized enterprises, cooperatives and producer associations; (c) dissemination of legislation on 

decentralisation and capacity building for public entities; (d) strengthening of citizen control with 

the empowerment of beneficiaries and economic actors in the planning, implementation and 

project output management process, and raising of stakeholder awareness of the available 

remedies; and (e) gender mainstreaming in local planning strategies and raising of household 

awareness on the benefits of gender mainstreaming. Residual management risks will be minimised 

through competitive recruitment of staff and partners and preparation of annual performance 

contracts, renewable based on good performance, as well as capacity building of project 

management teams at the different levels.  

4.6. Knowledge Building 

4.6.1. As part of knowledge management effort, an electronic library will be set up for the 

storage of all relevant documents on the agricultural sector, best practices, local knowledge and 

innovations. The library will be accessible to stakeholders and the public. This activity will be 

developed as part of the institutional support for the Studies and Planning Directorate (DEP) of the 

Ministry of Agriculture. The communication tools and resources will be shared with other projects 

in the agricultural sector, including the Youth Entrepreneurship in Agriculture and Agri-Business 

Project (PEJAB) and the Agricultural Value Chains Development Support Project in Six DRC 

Provinces (PADCA-6P). Mechanisms will be developed for communication between the players 

involved upstream and downstream of the targeted value chains. The knowledge generated by the 

project will help to inform policy dialogue on topics that may affect the improvement of the local 

economic environment, support and improve the design of new projects.
