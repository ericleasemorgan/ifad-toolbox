SCHEDULE 1

Description of the Project

1. The objective of the Project is to improve the standard of living and resilience 
of selected communities.

2. The Project shall comprise:

(a) Output 1: development of climate and disaster resilient community 
infrastructure subprojects, such as village access or farm roads, small 
bridges, water supply, electric grid connections and multipurpose 
centers, identified through the VDP process, based on selection criteria 
and funded through block grants;

(b) Output 2: development of resilient livelihood activities for poor men and 
women in the lowest four deciles of poor and vulnerable households in 
their villages, through livelihood subprojects identified through the VDP 
process, funded through block grants, such as new or improved climate­
smart agriculture, livestock, fisheries activities, among others; provision 
of access to vocational training particular for women and youth; and 
provision of training to poor households above the lowest four deciles to 
adapt to CDR; and

(c) Output 3: strengthening of the institutional and organizational capacity 
of communities and government by further developing their VDP 
process and building their capacity to assist villagers, through the 
formation of a DRD training unit along with associated training curricula 
in the areas of community-based planning, resilience building, gender, 
leadership and livelihood development, among others; and knowledge 
centers to promote CDR in agriculture, livestock, fishery and rural 
development.

3. The Project includes a disaster contingency feature. In the event of a disaster 
affecting an entire township, and upon the request of the Project Executing Agency and 
approval by ADB, funds from the subsequent cycle of community subproject implementation 
may be advanced for reconstruction of the damaged infrastructure and recovery of livelihoods. 
The selection of infrastructure and livelihood subprojects will follow similar participatory 
processes and criteria as set out in Outputs 1 and 2 described above and detailed in the PAM.

4. The Project is expected to be completed by 30 September 2026.
