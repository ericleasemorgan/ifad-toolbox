Recommendation for approval

The Executive Board is invited to approve the recommendation for proposed
financing to the Togolese Republic for the Shared-risk Agricultural Financing
Incentive Mechanism Support Project (ProMIFA), as set forth in paragraph 55.

Proposed Loan and Grant under the Debt Sustainability
Framework to the Togolese Republic for the Shared-risk
Agricultural Financing Incentive Mechanism Support
Project (ProMIFA)

I. Strategic context and rationale
A. Country and rural development and poverty context
1. The West African country of Togo had approximately 7.6 million inhabitants in

2016, 77 per cent of them living below the poverty line and 75 per cent aged under
35. The country's economy is highly dependent on exports of phosphates and
agricultural products. The agriculture sector provides 60 per cent of employment
and contributes 41 per cent of GDP. Agriculture consists essentially of subsistence
family farms – with an average size of four hectares per household – with low levels
of producer integration into value chains and the market economy.

2. Although agriculture is the main sector of employment for thousands of young
people and women, financial sector operators hesitate to lend to them because of
perceived high risk. Investments and promotion of initiatives in the sector are
therefore limited. Just 0.2 per cent of financial sector resources go to agriculture,
and only 32 per cent of rural people have access to financial services. Use of
banking and financial services is very limited, with only 18 per cent of the country’s
population nationwide having a bank account. In 2017, the International Monetary
Fund indicated that the banking system lacked liquidity to provide financing to
private lenders, since the latter were funding public deficits.

B. Rationale and alignment with government priorities and the
results-based country strategic opportunities programme

3. The Government of Togo has just adopted a new Five-year National Development
Plan (PND) for the 2018-2022 period, with the objective of achieving strong,
sustainable and resilient growth that will provide decent livelihoods and generate
social progress and well-being. The PND also aims to achieve the Sustainable
Development Goals, in particular SDG1 (no poverty), SDG2 (no hunger),
SDG8 (good jobs and economic growth) and SDG17 (partnerships for the goals).

4. Development of the agriculture sector has a central role within the PND, and the
Government has adopted specific sectoral strategies and policies, based on a
sustainable increase in productivity of organized agropastoral value chains, the
organization and professionalizing of value chain stakeholders, and facilitating
access to financial and non-financial services tailored to the needs of the small
producers and small and medium-sized enterprises in the value chains. To that end,
the Government introduced the Agricultural Financing Incentive Mechanism (MIFA)
and requested technical and financial support for it from IFAD.

5. Lessons learned. Togo is classified among the countries experiencing conditions of
fragility, particularly with regard to issues of governance, accountability and
institutional organization. The Shared-risk Agricultural Financing Incentive
Mechanism Support Project (ProMIFA) will capitalize on lessons learned from other
rural development projects in Togo and the subregion, in particular with regard to



EB 2018/LOT/P.25

2

the implementation of projects in countries with fragile situations. Performance of
the IFAD portfolio in Togo – and in particular its fiduciary aspects – have posed
challenges due to the weak capacities for implementation and results-based
management on the part of the participating parties. Greater attention to the
fiduciary aspects will be ensured, in particular through sustained capacity-building
and close monitoring through project oversight and the IFAD country team in Accra.

II. Project description
A. Objectives, project area and target group
6. The overall objective of ProMIFA is to contribute to poverty reduction, sustainable

and inclusive rural economic growth, and the creation of sustainable and decent
employment in rural areas, through organized and well-functioning value chains in
Togo.

7. Its development objective is to facilitate sustainable access to financial and non-
financial services tailored to stakeholders in organized, successful value chains.

8. Project area. ProMIFA will be aligned with the nationwide coverage adopted by the
Government’s incentive mechanism for agricultural financing (MIFA). Nevertheless,
its roll out in each region will be undertaken on a differentiated basis depending on
demand. For greater impact on the target group, namely women and youth,
ProMIFA will first support a limited number of key agropastoral value chains
(rice, market gardening, maize and poultry raising), which will be selected taking
into account: (i) their contribution to improving food and nutritional security of the
rural communities; (ii) the existence of demand for grains, vegetables and poultry
products from urban markets; (iii) the outlook for financial and economic cost-
effectiveness; and (iv) their potential for job creation – particularly for youth and
women – and for income generation.

9. Target group. ProMIFA will target: (i) smallholder farmers and their organizations
(cooperatives, unions and federations); (ii) vulnerable farm households; (iii) rural
small businesses and microenterprises and other actors upstream and downstream
involved in the production and distribution of inputs, marketing, processing,
handicrafts, the setting up and maintenance of farm equipment, and the provision
of other services.

10. ProMIFA seeks to reach at least 300,000 direct beneficiaries, or around 50,000 rural
households, especially rural young people (18 to 40 years of age), employed or
unemployed; and women who are producers or are active in the other segments of
the targeted value chains. Targeting and gender equality strategies will ensure that
young people of both sexes represent at least 40 per cent of the beneficiaries, and
adult women at least 30 per cent. Thus girls and adult women will account for
nearly half of ProMIFA beneficiaries.

B. Components/outcomes
11. ProMIFA’s activities will be organized into three components, namely:

Component 1: Technical support for value chain development and market
access

a) Technical support to the producers and other actors in the agropastoral value
chains: (i) overview of the selected value chains and inventory of service
providers; (ii) building of the technical/technological capacities of producers
and their organizations and of other value chain actors; and (iii) capacity-
building in financial literacy and business development services.

b) Support to the structuring of the value chains and market access:
(i) partnership strengthening within the links in the value chains; (ii) support
to interprofessional organizations; and (iii) support to the quality approach to
market access.



EB 2018/LOT/P.25

Component 2: Support for the development of financial products and
services

12. In order to meet the demand generated by the ongoing support under component
1, ProMIFA will help facilitate access to financial services for rural communities by
increasing loans to smallholder farmers – individually or in groups – and to small
and medium-sized rural enterprises; and by improving the quality of the
agricultural credit portfolio of ProMIFA’s partner financial institutions and the
operational and financial sustainability of these institutions.

13. These results will be achieved through the following measures: (i) technical
assistance to support establishment of a financing and risk mitigation mechanism,
and the development of new products; (ii) improvement in the quality of financial
services through capacity-building of the financial institutions and development of
tailored products; and (iii) effective establishment of the financing and risk
mitigation arrangements.

Component 3: Institutional support to MIFA; coordination and
management of ProMIFA

a) Institutional support to MIFA, with a view to its consolidation: the project will
finance the support needed (technical assistance, training programmes, study
tours, learning routes, monitoring and evaluation, etc.) for the
operationalization and consolidation of MIFA and its strategic planning within
the agricultural finance environment;

b) Coordination and management of ProMIFA will be undertaken by a simplified
project coordination and management unit (PCMU) working alongside MIFA –
and closely linked to it and to the MIFA Board of Directors (BoD).

Strategy for project implementation and phasing

14. ProMIFA will be implemented in two phases, following a staggered implementation
plan. Phase 1, with a duration of two years, is the preliminary phase of preparation
for implementation and phase 2, with a four-year duration, constitutes the
implementation and consolidation phase. The midterm review will make it possible
to review progress made, as a condition for passing from phase 1 to phase 2, which
will be launched subject to confirmation of the following six performance indicators:
(i) four key need and market studies finalized; (ii) at least two financial products
pre-identified in the studies, ready to be implemented; (iii) at least five financial
institutions having signed a partnership agreement with MIFA looking to finance the
actors in the selected value chains, with a multiplier effect; (iv) at least one
cofinancier committed to joining the Government and IFAD in support of MIFA;
(v) MIFA’s decision-making bodies in place and operational, in accordance with
Presidential Decree No. 2018-090 dated 25 April 2018 or any subsequent
amendments to it, the members of the BoD have been identified, the Director
General has been named and the key personnel have been put in place and trained;
and (vi) the financial management system is in place and MIFA’s capacity is in line
with the parameters defined by IFAD.

15. Confirmation of these indicators will occur at the time of the midterm review, which
is foreseen from the end of the second year. Unless all of the above-mentioned
performance indicators are confirmed, the project may not move forward to the
next phase, and suspension or even early closure of the project and withdrawal of
support to MIFA could be envisaged by IFAD.

C. Theory of change
16. The change envisaged by ProMIFA will make it possible to solve two major

problems for agricultural and rural development in Togo: (i) suboptimal value
chains with bottlenecks, poorly structured producers’ organizations and other issues
that discourage risk-taking by the financial sector; and (ii) very poor access on the



EB 2018/LOT/P.25

4

part of the rural population and micro-, small and medium-sized agricultural
enterprises to the financing needed for the development of their economic
activities.

17. The project rationale lies in strengthening the resilience and productivity of family
farms. The holistic and inclusive approach adopted – that of enabling family farms
to perform better and increase resilience and become true market-oriented
enterprises – will generate economic growth. Indeed, all categories of relevant
public and private stakeholders will participate in the project. ProMIFA’s activities
will address all links in the value chain, from production to marketing, while
integrating measures for sustainable natural resource management and climate
change adaptation.

D. Alignment, ownership and partnership
18. Alignment. ProMIFA is aligned with IFAD’s Strategic Framework 2016-2025, which

encourages inclusive and sustainable rural transformation and with the strategic
commitments of the Eleventh Replenishment of IFAD’s Resources (IFAD11), while
taking into account the priority themes of nutrition, gender equality, youth and
climate change. ProMIFA is also aligned with IFAD engagement in Togo, as
described in the country strategy note 2018-2019, which focuses on two strategic
objectives, to: (i) facilitate access to employment and improve incomes for rural
youth and women through their greater inclusion in agropastoral value chains
within the structured framework of “agro-hubs”; and (ii) improve sustainable
access for the rural population (young people and women) to financial services
tailored to the development of agropastoral value chains and rural small businesses
and microenterprises.

19. Ownership. The Government is fully committed to MIFA; the latter is in fact a
central mechanism for implementation of its economic development strategy. There
is high demand for financial and in-kind support among producers, their
organizations and rural small businesses and microenterprises, which explains their
readiness to contribute payment for such services. The financial institutions are also
committed to MIFA, since it will contribute to mitigation of the risks associated with
financing the value chains.

20. Partnerships. By promoting the financial literacy of small producers and of other
actors in the agropastoral value chains and their access to short-term seasonal
loans, ProMIFA will encourage partnership-building between their organizations and
private sector actors operating upstream and downstream of production. ProMIFA
will focus on the capacity-building of the various parties involved (MIFA, the
financial institutions, the private banks and other institutions), assisting
beneficiaries in drafting business plans, and supporting financial institutions in
providing financial products that meet the needs of agropastoral value chain
stakeholders, thus enabling their access to financing over the medium term.

21. ProMIFA will also collaborate with the other initiatives under way in support of the
agricultural sector, within the framework of the National Plan for Agricultural
Investment and Food and Nutritional Security and entrepreneurship for women and
young people. A special partnership will be instituted with the National Programme
for the Promotion of Rural Entrepreneurship (PNPER), cofinanced by IFAD, which
targets young rural entrepreneurs. Other partners will also be sought, notably in
the private sector.

III. Project implementation
A. Approach
22. ProMIFA’s will follow a “faire-faire” and “faire-avec” approach which places the

beneficiaries at the centre of activities and gives them responsibility, particularly for
forming financial relationships with the financial institutions. Once the business plan



EB 2018/LOT/P.25

5

is drawn up and completed, with the support of the service provider, ProMIFA will
leave the project sponsor with responsibility for submitting and justifying the
project with the financial institutions. Once the funds have been obtained, ProMIFA
will provide the project sponsor with support to mobilize consultancy services for
project management within a contractual framework with the support provider,
based on a memorandum of understanding with ProMIFA.

23. To ensure that stakeholders have access to quality agricultural consultancy support,
business management services will be promoted by creating a network of skilled
rural young people interested in investing in business consultancy activities,
including keeping accounts and producing financial statements.

24. A key part of the project exit strategy will be the establishment of interprofessional
frameworks for dialogue and a mechanism to build organizational and institutional
capacity to provide quality services to members.

B. Organizational framework
25. ProMIFA will be implemented by a PCMU, which will be set up on the premises of

MIFA and will be linked to its BoD. This unit will have administrative and financial
management autonomy; it will be composed of a coordinator, an administrative and
financial manager and bookkeeper, a procurement specialist, a manager for
targeting/women/youth issues, a monitoring and evaluation specialist, a secretary
and two drivers.

26. Eventually the PCMU should close, with its functions absorbed within MIFA. The
midterm review, to be held towards the end of the second year of ProMIFA
implementation, will make it possible to assess the situation and propose a plan for
the transfer of functions to MIFA, based on: (i) MIFA’s charter and composition;
(ii) its level of organizational and operational maturity; (iii) its performance in
implementation of its workplan and the level of achievement of the expected
outcomes; and (iv) its management capacity, in particular in relation to fiduciary
management, and the quality of the human resources and management
instruments (manual of administrative, financial and accounting procedures manual
and integrated management system).

C. Planning, monitoring/evaluation, learning and knowledge
management

27. Planning. The preparation of the annual workplan and budget (AWP/B) will be
carried out with the MIFA team on the basis of a critical review of the previous year
and of the progress made. All stakeholders, in particular those in the Presidential
Delivery Unit (CPES), will participate in the preparation, thereby translating it into
coherent activities that are allocated the needed resources and linked to the
objectives of the logical framework and its performance measurement framework.
The AWP/B will be approved by the Board of Directors of MIFA not later than
30 November of each year, before being submitted to IFAD for its no objection
before 31 December. The project’s progress over the course of the year will be
assessed based on the rate of progress, outputs achieved and the disbursement
rate of the activities set out in the AWP/B.

28. Monitoring/evaluation. The system will draw on internal monitoring and on
periodic internal and external evaluations, which will be carried out with the
participation of the stakeholders. Information will be collected and analysed on:
(i) progress towards the expected outcomes, as described in the project’s logical
framework, and in the performance of all the actors involved in implementing the
activities set out in the AWP/B; (ii) assessment of the relevance of implementation
approaches and strategies and specific mechanisms for coordination and monitoring
of the various components and activities; (iii) assessment of the participation of the
beneficiaries at the various stages of implementation; (iv) the relevance and
effectiveness of the targeting and the attention given to cross-cutting aspects



EB 2018/LOT/P.25

6

(nutrition, gender, youth and climate change); and (v) annual surveys to assess
impact on the beneficiaries since the midterm review. A baseline survey will be
carried out at project inception and an impact assessment is planned at completion.

29. The PCMU of ProMIFA will work closely with the MIFA monitoring/evaluation unit
and the CPES in support of periodic analyses and documentation of the dashboard
indicators, which will serve as learning and decision support tools. The teams will
benefit from IFAD’s training programmes (AVANTI and Prime).

30. Learning and knowledge management. Knowledge management is an essential
function in the continuous improvement of performance and results; it aims to
capitalize on the knowledge and lessons derived from implementation experience,
so as to generate corrective measures in planning and implementation. It will be
based on (i) identification, documentation, building on and dissemination of
knowledge and (ii) networking among the practitioners, knowledge holders and
other participating parties. The monitoring and evaluation database, activity reports
and self-assessment sessions will all provide opportunities to pool the innovations
and good practices and disseminate them. Knowledge exchanges relating to
FIDAFRIQUE, recently given a new boost, will be actively promoted.

D. Administrative and financial management
31. ProMIFA’s financial management risk is deemed high prior to the establishment of

mitigation measures. The project will focus on the competitive recruitment of
qualified staff to set up an organizational, accounting and financial management
framework, accompanied by a control process and tools for transparent operational
management of the funds. In functional terms, the PMCU will have administrative
and financial autonomy, and the fact that it will initially be separate from MIFA, will
make it possible to hold it increasingly accountable, in line with the governance
principles agreed.

32. The management system described in the procedures manual will specify the
reporting and functional relationships between the officials on the administrative
and financial team. At project inception, an operational management tool will be
put in place in line with: (i) the regulatory accounting rules of the revised
SYSCOHADA accounting system; (ii) IFAD procedures with regard to project
management; and (iii) the national procedures in relation to awarding of contracts
and to personnel management. The manual will contain the management support
needed for implementation.

33. Flow of funds. A designated account will be opened to receive the loan and grant
resources. Three operational accounts will be opened respectively for the
expenditures of the PCMU, the agricultural development financing facility and the
risk mitigation fund.

34. An annual external audit of the financial statements will be carried out, in
accordance with international auditing standards and in observance of the IFAD
guidelines. The audited financial statements will be made public on the official IFAD
site.

35. Although the closing date has passed, the advances provided to the Support to
Agricultural Development Project still need to be accounted for or reimbursed to
IFAD. Definitive resolution of this issue will constitute a prerequisite for
disbursement of ProMIFA funding.

E. Procurement
36. Procurement. Procurement will respect national procedures, and will comply with

standards acceptable to IFAD.



EB 2018/LOT/P.25

F. Supervision
37. IFAD and the Government will undertake joint supervision of the project and will

organize at least one mission per year, plus thematic monitoring missions as
needed, so as to formulate recommendations for effective project implementation.

IV. Project costs, financing, and benefits
A. Project costs
38. The total cost of ProMIFA over a six-year period, including provisions for price rises,

comes to US$35.07 million. Its base cost is US$34.032 million. The provisions for

C. Summary of the benefits and economic analysis
41. The economic analysis. Calculation of the financial return from the different

models shows that all of the models chosen (mixed market gardening, upland rice,
lowland rice and free range chickens) show a very attractive financial return. The
financial internal rate of return is positive for all of the models, with indicators of
between 17 per cent and 139 per cent. The net present value is also very positive,
between CFAF 119,000 and CFAF 8.7 million. The project’s internal economic rate of
return stands at 20.3 per cent and the net present value (at the economic
opportunity cost of capital of 6.5 per cent) comes to US$32.26 million. This result is
very satisfactory. The sensitivity analysis indicates that the results obtained are
robust. Even in the event of a decline in revenue of 30 per cent, a rise in costs of
30 per cent or a two-year delay in the appearance of profits, the rate of return
remains greater than the opportunity cost of capital (6.5 per cent), and the
minimum net present value is greater than US$17.4 million.

D. Sustainability
42. Project sustainability will be promoted first by the decision to empower actors in the

agropastoral value chains to be accountable for project activities. The second
measure to guarantee sustainability is the phasing approach that will
simultaneously make ProMIFA a tool to operationalize, consolidate and maintain
MIFA beyond project completion.

43. Among the effective mechanisms developed by ProMIFA are: making beneficiaries
accountable for the activities in which they are involved through their systematic
participation in decisions on the technical support needed to implement their action
plans. This will be realized through a tripartite partnership agreement established
between ProMIFA, the support provider and the beneficiary.

44. The cost-sharing system between the project and the beneficiaries will enable the
producers to contribute to the direct financing of their economically viable activities.
Similarly, with respect to the agricultural development financing facility, a
mechanism will make it possible to provide liquidity to MIFA’s partner financial
institutions for the financing of beneficiaries’ projects. This process will involve the
participation of the three sets of stakeholders: the farmers, ProMIFA and the
partner financial institutions.

45. The differentiated and calibrated support to the producers’ cooperatives and
organizations – by means of action plans that they themselves have designed – will
strengthen their institutional and economic capacity. The establishment of a
commercial relationship between the cooperatives and the market operators, along
with financial intermediation on the part of ProMIFA, will provide the producers with
autonomy. The specific and multifaceted support envisaged for building the
economic capacity of women and youth will contribute to the emergence of strong,
credible and economically promising entreprises led by women and young people.

E. Risk identification and mitigation
46. The project’s main risks are inherent to activities in the agricultural sector and rural

finance, and to markets, climate change and the country’s social and political
situation, in particular: (i) weak technical and management capacity of the
beneficiaries for ensuring the productivity and economic return of their activities;
(ii) low participation of women, due to cultural barriers and to men’s
monopolization of the most profitable links in the value chain; (iii) fluctuation in
prices of staples and the distortion caused by the parallel markets; (iv) disruption
of the markets by government policies to subsidize inputs and foodstuffs; (v) poor
quality of records, entailing drawn-out loan provision processes; (vi) delays in
establishing financing mechanisms, mitigating risks and conducting surveys;
(vii) fiduciary risks; and (viii) climate events that may place a strain on production
and repayment capacities. The project is classified as having moderate climate risk.



EB 2018/LOT/P.25

However, it will have many positive effects and is thus classified in environmental
category B.

V. Corporate considerations
A. Compliance with IFAD policies
47. ProMIFA is in line with IFAD’s Strategic Framework 2016-2025, which aims to

promote inclusive and sustainable rural transformation, and with IFAD’s rural
finance policy. ProMIFA will implement activities aimed at achieving IFAD’s three
strategic objectives: (i) improving the productive capacity of poor rural people in a
sustainable and resilient manner; (ii) adding to the benefits that these communities
draw from their inclusion/participation in the market; and (iii) strengthening
environmental sustainability and increasing the climate resilience of their economic
activities. It is also strongly aligned with IFAD’s planned country engagement as set
forth in the country strategy note for 2018-2019. ProMIFA is also in line with IFAD’s
rural finance policy, which calls for providing financial institutions with capital and
developing financial products tailored to the rural poor, including risk management
mechanisms, without creating distortion within the financial market.

B. Alignment and harmonization
48. ProMIFA will support the implementation of MIFA, a key instrument of the new five-

year PND (2018-2022), which will make it possible to facilitate the funding needed
for rural activities, so as to address the weak performance of agropastoral value
chains and poverty.

C. Innovations and scaling up
49. ProMIFA represents an innovative approach for mitigating risks linked to agricultural

financing, which is based on the scaling up of successful experiences from other
regions within the framework of a South-South partnership with Nigeria. MIFA is a
priority initiative of the President and plays a major role in the country’s
development strategy. It will be the gateway for the private sector, donors and
other partners. Since the beginning of the pilot phase of MIFA, IFAD, by supporting
ProMIFA, has been the only partner that has committed itself alongside the
Government and will benefit from a high level of visibility. IFAD’s direct
participation by providing a grant to strengthen the CPES – a service mechanism of
the Office of the President of the Republic of which MIFA is a priority project – is
also a major innovation whose results are eagerly awaited.

50. ProMIFA will build on and harness the experiences of projects with similar activities,
such as PEA Youth in Cameroon, NIRSAL in Nigeria, the Agribusiness Initiative Trust
in Uganda and the Private Agricultural Support Services Trust in the United Republic
of Tanzania.

D. Policy engagement
51. Since MIFA is a key implementation instrument for the Government’s development

strategy, ProMIFA – in support of MIFA – will contribute to strategic planning on the
key topics of: agropastoral value chains, professionalization of stakeholders and
rural finance. This contribution will be undertaken through mobilization of
specialized technical assistance, the financing of thematic studies, learning from
monitoring and evaluation, and building on and sharing good practices.

VI. Legal instruments and authority
52. The financing agreement between the Togolese Republic and IFAD constitutes the

legal instrument whereby the proposed financing will be granted to the
borrower/beneficiary. A copy of the negotiated financing agreement is attached as
appendix I.

53. The Togolese Republic is empowered under its laws to receive funding from IFAD.



EB 2018/LOT/P.25

13

54. I am satisfied that the proposed financing will comply with the Agreement
Establishing IFAD and the Policies and Criteria for IFAD Financing.

VII. Recommendation
55. I recommend that the Executive Board approve the proposed financing in terms of

the following resolutions:

RESOLVED: that the Fund shall provide a loan to the Togolese Republic on
highly concessional terms in the amount of three million three hundred
thousand euros (EUR 3,300,000), upon such terms and conditions as shall be
substantially in accordance with the terms and conditions presented herein.

FURTHER RESOLVED: that the Fund shall provide a grant to the Togolese
Republic under the Debt Sustainability Framework in the amount of
three million three hundred thousand euros (EUR 3,300,000), upon such
terms and conditions as shall be substantially in accordance with the terms
and conditions presented herein.

Recommendation for approval

The Executive Board is invited to approve the recommendation for the proposed
financing to the Republic of Sierra Leone for the Agriculture Value Chain
Development Project (AVDP), as contained in paragraph 45.

Proposed Loan and Debt Sustainability Framework Grant
to the Republic of Sierra Leone for the Agriculture Value
Chain Development Project (AVDP)

I. Strategic context and rationale
A. Country and rural development and poverty context
1. The Republic of Sierra Leone economy has grown substantially since the end of the

civil war in 2002, but it suffered two major shocks in 2014/2015 – the Ebola
epidemic and the collapse of iron ore prices, with GDP shrinking 21 per cent in
2015. However, economic growth resumed following new investments in mining,
agriculture and fisheries, registering GDP growth of 6.3 per cent in 2016 and
5.7 per cent in 2017. Agriculture, the largest sector in the economy, accounted for
59 per cent of GDP in 2016, 62 per cent of the labour force, and 22 per cent of
export earnings. Cash crops produced for export include cocoa and coffee, while
palm oil is produced for domestic consumption and some export.

2. Sierra Leone’s population is around 7.4 million (40 per cent youth) and growing at
2.2 per cent annually. Poverty is widespread but is particularly acute and
concentrated in rural areas, where 59 per cent of the population lives. The rural
poverty headcount of over 66 per cent is double that of urban areas. Women and
youth are particularly vulnerable due to challenges associated with access to land,
skills and capital, as well as customs. About 59.7 per cent of rural households in
Sierra Leone are food insecure, compared with 25.1 per cent in urban areas.

B. Rationale and alignment with government priorities and
RB-COSOP

3. Agricultural development remains key to Sierra Leone’s economic development and
rural poverty reduction, and there is considerable untapped potential for increasing
the production and productivity of both staple and cash crops. The project will
focus on three crops: rice, cocoa and palm oil, though the largest share of the
budget will be devoted to rice production in inland valley swamps, consistent with
the Government of Sierra Leone priorities. The AVDP will promote crop
diversification to provide flexibility and choice to beneficiaries and support
improved nutrition.

4. The AVDP is aligned with the National Agricultural Transformation 2023
Programme, which is currently in development. The AVDP addresses two of the
three priority intervention areas, which are rice self-sufficiency and crop
diversification, notably for palm oil and cocoa. The project aligns with five of the
seven new strategic priorities: (priority 2) Increasing investment in rice production,
processing and marketing, (priority 3) Make youth and women catalysts for
agribusiness development and growth, (priority 4) Invest in catalytic technologies
such as agricultural mechanization, irrigation and water management,
(priority 6) Strengthen sustainable biodiversity management and conservation,
including forest and tree crops, (priority 7) Increase the production of other crops,
such as vegetables, to ensure diversification.



EB 2018/LOT/P.19/Rev.1

2

5. The selection of value chains is consistent with government priorities and pro-poor
approaches to value chain development. The crop mixture addresses increased
availability of the dietary staple (rice), improved nutritional balance (vegetables)
and increased income from all crops.

6. The project development objective and approach are aligned with the two strategic
objectives of the Country Strategy Note 2017-2018, namely (i) improved
smallholder farmers’ access to technical skills and markets; and (ii) improved
access to finance for rural communities.

II. Project description
A. Project area and target group
7. Due to widespread poverty, the AVDP will in principle be nationwide, though the

concentration and intensity of project interventions will depend on climatic and
agroecological conditions in each of the 16 districts of Sierra Leone.1 While rice and
palm oil are produced throughout the country, cocoa production is localized in
specific districts.

8. The socio-economic profile of the target group will be similar to that of the groups
targeted under the Smallholder Commercialization Program - Global Agriculture
and Food Security Program (SCP-GAFSP), although primarily in other areas of the
country. The majority of the beneficiaries (62.3 per cent) have no education. Only
37.7 per cent of beneficiaries have some formal education, mostly primary or
secondary but very little post-secondary/tertiary. More female beneficiaries
(69.1 per cent) than their male counterparts (40.5 per cent) have no education.
The average monthly income of beneficiaries is at 468,795 leones. Radio and
mobile phones are popular assets that beneficiaries own, as indicated by
49.8 per cent and 41.8 per cent of respondents, respectively. Ownership of other
assets is insignificant. Fully 91 per cent of households experienced hunger in the
12 months prior to the survey, during which they had difficulty providing sufficient
food to feed all members.

9. The project is estimated to target 204,000 direct beneficiaries, equivalent to
34,000 households, over a period of six years, providing assistance to the target
groups and support for greater participation in targeted value chains. The project
aims at reaching at least 40 per cent of both women and youth.

B. Project development objective
10. The project's development objective is to increase the income of smallholder

farmers through the promotion of agriculture as a business.

C. Components/outcomes
11. The project has three components: (i) Climate-resilient and smart agricultural

production; (ii) Agricultural market development; (iii) Project coordination and
management.

12. Component 1: Climate-resilient and smart-agricultural production. The expected
outcome of component 1 is that the volume and value of production is increased
and production systems are made more climate resilient. Component 1 will have
two subcomponents, as follows:

(a) Subcomponent 1.1. Support for smallholder rice production and productivity.
This will support a total of 10,000 rice farmers by providing technical
assistance through farmer field schools and financial support for the
development of inland valley swamps for double or triple cropping of rice and
improved access to quality inputs and mechanized farming services.

1 The project will pursue a strategy of territorial concentration of interventions to facilitate implementation, which in
practice may mean that not all districts are targeted.



EB 2018/LOT/P.19/Rev.1

3

(b) Subcomponent 1.2. Support for tree crop production and productivity. This
will involve work with 13,000 farmers (5,000 cocoa and 8,000 palm oil
producers) receiving technical assistance and support for the establishment of
one-hectare plots on fallow or abandoned agricultural land. No deforestation
is permitted to clear land for the smallholder plantations. No large plantations
will be supported.

13. Component 2: Agricultural market development. The expected outcome of this
component is improved performance and organization of the selected value chains
for increased smallholder production and productivity. The component is composed
of two subcomponents:

(a) Subcomponent 2.1. Market access. This subcomponent will focus on:
strengthening the business skills of Agri-Business Centres, farmers’
organizations; farmer field schools; facilitating value chain organizations; and
deal making through the establishment of provincial multi-stakeholder
platforms.

(b) Subcomponent 2.2. Climate-resilient rural infrastructure. Partly financed
through the Adaptation Fund, this will involve the rehabilitation of
warehouses to improve product drying and storage capacity, provide potable
water and latrines and rehabilitate feeder roads and farm tracks.

14. Component 3: Project coordination and management. This component is divided
into two subcomponents:

(a) Subcomponent 3.1. Project coordination and management.

(b) Subcomponent 3.2. Financing mechanisms for target groups.

III. Project implementation
ApproachA.

15. The overall AVDP approach will be market-centred and demand-driven. The main
thrust will be on establishing win-win partnerships between producers and their
organizations, private-sector agribusinesses and rural finance institutions. This will
be achieved through a series of activities, including the provision of technical
assistance by the farmer field schools, as well as the strengthening of farmers’
organizations to better plan production and the purchase of inputs. The availability
of certified seeds will be enhanced through the set-up of seed multiplication plots
that will be linked to private-sector processors. The project will provide matching
grants to facilitate beneficiary investment in production infrastructure to boost
productivity. The matching grants scheme will also increase financial inclusion, as
most producers’ groups will need credit for their investments. Multi-stakeholder
platforms will better integrate the value chains by bringing the different
stakeholders – including representatives of the smallholder farmers – to the table
to find solutions to current obstacles, build trust and facilitate business deals.
Rehabilitated feeder roads will further facilitate market linkages. Additionally, the
project will seek to climate proof the productive investments and ensure relevant
capacity-building.

B. Organizational framework
16. The National Programme Coordination Unit (NPCU) will be responsible for project

planning, financial management, contracting implementing partners for specific
activities and tasks, monitoring and evaluation (M&E), communication and
knowledge management, supervision of project activities at the district level and
facilitating linkage with the Government, private-sector and development
institutions and integrating project experience into policy dialogue.



EB 2018/LOT/P.19/Rev.1

4

17. The NPCU will have approximately 25 technical and support staff at its
headquarters, supplemented with a robust presence at the provincial level with the
out-posting of 4 tree crop officers, 4 inland valley swamp officers, 2 agribusiness
specialists and 4 Community Mobilizers/Targeting Specialists. A matching grant
evaluation committee will be set up to approve grant applications. Staff
implementing AVDP will have an opportunity for training to improve their
performance. At the district level, the district agricultural officer of Ministry of
Agriculture, Forestry and Food Security (MAFFS) will be responsible for
coordinating the implementation of project activities.

18. AVDP will be placed under the technical supervision of the MAFFS. The MAFFS and
the National Steering Committee will provide oversight, direction and advice for
project implementation, and in particular, approve the project’s Annual Work Plan
and Budget (AWPB), as well as its periodic progress reports.

C. Planning, monitoring and evaluation and learning and
knowledge management

19. The project will prepare an AWPB for approval by the National Steering Committee
and subsequent presentation to IFAD for no objection. The AWPB will serve as the
basis for any work that the project undertakes. The AWPB will be prepared in
consultation with beneficiaries and other stakeholders and build on the project’s
progress.

20. The project’s logical framework will be the main document for supporting results-
based and objective-oriented implementation. The AVDP monitoring and evaluation
system will build on the system developed in the SCP-GAFSP, including its M&E
manual. The M&E system will be in line with the Government of Sierra Leone
requirements, as well as IFAD’s Operational Results Management System and will
generate gender- and age-disaggregated data on project outputs, outcomes and
impacts.

21. AVDP monitoring will be integrated into the existing SCP-GAFSP monitoring and
evaluation framework. The project M&E Unit will include and regularly assess a
number of gender, youth and other group-specific indicators in the programme’s
M&E system at the output, outcome and impact level-in particular, capturing the
improvement of access to outputs, their use by the target groups and these
groups’ satisfaction with them.

22. Knowledge management and learning are key to meeting project objectives, as
reliable information is the basis of results-based management. Priority will be given
to areas where AVDP interventions are recognized as exemplary and expected to
have the greatest impact, though failures are also an important basis for learning.
Best practices and proven concepts will be fed into the MAFFS and regional
knowledge management systems. Lessons learned will also be fed into the
continuous improvement of manuals, concepts and strategies and disseminated to
the various target groups, including the public, using appropriate communication
media.

D. Financial management, procurement and governance
23. The inherent risk is assessed as high. As a result, the project will largely follow the

financial management arrangements already established under the ongoing IFAD
projects, which will lower the risk to medium. The financial management
arrangements will include the following: (i) a qualified financial controller and an
accountant will be appointed; (ii) all programme transactions will be recorded in
customized accounting software, in accordance with the International Public Sector
Accounting Standards (IPSAS) cash-basis of accounting, (iii) a designated account
in United States dollars for IFAD financing will be maintained at a commercial bank,
and IFAD funds will not be mingled with other funds, (iv) IFAD financing will be
disbursed in accordance with IFAD disbursement procedures and (v) the NPCU will



EB 2018/LOT/P.19/Rev.1

5

prepare quarterly financial reports in formats agreed upon with IFAD. Furthermore,
the consolidated financial statements will be audited annually by the Audit Service
of Sierra Leone – Office of the Auditor General, in accordance with International
Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions/International Standards of Supreme
Audit Institutions (INTOSAI/ISSAI) standards and IFAD audit requirements. The
audit report, together with the management letter, will be submitted to IFAD within
six months of the end of the fiscal year. The day-to-day financial operations will be
specified further in the relevant section of the project implementation manual.

24. IFAD’s has a zero-tolerance policy toward fraudulent, corrupt, collusive or coercive
actions in all projects financed through its loans and grants. IFAD's anticorruption
policy and whistleblowing procedures will be mainstreamed in the project
implementation manual.

25. A procurement assessment was undertaken as part of the design mission.
According to the assessment, the legal and regulatory framework for public
procurement in Sierra Leone will be used for all AVDP procurement activities, with
the exception of international competitive bidding, for which the World Bank
guidelines and framework will apply. In addition, the procurement plan to be used
by AVDP will be based on the version presented as part of the IFAD Project
Procurement Handbook.

E. Supervision
26. The project will be directly supervised by IFAD. Supervision will be conducted as an

opportunity to assess achievements and lessons jointly and reflect on ways to
improve implementation and impact. Furthermore, a financial management
specialist will participate in missions at least annually to supervise and provide
implementation support to the project and monitor the fiduciary risk at various
levels.

IV. Project costs, financing and benefits
27. The financing gap of US$28.5 million may be sourced by subsequent performance-

based allocation system (PBAS) cycles (under financing terms to be determined
and subject to internal procedures and subsequent Executive Board approval) or by
cofinancing identified during implementation.

A. Project costs
28. The total combined AVDP investment and incremental recurrent costs, including

physical and price contingencies, are estimated at US$60.3 million, disaggregated
by component as follows: component 1, climate-resilient and smart-agricultural
production, is the main investment component, representing US$37.9 million of the
total project costs (63 per cent of total costs); while component 2, agricultural
market development, accounts for US$13.4 million (22 per cent of total costs); and
US$9 million for the project coordination and management component 3,
(15 per cent of total project costs).

B. Project financing
29. The financing plan covers: (i) IFAD financing of US$11.8 million under the

Tenth Replenishment of IFAD's Resources (IFAD10); (ii) a financing gap of
US$28.5 million, which may be sourced by subsequent PBAS cycles, as outlined in
paragraph 27; (iii) an Adaptation Fund grant of US$9.2 million, subject to
approval; (iv) a contribution from the Government of US$8.1 million, which will be
used to finance project duties and VAT, of which US$1.9 million will be provided to
match IFAD financing of US$11.8 million approved under IFAD10; (v) estimated
beneficiary contributions (in-kind and cash) of US$1.4 million; and (vi) a private-
sector contribution of US$1.4 million.

30. Additionally, the AVDP is expected to benefit from an estimated US$10 million in
parallel value chain investments under the World Bank-financed Smallholder
Commercialization and Agribusiness Development Project and an estimated
US$12 million for the rice-seed value chain under the World Bank’s West Africa
Agricultural Transformation Project.

C. Summary benefit and economic analysis
31. The economic analysis shows that the project has the capacity to generate an

economic rate of return (ERR) of 32 per cent over a 20-year period, with a net
present value of Sierra Leonean leone 203 billion (approximately US$23.5 million).
Given the many unquantifiable benefits, the actual ERR will likely be higher.

32. In order to test the robustness of the above results, sensitivity analysis was carried
out, and the results are presented below. The sensitivity analysis investigates the
effect of fluctuations in project costs, benefits and implementation delays on the
net present value and ERR. The results show that the ERR drops to 22 per cent
with a 20 per cent increase in costs, and to 20 per cent with a 50 per cent increase
in costs, still making the project economically viable.

D. Sustainability
33. The project aims at strengthening farmers’ organizations to the extent that they

are able to collectively plan sustainable production, purchase inputs and sell their
produce through stable private-sector engagement. In coordination with the Rural
Finance and Community Improvement Programme, the project also seeks to
ensure that farmer-based organizations are sustainably accessing rural finance for
inputs. Furthermore, productive investments will be climate proofed through the
financing from the Adaptation Fund. Finally, through policy engagement planned as
part of component 3, the project will help keep the Government's focus on the
rural poor and facilitate Government support to the target group after project
completion.

E. Risk identification and mitigation
34. Since governance issues could compromise the expected impact on communities

and increase project costs, the risk is classified as high. Elite capture of outputs,
especially physical assets, which are intended for well-defined target groups, is
another problem associated with poor governance. These governance risks will be
mitigated by complementing the Government’s initiatives with: (i) increased
transparency and publicity about the distribution of outputs; (ii) training for



EB 2018/LOT/P.19/Rev.1

8

implementers at all levels in financial management, procurement, M&E and
reporting procedures; (iii) the implementation of a clear targeting strategy; and
(iv) continued improvement of the grievance mechanism for beneficiaries. The
Good Governance Framework developed for the SCP-GAFSP will be applied during
the implementation of AVDP.

35. Institutional capacity for implementation and sustainability risks are considered
moderate. Failure in project coordination is a risk, especially among and within
non-state actors and private agribusiness. Private stakeholders consistently
indicate that institutions that provide critical support services to private-sector
investors remain weak and coordination among them is fragmented. The project
will mitigate this risk by ensuring that the project implementation unit has clear
mechanisms for effective coordination during project implementation.

36. The AVDP is not expected to have overall negative environmental impacts.
However, since small commercial agricultural activities may produce unexpected
cumulative impacts, careful design of an appropriate monitoring system is critical.
The major concerns are associated with the increased use of fertilizers and
pesticides that might result from wider distribution of these products and their
impact on biodiversity and human health. Training on proper use and disposal,
adoption of the principles of the International Code of Conduct on the Distribution
and Use of Pesticides of the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United
Nations, as well as the design of an environmental monitoring system in
partnership with the Sierra Leone Environmental Protection Agency are considered
sufficient mitigation measures. Based on the above information, the project has
been classified as category B according to IFAD classification standards.

37. The promotion of palm oil is considered to entail limited risks, as only smallholder
oil palm plantations of a maximum of one hectare will be established under the
project. Large-scale plantations will not be supported. Furthermore, new
smallholder plantations will be established only on fallow or abandoned agricultural
land, and no deforestation will be accepted. Moreover, oil palm (Elaeis guineensis)
is endemic to West Africa and is therefore a natural part of the vegetation in
Sierra Leone. The palm oil produced will largely be used for cooking and sold on
the domestic market. Appendix II presents answers to key questions on how the
project will support palm oil production.

V. Corporate considerations
Compliance with IFAD policiesA.

38. The project is aligned with the IFAD11 priorities on a range of parameters. First, it
addresses gender, youth, nutrition and climate change and therefore supports the
IFAD11 mainstreaming agenda. Second, the project has managed to attract
cofinancing from the Adaptation Fund and will therefore contribute to the corporate
cofinancing targets. Third, the project is designed to have a relatively frontloaded
disbursement profile underpinned by substantial investments in equipment and
irrigation systems, as well as road rehabilitation and maintenance in the initial
years, all of which will contribute to an increasing corporate disbursement ratio.
Fourth, the project covers two PBAS cycles and is therefore aligned with the notion
of delivering bigger, better and smarter.

Alignment and harmonizationB.
39. The AVDP is wholly consistent with the Government’s National Agricultural

Transformation 2023 Programme, which is currently in development. The AVDP
addresses two of the three priority intervention areas, which are rice self-
sufficiency and crop diversification, notably for palm oil and cocoa. The selection of
value chains will allow the AVDP to build on and strengthen the results that have
been achieved in Sierra Leone through past and ongoing IFAD-financed projects
operating in the same value chains.

Innovations and scaling upC.
40. The project scales up and refines the intervention model developed under the

ongoing SCP-GAFSP, but with a range of innovations, including: (i) the
establishment of multi-stakeholder platforms to strengthen integration of the
selected sustainable value chains; and (ii) an increased focus on nutrition and food
security through the promotion of intercropping with food/tree crops and the
creation of vegetable gardens.

Policy engagementD.
41. Policy engagement in the interest of smallholder farmers and the rural poor will be

undertaken through: (i) the organization of periodic stakeholder discussions around
specific policy issues, with the participation of public and private value chain
stakeholders; (ii) the use of provincial commodity platforms as a nexus for
discussing and sharing policy-related concerns with the Government, in line with
national priorities; (iii) support for relevant analytical work related to agricultural
policies and strategies; and (iv) support for capacity-building in selected
government agencies involved in policy-making for agricultural development
(e.g., MAFFS, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Planning and Economic Development
and Ministry of Trade and Industry).

VI. Legal instruments and authority
42. A financing agreement between the Republic of Sierra Leone and IFAD will

constitute the legal instrument for extending the proposed financing to the
borrower/recipient. A copy of the negotiated financing agreement is attached as
appendix I.

43. The Republic of Sierra Leone is empowered under its laws to receive financing from
IFAD.

44. I am satisfied that the proposed financing will comply with the Agreement
Establishing IFAD and the Policies and Criteria for IFAD Financing.

VII. Recommendation
45. I recommend that the Executive Board approve the proposed financing in terms of

the following resolution:

RESOLVED: that the Fund shall provide a loan on highly concessional terms to
the Republic of Sierra Leone in an amount of five million nine hundred
thousand United States dollars (US$5,900,000) and upon such terms and
conditions as shall be substantially in accordance with the terms and
conditions presented herein.

RESOLVED FURTHER: that the Fund shall provide a DSF grant to the
Republic of Sierra Leone in an amount of five million nine hundred thousand
United States dollars (US$5,900,000) and upon such terms and conditions as
shall be substantially in accordance with the terms and conditions presented
herein.

Recommendation for approval

The Executive Board is invited to approve the recommendation for the proposed
financing to the Republic of Liberia for the Tree Crops Extension Project II (TCEP II)
as contained in paragraph 44.

Proposed Loan and Grant to the Republic of Liberia for the
Tree Crops Extension Project II (TCEP II)

I. Strategic context and rationale
A. Country and rural development and poverty context
1. Despite positive socioeconomic developments since the end of the civil war in 2003,

Liberia remains a low-income, food-deficit country with an undiversified economy. The
country saw initial post-war economic growth in real GDP of 8.9 per cent in 2012; this
fell slightly to 8.1 per cent in 2013. In 2014 and 2015, the Ebola virus disease crisis
crippled economic growth and the GDP growth rate fell drastically, only starting to
recover in 2017 with 2.5 per cent growth. The growth forecast for 2018 is 3 per cent.1

2. As of 2016, Liberia's population was estimated at 4.6 million with an annual growth rate
of 2.6 per cent. In 2015, the United Nations Development Programme ranked Liberia
177th out of 188 countries on the Human Development Index with a score of 0.427. In
2016, approximately 54 per cent of the population lived below the poverty line
(46 per cent live in rural areas). Liberia has an extremely young population:
approximately 90 per cent of its people are under 35 years.

3. A 2015 emergency food security assessment by the World Food Programme (WFP)2
found that food insecurity affects 16 per cent of households, including 2 per cent that
are severely food insecure. Food insecurity is not distributed evenly across the country.
In Lofa County, where the project will be implemented, 11.3 per cent of households
reported moderate to severe food insecurity.

4. Agriculture is the primary livelihood source for more than 60 per cent of Liberia’s
population. Traditionally, tree crops have constituted one of the country’s largest
sources of employment and an integral part of its social fabric and economy. However
during the country’s civil wars, the tree crop sector was devastated and many farmers
were displaced. Abandoned farms and plantations degenerated into forests and their
associated support structures were damaged or destroyed. Market linkages vanished
while exports dropped to near zero. In recent years, there has been increased
investment in rehabilitating smallholder cocoa farms and strengthening
cooperatives. Cocoa production is still small scale, undertaken by approximately 38,000
farmers in the country, of which 30 per cent are in Lofa County with cocoa farm sizes
averaging 1 to 3 ha.3 The sector is expected to grow as farmers continue to reclaim and
rehabilitate farms, and youth are attracted to the cocoa sub-sector with the emergence
of cocoa as a profitable cash crop.

B. Rationale and alignment with government priorities and
RB-COSOP

5. The project is aligned with the Government’s Pro-Poor Agenda for Prosperity and
Development (PAPD), which has prioritized the agricultural sector for diversifying the
economy, and has identified seven priority value chains, including cocoa. The PAPD
outlines the need to strengthen policy coordination, agricultural research and the
extension system in order to support smallholders and out-grower farmers; these are
the areas to be addressed by TCEP II.

6. The current country strategy note for Liberia (2017-2019) has two strategic objectives:
(i) smallholder farmers’ access to finance, inputs, skills and markets is improved; and
(ii) smallholders’ organizational capacities and access to Ministry of Agriculture
extension services are improved. The project is aligned with the country strategy note
since it aims to support smallholder farmers’ access to inputs, capacity building,
markets and extension services.

II. Project description
A. Project area and target group
7. While TCEP II will target Lofa County, it will be closely connected with activities in

Nimba County given the: (i) importance of cocoa farming there; (ii) project’s
complementarity with others implemented in Nimba County, including its sister TCEP I
project; and (iii) potential gains from road and track improvement. Other areas may be
targeted during implementation if productive potential is demonstrated and targeting
criteria are met.

8. The project will benefit both producers and other players within the cocoa value chain
such as input suppliers and farm-to-market operators (FMOs).4 It aims to benefit
10,000 cocoa smallholder producers using a self-targeting approach complemented by
tools to ensure that beneficiaries meet project targeting criteria. These beneficiaries will
include members of kuu groups (traditional community-based labour groups), youth
and women. TCEP II will also target cooperatives strengthened through the recently
completed IFAD-financed STCRSP, other cocoa producer groups and potential FMOs.

B. Project development objective
9. The goal of TCEP II will be to increase incomes and improve the livelihoods of poor rural

smallholder cocoa farming households in Lofa County. The project’s development
objective is to improve the incomes and climate resilience of smallholder cocoa
producers in Lofa County.

C. Components
10. The project will have the following components:

11. Component 1: Revitalization of cocoa plantations. The expected outcome of
component 1 will be increased quantity and quality of cocoa sold by smallholders. This
component comprises five subcomponents: 1.1 – Basic rehabilitation and new cocoa
plantations; 1.2 – Improving post-harvest handling and quality;
1.3 – Germplasm garden support; 1.4 – Alternative livelihood activities (crop
diversification through intercropping on existing plantations for food and nutrition
security, shade management and income generation, and on new plantations before
newly planted cocoa trees mature); and 1.5 – Transformation of cocoa waste as an
alternative income source.

12. Component 2: Rehabilitation and maintenance of roads. The expected outcome of
component 2 will be improved and climate-proof access to markets. It contains two
subcomponents: 2.1 – Road construction, rehabilitation and climate proofing; and
2.2 – Maintenance of roads.

4 FMOs are value chain actors who buy products from producers and take them to market or for value addition through processing,
sorting, grading and bagging. They include buying agents, cooperatives and companies.



EB 2018/LOT/P.16

13. Component 3: Service provision for value chain development. The outcome of
component 3 will be improved value chain organization and performance. This will be
achieved through a set of concurrent activities in subcomponents: 3.1 – Support to
farmer organizations (including the establishment of business platforms for value chain
players); 3.2 – Improved market linkages through the construction of humidity-
controlled warehouses to store cocoa beans during the wet season when roads are not
passable; 3.3 – Support to extension service development and outreach; 3.4 – Dry
storage; and 3.5 – Implementation support to the Government’s strategy on reducing
emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, and foster conservation,
sustainable management of forests, and enhancement of forest carbon stocks.

14. Component 4: Project coordination, management, monitoring and evaluation (M&E),
and policy. Using the country programme approach, TCEP II will adopt a similar
strategy to that of TCEP I. This will ensure efficient and effective planning,
implementation, M&E and knowledge management while considering environmental and
climate change resilience. In addition, component 4 will involve policy engagement and
will drive gender and social inclusion activities along with dialogue for establishing a
functional road maintenance fund.

III. Project implementation
ApproachA.

15. Similar to TCEP I, the Ministry of Agriculture will be responsible for implementing TCEP
II. The same national steering committee will orient the project strategy, oversee
planning, review progress and ensure linkages among stakeholders. Under the
supervision of the project management unit within the ministry, which was established
to coordinate donor-funded projects, the implementation, management and M&E of
TCEP II will be the delegated responsibility of the project implementation unit (PIU).
Staffing requirements for TCEP II will be harmonized with those of TCEP I using the
country programme approach. A county-level PIU will be established in Lofa County
with similar functions to that of STCRSP, but with increased human and physical
resources to coordinate the mobilization of kuu groups, farmer field schools and other
farmer groups, and facilitate the participation of community members and FMOs.
Through the efforts of a value chain specialist and a multi-stakeholder platform,
memoranda of agreement will be signed with private-sector entities and cooperatives in
order to ensure access to markets and services. The Central Agricultural Research
Institute (CARI) will be responsible for increasing the supply of improved planting
material.

Organizational framework.B.
16. A project steering committee will be established to drive the project’s strategy, oversee

planning, measure progress and assess impact. It will also facilitate linkages with
related projects, government services and value chain stakeholders. The Monrovia-
based project management unit will be the secretariat of the project steering
committee, with administration and overall management responsibilities. The
appropriately staffed and equipped country-level PIU at the Ministry of Agriculture office
in Voinjama will facilitate local linkages, provide technical and monitoring support, and
liaise with TCEP I counterparts in Nimba County.

17. The Monrovia-based PIU will coordinate activities in Lofa County with those in
Nimba County so that both can access similar services and jointly acquire seeds,
equipment and other inputs, creating economies of scale through bulk buying or
staggering buying arrangements in order to avoid over-burdening suppliers.

18. TCEP II is aligned with the Government’s PAPD, in which the Government recognizes
the agricultural sector’s potential for job creation and sustainable livelihoods,
particularly though value chain development.



EB 2018/LOT/P.16

Planning, monitoring and evaluation, learning and knowledgeC.
management

19. M&E will be undertaken by a team of qualified officers and implemented in line with
guidance developed for TCEP I. The targets included in the logical framework will guide
the project’s pace of implementation.

20. The preparation of the annual workplan and budget (AWP/B) will be a participatory
exercise involving the county-level PIU along with colleagues from the central PIU in
Monrovia, the decentralized local government, other stakeholders and implementing
partners. The central PIU will play a key role in consolidating the AWP/B and will ensure
that project indicators are properly integrated with clear targets.

21. TCEP II will establish a knowledge management plan, including a communication
strategy and plan, which will determine the types of knowledge management products
to be developed based on the intended audience. The knowledge management focus of
TCEP II will be on learning lessons and accumulating best practices through the
collection, sharing and dissemination of information on targeted cocoa value chains,
organizational development and cocoa commercialization.

22. These knowledge services will be tailored to the needs of beneficiaries. The content will
be aimed at women and youth, and all services will target these users. To this end, the
project’s learning and knowledge management strategy will capture and disseminate
knowledge at various levels focused on: (i) generating trust and fostering linkages
between partners; (ii) managing and sharing information, knowledge and experiences;
(iii) improving the private sector’s effectiveness and efficiency in adding value and
innovating; (iv) conducting analyses that can provide an evidence base for policy
dialogue; and (v) creating conditions for replication, scaling up and sustainability.

Financial management, procurement and governanceD.
23. The inherent risk is assessed as high. As a result, the project will largely follow the

same stand-alone financial management arrangements established for ongoing IFAD
projects, which will reduce the risk to medium. The financial management
arrangements will include: (i) the appointment of a qualified financial controller and
accountant; (ii) the tracking of all programme transactions using customized accounting
software in line with the International Public Sector Accounting Standards cash basis of
accounting; (iii) a designated account in United States dollars for IFAD financing in the
central bank of Liberia (IFAD funds will not be mingled with other funds); (iv) the
disbursement of IFAD financing against duly certified withdrawal applications in
accordance with IFAD disbursement procedures; and (v) periodic financial reports
prepared by the PIU in formats agreed upon with IFAD. In addition, consolidated
financial statements will be audited annually by an independent auditor in accordance
with the International Standards on Auditing and IFAD audit requirements. The audit
report, together with a management letter, will be submitted to IFAD within six months
of the end of each fiscal year. Daily financial operations will be detailed in the relevant
section of the programme implementation manual.

24. IFAD applies a zero-tolerance policy towards fraudulent, corrupt, collusive or coercive
actions in all projects financed through its loans and grants. IFAD’s anticorruption policy
and whistleblowing procedures will be included in the project implementation manual.

SupervisionE.
25. The project will be directly supervised by IFAD. Supervision will not be conducted as a

general inspection or evaluation, but as an opportunity to assess achievements and
lessons jointly with the implementation team, and reflect on ways to improve
implementation and impact. A financial management specialist will participate in
supervision missions at least once per year, to providing implementation support and
monitoring fiduciary risks.

B. Project financing
27. TCEP II will be financed by IFAD, the Government of Liberia, private-sector partners,

participating farmers and cofinanciers. As the main financier, IFAD will contribute
US$23.8 million, covering 50 per cent of the total costs of all components. Private-
sector partners will contribute approximately US$3.4 million. The Government will
finance taxes and duties on imported goods, and value-added tax for a total of
US$2.5 million (5.2 per cent of the total cost). Beneficiary contributions are estimated
at 1.8 million (3.8 per cent of the total cost). The financing gap of US$16.2 million
includes US$7 million for climate adaptation and mitigation. It should be noted that
TCEP II will absorb the entire US$ 23.8 million allocation for Liberia in IFAD10 through
the performance-based allocation system (PBAS) as a 50 per cent grant and 50 per cent
highly concessional loan. Cofinancing opportunities will be explored in order to fill the
US$16.2 million financing gap. In the event that cofinancing to cover this gap is not
secured, funding will be provided through the country’s next PBAS allocation.

C. Summary benefit and economic analysis
28. TCEP II will benefit 10,000 smallholder cocoa farmers and 5,000 other beneficiaries

through improved roads and value chain services. Considering the average household
size of 4.289 in the project area, this totals 64,200 household members. An additional
5,000 people will benefit from better roads, stronger cooperatives and market linkages,
the availability of improved planting material and better input-supply systems.

29. Component 1 is expected to lead to an increase in cocoa production, marketing and
exports as a result of: (i) the revitalization of abandoned plantations; (ii) replanting of
new trees; (iii) higher yields for smallholder farmers; (iv) higher farm-gate prices; and
(e) higher-quality cocoa as a result of improved post-harvest handling and marketing.

30. Benefits from component 2 (rehabilitation and maintenance of roads) will include
greater access to markets, reduced time and cost of reaching local markets, and limited
post-harvest losses due to poor transportation conditions. Component 3 (service
provision for value chain development) will enhance the delivery of quality services to
cocoa farmers and guarantee sustainability through improved extension services and
greater access to inputs and markets.

31. The economic results of the project are positive and significant, with an economic
internal rate of return of 17 per cent and a net present value of additional benefits
totalling US$15.2 million over 20 years against a social discount rate of 10 per cent.
The sensitivity analysis indicates that the results are robust to a reduction in the rate of
adoption, but sensitive to an overall reduction in benefits, increased costs and delays in
implementation.

D. Sustainability
32. In view of the project’s targeting of existing and new plantations, rehabilitation of

existing roads, safeguards against indirect deforestation, measures to mitigate
environmental risks posed by the application of agrochemicals and careful monitoring of
negative social impacts, it has been proposed to classify this project as category B –
posing moderate socio-environmental risks. A Social, Environmental and Climate
Assessment Procedures note has been prepared classifying the climate risk as
moderate.



EB 2018/LOT/P.16

7

E. Risk identification and mitigation
33. The project’s main risks include start-up delays, weak governance and institutional

capacities, and vulnerability cocoa price variations. With a 14-month delay between
signature and ratification of the financing agreement for TCEP I under the previous
administration, continuous and results-driven dialogue with the Government on all
critical dimensions of the project will be undertaken to accelerate the start up. In
addition, start-up funds of US$200,000 have been included in the financing agreement.
To mitigate the risk of weak governance and capacities, TCEP II will competitively
recruit staff, harmonize staffing with the country programme staffing arrangements,
use IFAD procurement guidelines and strengthen training and control systems related to
financial management. To mitigate the risk of price variations, the project will support
investments in other food crops for food security, climate resilience and smooth cash
flow.

V. Corporate considerations
Compliance with IFAD policiesA.

34. The design of TCEP II complies with IFAD’s Strategic Framework (2016-2025), with a
clear focus on enabling poor rural women and men to overcome poverty. Specifically,
TCEP II is aligned with Strategic Objective 1: Increase poor rural people’s productive
capacities; Strategic Objective 2: Increase poor rural people’s benefits from market
participation; and Strategic Objective 3: Strengthen the environmental sustainability
and climate resilience of poor rural people’s economic activities.

35. In addition, the project is aligned with the IFAD Policy on Gender Equality and Women’s
Empowerment by promoting economic empowerment that provides rural women with
equal opportunities to participate in – and benefit from – profitable economic activities
in the cocoa value chain.

36. TCEP II is compliant with IFAD’s Private Sector Development and Partnership Strategy
through promoting public-sector facilitation of mutually beneficial 4P involving
smallholder farmers and private market operators in response to clear market
opportunities.

Alignment and harmonizationB.
37. The proposed project is in line with the new administration’s five-year PAPD, which

recognizes the importance of: (i) inclusive and sustainable economic diversification to
achieve structural transformation and growth; (ii) enabling the private sector to play a
leadership role; and (iii) agriculture as an engine of growth. In order to diversify the
economy, the Government has prioritized the agricultural sector and has identified
seven priority value chains for support through the PAPD (2018-2022). These include,
rice, oil palm, horticulture, cocoa, rubber, cassava, and poultry and pig husbandry.

Innovations and scaling upC.
38. TCEP II scales up the recently completed STCRSP and is complementary to TCEP I.

There are additional opportunities for scaling up within the cocoa belt and the proposed
project is closely aligned with government priorities and the interventions of other
donors such as the World Bank. Prospects for scaling up this project include the use of
kuu groups and farmer field schools, youth engagement, tree crop revitalization and
capacity building of partner cooperatives. The benefits of a strengthened cocoa value
chain could be transferred to other commodity value chains.

39. Key innovations in TCEP II as compared to past projects include: (i) the integration of
climate change resilience and institutional capacity building into the approach; (ii) a
focus on the supply chain for new cocoa genetic resources along with post-harvest
activities and cocoa quality; (iii) an emphasis on service delivery by cooperatives to
their members; (iv) the combination of plantation revitalization with the replanting of
cocoa; (v) specific measures to include women and promote their access to benefits;



EB 2018/LOT/P.16

8

and (vi) the use of a long-term capacity-building strategy for cooperatives along with
systematic institutional capacity building and institutional auditing.

Policy engagementD.
40. The proposed project is aligned with government policies including the: (i) PAPD (2018-

2023); (ii) Revised Draft National Aid Policy of Liberia; (iii) National Cocoa Export
Strategy (2014-2018); (iv) Land Rights Act; (v) Agriculture Commodity Regulatory
Authority Act; and (vi) National Adaptation Programme of Action for Climate Change
Resilience. Through its M&E system, the project will provide important feedback to the
Government on project implementation and lessons learned, informing policies for the
sector.

VI. Legal instruments and authority
41. A Project financing agreement between the Republic of Liberia and IFAD will constitute

the legal instrument for extending the proposed financing to the borrower/recipient. A
copy of the negotiated financing agreement will be tabled at the session.

42. The Republic of Liberia is empowered under its laws to receive financing from IFAD.

43. I am satisfied that the proposed financing will comply with the Agreement Establishing
IFAD and the Policies and Criteria for IFAD Financing.

VII. Recommendation
44. I recommend that the Executive Board approve the proposed financing in terms of the

following resolution:

RESOLVED: that the Fund shall provide a loan on highly concessional terms to the
Republic of Liberia in an amount of eleven million nine hundred and thirteen
thousand United States dollars (US$11,913,000) and upon such terms and
conditions as shall be substantially in accordance with the terms and conditions
presented herein.

RESOLVED FURTHER: that the Fund shall provide a Debt Sustainability Framework
grant to the Republic of Liberia in an amount of eleven million nine hundred and
thirteen thousand United States dollars (US$11,913,000) and upon such terms
and conditions as shall be substantially in accordance with the terms and
conditions presented herein.

Recommendation for approval 

The Executive Board is invited to approve the recommendation for the proposed 

financing to the Republic of the Niger for the Family Farming Development 

Programme in the Diffa Region (ProDAF-Diffa), as contained in paragraph 59. 

Proposed loan and Debt Sustainability Framework Grant 
to the Republic of the Niger for the Family Farming 
Development Programme in the Diffa Region  

I. Strategic context and rationale 

A. Country and rural development and poverty context 

1. Poverty and security situation. With a poverty rate of 48.9 per cent, a gross 

national product of US$430 per capita and a very low human development index 

(HDI) of 0.348 in 2015 and 2016, Niger is one of the poorest countries in the 

world, ranking 187
th
 out of 188 countries on the HDI. Attacks by Boko Haram 

terrorists around Lake Chad have exacerbated the poverty of the area’s population, 

whose security is seriously affected. According to government statistics, there were 

252,305 refugees or displaced persons in the Diffa region in October 2017. 

2. Agricultural potential. The Diffa region has real potential for the production of 

irrigated and flood recession crops, having an arable area of 265,000 hectares, 

69 per cent of it in the Lake Chad lakebed, 28 per cent along the Komadougou 

Yobé River et 3 per cent in the oasis basins of Mainé-Soroa and Goudoumaria. 

Rainfed crop development in the agriculture subsector is limited due to low rainfall, 

coupled with low dune-soil fertility and parasite pressure. The main constraints to 

irrigated crop production are the limited financial capacity of farmers to embrace 

irrigated farming, the absence of credit tailored to their needs and the lack of 

effective systems to provide them with inputs and market their produce. 

3. In terms of livestock production, in 2016 the livestock population in the Diffa 

region (all species) was estimated at over 3,750,000 head, corresponding to 

1,637,000 tropical livestock units, or 9.9 per cent of the nation’s stock. Some 

95 per cent of the population engages in livestock production, which accounts for 

55 per cent of the region’s annual gross product, making it the leading activity in 

terms of total export earnings from agro-sylvo-pastoral products. Notwithstanding, 

the livestock subsector in the Diffa region suffers from chronic forage shortages 

(in 10 out of 12 years), poor networking of water points, hindering rational use of 

grazing lands, and poor farmer organization in terms of marketing the animals and 

their subproducts. 

4. Market access. Market transactions in the Diffa region are dominated by the sale 

of livestock and peppers and controlled by Nigerians, who are positioned 

downstream in the value chains as the main buyers but upstream as well, in the 

case of peppers, as the main providers of inputs through crop loans. This model, 

however, has been seriously disrupted by the Boko Haram attacks, which have 

caused most rural markets to shut down and led to the development of informal 

channels of trade. A large portion of the profit margin, therefore, accrues to 

merchants and their intermediaries, while farmers sell around 70 per cent of their 

production at harvest, when prices are at their lowest.  

5. Situation of women and young adults. Limited access to production factors, 

among them land, financing and technical and economic advisory services, exclude 

women from agricultural production activities, leaving them to work in the artisanal 

processing of farm products (small-scale food services, oil, dairy products and flour 



EB 2018/LOT/P.15 

2 

and by-products). In rainfed crop production, women’s participation is observed in 

cowpea harvesting, and in irrigated crop production, in pepper harvesting. In 

recent years, women have shown a keen interest in irrigated market garden crops 

in oasis basins. The banning of motorcycle use due to security issues has seriously 

affected the employment of young men who once provided motorized transport for 

people and merchandize. Agriculture, especially market gardening, could offer 

them an opportunity to re-enter the workforce. 

B. Rationale and alignment with government priorities and 
RB-COSOP  

6. The Diffa Regional Development Plan (2016-2020) emphasizes: (i) the 

preservation, growth and diversification of agro-sylvo-pastoral and fish production; 

and (ii) the strengthening of community resilience to climate change, crises and 

natural disasters.  

7. The national policy orientations for 2020
1
 include the goal of tripling the 

contribution of irrigated crops to the national grain balance sheet. This strategic 

orientation also applies to the Diffa region, thanks to a greater supply of production 

factors (water-capture works, drainage systems), technical and economic 

agricultural advisory services and the creation of warehousing and processing 

facilities and mechanisms for securing market access for the products supplied by 

the agro-sylvo-pastoral and fish value chains. 

8. The Nigerien authorities’ determination and efforts to fight rural poverty by 

targeting support to young adults and women through agricultural development as 

the primary source of rural employment, strengthening the population’s resilience 

through upstream and downstream production assistance and helping households 

hurt by the security crisis to rapidly recover are the motives behind the preparation 

of this programme.  

9. Concerning refugee populations, the Government is committed to establishing 

mechanisms to support local communities, accommodating displaced persons 

through the development of sustainable agropastoral activities and ensuring the 

social and economic integration of displaced persons in the receiving areas and 

preparing them to return to their country and village of origin once the security 

threats are under control. This vision is supported by the findings of partners 

operating in the area, who state that after years of humanitarian assistance, the 

target groups’ current needs are related more to the demand for economic projects 

that empower them and guarantee their dignity. This demand is consistent with 

IFAD’s intervention framework, grounded in the promotion of family farming to 

eradicate poverty and hunger in rural areas.  

10. Thus, based on the conclusions and measures agreed upon by Niger and IFAD in 

the COSOP 2013-2018 midterm review, the Government has requested IFAD’s 

agreement to finance and extend the Family Farming Development Programme 

(ProDAF) to the Diffa region to capitalize on the achievements of previous and 

current projects in this region. 

II. Programme description 

A. Programme area and target group 

11. The programme will operate in oasis basins, the western and central areas of the 

Komadougou Yobé river valley, the central agropastoral area and the north-

western pastoral area of the region. This area covers the entire communes of 

Goudoumaria, Mainé-Soroa, Chétimari, Diffa, Gueskérou, Foulatariet and N’Guel 

Beyli and the southern part of the N’gourti commune, connecting the Gueskérou 

                                           
1
 (i) The Sustainable Development and Inclusive Growth Strategy 2035 (SDDCI – Niger 2035); (ii) the Economic and 

Social Development Plan 2017-2021; (iii) the Action Plan 2016-2020 of the 3N Initiative "Nigeriens Nourishing Nigeriens"; 
and (iv) the Small-scale Irrigation Strategy in Niger. 



EB 2018/LOT/P.15

and N’Guel Beyli communes. Operations will be concentrated around five economic 

development poles (EDP): Goudoumaria (including Boudti), Mainé-Soroa, N'Guel 

Beyli/Foulatari, Chétimari and Diffa (including Gueskérou). The N'Guel Beyli EDP 

will focus on agropastoral activities and products, and the other EDPs on activities 

and the products of irrigated and rainfed agriculture and sedentary livestock 

production. 

12. Four criteria were used in selecting the intervention areas: (i) security conditions 

(subject to variation); (ii) the geographical concentration of activities in an EDP 

approach; (iii) potential partnerships and synergies with other actors; and (iv) the 

presence of different types of target groups, addressed through a holistic approach. 

13. The targeting of beneficiaries will take place at two levels: (i) socio-economic 

targeting of vulnerable local or refugee households; and (ii) demographic targeting 

of women and young adults. More particularly, ProDAF-Diffa will target 20,000 

households, or roughly 140,000 people, representing some 16 per cent of the 

population in the Diffa region, 30 per cent of them refugees. Furthermore, at least 

30 per cent of the beneficiaries will be women and 30 per cent young adults, as 

stipulated in the ProDAF strategy for equitable development and empowerment of 

women and youth.  

B. Programme development objective 

14. The programme’s general objective is adapted from the objective of the ProDAF 

programme in the Maradi, Tahoua and Zinder regions, of which this programme is 

an extension. Its purpose is to sustainably ensure food and nutrition security and 

the resilience capacities of rural households in the Diffa region. 

15. The development objective is to sustainably increase the income, adaptation to 

climate change and market access of family farms and promote the social and 

economic integration of refugee or displaced populations into the receiving 

communities. 

16. ProDAF-Diffa operations will be part of the following key actions in the five selected 

EDPs: (i) the development of a wholesale market; (ii) small-scale irrigated farming 

in intermediate areas located near national Route 1; (iii) higher productivity in 

rainfed and irrigated crop production; (iv) protection of intervention basins through 

sand-dune stabilization; (v) the upgrading of pastoral trails and water points; and 

(vi) the social and economic integration of refugee groups. 

17. The expected result is expressed in two outcomes: 

(i) The emergence of sustainable family farms enables 20,000 rural households, 

30 per cent made up of refugees, 30 per cent women and 30 per cent young 

adults, to diversify their production (crops and livestock) and boost their 

yields (30 per cent) and resilience to external shocks, notably those that are 

climate-related. 

(ii) Thirty per cent of the 20,000 rural farmers, 30 per cent of them refugees, 

30 per cent women and 30 per cent young adults, obtain higher income from 

their surplus agro-sylvo-pastoral production thanks to higher sales in the 

markets that supply national consumer centres and cross-border markets. 

C. Components/outcomes 

Component 1: Strengthening of sustainable family farming 

18. The objective of this component is to sustainably boost the productivity of family 

farms. It has three sub-components: (i) structured and productive climate-resilient 

farms; (ii) strengthening of the technical and economic capacity of family farms; 

and (iii) resilience of vulnerable populations.  

19. Component 1 consists of: (i)(a) the development of sub-watersheds 

(3,000 hectares) and promotion of the pastoral water subsector through water and 



EB 2018/LOT/P.15 

4 

soil conservation works and soil protection and restoration, the rehabilitation of 

pastoral corridors and water points and (i)(b) the development of areas for 

irrigated crop production (360 hectares); (ii) the strengthening of agricultural 

technical capacity to enable family farms to diversify their production and increase 

crop yields by 30 per cent, and the improvement of sedentary livestock production 

to boost herd productivity and reduce conflicts over the use of natural resources; 

and (iii) activities preparatory to action on behalf of refugees and the promotion of 

women’s leadership and nutrition security. 

Component 2: Market access 

20. This component has three sub-components: (i) the structural development of 

sustainable market access; (ii) the promotion of rural microenterprises and youth 

employment; and (iii) market access and regional trade integration. 

21. Component 2 consists of: (i) the rehabilitation or building of economic 

infrastructure to improve trade flows in existing markets in the five EDPs; (ii) the 

sustainable management of economic infrastructure through specific social 

engineering; (iii) the promotion of rural microenterprises to benefit local and 

refugee populations; (iv) financing for the vocational training and equipping of 

young adults (30 per cent of them young women) for work in farming-related 

agricultural activities or non-agricultural activities; and (v) actions aimed at 

strengthening the policy dialogue on increasing EDP connectivity through wholesale 

markets and sales platforms in subregional transport corridors. 

Component 3: Programme management and coordination, monitoring and 

evaluation and knowledge management  

22. This component includes the administrative and financial operations, management 

and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of the programme. 

III. Programme implementation 

A. Approach 

23. ProDAF-Diffa’s implementation will follow the ProDAF principles applied in the 

Maradi, Tahoua and Zinder regions while considering the specific context of Diffa, 

marked by the presence of refugee populations among the beneficiaries.  

24. The programme approach is based on the following intervention principles: 

 The improvement of food and nutrition security, considering the dimensions 

of food availability, accessibility and use through stable mechanisms; 

 Geographical continuity of the interventions through the EDPs, which includes 

the wholesale market connected by rural feeder roads to satellite collection 

points in the production areas, themselves surrounded by watersheds; and  

 The scaling up of ProDAF to benefit the Diffa region. 

B. Organizational framework 

25. The Ministry of Agriculture will be responsible for project oversight and 

implementation. The national steering committee will be responsible for the 

strategic orientation of the programme, ensure compliance with the financing 

agreements and the programme’s alignment with national strategies and approve 

the annual work plans and budgets (AWP/B). It will be presided over by the 

General Secretary of the Ministry of Agriculture and consist of representatives of 

government agencies and the beneficiaries. 

26. Programme coordination and management, overseen by the Ministry of Agriculture, 

will be handled by a regional programme management unit (RPMU) based in Diffa 

with technical, administrative and financial autonomy. 



EB 2018/LOT/P.15 

5 

27. ProDAF’s national technical assistance unit, based in Niamey and Maradi, will 

provide ad hoc technical assistance for programme implementation, as needed, 

particularly in the areas of fiduciary, administrative and technical management.  

C. Planning, monitoring and evaluation and learning and 
knowledge management  

28. Planning. The RPMU will be responsible for consolidating the AWP/Bs prepared by 

the technical partners in keeping with the regulations and timetables and based on 

targeted discussions at the local level. It will be co-responsible for organizing and 

serving as the secretariat for the national steering committee’s sessions with the 

other RPMUs. The AWP/B will be validated by the national steering committee and 

submitted for IFAD's prior approval. 

29. Monitoring and evaluation. The purpose of the M&E system will be to furnish 
reliable current data on the programme’s implementation and facilitate 
decision-making. It will be linked to ProDAF’s comprehensive M&E system. The 
RPMU in Diffa will take the data collected from forms completed in the field by 

implementation operatives/partners and enter it in ProDAF’s consolidated 

harmonized database. IFAD and the Government will conduct a joint midterm 

review in year three of the programme.  

30. Learning and knowledge management. The purpose of knowledge management 
in ProDAF-Diffa will be: (i) to encourage personnel involved in the implementation 
of programme activities to regularly describe and document the knowledge gained 

during implementation (capitalization); and (ii) to systematically store (either 

manually or electronically) the documentary output (reports, studies, terms of 

reference, notes, etc.) of the various programme actors and facilitate its use 

(as part of knowledge sharing). 

D. Financial management, procurement and governance 

31. The programme’s administrative and financial management, as well as its fiduciary 

aspects, will be based on ProDAF’s existing configuration and mechanisms. 

ProDAF’s financial management risk is considered “moderate.” 

32. Programme funds will be managed according to the terms of the financial 

agreements. The administrative and financial management procedures will be 

detailed in the letter to the borrower and the manual of internal administrative, 

financial, accounting and monitoring procedures. The manual will take the 

distinctive features of the programme into account, specifically the multiple sources 

of financing and the number of intervention regions, as well as the particular risks 

of the Diffa region.  

33. Flow of funds. A dedicated account in CFA francs for the deposit of the respective 

loan and grant funds and an operational account in CFA francs will be opened in the 

name of the programme at a reputable commercial bank. Disbursements from 

these accounts will require two signatures.  

34. The programme coordination unit will prepare quarterly financial and accounting 

statements, which it will transmit to the Government and IFAD, along with the 

financial statements for programme operations, which will be subject to an annual 

external audit.  

35. Pursuant to IFAD guidelines, an external audit of the financial statements will be 

performed annually. It will adhere to the International Standards on Auditing and 

comply with IFAD Guidelines on Project Audits. The audited financial statements 

will be published on IFAD’s official website.  

  



EB 2018/LOT/P.15

36. Procurement. Procurement is governed by: (i) Law No. 2011/037 of 28 October 

2011, containing the general principles, controls and regulations governing public 

contracts and the outsourcing of public services; (ii) Decree No. 2014-070/PRN/MF 

of 12 February 2014 on a priori supervision of procurement procedures, which is 

exercised by the Directorate for Public Procurement and Financial Covenants; and 

(iii) Decree No. 2016-641/PRN/PM of 1 December 2016 on the code for 

procurement and the outsourcing of public services. 

E. Supervision 

37. Programme supervision will be carried out directly by IFAD and the Government, 

represented by the Ministry of Agriculture, in collaboration with the other 

departments involved, the programme coordination unit and relevant partners, 

notably NORAD. In addition, IFAD will organize implementation support missions, 

as needed.  

IV. Programme costs, financing and benefits 

A. Programme costs

C. Summary benefit and economic analysis  

41. The analysis of the financial return of the activities shows that for rainfed crops, 

the respective internal rates of return (IRR), net present values (NPV) and cost-

benefit ratios are on the order of: (i) for millet, IRR of 21.20 per cent, NPV of 

FCFA 15,135 and cost-benefit ratio of 1:7; (ii) for sorghum, IRR of 16.3 per cent, 

NPV of FCFA 7,206 and cost-benefit ratio of 1:3; and (iii) for groundnut, IRR of 

23.40 per cent, NPV FCFA 37,772 and cost-benefit ratio of 1:2. 

42. The additional margins for irrigated crops are FCFA 661,697 and FCFA 739,000 for 

peppers and rice, respectively. The IRR for onions is 62.8 per cent, with an NPV of 

FCFA 11 million and a cost-benefit ratio of 2:2. These results show that a farmer 

can handle the additional costs of adopting improved production techniques to clear 

additional income.  

43. Goat raising in these groups is also a profitable venture, with an IRR of 

43.7 per cent, an NPV de FCFA 642,219 and a cost-benefit ratio of 1:3. 

44. The financial analysis of the operating accounts of the various market stakeholders 

(farmers, collectors, warehousers, merchants/wholesalers, communities/ 

municipalities, market management groups) shows a satisfactory return for the 

different types of market investments, with IRRs ranging from 14.2 to 48 per cent.  

45. The programme’s overall economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is 21.6 per cent, 

and the NPV of the net economic cash flow will be US$13 million. This preliminary 

result is satisfactory. With a 10 per cent increase in sales prices, the EIRR is 

around 23.6 per cent. A 15, 20 and 30 per cent drop in the yield of rainfed crops 

reduces the EIRRs to 18.9 per cent, 17.3 per cent and 14.0 per cent, respectively, 

while a 10 per cent increase in costs yields an EIRR of 19.6 per cent.  

D. Sustainability 

46. ProDAF-Diffa employs an approach based on increasing resilience that applies the 

lessons learned in neighbouring regions while tackling the challenges stemming 

from population movements triggered by the security situation. The programme’s 

primary goal is therefore to increase the sustainability of the proposed practices 

and the installations introduced by the programme. The sustainability of the 

interventions will be guaranteed by choosing practices and activities that have 

proven effective over decades, with a high rate of adoption by rural populations. 

47. From a technical standpoint, the activities under components 1 and 2 are based on 

social engineering that links each intervention, from the lowland parcel to the 

subwatershed, to its users through commune management and association 

committees with recognized competencies.  

48. From a social standpoint, the programme approach will be inclusive, and support 

will be provided to all target groups without discrimination. To this end, instead of 

setting up specific organizations for refugee groups, the programme will encourage 

populations to participate in existing or newly created village associations. This 

approach will better integrate the communities to implement the activities and 

capitalize on the opportunities offered. 

49. From an economic standpoint, the increased volume and value of farm production, 

together with greater market opportunities, will be the incentives for beneficiary 

engagement. 

E. Risk identification and mitigation 

50. ProDAF-Diffa’s implementation will face risks associated with the climate and 

security situation in the region, the security risk remaining unpredictable and high. 

The environmental and social risks make it a “Category B” project. Since the region 

is Sahelian, the project is classified as having a “high climate risk” due to the risks 

associated with climate change. The risk assessment was taken into account in the 



EB 2018/LOT/P.15 

11 

Environmental and Social Management Plan. The anticipated mechanisms and 

interventions will mitigate the adverse effects of the risks on the activities. Since 

ProDAF-Diffa is an extension of ProDAF, numerous risks are substantially mitigated 

by the very fact of its institutional integration and the recognized experience of 

ProDAF. Nevertheless, in order to lower ProDAF-Diffa’s risk in the implementation 

phase from “high” to “moderate,” as in the case of ProDAF, the new structure 

includes an internal risk auditor to better control the risks. The main risks and 

mitigation measures put the overall programme risk at the “moderate” level.  

V. Corporate considerations 

A. Compliance with IFAD policies 

51. ProDAF-Diffa is aligned with IFAD’s Strategic Framework 2016-2025, centred on 

inclusive and sustainable transformation of the rural world. ProDAF-Diffa will 

contribute to meeting IFAD’s three strategic objectives, namely: (i) increase poor 

rural people’s productive capacities; (ii) increase poor rural people’s benefits from 

market participation; and (iii) strengthen the environmental sustainability and 

climate resilience of poor rural people’s economic activities.  

52. The activities implemented under ProDAF-Diffa (development of water points, 

pastoral areas, stabilization of dunes surrounding water points, support for 

agricultural inputs) will have a limited, reversible, and easily mitigated 

environmental and social impact. Moreover, they will take place in small areas and 

be on the scale of the activities implemented under ProDAF in the neighbouring 

regions, where the adverse social and environmental impacts were considered 

minimal and very localized. It is therefore proposed that ProDAF-Diffa be classified 

as an environmental and social category “B” programme. 

B. Alignment and harmonization 

53. The programme’s targeting strategy is aligned with IFAD’s targeting policy. 

ProDAF-Diffa is aligned with the Government’s recommendations in favour of the 

interventions in the Diffa context, considering the refugee, displaced and returning 

populations in the country who wish to engage in family farming. The programme 

will also ensure that this aspect will be taken into account in the monitoring of 

programme results and the impact assessment (with data disaggregated by sex, 

age and origin). ProDAF-Diffa is aligned with Niger’s Small-scale Irrigation 

Strategy.  

C. Innovations and scaling up 

54. ProDAF-Diffa is the product of a scaling up of ProDAF’s achievements and approach 

in the neighbouring regions. In particular, it has the following features:  

 The economic development pole (EDP) approach. The EDP approach, 

which consists of concentrating a coherent and complementary group of 

support activities in a production area to amplify their impact, was 

successfully implemented in 2012-2013 in the Project to Support Food 

Security in the Maradi Region (PASADEM) and the Ruwanmu Small-scale 

Irrigation Project (PPI Ruwanmu). It has been employed in current ProDAF 

activities in the Maradi, Tahoua and Zinder regions and is now used as a 

model in the intervention strategies of the government and certain partners. 

This approach will be replicated in this programme.  

 Farmer field schools and water user associations. These tools will be 

promoted by the programme based on the current ProDAF experience. 

 Assisted natural tree regeneration. This simple and inexpensive technical 

innovation for managing the natural regeneration of trees has had a very 

positive impact in projects promoted by IFAD since the 1980s.  



EB 2018/LOT/P.15 

12 

D. Policy engagement  

55. ProDAF-Diffa interventions are aligned with the lines of action in the Plan of Action 

2016-2020 of the 3N Initiative "Nigeriens Nourishing Nigeriens," especially: 

(i) water management for agro-sylvo-pastoral and fish production; (ii) the 

promotion of agro-sylvo-pastoral and fish value chains; and (iii) integrated and 

sustainable natural resource management and environmental protection. These 

lines of action are also part of the Diffa Regional Development Plan (2016-2020) 

and IFAD’s country strategic opportunities programme (COSOP) 2013-2021. 

By focusing its efforts on the problem of assisting refugees, the programme is also 

aligned with the Facility for Refugees, Migrants, Forced Displacement and Rural 

Stability (FARMS), developed by IFAD and its partners to help displaced persons 

become more independent and strengthen the resilience of receiving communities. 

Therefore, the programme will generally support Niger’s Sustainable Development 

and Inclusive Growth Strategy 2035 (SDDCI – Niger 2035). 

VI. Legal instruments and authority 
56. The financing agreement between the Republic of the Niger and IFAD will 

constitute the legal instrument for extending the proposed financing to the 

borrower/recipient. A copy of the negotiated financing agreement is attached in 

appendix I. 

57. The Republic of the Niger is empowered under its laws to receive financing from 

IFAD. 

58. I am satisfied that the proposed financing will comply with the Agreement 

Establishing IFAD and the Policies and Criteria for IFAD Financing. 

VII. Recommendation 
59. I recommend that the Executive Board approve the proposed financing in terms of 

the following resolution: 

RESOLVED: that the Fund shall provide a loan on highly concessional terms to 

the Republic of the Niger in the amount of five million three hundred seventy 

thousand euros (EUR 5,370,000) and upon such terms and conditions as shall 

be substantially in accordance with the terms and conditions presented 

herein. 

RESOLVED FURTHER: that the Fund shall provide a Debt Sustainability 

Framework grant to the Republic of the Niger in the amount of five million 

three hundred seventy thousand euros (EUR 5,370,000) and upon such terms 

and conditions as shall be substantially in accordance with the terms and 

conditions presented herein.

Recommendation for approval

The Executive Board is invited to approve the recommendation for the proposed
financing to the Republic of Benin for the Agricultural Development and Market
Access Support Project, as contained in paragraph 56.

Proposed loan and grant to the Republic of Benin for the
Agricultural Development and Market Access Support
Project

I. Strategic context and rationale
A. Country and rural development and poverty context
1. As a result of the economic and institutional reforms introduced under the

Government Action Programme (PAG) “Revealing Benin”, the Beninese economy
has entered a new era of growth. In 2017, the country reported 5.5 per cent
growth in its GDP, compared with 4 per cent in 2016. Nevertheless, it still faces
significant challenges, with a poverty rate of more than 40 per cent; persistent
social and occupational inequalities to the detriment of women; food insecurity,
which affects 15 per cent of rural populations and 21 per cent of farm households;
and persistent unemployment (2.7 per cent) on top of a high level of
underemployment (72 per cent), largely among young adults. Added to these
constraints are the effects of climate change, which sap the resilience of
populations, especially in rural areas.

2. Agriculture is a strategic sector of the Beninese economy, contributing an average
of 23 per cent of GDP and 75 per cent of export revenues and generating around 70
per cent of the jobs. The National Investment Plan for Agriculture, Food and
Nutrition Security 2017-2021 five-year breakdown, prepared within the framework
of the Strategic Plan for Agricultural Development (PSDSA 2017-2025), is aimed at
maintaining annual GDP growth of at least 6 per cent during the period and
increasing the average annual income of rural households by 7.5 per cent.

B. Rationale and alignment with government priorities and the
results-based COSOP

3. PADAAM was chosen to implement the country strategic opportunities programme
(COSOP) for Benin 2018-2022 and is entirely under the agricultural component of
the PAG 2016-2021. It has two strategic objectives: (i) the productive capacity,
resilience to climate change and food and nutrition security of vulnerable rural
populations are sustainably improved; and (ii) access to agricultural output markets
is improved.

4. The national value-chain promotion strategy focuses on three conventional value
chains – rice, maize and cassava – with a view to improving food security and
increasing the income of rural populations. PADAAM will thus support the three
value chains stipulated in the PAG in order to: (i) bridge the food gap in terms of
the domestic demand for rice, only 56 per cent of which was met in 2017, thus
reducing the country’s dependence on mass imports of rice from the Asian market;
and (ii) maintain and increase the value added of maize and cassava in association
with the private sector, while developing trade with the subregional market.

5. In the conventional value-chain niche, PADAAM will support government efforts to
promote the value chains, ensuring household food security and creating value
added. It will be devoted entirely to supporting the implementation of national
development programmes in the value chains in question.



EB 2018/124/R.23/Rev.1

II. Project description
A. Intervention area and target group
6. In the current strategic context, characterized by the promotion of value chains and

“agro-clusters,” PADAAM will intervene in four agricultural development poles
(ADPs) with the potential for production and economic partnership development,
namely: (i) the south of pole 4, covering the department of Collines; (ii) pole 5,
covering the departments of Zou and Couffo; (iii) pole 6, confined to the
department of Plateau; and (iv) pole 7, which stretches to the departments of
Ouémé, Atlantique and Mono.1 The priority production areas in the ADPs will be
selected on the basis of a detailed study conducted prior to project start-up.

7. PADAAM’s target group will consist of the following categories: (i) smallholder
farmers and small rural entrepreneurs engaged in production or processing
activities in the three value chains (rice, maize and cassava); (ii) young adults from
family farms and/or young adults who have graduated and/or have some education
who wish to work in the value chains as first-time entrepreneurs, as well as young
entrepreneurs who are already active in the value chains or wish to take advantage
of the business opportunities they offer; (iii) agroentrepreneurs and downstream
actors in the value chains – for example, processors, merchants and individuals
involved in service activities and organized into small or medium-sized enterprises
or cooperatives; (iv) agricultural professional organizations (APOs) with different
degrees of organization and geographic positioning: grassroots farmers’
organizations, unions, federations, regional collaboration platforms and national
mixed groups of professionals.

8. PADAAM will reach 51,000 households and approximately 255,000 rural people,2
including smallholder farmers, farm youth, agroentrepreneurs and actors
downstream in the value chains, as well as professional organizations. This
approach is designed to target and favour women and young adults (aged 15-35),
who represent 40 per cent and 30 per cent of the beneficiaries, respectively.

B. Project development objective
9. PADAAM’s general objective is to reduce rural poverty in the project intervention

area by including stakeholders, both women and men, in diversified and profitable
value chains.

10. The project’s development objective is to sustainably increase the food and
nutrition security, as well as the income, of smallholder farmers, particularly
women and young adults.

11. Attainment of this objective will be measured by the following indicators:
(i) 204,000 low-income rural people benefitting from upward economic mobility, 40
per cent of them women and 30 per cent of them young adults; (ii) an increase in
the yield per hectare of maize, rice and cassava; (iii) at least a 30 per cent increase
in the income of 80 per cent of the beneficiaries; (iv) more than 400 production
partnerships, bringing together some 1,600 organizations, and close to
50,000 smallholder farmers developed; (v) 80 per cent of supported rural
businesses reporting higher profits; and (vi) 1,100 young adults engaged in
business initiatives in the three targeted value chains.

C. Components/outcomes
12. PADAAM will be implemented over a six-year period (2019-2024) and will have

three investment components: (i) strengthening partnerships and creating value
added (EUR 39.4 million, or 44 per cent of the total cost); (ii) improving agricultural

productivity and production (EUR 40.1 million, or 44.8 per cent of the total cost);
and (iii) coordination and management under the IFAD Rural Intervention
Framework Programme in Benin (ProCar) (EUR 10 million, or 11.2 per cent of the
total cost).

13. Component 1: Strengthening partnerships and creating value added. This
component should result in: (i) the formalization of sustainable economic
relationships between smallholder farmers and the private sector; (ii) an increase in
the volume of raw materials processed in the three value chains and sold on the
domestic and international market; (iii) a significant increase in the income of
smallholder farmers; and (iv) strengthening of the institutional and governance
base of professional organizations.

14. Component 2: Improving agricultural productivity and production. This
component is aimed at increasing the average yield per hectare by around 44 per
cent, with production in the three targeted value chains reaching the volumes
specified in the PSDSA for 2021. Under this component, PADAAM will also
participate in increasing the availability and quality of infrastructure for production
and implementation support, with the following as the main indicators:
2,500 hectares of wetlands improved, 91 storage facilities rehabilitated or built and
250 km of feeder roads built.

15. Component 3: Coordination and management under ProCar (Coordination,
monitoring and evaluation and knowledge management). Implementation of
this component will be based on the programme approach used in the creation of
ProCar and the reforms to the territorialization of agricultural development adopted
by the Government. This framework programme governs the administrative and
fiduciary management of all projects in IFAD’s portfolio in Benin, and supports the
shared functions of monitoring and evaluation, knowledge management,
communication, targeting and youth support.

III. Project execution
A. Approach
16. Geographic approach. Benin has chosen the geographic approach for agricultural

development, and PADAAM will endorse it. This new approach will be implemented
through the ADPs under the new institutional architecture that gives the territorial
agricultural development agencies (ATDA) technical coordination functions that
cover the ADPs and the promotion of value chains, making the departmental
bureaus of agriculture, livestock and fisheries responsible for the regulation of the
interventions and geographic monitoring and evaluation at the territorial level.

17. Value-chain approach. PADAAM supports a change in paradigm centred on the
sustainable creation of value added through the promotion of inclusive economic
partnerships that link smallholder farmers and their organizations with the private
sector and the market in the three priority value chains.

18. Outsourcing approach. The project will employ an inclusive outsourcing approach
to implementing the activities related to partnerships, employing a mechanism
involving different consulting and facilitation firms whose services will be
coordinated by international technical assistance in direct support of project
coordination. This approach will also help to bring young adults into the workforce
through on-the-job training provided by experienced training centres selected for a
customized partnership.

B. Organizational framework
19. PADAAM will be overseen by the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries and

be part of ProCar’s organic framework. ProCar’s National Steering Committee (CNP)
will be expanded to PADAAM with the participation of new stakeholders and/or focal



EB 2018/124/R.23/Rev.1

4

points. Four participatory territorial planning committees will be created in the four
ADPs in question – the south of pole 4, pole 5 and poles 6 and 7).

20. PADAAM’s execution will involve an array of complementary functions divided into
two categories: (i) the country programme functions already established in ProCar
(financial administration and management, procurement, monitoring and
evaluation, communication and knowledge management, gender, young adults and
targeting, etc.); and (ii) specific technical functions, which will be buttressed by
technical assistance.

21. In the ADPs, PADAAM will be implemented by the ATDAs, which will be supported
with technical assistance under a mandate governed by a clear and assured exit
strategy with a three-year horizon, capacity building and the acquisition of
competencies by the ATDAs. ProCar programme functions in the four ADPs will be
guaranteed by two regional support units.

C. Planning, monitoring and evaluation, learning and knowledge
management

22. The planning and budgeting of PADAAM activities will be built on the work
programmes and annual budgets, prepared using a bottom-up approach. The
participatory territorial planning committees will meet in the ADPs each year to
validate the work programmes and annual budget, which will ultimately be
submitted to ProCar for approval during the annual sessions of the CNP.

23. The PADAAM monitoring and evaluation system will be anchored in the ProCar
system and implement a results-based management system, using the programme
approach adopted in 2016 and the monitoring and coordination mechanism of the
National Value-chain Development Programmes fostered by the ATDAs responsible
for their coordination. The system will be buttressed by: (i) monitoring and
evaluation assistants assigned to the regional support units, (ii) the creation of a
data-gathering mechanism and tools to ensure optimal and regular information
about the PADAAM’s chain of results, and (iii) the ProCar database, along with
those of the ATDAs in the ADPs.

24. Learning, knowledge management and communication. PADAAM will base its
learning and knowledge management system on ProCar’s monitoring and
evaluation mechanism. A management plan will be prepared at project start-up to
specify the different communication products and tools that should be developed,
the most suitable formats and support for the different types of users and the
frequency with which these products and tools should be developed.

D. Financial management, procurement and governance
25. Financial management. This will be based on the ProCar mechanisms and

procedures for the execution of portfolio operations. Resource management will
follow country and IFAD procedures. ProCar will prepare the financial statements,
which it will regularly transmit to the Government and IFAD.

26. Procurement. The works and supplies, as well as the consulting and advisory
services necessary for the project, will be delivered in accordance with the current
Benin procurement code, insofar as they are aligned with IFAD’s procurement
mechanisms. Within the framework of productive partnerships and rural
microenterprise promotion, the beneficiaries – farmers’ organizations and young
promoters of rural enterprises – will participate in procurement through the specific
modalities defined in the manuals.

27. Governance. PADAAM will apply the principles of good governance: (i) to the
national orientation and monitoring committee’s mobilization and participation
mechanism through Benin’s civil society stakeholders’ platform; (ii) thanks to the
territorial decentralization groups’ involvement in creating facilitating infrastructure
for the implementation of productive partnerships; (iii) through beneficiary



EB 2018/124/R.23/Rev.1

5

participation in the planning and evaluation of investments; and (iv) by overseeing
the implementation of partnership business plans by farmers’ organizations.

E. Supervision
28. PADAAM supervision will consist of two supervision missions per year, organized

and conducted jointly by IFAD, the Government and the principal stakeholders,
notably the members of the CNP and the ADP participatory territorial planning
committees. Supervision will be conducted using the new online Operational Results
Management System, which will facilitate the updating of data and information on
the project’s status. The first supervision mission will essentially support project
start-up by establishing the implementation mechanism at all levels, finalizing the
mandates, and issuing the tender documents for the baseline studies and other
priority activities. The supervision missions will particularly emphasize
implementation monitoring, achievement of the results, outcomes and impacts and
the effectiveness of institutional and technical outcomes intended for consolidation
and replication on a large scale. Specific implementation support missions can also
be organized as needed.

IV. Project costs, financing and benefits
A. Project costs
29. The total cost of PADAAM, including provisions for physical contingencies and price

increases, is EUR 89.5 million. The base cost is EUR 84.1 million. The amount for
physical and financial contingencies is EUR 5.4 million. Taxes, which are included,
come to EUR 8.4 million.

30. Project costs can be broken down into the following components: (i) strengthening
of partnerships and creation of value added: evaluated at EUR 39.4 million, or
44 per cent of the total project cost; (ii) improvement of agricultural productivity
and production: EUR 40.1 million, or 44.8 per cent of the total project cost; and
(iii) coordination, monitoring and evaluation and knowledge management:
EUR 10 million, or 11.2 per cent of the total project cost.

B. Project financing
31. The project financing plan is as follows:

(i) IFAD, for a total of EUR 26.6 million, or 29.8 per cent of the total project cost
(50 per cent in the form of a loan granted under highly concessional terms
and 50 per cent in the form of a grant through the Debt Sustainability
Framework), under the PBAS 2016-2018 cycle;

(ii) OFID, for EUR 8.6 million, or 9.6 per cent of the total project cost;

(iii) The private sector, for EUR 4.8 million, or 5.4 per cent of the total project
cost;

(iv) Financial institutions, for EUR 1.1 million, or 1.2 per cent of the total project
cost;

(v) Beninese Government, for EUR 8.4 million, or 9.4 per cent of the total project
cost; and

(vi) Beneficiaries, for EUR 2.8 million, or 3.2 per cent of the total project cost.

32. This yields a financing gap of EUR 37.2 million, or 41.6 per cent of the total project
cost, which can be filled by future allocations from IFAD (through financing
modalities to be determined, based on internal procedures and approval by the
Executive Board), or any other source of financing to be determined in the course
of project implementation. The financing from the Beninese Government consists
solely of the exemption of duties and taxes on project acquisitions.

C. Summary benefit and economic analysis
33. Financial analysis. PADAAM’s financial analysis examined: (i) smallholder maize

and cassava farmers; (ii) small wetlands operations; and (iii) different types of
partnership initiatives between farmers and the private sector in the form of simple
partnerships, public-private-producer partnerships (4P) and co-enterprises. The
analysis was aimed at determining the feasibility of the activities in terms of the
return on investment throughout the project and ensuring that the funds invested
came from the farmer, the project or a credit institution. It consisted, on the one
hand, of evaluating farmers’ capacity to generate net positive results, and on the
other, of analysing their financial situation to ensure that financial equilibrium was
maintained for the continuity of the activity, bearing in mind the conditions of
access to credit in the project area and the cofinancing rules established for the
project. The results, summarized in the table below, indicate that all the models
included have a satisfactory financial return.

34. Economic results and sensitivity analysis. Given the wide range of activities
foreseen, PADAAM will have many economic benefits, the totality of which cannot
be addressed in calculating the economic return indicators, such as the economic
internal rate of return (EIRR) and the net present value (NPV). Nevertheless, the
analysis covers the project’s main benefits and the resulting support for production
(rice, maize and cassava), support for the creation and strengthening of
stakeholder partnerships (simple contracting, 4Ps, co-enterprises) and the
rehabilitation of rural feeder roads.

35. The project’s EIRR is established at 18.9 per cent, and the NPV, with an economic
opportunity cost of capital of 6 per cent, at EUR 54.2 million. This is a very
satisfactory result, all the more so because certain benefits could not be included in
the calculations due to insufficient data for their evaluation – for example, the
effects of capacity building and the construction of storage facilities, which have
improved food security. Overall, the project will have a positive impact on the
entire economy and especially on women and young adults, who are its priority
target groups.

36. The sensitivity analysis yields very robust results. Even in the case of a 30 per cent
drop in income, a 50 per cent increase in costs or a two-year lag in profits, the
economic rate of return remains largely above the opportunity cost of capital (6 per
cent), and the NPV, at more than EUR 20.6 million. Calculation of the switching
values shows that, all things being equal, the project’s economic return will be nil
only if its profits fall by 56 per cent or its costs increase by 125 per cent.

D. Sustainability
37. PADAAM will develop and/or improve the sustainability of the investments made at

different levels of the ADPs, thanks to its approach aimed at guaranteeing their
ownership by the beneficiaries and furthering beneficiary empowerment, thereby
limiting backsliding after project completion. The dynamics of the programme
approach in place since the advent of ProCar will consolidate the synergy of the
interventions and strengthen the sustainability of the achievements.

38. PADAAM’s actions will contribute to: (i) the institutional sustainability of farmers’
organizations and mixed groups of professionals in the targeted value chains, and
the strengthening of ATDAs through institutional support; (ii) the economic and
financial viability of the actors involved in the partnerships and business initiatives
developed by farmers’ organizations or young rural entrepreneurs; (iii) on the one



EB 2018/124/R.23/Rev.1

9

hand, the sustainability of the infrastructure that will be built in collaboration with
the decentralized territorial groups during implementation of their communal
development plans, and on the other, the involvement of the beneficiaries, who will
be organized to ensure the sustainable maintenance and management of the
infrastructure and facilities; and (iv) environmental sustainability and the promotion
of measures to increase target groups’ resilience to climate change. In addition, the
results of the sensitivity test performed as part of the economic and financial
analysis show the robustness of the project in the face of risks.

E. Risk identification and mitigation
39. The main risks for PADAAM are associated with: (i) the innovative nature of the

value-chain approach in the ADPs: (ii) the recent advent of the ATDAs as overseers
of the execution of the national value-chain promotion strategy; (iii) the weak
structure of the value chains’ APOs, and (iv) external factors, such as climate
change. These risks have been clearly identified and mitigation measures put in
place, among them: (i) the strengthening of ATDA technical functions and the
gradual transfer of project supervision; (ii) support for the establishment of APOs
and the improvement of their governance; (iii) the dissemination of drought-
resistant varieties, cultivation systems and conservation practices in agriculture;
and (iv) agricultural insurance. The project’s environmental and social risks put it in
Category “B.” The risks associated with climate change are considered moderate.

V. Corporate considerations
A. Compliance with IFAD policies

40. IFAD Strategic Framework 2016-2025. PADAAM is aligned with IFAD’s Strategic
Framework 2016-2025, which fosters inclusive and sustainable transformation of
the rural world. PADAAM will engage in activities aimed at the attainment of IFAD’s
three strategic objectives, which are to: (i) increase poor rural people’s productive
capacity; (ii) increase poor rural people’s benefits from market participation; and
(iii) strengthen the environmental sustainability and climate resilience of poor rural
people’s economic activities.

41. COSOP 2018-2022. PADAAM is included in IFAD’s strategy note for Benin, which
pursues the following strategic objectives: (i) Productive capacity, resilience to
climate change, and food and nutrition security of vulnerable rural populations are
sustainably improved; and (ii) access to agricultural output markets is improved.

42. IFAD strategy on climate change. The project is aligned with the IFAD strategy
on climate change, especially the following objectives: (i) support innovative
approaches to make smallholder farmers, both women and men, more resilient to
climate change; (ii) help smallholder farmers take advantage of the available
measures and financing to mitigate its effects; and (iii) establish a more coherent
dialogue on climate change, rural development, agriculture and food security.

43. Natural resource and environmental management. PADAAM is aligned with
IFAD’s Environment and Natural Resource Management Policy (2011) and is based
on the following guiding principles: (i) engagement in value chains to drive green
growth (principle 5); and (ii) promote climate-smart approaches to rural
development (principle 3).

44. IFAD targeting strategy. The project’s targeting strategy espouses IFAD’s policy,
which is based on targeting that is geographic, direct and self-targeting. PADAAM
engages with poor rural people, women and young adults, the priority beneficiaries
at the heart of IFAD interventions. The different profiles of the target groups have
been considered in the project support, notably through an analysis by sex and
age, as well as wherewithal (degree of wealth). PADAAM also integrates the issues
of gender and youth in its targeting and throughout the project’s life cycle. The
development of gender and youth targeting strategies and mechanisms was



EB 2018/124/R.23/Rev.1

10

introduced during the project design phase. These strategies also sought to devise
measures to promote empowerment, facilitation, and execution during its
implementation. The project will also ensure that these elements are well-
integrated during results monitoring and impact assessment.

45. Integration of smallholder farmers and the private sector in agricultural
value chains. PADAAM’s development approach is focused on value chains and
based on an overall analysis of the entire value chain (for each of the three value
chains – rice, maize and cassava). The value-chain approach adopted considers all
stakeholders in each of them (in addition to poor rural people, young adults, and
women, who are IFAD’s main target group) and their interactions. The market is
considered a driving force, and the activities are based on an assessment of the
demand and the capacity of markets to absorb additional production. PADAAM
encourages private-sector engagement to promote the forging of 4P partnerships
that facilitate access to markets.

46. Social, environmental and climate evaluation procedures. Aligned.

B. Alignment and harmonization
47. PADAAM is aligned with the PAG and the PSDSA 2025, whose implementation it

supports by concentrating on the strategy to promote the three conventional value
chains. Project execution will respect the principles of coordination by value chain
established at the sector level and will support implementation of the national
development plans for these value chains overseen by the ATDAs.

48. In addition to the usual services, ProCar aims at fostering greater complementarity
between PADAAM and IFAD-funded operations, in alignment with the Adapted Rural
Financing Services Promotion Project and the Market Gardening Development
Support Project.

49. PADAAM’s targeting will consider the presence of the other bilateral and multilateral
partners operating in the project areas and the need for complementarity. In order
to ensure good coordination in the value chains, prior to start-up a study will be
conducted to update the intervention plan with the support of other technical and
financial partners such as the French Development Agency, German cooperation,
Belgian cooperation, Swiss cooperation, Netherlands cooperation, Canadian
cooperation, the European Union, the African Development Bank, the World Food
Programme, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the World
Bank, etc.

C. Innovation and scaling up
50. PADAAM is one of the first development projects formulated under the PAG. It will

support the national strategy to promote ADPs, innovatively combining the
geographic and value-chain approaches.

51. PADAAM will replicate IFAD’s strategy to further the social and economic inclusion
of poor rural people and scale up successful integrated and innovative approaches
to agricultural value-chain development in order to promote intensified use of
innovative production and processing technologies, efficient agricultural and
agro-industrial contracting practices and appropriate financing and risk
management mechanisms in the agricultural production system. While employing a
diachronic approach, the PADAAM design values the achievements of the recently
sunsetted IFAD interventions – that is, the Rural Development Support Programme
and the Rural Economic Growth Support Project.

D. Policy engagement
52. The project is aimed at grassroots capacity building, especially through

consolidation of the technical, economic, organizational, and operational
competencies of APOs (unions and federations) and mixed groups of professionals.



EB 2018/124/R.23/Rev.1

11

The goal is to endow their structures for representation with greater legitimacy and
enable them to actively participate in policy-making.

VI. Legal instruments and authority
53. A financing agreement between the Republic of Benin and IFAD is the legal

instrument under whose terms the proposed financing will be granted to the
borrower/beneficiary. A copy of the negotiated financing agreement is attached as
appendix I.

54. The Republic of Benin is authorized under its laws to receive financing from IFAD.

Recommendation for approval

The Executive Board is invited to approve the recommendation for the proposed
financing to Republic of the Union of Myanmar for the Western States Agribusiness
Project, as contained in paragraph 54.

Proposed loan and grant to the Republic of the Union of
Myanmar for the Western States Agribusiness Project

I. Strategic context and rationale
A. Country and rural development and poverty context

1. Emerging from 50 years of isolation, Myanmar has embarked on a comprehensive
path of political and economic reforms since 2011. These aim to introduce elements
of popular representation into the political sphere, foster economic growth and
inclusive social development, improve the business environment, attract foreign
investment and reduce poverty.

2. Myanmar’s population was estimated at 53.9 million in 2015, of which some
66 per cent is rural. Myanmar is ethnically diverse, with eight major ethnic groups
and 135 subgroups.

3. Despite being resource-rich, Myanmar is one of the poorest nations in South-East
Asia. An estimated one third of the population were living below the poverty line in
2005, but this proportion had dropped to one fourth by 2014. The 2015 Human
Development Report ranked the country 148th among the 188 nations rated, with a
human development index of 0.536. Myanmar’s per capita gross national income
was estimated at US$1,160 in 2015. The annual growth rate of gross domestic
product accelerated from 4.8 per cent in 2011 to 7.2 per cent in 2015, while
inflation was reported at 8.4 per cent at the end of that year.

4. The agriculture sector is the core of the economy, generating 37 per cent of GDP
and employing about 70 per cent of the working population in 2015. There is a
strong association between agriculture and poverty; and there is significantly
greater poverty in rural areas. The incidence of poverty is also higher among ethnic
groups compared to the majority population.

5. Disparities exist among and within states and within communities. Rural poverty is
largely a function of poor resource endowments. The rural poor are typically
landless people and small and marginal farmers, usually owning between less than
one and five acres of land. They lack access to adequate food and to essential non-
food items and services. Many of the poorest live in isolated hill tracts and upland
areas of ethnic states, which were previously ravaged by decades of civil conflict
that left them isolated and without development investment.

B. Rationale and alignment with government priorities and
RB-COSOP

6. IFAD’s strategy in Myanmar is to support the Government in creating a model for
agricultural modernization and rural transformation in each agroecological zone of
the country. The first investment – the Fostering Agricultural Revitalization in
Myanmar (FARM project) – created the model for agricultural development, service
delivery and enterprise growth in the central dry zone. This model is now being
scaled up by development partners and the Government across the entire dry zone.
The second investment – the Eastern States Agribusiness Project – establishes the



EB 2018/LOT/P.6/Rev.1

2

model for agribusiness development and community agroforestry, and will create
farming and employment opportunities across the eastern hilly zone for ethnic
groups, indigenous people, ex-combatants, and returning migrants. The third
investment – the Western States Agribusiness Project – to be financed under the
2016-2018 performance-based allocation system (PBAS) cycle – creates the model
for climate-resilient agricultural transformation from subsistence to commercial
livelihoods, to be implemented across the western upland areas and forests. With
these projects, IFAD is fulfilling its strategic objective of helping the Government
create optimal models for modernizing agriculture across agroecological zones, with
a strong focus on the ethnic states.

7. The project’s rationale is anchored in the Government’s policies to reduce economic
and social disparities in rural areas. It is consistent with the National
Comprehensive Development Plan, the Framework for Economic and Social
Reforms, and the Poverty Alleviation and Rural Development Action Plan. The
project’s rationale has four dimensions: (i) to provide a systemic structural
response to the challenges of, and opportunities for, rural transformation in
southern Chin and northern Magway; (ii) to create a model for the environmentally
sustainable modernization of agriculture in degraded sloping areas, which generates
economic benefits for poor households; (iii) to rehabilitate productive infrastructure
in ways that optimize sustainable use of the natural resource base; and (iv) to
forge pathways for communities to transition from subsistence to commercial
livelihoods through better access to inputs, knowledge and services. Activities for
livelihood-support and nutrition-sensitive agriculture have also been included, to
address important needs among local communities.

II. Project description
A. Project area and target group
8. The project is located in southern Chin State and the northern Magway Region,

which share a common river basin. These areas have among the highest
concentrations of poverty in Myanmar. Chin State is located in the hilly western
border area. Its people belong to the Chin ethnic group and its 53 officially
recognized subgroups. Southern Chin is home to some of the most remote and
isolated communities in the country. Magway Region is situated in the central dry
zone, and its population is mostly of the Bamar ethnic group. The region is poor
and food-insecure, and has suffered a series of natural calamities and major
harvest losses in recent years.

9. The project’s target groups consist of: (i) small and medium-scale farming
households in upland and lowland areas; (ii) livestock producers; and
(iii) non-farming and landless households. Women and women-led households will
be prioritized; and youth, as the primary agents of change at the community level,
will be the focus of activities involving technological innovation and
commercialization.

B. Project development objective
10. The project’s goal is to improve the social and economic status of rural households

in a climate-resilient manner in the northern Magway Region and southern
Chin State. Its objective is to increase household incomes and enhance food
security and nutrition quality. Its investments focus on commodities and services
that have comparative advantage, market demand and growth potential.

C. Components/outcomes
11. The project’s two expected outcomes are: (i) access to productive and social

infrastructure is improved; and (ii) technological, financial and policy environment
for small farmers and agribusinesses is enhanced.



EB 2018/LOT/P.6/Rev.1

3

12. Component 1: Infrastructure. The project will finance strategic investments in
productive and social infrastructure.

13. Subcomponent 1.1: Productive infrastructure. The project will finance:
(i) rehabilitation of irrigation schemes to ensure an adequate and reliable supply of
water to farms; (ii) rural access roads linking farms to markets; (iii) irrigation
technology for home gardens to ensure food security and nutritional diversity; and,
(iv) land consolidation on a pilot basis. These investments will generate
opportunities for increased incomes, reduce on-farm and off-farm production costs,
and improve food security for communities and households. They will also improve
water management, reduce water conveyance and application losses by
30-40 per cent, improve drainage and reduce siltation, and conserve groundwater.

14. Subcomponent 1.2: Social infrastructure. The project will invest in social
infrastructure facilities mainly at the household level, particularly targeting the
needs of women and the poorest households. Domestic water supply, rainwater
harvesting, and renewable energy solutions will be eligible for support. Scheme
selection will be participatory, sensitive to cultural considerations, and subject to
social, technical, financial and environmental feasibility. The ownership,
management, operation and maintenance of all facilities constructed will be
optimized to ensure sustainability.

15. Subcomponent 1.3: Capacity-building. The project will build capacities in the
Irrigation and Water Utilization Management Department and the Department of
Rural Development of the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Irrigation (MoALI) –
responsible for productive and social infrastructure respectively. This will be done
through the provision of technical assistance; strengthening of staffing and office
facilities; awareness of water, sanitation and hygiene issues; awareness of
nutritional diversity; and capacity development for social mobilization.

16. Component 2: Services. The project will invest in agricultural modernization and
enabling services to optimize resource management, productivity and benefits in
areas of infrastructure investment.

17. Subcomponent 2.1: Agricultural modernization. The project will invest in a
range of agriculture, livestock and technical services to modernize production and
trigger improvements in food security and nutrition, livelihoods, and economic
returns. Services delivered to farming households will include land titling,
technology transfer, skill development, access to inputs and supplies, access to
markets and information, contractual linkages, and access to financial resources.
Climate-resilient sloping agricultural land technology will be promoted. Services
delivered to the landless will focus on technical and business management skills,
microenterprise development and private-sector linkages.

18. Subcomponent 2.2: Financial services. Building on FARM experiences, the
project will support financial inclusion for small farmers, livestock owners and the
landless, ensuring equal access for ethnic groups and women. It will invest in:
(i) savings and credit groups, promoting financial literacy; (ii) a rural business fund
to support microenterprises; (iii) an agribusiness fund to help agribusinesses set up
processing facilities in the project area; and (iv) a line of credit to refinance project-
related agriculture, livestock and enterprise-lending operations by licensed financial
institutions.

19. Subcomponent 2.3: Policy engagement. The project will contribute to an
inclusive and evidence-based policy framework for rural development in Myanmar,
specifically related to the project’s implementation experiences. It will focus on:
(i) transition from shifting to sedentary agriculture and associated customary land
laws; (ii) re-categorization of high-value commercial crops from non-timber forest
products to agricultural or industrial crops; and (iii) agricultural service delivery and
market linkages.



EB 2018/LOT/P.6/Rev.1

III. Project implementation
ApproachA.

20. Based on an institutional assessment at the state level, experience in similar
contexts and the country strategy, the project’s implementation approach is to:
(i) strengthen MoALI and other relevant agencies at the state level, and increase
their responsibilities for implementing activities in a sequenced manner; (ii) engage
with reputable implementing partners to serve as lead technical agencies and to
gradually devolve responsibilities to public agencies as their capacities mature;
(iii) establish small state-level project implementation offices (PIOs) for
coordinating implementation at state level and for monitoring and reporting on
progress ; and (iv) establish a project management unit (PMU) in the Department
of Rural Development (DRD) that will be integrated within DRD structures. The PMU
will be responsible for project implementation, fiduciary management, work
planning and budgeting, monitoring and evaluation (M&E), and policy interface
functions. It will manage contracts with implementing partners and public and
private entities.

B. Organizational framework
21. MoALI, in its capacity as lead project agency, will be responsible and accountable

for the project. The DRD of MoALI will be the project's focal department. The
Ministry of Planning and Finance will enter into subsidiary financing agreements
(SFA) with selected licensed financial institutions for administration of the credit
line.

22. The project will be governed by a National Project Steering Committee and two
project coordination committees (one in each location). It will be managed by the
central PMU established within DRD and the two decentralized PIOs (one in each
location).

23. The project will be executed by implementing partners, MoALI at the state level,
and the private sector. They will lead social mobilization, community interfacing and
policy engagement. Infrastructure will be implemented by the Irrigation and Water
Utilization Management Department (IWUMD) and DRD, in collaboration with
private-sector engineering firms and contractors, as required. Agricultural
modernization will be implemented by MoALI knowledge centres (KCs), brokering
services and markets for the target groups, in collaboration with producer
associations and community organizations. Financial services will be provided by
licensed financial institutions.

C. Planning, monitoring and evaluation, and learning and
knowledge management

24. Planning. The annual work plan and budget will be the key management tool for
planning, monitoring and reporting on the implementation of activities. It will be
based on project design, cost tables and the implementation manual; and it will be
informed by operational experiences and challenges. The logical framework will
constitute the main reference for framing annual work plan and budgets, to create
clear linkages among proposed activities, budget requirements and expected
outputs, outcomes and impacts. A participatory planning approach will be applied,
to ensure that project investments reflect the target groups’ needs and aspirations.

25. Monitoring and evaluation. The project’s M&E system will be designed to provide
reliable information to facilitate results-based management. It will be aligned with
the M&E system developed under the FARM, and will help strengthen MoALI’s
system for monitoring the effectiveness of official development assistance. The M&E
system will have a three-tier structure: (i) output monitoring, focusing on physical
and financial inputs, activities and outputs; (ii) outcome monitoring, focusing on the
use of outputs and measurement of benefits at the household and community



EB 2018/LOT/P.6/Rev.1

5

levels; and (iii) impact assessment, evaluating impacts against objectives. All M&E
data, analysis, and reporting will be disaggregated by poverty status, gender, and
ethnicity.

26. Learning and knowledge management. The project’s learning system will be
structured at the state, region and central levels. It will capture information on
progress, lessons and solutions to implementation constraints. A consolidated
annual project review will be performed towards the end of each fiscal year, to
assess physical and financial progress against the targets and towards the
objectives.

27. Knowledge management will be a systematic feature throughout the project. To
enable effective knowledge management and sharing, results and lessons from the
project will be systematically documented through specific studies and knowledge
products commissioned by the PMU and/or the PIOs. The M&E system will be a key
knowledge source. Innovations observed during implementation will be documented
for possible scaling up. The MoALI and PMU will be responsible for sharing
knowledge documents through dedicated websites, workshops and seminars.

D. Financial management, procurement and governance
28. As fiduciary risks are high in Myanmar, the project will apply a number of mitigating

measures: (i) financial reporting based on automated systems; (ii) competitive
recruitment of qualified staff; (iii) use of a financial management manual
integrating controls with operations; (iv) technical assistance and external
oversight; (v) a control framework integrating periodic internal audits and
independent external audits; and (vi) a good governance framework to ensure
accountability and transparency.

29. Financial management. The PMU will be responsible for all aspects of project
financial management, including budgeting, financial statements and reporting,
withdrawal applications for IFAD disbursements, and the coordination of audit
processes.

30. Flow of funds. Designated accounts in United States dollars will be opened for the
IFAD loan and the IFAD grant, and will be operated using the imprest method. Bank
accounts denominated in local currency will be opened at the PMU level, with
signatories at appropriate level for operational efficiency.

31. Financial reporting. The PMU will maintain separate accounts for the project, in
accordance with the cash basis of accounting. The financial statements prepared for
the project will be supplemented with additional data as necessary, so as to provide
minimum disclosures under international accounting standards.

32. Project expenditure will be recorded using the accounting software currently used
by the PMU of another ongoing project in MoALI. Further customization is foreseen
to enhance the software’s reporting capability.

33. Taxes. IFAD’s General Conditions for Agricultural Development Financing, adopted
in 2009 and amended in 2014, allow IFAD financing to be used to pay taxes. The
payment of taxes with IFAD funding is foreseen for the project. The Ministry of
Planning and Finance has formally requested IFAD to cover taxes on the basis that
tax exemption is impractical and the tax burden is low.

34. Audit. The project will be audited by the Office of the Auditor General of the Union
(OAG), which has adopted INTOSAI audit standards. OAG conducts mostly financial
audits, with some procurement and performance audits.

35. Procurement. IFAD procurement guidelines will apply to the project. The
programme implementation manual will specify detailed procurement requirements
and procedures. The procurement methods, prior review arrangements, cost and
time estimates, and risk mitigation measures will be defined in the Letter to the



EB 2018/LOT/P.6/Rev.1

Borrower and reflected in the procurement plan. Technical assistance will be
provided to develop PMU and PIO procurement capacities.

E. Supervision
36. The project will be supervised by IFAD. A supervision and implementation support

mission will be undertaken annually; and MoALI offices at the central, state and
regional levels will participate in these missions. A midterm review mission will be
undertaken jointly by IFAD and the Government at the end of the third year of
implementation, to assess the progress, achievements, constraints, emerging
impact and likely sustainability of project activities, and to make recommendations
and any adjustments for the remaining project period.

IV. Project costs, financing, and benefits
A. Project costs
37. The total project cost, including duties, taxes and contingencies, is estimated at

US$20.26 million over a six-year implementation period. Indicative costs for each
component are detailed in table 1. Indicative costs by expenditure categories are
provided in table 2.

Disbursement categories will be specified in schedule 2 of the negotiated financing agreement. A maximum of six disbursement categories is
envisaged to allow sufficient flexibility during implementation.

C. Summary benefit and economic analysis
39. The project is expected to directly benefit 76,810 households, of which 10,190 in

Chin and 66,620 in Magway, encompassing a total of 390,410 rural women and
men. Many additional households will indirectly benefit from project activities. The
estimated project cost per beneficiary household is US$327.

40. Project benefits will be generated from improved infrastructure, land tenure,
agricultural technology, market access, enterprise growth and financial services.
The main beneficiaries will be small farming households, landless/tenant
households, and off-farm households. The key results will be higher incomes,
additional jobs, better food security and nutrition, and secured climate resilience.

41. The project’s economic internal rate of return over 20 years is estimated at
32 per cent.

D. Sustainability
42. The sustainability of project investments is based on the underlying business

relationships that the project will generate between small farmers and markets, and
between enterprises and markets. Global development experiences have shown
that profitable business relationships are an optimal instrument for making
investments sustainable and for breaking the cycle of dependency and poverty.

43. Project sustainability is also based on: (i) access to knowledge: KCs will be low-cost
facilities that will eventually operate on a cost recovery basis; (ii) access to
markets: upgraded commodity chains, contract farming and outgrower schemes
will ensure smallholder access to markets; (iii) access to land: the project will
invest in securing land tenure and ownership, particularly in Chin State; (iv) access
to water: irrigation and drainage improvement, combined with participatory water
management, will improve water distribution and operation and maintenance;
(v) access to basic needs: social infrastructure will cover underlying needs related
to food security, nutrition, and domestic water supply; (vi) access to finance:
financial inclusion activities will link smallholders and landless microentrepreneurs
to the formal financial sector; and (vii) access to extension: use of MoALI extension
officers as KC managers trained by the project will ensure continuity in service
delivery.



EB 2018/LOT/P.6/Rev.1

44. Exit strategy. The project’s exit strategy is to strengthen public institutions at the
central and state levels, to rely on a range of institutional service providers for
implementation, to foster profitable business relationships among producers and
markets, and to improve the capabilities of poor rural women and men.

E. Risk identification and mitigation
45. The project’s main risks are in the governance, expropriation, fiduciary and capacity

areas. They will be mitigated by a robust project governance framework, a set of
legal assurances to be negotiated with the Government, substantial technical
assistance and capacity-building, and the underlying business relationships to be
fostered.

V. Corporate considerations
Compliance with IFAD policiesA.

46. The project’s goal and objectives are aligned with the Strategic Framework
2016-2025 in terms of market-driven smallholder development and rural business
growth. It is compliant with all relevant IFAD policies, strategies and guidelines,
and in particular with the Fund’s policies on targeting, rural finance, land tenure,
Engagement with Indigenous Peoples, and Gender Equality and Women’s
Empowerment, as well as with the partnership and climate change strategies, and
the Policy on Preventing Fraud and Corruption.

Alignment and harmonizationB.
47. The project’s rationale is anchored in IFAD’s poverty reduction mandate and the

Government’s policy for reducing economic and social disparities in rural areas. It is
consistent with Myanmar’s National Comprehensive Development Plan, the
Framework for Economic and Social Reforms, and the Poverty Alleviation and Rural
Development Action Plan. It is closely coordinated with the emerging agriculture
sector investments of multilateral and bilateral development partners, and with the
Agriculture and Rural Development Sector Working Group.

Innovations and scaling upC.
48. Innovation. The project is the first substantial investment in Myanmar’s western

states to address the climate change challenges posed by erratic rainfall, intra- and
inter-annual drought, and record high temperatures that are undermining farm
productivity and the livelihood options of the rural poor. It introduces several
innovations in its model for climate-smart agricultural development in the
upland/lowland areas of the western states. Key innovations in the Myanmar
context include: (i) introduction of sloping agricultural land technology;
(ii) promotion of climate-smart agricultural practices and technologies;
(iii) livelihood diversification, with potential for greater value-added; (iv) promotion
of smallholder-driven small businesses and microenterprises; and (v) support for
adapted rural finance products and services.

49. Scaling up potential. Given the transient nature of the current agriculture sector
regulatory framework in Myanmar, particularly in view of the major political
changes that occurred in 2015, there is an important window of opportunity for
scaling up the methodologies and results pioneered by IFAD-financed operations in
Myanmar. The country programme is engaging in this in two ways: (i) successful
service delivery models are already being replicated and brought to scale in other
parts of the country by the Government, partners, and the private sector; and
(ii) policy engagement opens avenues for scaling up investments based on
implementation experiences, the fostering of stakeholder alliances to capture policy
proposals, capacity-building for policy development, and the promotion of policy
advocacy within national processes.



EB 2018/LOT/P.6/Rev.1

Policy engagementD.
50. The project will contribute to an inclusive and evidence-based policy framework for

rural development in Myanmar, specifically related to the project’s implementation
experiences. It will support formulation of the policies and regulations needed to
enhance and sustain project investments, and to contribute to the ongoing policy
discussions on broader agricultural modernization and rural transformation. Policy
engagement will also aim at scaling up successful approaches in other states and
regions of the country, and will contribute to the project’s exit strategy.

VI. Legal instruments and authority
51. A project financing agreement between the Republic of the Union of Myanmar and

IFAD will constitute the legal instrument for extending the proposed financing to the
borrower/recipient. A copy of the negotiated financing agreement is attached in
appendix I.

52. The Republic of the Union of Myanmar is empowered under its laws to receive
financing from IFAD.

53. I am satisfied that the proposed financing will comply with the Agreement
Establishing IFAD and the Policies and Criteria for IFAD Financing.

VII. Recommendation
54. I recommend that the Executive Board approve the proposed financing in terms of

the following resolution:

RESOLVED: that the Fund shall provide a loan on highly concessional terms to
the Republic of the Union of Myanmar in an amount equivalent to eight million
nine hundred and eighty four thousand United States dollars (US$8,984,000)
and upon such terms and conditions as shall be substantially in accordance
with the terms and conditions presented herein.

RESOLVED FURTHER: that the Fund shall provide a grant to the Republic of
the Union of Myanmar in an amount equivalent to three million nine hundred
and seventy eight  thousand United States dollars (US$3,978,000) and upon
such terms and conditions as shall be substantially in accordance with the
terms and conditions presented herein.

Recommendation for approval

The Executive Board is invited to approve the recommendation for the proposed
grant to the Central African Republic for the Project to Revitalize Crop and Livestock
Production in the Savannah, as contained in paragraph 39.

Proposal for a grant to the Central African Republic for
the Project to Revitalize Crop and Livestock Production in
the Savannah

I. Strategic context and rationale
A. Country and rural development and poverty context
1. The Central African Republic (CAR) is classified as a country with a fragile situation.

The recent humanitarian and security crisis in 2013-2015 devastated the economy
and caused a quarter of the population to flee their homes. GDP fell 37 per cent in
2013, stabilizing at a growth rate on the order of 5 per cent between 2014 and
2016. Some 74 per cent of the population depend on the agropastoral sector, which
accounts for 52 per cent of GDP. With a Human Development Index (HDI) of 0.352
in 2016, CAR ranks 188th of 188 countries,1 reflecting the poverty that affects an
estimated 67 per cent of the population as a whole and 72 per cent of rural people.
Life expectancy is 51.5 years. CAR’s population density is among the lowest in the
world with five million people and an area of 623,000 km2. About 60 per cent of
the country’s people live in rural areas and the population is very young, with 60
per cent under 25.

2. The causes of poverty include poor availability and management of agropastoral
production factors, destruction of the economic fabric and limited road access; a
lack of infrastructure and of efficient public services in rural areas; and scarce
economic opportunities, especially for young people. The conflicts continue to have
an adverse impact on food security. Ten armed groups are still operative in the
areas bordering Cameroon and Chad, and in the country’s central and eastern
regions. Many farmers have fled their land, while others have had no access to
agricultural inputs or agropastoral markets. Livestock keepers have lost their herds
or migrated to Cameroon. Nevertheless, the potential for agricultural development
is extraordinary with close to 15 million hectares of arable land and 20 million
hectares of permanent pasture, as well as a favourable climate. The vulnerability
profile, however, presents extreme hazards such as torrential rains, flooding and
drought.

B. Rationale and alignment with government priorities and RB-
COSOP

3. The Central African Government and IFAD, based on lessons learned from the
Project for Reviving Food Crops and Small Livestock Production in the Savannah
(PREVES), which was completed on 31 December 2017, have designed the Project
to Revitalize Crop and Livestock Production in the Savannah (PREPAS) to
consolidate and scale up gains under PREVES. PREPAS is in line with the National
Recovery and Peacebuilding Plan (PNRCP) 2017-2021, which sets forth the
Government’s priorities and was the subject of the donors conference held in
Brussels in December 2016. The PNRCP has three pillars: (i) support for peace,
security and reconciliation; (ii) renewal of the social contract between the
Government and the people; and (iii) economic recovery and reactivation of

1 United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Human Development Report 2017.



EB 2018/LOT/P.9

2

productive sectors. PREPAS will contribute to the food security and productive
sector recovery objectives set under pillar 3.

4. In terms of IFAD, the alignment documents are IFAD’s Strategic Framework 2016-
2025 and the country strategy note 2018-2019 under which PREPAS is the only
investment planned.

II. Project description
A. Project area and target group
5. The project area covers the subprefectures of Bouar, Baoro, Bossemptélé and

Yaloké, with a possible expansion to Bozoum following the midterm review.

6. PREPAS will target some 30,000 beneficiaries and their households, or some
240,000 people potentially reached by the project. The beneficiaries are essentially
poor smallholder crop and livestock farmers and agricultural producers, at least 50
per cent of them women, 30 per cent young people and 10 per cent heads of highly
vulnerable families. Given the marked vulnerability of women in the Central African
Republic, a gender equity strategy will be developed to promote their economic
empowerment. The project will support the integration of young people into
existing groups, establishment of youth groups and promotion of youth
entrepreneurship in specific activities such as market gardening, small livestock
raising or upstream and downstream production activities, particularly related to
marketing and processing, the seed subsector, farm mechanization and borehole
maintenance.

7. The 355 groups under PREVES will be supported in achieving a higher stage of
professionalization, while 445 new grass-roots groups will be structured with
training and start-up support, taking the total number of groups to 800, or 20,000
beneficiary households. In addition, 10,000 more households will benefit from
activities around nutrition, access to drinking water, animal hygiene and
vaccination, and structuring activities.

B. Project development objectives
8. The overall objective of PREPAS is to contribute to reducing poverty and sustainably

improving food and nutritional security in the subprefectures of Bouar, Baoro,
Bossemptélé and Yaloké. The development objective is to strengthen the socio-
economic development framework and reactivate crop and livestock production
using approaches adapted to climate change.

C. Components/outcomes
9. Component 1: Promotion of community development. Expected outcome 1 is

improved community organization, nutrition and access to drinking water.

10. Subcomponent 1.1: Strengthening of organizational capacities. The aim is to
create an enabling environment for sustainable project implementation, by focusing
on sensitizing and mobilizing populations, encouraging dialogue between crop and
livestock farmers, organizing producers into groups and providing functional literacy
training. The main outcomes expected under subcomponent 1 are: (i) 800 groups
organized through community facilitation; (ii) 1,600 technical delegates of these
groups having received organizational training; (iii) 3,200 people having received
literacy training; (iv) 5,000 group members participating in savings and credit
activities.

11. Subcomponent 1.2: Promotion of nutrition and access to drinking water.
Nutritional education designed to improve the beneficiaries’ dietary behaviours will
be accompanied with other nutrition-related activities to put in place a healthy and
balanced diet. This objective will be achieved with the increased availability of foods
with high nutritional value and their processing. In addition, the project will
strengthen institutional capacities in nutrition. The project is also intended to
rehabilitate or build 135 boreholes in the project area and to continue to guarantee



EB 2018/LOT/P.9

3

the operation of the 65 boreholes installed by PREVES. The boreholes will be
combined with the construction of latrines following the models and approaches
disseminated by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF). The main expected
outcomes under this subcomponent are: (i) 10,000 people having received
capacity-building in nutritional practices; (ii) 2,500 home gardens set up; (iii) 135
drinking water points constructed and 65 water points set up under PREVES
maintained; (iv) two spare parts warehouses installed; (v) 20 repairers trained.

12. Component 2: Productive investments. Expected outcome 2 will be producers
strengthened and recapitalized with more efficient production, processing and
marketing methods that are adapted to climate change. The products targeted will
be: (a) for crops: maize, cassava, groundnut, and red bean; and (b) for livestock:
poultry and smallstock – goats, sheep and pigs.

13. Subcomponent 2.1: Strengthening of the supply of services to producers.
The aim is to improve the supply of extension services for farmers as follows: (i) an
effective system of outreach and advisory assistance, and better technical and
logistical capacities among public services; (ii) professionalization of the seed
subsector to recover the productivity of the targeted value chains; and (iii) a
livestock vaccination campaign. The expected outcomes are: (i) thematic materials
and toolkits developed for outreach; (ii) 28 master trainers trained; (iii) 1,600
technical delegates having received technical training; (iv) 800 groups having
received extension services; (v) the Central African Agricultural Research Institute
station in Bolée better equipped; and (vi) the National Livestock School in Bouar
rehabilitated.

14. Subcomponent 2.2: Support for production, processing and marketing. To
ensure efficient implementation on a large scale throughout the PREPAS area,
various support modules will be used – network of seed producers, crop production,
livestock farming and market gardening – for the 800 groups. In addition, PREPAS
will support 150 modules benefiting 450 young people in areas such as:
(i) agricultural processing; (ii) transportation and marketing; (iii) input stores; and
(iv) mechanization. As part of the inclusion module for highly vulnerable
households, PREPAS will provide the most capable with start-up equipment
consisting of small-scale supplies and inputs to undertake farming, while
beneficiaries lacking labourers will receive small ruminants or poultry. They may
subsequently set up an agricultural or agropastoral group. The expected outcomes
under this subcomponent are as follows: (i) 800 agricultural, agropastoral and
market gardening groups, representing 20,000 households, having benefited from
crop, livestock and market gardening production modules; (ii) 8 ha of land
developed for market gardening and equipped with innovative irrigation devices,
mainly solar; (iii) 12 storage warehouses and eight input storehouses constructed;
and (iv) 450 young people supported and engaged in processing, marketing or
services upstream and downstream of the value chain.

15. Component 3: Coordination, management, monitoring and evaluation
(M&E) and policy dialogue. The expected outcome of subcomponent 3.1 is better
coordination and M&E of rural sector interventions and knowledge management
that stimulates fruitful consultations and enhances the sector environment in favour
of sustainable agropastoral development.

16. Subcomponent 3.1: Knowledge management and policy dialogue. The aim is
to set up a rural sector coordination group (RSCG) linked to the PNRCP institutional
guidance and steering arrangements. In addition to this strengthening and the
creation of a consultative framework, the RSCG will specifically support the
development of a rural sector M&E system with the participation and alignment of
technical and financial partners. Data from the M&E system will be used in annual
rural sector reviews and consultation themes, which may lead to the formulation of
policies such as the National Agricultural Outreach Policy (PNVA).



EB 2018/LOT/P.9

17. Subcomponent 3.2: Coordination, management and M&E. The objective of
this subcomponent is to coordinate project interventions, provide effective and
transparent financial management of resources, promote ongoing improvements in
tools, approaches and methods of the actors, and coordinate the results-based M&E
process.

III. Project implementation
A. Approach
18. The government services participating in project implementation are, at the

regional, prefectural and subprefectural level, the Central African Agency for
Agricultural Development (ACDA), National Agency for Livestock Development
(ANDE), Central African Institute of Agricultural Research (ICRA), the Regional
Directorates for Rural Development 1 and 2, the West Regional Directorates and
the Livestock Centre and the prefectural services of the Interministerial Unit for
Rural Roads Planning and Coordination (CIPC-PR). At the national level, the actors
concerned will be the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MADR)
Directorate General for Monitoring and Evaluation and the Directorates General of
ICRA, ACDA and ANDE.

19. At the national level, the project management and coordination unit (PMCU) will
sign agreements and performance contracts with government and non-government
partners in the different areas of project implementation. The technical agencies
AGDR, ANDE and ICRA will be accountable for the implementation of project
activities in crop and livestock agriculture under agreements and protocols for
collaboration concluded with the PCMU. Certain specific activities will be
implemented by operators and service providers and through national and
international technical assistance to be selected by competitive bidding and linked
to the project under performance contracts.

B. Organizational framework
20. PREPAS will be placed under the joint oversight of MADR and the Ministry of

Livestock and Animal Health (MESA). The two ministries will jointly provide
supervision and direct interaction with other sector ministries and technical and
financial partners, and will coordinate M&E activities in relation to recovery and
peacebuilding in the Central African Republic. The Ministry of Finance and Economy,
as recipient, will manage all funds and will be responsible for making counterpart
funding available in an effective and timely fashion.

21. National consultations will take place through a national steering committee to be
created by a joint decree of the Ministers of Agriculture and Livestock. The national
steering committee will bring together representatives of the sector ministries
involved in PREPAS implementation and representatives of producers’
organizations. Decentralized consultations will take place at the subprefectural
level, within consultative committees created by joint decree of the Ministers of
Agriculture and Livestock. Secretariat services will be provided by the PREPAS
bureau chief.

22. Project management will be provided by the PMCU based in Bangui, which will have
administrative and financial autonomy. The two subprefectural branches will be
located in Yaloké and Bouar. In alignment with IFAD guidelines for implementation
of projects in fragile situations, PREPAS will promote partnership-building and
technical assistance mobilization (UNICEF, the Food and Agriculture Organization of
the United Nations, the United Nations Office for Project Services, the International
Institute of Tropical Agriculture, and the International Centre for Agricultural
Research for Development). This will allow for the scaling up of activities in year 3,
particularly in relation to drinking water access, training and production.



EB 2018/LOT/P.9

5

C. Planning, M&E, learning and knowledge management
23. Planning and budgeting for PREPAS activities will take place by means of annual

workplans and budgets (AWP/Bs). Beginning in year two, the draft AWP/B will
include a summary of results obtained and constraints encountered during the
preceding year. A flexible approach will be adopted to enable the AWP/B to be
revised in the course of the fiscal year as needed. The planning process will begin in
early September of each year so that the Government may transmit the AWP/B to
IFAD on 30 November at the latest. Since the M&E system was virtually nonexistent
during PREVES start-up, the project will develop an M&E system to steer
implementation of sector M&E, which will produce data for policy dialogue purposes.
The PREPAS M&E system will measure progress made on project implementation
and the results and impact on target groups, including core indicators from the
Operational Results Management System (ORMS). An M&E manual will be
developed. An automated database will be developed specifically for the project,
which will also be equipped with geographical information system (GIS) software
for intervention mapping. A knowledge management strategy will be developed at
project start-up and supported by the M&E system.

D. Financial management, procurement and governance
24. Budgets will be prepared and approved in accordance with the management

manual. The budgets are to be specified and entered using accounting software.
The imprest accounts procedure will be used for disbursements. Prior conditions will
be met before the first disbursement. The management manual will outline all
control activities in detail. The PREPAS accounts will be kept on an accruals basis in
accordance with international accounting standards and the Organization for the
Harmonization of Business Law in Africa accounting system (SYSCOHADA). An
internal auditor will be hired and will report to the national steering committee or to
an audit committee. The external audit of the project will be done by a private audit
firm in accordance with IFAD guidelines.

25. Procurement will take place in accordance with IFAD guidelines and the public
procurement code of the Central African Republic. To the extent possible, contracts
will be grouped in such a way as to appeal to bidders, encourage competition and
obtain the bet offers. At project start-up, the PCMU will update the procurement
plan for the first 18 months and submit it to IFAD for approval. The procurement
plan will specify, inter alia, the procurement method for each contract and the
thresholds and preferences applicable within the project. Procurement plans for
subsequent years will be included in AWP/Bs and submitted for approval by the
steering committee and non objection of IFAD. Each procurement plan will stipulate
the procedures to be followed by bidders to ensure compliance with IFAD
procurement guidelines.

E. Supervision
26. PREPAS supervision and financial administration will be done directly by IFAD, with

participation by representatives of MADR and MESA, with two supervision missions
per year. The first of these will be dedicated to supporting project start-up with
preparation of the first AWP/B, the procurement plan for the first 18 months, and
terms of reference for baseline studies and tender documents. In light of the fragile
context, significant resources will be allocated to the country office to ensure
continuous supervision and strong implementation support.

IV. Project costs, financing, benefits
A. Project cost
27. PREPAS will be implemented over a period of six years. The project duration will be

reassessed at the midterm review given the fragile situations in the country. The
total project cost, including contingencies, is US$29.04 million (CFAF 15.9 billion).
Base cost is US$25.5 million (CFAF 14.0 billion). The project’s investment costs and
current expenses are, respectively, US$23.5 million (CFAF 12.9 billion) or 92 per



EB 2018/LOT/P.9

6

B. Project financing
28. The financing sources for the project are as follows: (i) IFAD will provide

US$25.0 million, or 86 per cent of total project cost, assigned over two allocation
cycles of the performance-based allocation system (PBAS) – US$12.4 million under
the 2016-2018 cycle and US$12.6 million to cover the financing gap under a further
cycle; (ii) module beneficiaries will contribute US$3.1 million, or 11 per cent of total
cost, in the form of contributions in kind; and (iii) the Central African Government
will contribute US$0.97 million in the form of exemptions from taxes and tariffs on
goods and services to be acquired under the project, or 3 per cent of total cost. The
financing gap of US$12.6 million could be financed under subsequent PBAS cycles,
on terms to be determined and subject to internal procedures and Executive Board
approval, or by cofinancing to be identified during implementation.

C. Summary benefit and economic analysis
29. Financial analysis shows that the net benefits generated by operations and

enterprises are positive and that the activities promoted by the project are
profitable. The economic internal rate of return is 19.6 per cent. Net present value
is an estimated US$19.3 million, or CFAF 10,590 million, for a discount rate of 6 per
cent.

D. Sustainability
30. PREPAS is not expected to involve any adverse environmental and social impact

and has therefore been classified as a category B operation, among projects with
moderate climate risk. The probability of maintaining gains over the long term and
creating the desired conditions to develop crop and livestock farming in the project
area is good. Boreholes and water points will be managed by management
committees to make drinking water widely available, thus reducing the workload
and waterborne illnesses, and will meet the needs of multiple uses. In addition,
repairers will be trained to do maintenance. The approach for inclusion of the most
vulnerable people – through literacy and project support modules designed to
facilitate access to production factors – is structured so as to endow households
with the needed capital and to create production and management capacity over
the medium term to guarantee food and nutritional security.

E. Risk identification and mitigation
31. The main risks identified, in addition to fiduciary risks, are as follows: (i) worsening

of the country’s political and security crisis, and its possible spread to the PREPAS
area; (ii) poor technical and administrative capacities among project team
members; (iii) limited capacities of implementation partners; (iv) a lack of
coordination among interventions by technical and financial partners; and
(v) extreme climate events. Mitigation measures have been proposed for each risk.



EB 2018/LOT/P.9

V. Corporate considerations
A. Compliance with IFAD policies
32. PREPAS is aligned with IFAD policies, including: (i) IFAD’s Strategic Framework

2016-2025; (ii) Disaster Early Recovery Guidelines; (iii) Country Strategy
Note 2017-2018; (iv) climate change strategy; (v) environment and natural
resource management policy; (vi) targeting policy to mainstream smallholder
farmers and vulnerable groups into agricultural value chains; and (viii) policy on
gender equality and women’s empowerment.

B. Alignment and harmonization
33. PREPAS is aligned with the PNRCP 2017-2021, and will contribute to achieving the

objectives of food security and productive sector recovery included in pillar 3.
Within IFAD, the alignment documents are IFAD’s Strategic Framework 2016-2025
and Country Strategy Note 2018-2019, in which PREPAS is the only investment
planned. PREPAS will respond to IFAD’s strategic objectives 1, increasing the
productive capacity of poor rural people; and 3, strengthening the environmental
sustainability and climate resilience of their economic activities. PREPAS will also
contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular
SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG2 (zero hunger), SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) and
SDG 15 (life on land).

C. Innovations and scaling up
34. IFAD considers innovation to be a process that adds value and solves a problem in

new ways. Based on this definition and to ensure the possibility of efficient
implementation on a large scale throughout the PREPAS area, the project will make
available standardized modules for production, processing, marketing and
production support services, taking into account the innovations that are best
adapted to withstand the effects of climate change, in particular involving manure –
e.g. training in integrated soil fertility management and EcoSan. PREPAS will also
consolidate and expand PREVES by gradually adding new villages and groups, and
with the inclusion of the Bossemptélé subprefecture.

D. Policy engagement
35. PREPAS calls for providing, based on pilot tests, factual data to guide policy

formulation favouring public and private investment and putting in place an
attractive regulatory and legislative framework. Through PREPAS, IFAD will support
the development and implementation of a seed policy, possibly in partnership with
FAO and/or the International Centre for Agronomic Research for Development. The
Central African Republic does not currently have a national policy on agricultural
extension. PREPAS will continue to pursue the extension approach used under
PREVES, adapting it to the local and national context. The data gathered will be
used to design such a policy over the longer term.

VI. Legal instruments and authority
36. A financing agreement between the Central African Republic and IFAD will

constitute the legal instrument for extending the proposed financing to the
borrower. A copy of the negotiated financing agreement is attached as appendix I.

37. The Central African Republic is empowered under its laws to receive financing from
IFAD.

38. I am satisfied that the proposed financing will comply with the Agreement
Establishing IFAD and the Lending Policies and Criteria.

VII. Recommendation
39. I recommend that the Executive Board approve the proposed financing in terms of

the following resolution:



EB 2018/LOT/P.9

RESOLVED: that the Fund shall provide a grant to the Central African Republic
under the Debt Sustainability Framework in an amount of twelve million four

Recommendation for approval

The Executive Board is invited to approve the recommendation for the proposed
loan to the Republic of Gabon for the Agricultural and Rural Development Project –
Phase II, as contained in paragraph 48.

Proposal for a loan to the Republic of Gabon for the
Agricultural and Rural Development Project – Phase II

I. Strategic context and rationale
A. Country and rural development and poverty context
1. Gabon is an upper middle-income country with a predominantly young population

estimated at 1.7 million. According to the Human Investment Strategy of 2014, the
poverty rate has dropped from 33 per cent in 2005 to 30 per cent in 2013. Poverty
is more prevalent in rural areas, where 45 per cent of households are economically
vulnerable compared to 20 per cent in urban areas.

2. The agriculture sector currently employs around 40 per cent of Gabon’s rural
population, yet contributes just 5 per cent of GDP. Agricultural production is
insufficient to make the country self-sufficient in food. To make up the resulting 60
per cent deficit in staple products, particularly cereals and meat, large volumes of
food are imported, estimated at more than US$650 million per year. The
prevalence of chronic malnutrition is higher in rural areas than in urban centres at
29 per cent and 14 per cent respectively.

3. This situation, the result of an organizational, political and institutional framework
that is weakly organized to stimulate agricultural development, is caused by
several factors: (i) uncontrolled and unsecured land tenure; (ii) small size of farms;
(iii) low yields for staple products; (iv) unattractive investment conditions and
insufficient tax incentives; (v) limited access to financing, seed, agricultural inputs
and outreach services; (vi) weak capacities among public, private and community
institutions operating in the sector; (vii) insufficient investment in production,
processing and marketing infrastructure; (viii) limited interconnectivity among
different value chain stakeholders; (ix) insufficient local workforce; and (x)
obsolete training infrastructure and platforms.

B. Justification and alignment with government priorities and
RB-COSOP

4. To reduce the country’s dependence on oil revenues and diversify the economy,
the Government launched the Emerging Gabon Strategic Plan (PSGE) setting forth
the main development priorities through 2025. In application of the PSGE, the
Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock, responsible for the Graine programme
(MALGP) developed the Strategy for Economic Recovery of the Agriculture Sector
for the period 2016-2023, built around three major priorities: (i) guarantee food
security and reduce food imports by 80 per cent; (ii) create at least 150,000 new
formal jobs in cooperatives; and (iii) boost agricultural exports to US$1 billion per
year.

5. The country still faces rural poverty, inequalities and other challenges such as
limited institutional capacities and weak support structures and mechanisms for
agricultural policy and strategy. Although policies have been launched in the past,
the lack of full implementation has limited their impact on rural poverty, food crop
productivity, nutrition and food security.



EB 2018/LOT/P.8

6. Achieving the current national ambitions for agriculture will therefore mean
overcoming these challenges, starting with the creation of enabling conditions for
mobilizing and settling rural people generally, and the young workforce in
particular. This challenge, in addition to the need to strengthen productive capital,
is to reform institutional support systems, improve access to rural areas and
guarantee an adequate supply of inputs and technologies to support production
processing and market integration. Essentially, a fact-based decision-making
process on strategy and policy is crucial to spark excitement and engagement
among farmers, and interest among the private sector and market actors, in order
to sustainably reactivate agricultural development in Gabon.

7. Against this backdrop, a contextualized approach to IFAD’s engagement in Gabon,
based in part on support for agricultural policy and in part on structuring
productive investments, is suggested to accompany the Government’s efforts to
meet the challenges described. IFAD assistance in policy dialogue, innovation,
knowledge management and partnership, including South-South cooperation, will
make it possible to build local and national institutional capacities, stimulate sound
governance and promote an enabling environment for national and private
investment.

II. Project description
A. Project area and target group
8. PDAR II will be implemented in three of the country’s nine provinces: Woleu-Ntem,

where PDAR was implemented, Ngounié and l’Ogooué-Ivindo. Within these
provinces, the project will focus on 16 production areas covering 43 cantons and
171 villages or groups of villages.

9. PDAR II is intended to reach more than 16,000 beneficiaries. It will target actors in
the value chains, including those operating upstream and downstream of
production, in related services and occupations, in particular agricultural service
provision, input distribution, and equipment installation and maintenance. The
priority target group comprises poor rural people, particularly: (i) smallholder
producers; (ii) rural youth; (iii) women; and (iv) indigenous people.

10. The other beneficiaries will be the public bodies involved in agricultural policy
formulation, implementation and evaluation, decentralized crop and livestock
services, producers’ organizations and the private sector. They will receive
capacity-building to ensure that goods and services provided are adapted to the
needs of the priority target group.

B. Project development objectives
11. The project development objective is to sustainably improve incomes, food security

and nutrition for smallholder producers – women, youth and indigenous people – in
three provinces in Gabon. More specifically, this means:

- Improving the agricultural policy environment to promote increased public
and private investment thanks to an effective and sustainable system that
allows for implementation and monitoring of subsector policies and
strategies;

- Promoting economic activities and entrepreneurship in key agropastoral value
chains to improve incomes, food security and nutrition.

C. Components/results
Component 1: Policy support

12. The goal of this component is to improve the institutional, policy and regulatory
framework for the agriculture sector to increase public and private investment in
the rural sector and improve sector governance.



EB 2018/LOT/P.8

3

13. The component will be implemented in three subcomponents.

Subcomponent 1.1: Agriculture policy dialogue
14. The aim of this subcomponent is to achieve participation by all stakeholders in the

process of sector policy development, implementation and monitoring – the private
sector, producers’ organizations, NGOs, youth and women’s representatives, and
so on – while ensuring that poor rural people and their organizations have a space
to express their concerns.

15. To this end, a national platform and three provincial platforms will be set up to
serve as a framework for dialogue on agriculture policy and bottlenecks impeding
agricultural development, subsector competitiveness and actors’ performance.
Working groups will be set up around the priority themes identified. Specialized
resource persons will be tapped to conduct studies documenting the discussions
and informing debates by presenting facts and sound evidence. To optimize
participation by producers’ organizations, their apex organization will be
restructured and will benefit from specific capacity-building.

Subcomponent 1.2: Support for evidence-based agriculture policy
formulation and implementation

16. Depending on the bottlenecks identified by platform participants, the project will
support the production and use of factual data to document the development or
revision of policies on priority themes and their implementation, to improve
governance and enable an effective rural transformation to take place.

17. Activities will relate to: (i) the conduct of prospective and thematic studies in
preparation for the development or revision and validation of priority policies;
(ii) preparation and validation of three provincial land use management and
allocation plans; (iii) mobilization of international technical assistance specializing
in agriculture policy during the first three years of implementation, through a
specialized institution.

Subcomponent 1.3: Strengthening national capacities for policy
implementation and monitoring

18. The aim of this subcomponent is to strengthen national capacities with training on
policy analysis, evaluation of different agricultural strategy options, production of
factual data to guide policy and decision-making. To support this strategic,
institutional and operational shift, PDAR II will support the following five actions:

- Conduct of an institutional and organizational diagnostic assessment by the
MALGP, to develop a restructuring proposal adapted to the mandates of the
central directorates, decentralized services and agencies;

- Entry into service of the Agriculture Development Agency, which was recently
created to implement agricultural policies and strategies;

- Operational capacity-building for three provincial directorates, the regional
directorate for the North and 18 agriculture divisions to improve their
effectiveness in monitoring and supervising interventions by PDAR II;

- Entry into service of the sector M&E system prepared by the Government with
technical support from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United
Nations (FAO), and the establishment of a framework for consultation and
coordination of rural sector technical and financial partners; and

- Strengthening of the PDAR II steering, monitoring and knowledge
capitalization function.

Component 2: Value chain development and agropastoral
entrepreneurship promotion

19. This component is intended to intensify production systems and improve
productivity and competitiveness of produce by supporting the development of



EB 2018/LOT/P.8

4

local economic initiatives and entrepreneurship in the crop and livestock
subsectors. This objective will be achieved within the framework of four
subcomponents.

Subcomponent 2.1 – Support for consultation among local actors and
market access

20. The aim is to set up multi-actor innovation platforms in the 16 production areas to
improve consultation among actors and create local collective dynamics that will
enable market access. Each innovation platform will conduct a diagnostic
assessment for use in developing and implementing action plans.

Subcomponent 2.2 – Access to inputs and crop and livestock services
21. The intervention strategy will be based on setting up private local service

providers, particularly young people, by financing cross-cutting actions that are key
to promoting the targeted value chains. These actions will relate to multiplication
and distribution of plant material, supply of small-scale breeding livestock, setting
up agricultural machinery service providers and installing input stores in
partnership with producers’ organizations or private providers.

Subcomponent 2.3 – Support for agropastoral investment and
entrepreneurship

22. The aim is to cofinance actions plans, i.e. collective and individual investments
planned for production areas by innovation platform participants to improve
production, storage, processing and marketing, and raise the incomes of the target
groups. To this end, a PDAR II investment cofinancing mechanism will be set up at
project start-up following the model in the PDAR manual. This will define the
overall activity planning framework, cofinancing code, procedures and management
tools.

Subcomponent 2.4 – Capacity-building and dissemination of innovations
23. This subcomponent will cover testing and disseminating innovative techniques that

can lift the constraints on smallholder rural producers and improve the productivity
of production systems. In addition, it will allow for testing and disseminating
technologies to manage conflicts with wildlife generally, and with elephants in
particular, to enable the producers concerned to better manage their farms. Finally,
the subcomponent will promote South-South cooperation to seek solutions to
urgent challenges facing agricultural development in Gabon.

III. Project implementation
A. Approach
24. The national platform for policy dialogue and the innovation platforms in production

areas will be coordinated respectively by a MALGP central or general directorate
and by provincial directorates. Participation by actors representing all economic
interests and target groups will be assured, to engage in dialogue, communication
and interaction to mobilize collective knowledge about the territories and prioritize
problems and possible solutions and take them to the Government. This approach
will improve the ownership and effectiveness of policies and strategies.

25. Policy and strategy development will be steered by the central directorate in charge
of planning and policy. International technical assistance will be used to carry out
agriculture policy support activities, including capacity-building for actors.

26. Setting up and coordinating innovation platforms will be a key activity under
component 2, to be launched at project start-up, as the success of productive
investments will depend upon them functioning properly. Supported activities will
be identified in the diagnostic assessments and consultations conducted in the
platforms, and will be included in their action plans. The action plans will define the
different individual and collective value chain subprojects to be submitted for
funding purposes.



EB 2018/LOT/P.8

27. Cofinancing for subprojects will be obtained via demand together with a feasibility
study or business plan. Business plans will be developed by the beneficiary with
support from the production area facilitator, and by ad hoc experts as needed. A
simplified procedure will be put in place to review the applications.

B. Organizational framework
28. The project will be placed under the oversight of the Ministry of Agriculture as the

executing agency. A national project steering and monitoring committee will be set
up to provide strategic direction. Consultation at the decentralized level will be
through a provincial technical coordination committee that will validate provincial
activity planning and supervise implementation to ensure harmonization and
consistency with sector strategies and interventions by other partners. Project
coordination and management will be done by a national project coordination and
management unit (PCU) based in Libreville with administrative and financial
autonomy. The PCU will comprise a national coordination unit and three provincial
branches located in Ngounié, Ogoué Ivindo and Woleu Ntem.

C. Planning, M&E, learning and knowledge management
29. Planning involves the preparation of annual workplans and budgets (AWP/Bs).

Planning and budgeting activities under component 1 will be steered by the PCU in
close collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture central and general directorates
concerned. Planning and budgeting activities under component 2 will be based on
diagnostic assessments and consultations at the production area level, estimates of
potential demand in subprojects for the following year and recommendations from
annual participatory M&E workshops held at the provincial level, and will give rise
to preparation by each branch of an annual workplan for discussion at meetings of
provincial technical coordination committees, then transmitted to the PCU for
decision.

30. The M&E system will serve as a tool for steering at both the project and oversight
level. The information provided by the system will be used to help achieve project
results and to improve the strategy and policy framework. A management
information system and a subproject management and monitoring system will be
put in place to provide input for a spatial database on all project interventions.

31. Knowledge management will be linked to the project M&E through a global system
for collection and dissemination of information of use to the different actors, and
for gathering information on the activities and methods implemented. Products
generated will include training manuals, good practice guidelines, technical
specifications, posters, videos and rural radio broadcasts, as well as exchanges of
experience and knowledge.

D. Financial management, procurement and governance
32. PDAR II financial management will be provided by the PCU, acting with

administrative and financial autonomy. The PCU will be responsible and
accountable to the Government and IFAD for the use of the project’s financial
resources in accordance with the financing agreement. The PCU will prepare
quarterly financial and accounting statements for transmission to the Government
and IFAD, as well as financial statements on project operations for submission to
an annual external audit. The administrative and financial management of PDAR II
and all fiduciary matters will be in compliance with the provisions and procedures
set forth in the letter to the borrower and in the administrative, financial and
management procedures manual.



EB 2018/LOT/P.8

33. Procurement will take place in accordance with the relevant IFAD guidelines1 and
the Gabonese Procurement Code. To the extent possible, contracts will be grouped
in such a way as to attract bidders, encourage competition and obtain better offers.
At start-up, the procurement plan for the first 18 months of implementation will be
updated by the PCU and submitted to IFAD for non-objection.

E. Supervision
34. PDAR II will be supervised jointly by IFAD and the Government, through

representatives of the project’s national steering and monitoring committee, with
two supervision missions each year.

IV. Project costs, financing, benefits
A. Project cost
35. The total cost of the project, including contingencies, is EUR 20.93 million (CFAF

13.73 billion) over a period of six years. Base costs are EUR 19.6 million, and cost
escalation and physical contingencies are EUR 1.32 million (CFAF 868 million), or 6
per cent of base costs. Taxes account for 8 per cent of total cost, in the amount of
EUR 1.72 million (CFAF 1.1 billion).

4.91 million, equivalent to US$5.7 million (23.5 per cent of total cost); (iii) a
government contribution of about CFAF 6.73 billion or EUR 10.26 million (49 per
cent of total cost), of which EUR 1.72 million corresponds to taxes and tariffs on
goods and services purchased by the project and a contribution in cash of EUR 8.54
million; and (iv) a contribution by beneficiaries to cofinancing for subprojects
estimated at EUR 0.32 million (1.5 per cent of total cost).3 The financing gap of
EUR 4.91 million could be covered under subsequent cycles of the PBAS – subject
to financing terms to be determined, compliance with internal procedures and
Executive Board approval – or by cofinancing mobilized during implementation.

C. Summary benefit and economic analysis
37. The quantifiable benefits of PDAR II are derived from the investments to be made.

The economic internal rate of return is an estimated 13.22 per cent, well above the
opportunity cost of capital (7 per cent); net present value is CFAF 6.92 billion
(US$12.23 million).

D. Sustainability
38. Three kinds of major adverse environmental and social impact potentially related to

project implementation have been identified: (i) conflicts between humans and
wildlife; (ii) accelerated deforestation as a result of supporting unsustainable
farming practices; and (iii) marginalization of indigenous peoples. For each of the
risks identified, alternative measures or safeguards have been proposed to
minimize the project’s adverse environmental and social impact and optimize
benefits for target populations.

3 Counterpart contributions from beneficiaries will represent at least 10 per cent of the total cost of the subprojects,
including contributions in cash and in kind. The counterpart ratios for public and common goods may, following
consultation with beneficiaries, exceed this percentage.



EB 2018/LOT/P.8

E. Risk identification and mitigation
39. Several risks have been identified: (i) insufficient or tardy mobilization of

counterpart funds; (ii) weak national capacities in coordination and
implementation; and (iii) weak national capacities in financial management and
procurement. Mitigation measures have been proposed for each of these risks,
including mobilizing international technical assistance.

V. Corporate considerations
A. Compliance with IFAD policies
40. PDAR II is aligned with IFAD policies and major guidelines, such as: (i) IFAD’s

Strategic Framework 2016-2025; (ii) country strategy note 2017-2018;4
(iii) climate change strategy; (iv) natural resources and environmental
management policy; (v) rural finance policy; (vi) targeting strategy, in connection
with targeting vulnerable people and mainstreaming smallholder producers and the
private sector into agricultural value chains; and (vii) respect for gender parity and
social inclusion of young people.

41. A Social, Environmental and Climate Assessment Procedures of IFAD (SECAP) note
has been prepared. PDAR II is not expected to involve any significant adverse
social, environmental or climate impact. It is therefore proposed that it be
classified as a category B operation.

B. Alignment and harmonization
42. The project’s lines of action are in line with the priorities set forth in the PSGE, and

more specifically with the strategic guidelines of the Green Gabon Plan. They are
also fully aligned with the Strategy for Economic Recovery of the Agriculture Sector
for the period 2016-2023, and consistent with IFAD’s country strategy note
outlining the framework for cooperation during the 2016-2018 financing cycle.

C. Innovations and scaling up
43. Based on IFAD’s definition of innovation as a process that creates value added or

solves a problem in an original way using new solutions, PDAR II has selected the
following areas for innovation: (i) mitigating human-elephant conflict; (ii) inclusion
of indigenous peoples; (iii) South-South cooperation; and (iv) testing innovations
in a farming environment. Phase 1 of the project arose as a model for sustainable
socio-economic development in rural Gabon. Scaling up earlier achievements by
IFAD in the framework of public investment will inspire this model, and will be
realized using three main instruments: project financing, policy and strategy
consultations, and knowledge management.

D. Policy engagement
44. One component is entirely dedicated to policy development. The objective is to

improve the agriculture policy environment to encourage increased public and
private investment by setting up an effective and sustainable system to develop,
implement and monitor subsector policies and strategies.

4 Preliminary version presented in May 2017. In view of IFAD’s comparative advantage and lessons learned from
experience, the strategy consists of scaling up PDAR gains to intensify sector investment while enabling full
participation by rural smallholder producers in the agriculture sector recovery and diversification of the economy,
following an entrepreneurial approach. Overall, the aim of the strategy is to achieve a sustainable increase in incomes
and food and nutritional security for poor rural people, particularly women and young people. This overall objective
translates into three strategic objectives: (i) sustainably increase smallholder farmers’ productivity; (ii) improve
smallholders’ access to markets; and (iii) strengthen the capacities of all actors.

Recommendation for approval 

The Executive Board is invited to approve the recommendation for the proposed 

financing to the Republic of Senegal for the Support to Agricultural Development 

and Rural Entrepreneurship Programme ‒ Phase II, as contained in paragraph 44. 

Proposal for a loan and grant to the Republic of Senegal 
for the Support to Agricultural Development and Rural 
Entrepreneurship Programme ‒ Phase II  

I. Strategic context and rationale  

A. Country and rural development and poverty context  

1. Senegal had a population of 15.26 million in 2017, 50.2 per cent women and  

49.8 per cent men. Demographic growth is 2.6 per cent per year. The Senegalese 

population is relatively young, with 62 per cent under 35 years of age. 

Unemployment is primarily young as well: nearly six of 10 unemployed people 

(60.6 per cent) were between 15 and 34 years of age in 2017, according to the 

National Agency of Statistics and Demography (2016). 

2. Growth in 2016, driven by agriculture and the secondary sector, was 6.5 per cent. 

Nevertheless, the endemic poverty rate remains unchanged at an estimated  

46 per cent of households, placing Senegal among the world’s 25 poorest 

countries.  

3. The country’s economy is based essentially on the primary sector – agriculture, 

fishing, mining and tourism – in addition to the secondary and tertiary sectors with 

new information and communication technologies. Agriculture employs 50 per cent 

of the population and accounts for 15.83 per cent of GDP (World Bank, 2016). 

Farming is mainly rainfed and seasonal, focusing on both cash crops – groundnut, 

cotton, horticulture – and staple foods such as millet, sorghum, maize, cowpea and 

rice. The groundnut subsector, long the mainstay of the economy, is undergoing a 

serious crisis. Current agricultural performance does not allow for improving living 

standards or reducing poverty among people living in rural areas.  

4. The food and nutritional status of Senegal’s population is cause for concern. Since 

2012, Senegal has faced a persistent nutritional crisis, with high rates of acute 

malnutrition in five regions – Matam, Tambacounda, Louga, Saint-Louis and 

Diourbel. Nutritional surveys conducted at end-2017 show a significant drop in the 

prevalence of acute malnutrition in these five regions, but the situation remains 

precarious despite this positive development. Some 120,000 children will need 

nutritional care, including more than 23,000 suffering from severe acute 

malnutrition and close to 92,000 with moderate acute malnutrition. Around 25,000 

expectant and nursing mothers will also need nutritional support (United Nations, 

2018). 

5. The United Nations Development Programme’s sustainable human development 

index ranked Senegal in 165
th
 place worldwide in 2016, with 46.7 per cent of the 

population living below the poverty line (World Bank, 2016). Poverty is 

multidimensional in Senegal and very pronounced in rural areas where farming is 

the main economic activity: in 2015 more than two thirds of households  

(69 per cent) were considered poor, 53.2 per cent of them very poor (National 

Agency of Statistics and Demography, 2015). 

6. The agriculture sector is extremely fragile in the face of climate hazards. Poor 

management of natural resources such as soil and water raise the vulnerability of 



EB 2018/123/R.12/Rev.1 

2 

poor people, whose incomes and food security are dependent on agriculture. 

Recent climate changes in Senegal include a 30 per cent drop in rainfall, an 

increase in temperature on the order of 0.9°C, growing aridification in the country’s 

north, a strong trend towards aridity in the central regions and a more or less 

strong trend towards semi-aridity in the southern regions. Should these trends 

continue, the resulting impact on water resources, agriculture, fishing, coastal 

areas and health could be significant. 

7. The supply of financial services in rural areas is insufficient to meet the financing 

needs expressed by the populations concerned. High transaction costs, limited 

institutional capacities of endogenous rural service providers, specific risks inherent 

to farming activity, a lack of assets that can be put up as collateral by people and 

inadequate financial resources given the specificities of savings that are often in 

kind – livestock, poultry, agricultural produce, etc. – act as obstacles to financial 

inclusion of rural populations in Senegal. 

B. Rationale and alignment with government priorities and  
RB- COSOP  

8. The Support to Agriculture Development and Rural Entrepreneurship Programme – 

Phase II (PADAER-II) will be carried out within a country context characterized by 

high levels of poverty and malnutrition, poor agricultural productivity, low access 

by agricultural value chain actors to external financing, very high youth 

unemployment and production systems that are highly exposed to climate 

phenomena. Accordingly, it will adopt an inclusive value chains approach that 

builds on and scales up the results achieved by IFAD in Senegal under the first 

phase of PADAER and elsewhere in the subregion. PADAER-II is fully aligned with 

national policies on rural development, in particular the Programme to Accelerate 

Agricultural Growth, the agricultural component of the Emerging Senegal Plan, the 

Livestock Development Programme, the National Food Security Plan and the 

National Action Plan on Climate Change Adaptation. The programme is aligned with 

the IFAD country strategy note, and takes into account experiences by the World 

Food Programme (WFP), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United 

Nations (FAO) and the Global Environment Fund (GEF). 

9. The lessons learned from the first phase of PADAER showed that access to quality 

production factors for women and young people, together with a system of 

agricultural advisory assistance based on mobilizing endogenous resource persons 

from producers’ organizations (POs) supported by rural advisory assistance 

structures, can make a strong contribution to raising farm productivity. It is crucial 

to take climate variability into account by making sustainable hydro-agricultural 

improvements available to value chain actors, facilitating access to climate 

information and developing a farm insurance programme to build the resilience of 

vulnerable households. Previous experiences in Senegal also showed that giving 

producers access to secure and more profitable markets is a determining factor in 

achieving food security and combating poverty. 

II. Programme description  

A. Programme area and target group  

10. PADAER-II will operate in the regions of Matam, Tambacounda, Kédougou and 

Kolda. The programme area covers about 50 per cent of the country’s area and  

15 per cent of its population. PADAER-II will target 43,700 households directly, 

comprising about 437,000 people. The programme beneficiaries are essentially 

poor smallholder crop and livestock farmers, of whom at least 40 per cent will be 

women and 50 per cent young people, both girls and boys. 

11. PADAER will operate in the following value chains: rice, maize, fonio, small 

ruminants and improved village poultry breeding. The programme will support the 

market gardening subsector. In addition to these major value chains, it will support 



EB 2018/123/R.12/Rev.1 

3 

complementary value chains such as millet and sorghum, non-timber forest 

products and banana. Value chains to be prioritized will be those in which poor 

households, women and young people are most represented or could easily join.  

B. Programme development objective 

12. The goal of PADAER-II is to contribute to reducing poverty for women, young 

people and men living in the programme area by integrating them with profitable, 

diversified value chains that are resilient to climate change. The development 

objective is to sustainably improve the food security and incomes of smallholder 

crop and livestock farmers and to create permanent, well-paying jobs for rural 

people, particularly women and young people.  

C. Components/outcomes 

13. The programme is structured in three components.  

14. Component 1: Improving the supply of agricultural products. The expected 

outcome of this component is for smallholder crop and livestock farmers to 

sustainably increase their production and productivity. To this end, the programme 

will build: (i) hydro-agricultural improvements; (ii) pastoral infrastructure; and 

(iii) marketing infrastructure. It will facilitate access to production factors and 

advisory assistance on crop and livestock farming. The nutritional education 

subcomponent will strengthen knowledge and attitudes among rural people. To 

build smallholder resilience, the programme will consolidate the index-based 

insurance programme developed during phase one.  

15. Component 2: Developing value chains and financing actors. The expected 

outcome is professionalized and empowered agricultural value chain actors, 

particularly crop and livestock producers’ organizations. To this end, the 

programme will facilitate the development of rural entrepreneurship; capacity-

building for POs to enable them to provide sustainable services to their members; 

and collaborative governance of crop and livestock value chains to consolidate 

existing value chain inter-professional frameworks. The programme will also 

facilitate access by producers to credit and strengthen their knowledge of financial 

matters. 

16. Component 3: Coordination, monitoring and evaluation (M&E) and 

knowledge management. Under this component, the programme will finance: 

(i) the programme coordination unit (PCU); (ii) the operation of three branches 

located in Matam, Kédougou and Kolda; (iii) steering and technical activities; and 

(iv) strengthening of M&E capacities within the agriculture sector. 

III. Programme implementation 

A. Approach 

17. The PADAER–II intervention logic is to scale up the gains achieved under the first 

phase of the programme, as well as the positive results of innovations developed in 

Senegal, to promote rural youth employment, rural women’s empowerment and 

the climate change resilience of agricultural value chains. As in phase one, the 

programme will adopt an inclusive value chains approach driven by demand from 

agricultural value chain actors.  

18. The programme will outsource the implementation of activities with support from 

deconcentrated government services, national directorates and agencies, 

experienced national and international operators, civil society, and PO and private 

sector platforms.  

B. Organizational framework 

19. The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Infrastructure (MAER) will provide oversight 

of PADAER-II. MAER will set up a steering committee based on the same 

committee as in phase one, expanded to take responsibility for new activities under 



EB 2018/123/R.12/Rev.1 

4 

PADAER-II. The Ministry of Livestock and Animal Production will serve as  

vice-chairperson of the committee. The technical committee, composed of the 

various national and regional actors in rural development, will review relevant 

matters as needed prior to meetings of the steering committee.  

20. PADAER-II will have a PCU that will be responsible for procurement and M&E and 

will coordination consultations among the partners to ensure sustainable 

agricultural value chain development. The PCU will be based in Tambacounda and 

will have three light branches located in Matam, Kédougou and Kolda. 

21. The PCU, directed by a coordinator, will comprise an administrative and financial 

officer, an infrastructure specialist, an M&E specialist, a specialist in gender issues 

and POs, a specialist in livestock value chains, a specialist in crop value chains, a 

specialist in rural entrepreneurship, an accountant, an M&E assistant and support 

staff. The branches will be very light units directed by a regional branch manager, 

with a secretary and a driver. They will provide representation and close 

monitoring of activities. The management staff of the PADAER-II PCU will be 

recruited on a competitive basis according to IFAD-approved procedures. 

C. Planning, M&E, learning and knowledge management  

22. Planning. The programme will be implemented on the basis of annual workplans 

and budgets (AWP/Bs). The AWP/Bs will be driven by the needs of agricultural 

value chain actors, with support from inter-professional value chain frameworks. 

Needs expressed at the regional level will be covered by a regional technical 

programme. The different regional technical programmes will be validated by the 

technical committee, then assembled by the PCU team into a national AWP/B, 

which will then be transmitted for comments to the Ministry of Agriculture and 

approved by the steering committee before being sent to IFAD for non-objection. 

To ensure consistency and complementarity of actions with partners operating in 

the programme area and investments in roads to connect production areas and 

hydro-agricultural improvements, the programme will ensure that such activities 

are in fact included in the community investment plans.  

23. M&E system. The M&E system will be used as a decision-making tool at various 

levels of programme implementation. M&E for PADAER-II will be established by 

drawing on lessons learned during phase one. A limited number of indicators will be 

gathered, disaggregated by sex and age as relevant. The system will be aligned 

with the national indicators used by MAER and the Ministry of Livestock and Animal 

Production. The programme will set up the system to monitor the agriculture 

subsector and will support the Ministry of Livestock’s research and planning unit in 

implementing the livestock sector monitoring system.  

24. Knowledge management. The knowledge management strategy for PADAER-II 

will link the M&E, results obtained and lessons learned. The programme will 

support the collection and dissemination of useful information for value chain 

actors at the local, regional and national levels, as well as the capitalization of 

activities and methods applied by IFAD projects.  

D. Financial management, procurement and governance 

25. Financial management. An evaluation of the proposed financial management 

system was done during programme design. The programme risk is considered 

moderate. The programme funds will be managed in accordance with the financing 

agreement. The administrative and financial management procedures will be set 

forth in the letter to the borrower and in the programme manual of administrative, 

accounting, financial and internal control procedures. 

26. The administrative, financial and accounting procedures manual will take into 

account the specificities of the programme, in particular the use of multiple 

financing sources and the number of intervention regions. The accounting 



EB 2018/123/R.12/Rev.1 

5 

procedures used will be those applicable to programmes and projects in the IFAD 

portfolio. 

27. Flow of funds. For disbursements, a principal designated account will be opened 

in the programme name by the Directorate for Cooperation and External Financing 

at a credible commercial bank to deposit the loan proceeds. A separate account will 

be opened for grant resources. An operations account, receiving funds from the 

designated accounts, will also be opened in Tambacounda, and movements will be 

subject to the double signature principle.  

28. Audit. In accordance with the new IFAD procedures approved in December 2017, 

an overall programme audit will be performed each year by an audit firm selected 

by competitive bidding. The project support unit of the Ministry of Economy, 

Finance and Planning will direct the audit firm selection process and the monitoring 

of implementation of audit recommendations. The internal control arrangements 

for the country programme will ensure that internal control for the programme 

takes place on the basis of an annual plan approved by the Ministry of Finance and 

IFAD. In addition to the annual audit, the project will prepare quarterly financial 

and accounting reports for transmission to the Government and IFAD. The audited 

financial statements will be published on the IFAD official website. 

29. Procurement. Contracts for goods, works and services will be awarded in 

accordance with recipient government provisions, provided they are compatible 

with IFAD procurement guidelines. The community procurement method may also 

be used to ensure participation by POs and local authorities. For infrastructure, the 

procurement specialists of regional development agencies will provide oversight of 

the quality of tender documents prepared by local authorities and implementing 

agencies.  

E. Supervision 

30. Programme supervision and administration of financing will be provided directly by 

IFAD.  

IV. Programme cost, financing, benefits  

A. Programme cost 

31. The total cost of the programme, for a duration of six years, is US$72.4 million, of 

which US$3.4 million for physical and financial contingencies, distributed as

C. Summary benefit and economic analysis 

33. Financial analysis shows that the net benefits generated by operations and 

enterprises are positive and that the activities promoted by the programme are 

profitable. The economic internal rate of return for the programme is  

16.92 per cent. Net present value is estimated at US$41.2 million, or  

CFAF 24.3 billion, at a discount rate of 6 per cent. The sensitivity analysis confirms 

that the positive economic results and impact of the programme are robust to the 

risks identified.  

D. Sustainability 

34. The sustainability of the investments under PADAER-II will be ensured by: 

(i) systematically giving accountability from the outset to existing permanent 

structures set up and reinforced by previous projects and programmes – 

deconcentrated technical services closest to beneficiaries, grass-roots and apex 

professional organizations, and agricultural and rural advisory assistance and 

private sector organizations – to provide accessible socio-economic services of 

quality; (ii) giving accountability and providing institutional and economic 

strengthening to POs at all levels; (iii) setting up management and maintenance 

committees based on previous experience for infrastructure built or rehabilitated in 

each case; (iv) strengthening inter-profession capacities to provide collaborative 

value chain governance; (v) guaranteeing the creditworthiness of market operators 

and compliance with contracts between POs and market operators; and 

(vi) promoting production models that are resilient to climate change.  

E. Risk identification and mitigation 

35. Overall, the level of risk of PADAER-II is considered moderate. The most probable 

risks relate to climate hazards, in particular rising temperatures and declining 

rainfall, and to access by vulnerable households to financial institutions. These risks 

will be mitigated by means of an effective partnership between the programme and 

the financial institutions and other funds set up by the Government, and by 

developing climate-smart production models. In addition to the risks mentioned 

above, the additional workload to be taken on by the current team could have an 

adverse impact on internal control. This risk could be mitigated by realistic 

planning of activities and a good distribution of the workload. 

V. Corporate considerations  

A. Compliance with IFAD policies 

36. The programme is compliant with IFAD strategies, principles and instruments, and 

is aligned with IFAD’s climate change strategy.  

37. PADAER-II is classified in environmental category B. The programme activities will 

have moderate social and environmental impact owing to the intensification of 

agricultural and livestock production through the use of appropriate technologies as 

well as the processing and marketing of products. The programme calls for a set of 

approaches and technologies to avoid greenhouse gas emissions and to capture. 

B. Alignment and harmonization 

38. The programme is fully aligned with the Emerging Senegal Plan, in particular the 

agriculture component, and with the Programme to Accelerate Agricultural Growth. 

In the case of livestock activities, it is aligned with the National Livestock 

Development Programme and the livestock component of the Emerging Senegal 

Plan. Concerning nutrition, the programme is consistent with the Strategic Plan on 

Nutrition.  

C. Innovations and scaling up  

39. A number of innovations and good practices developed during phase one and 

during the implementation of other projects under the country programme will be

scaled up: (i) commercial contracting between POs and market operators to 

facilitate access by smallholders to more profitable markets; (ii) the consolidation 

and establishment of value chain inter-professional frameworks to facilitate 

collaborative governance of activities and effective smallholder participation in 

consultations; (iii) capacity-building for smallholder producers in good practices in 

crop and livestock farming; and (iv) quality and management of infrastructure in 

crop and livestock value chains.  

D. Policy engagement  

40. PADAER-II will support the establishment of a national monitoring system for the 

agriculture subsector. For the livestock subsector, the programme will support the 

implementation of the system in place. Support for national M&E systems will 

significantly improve the quality of sector reports and the preparation of crop and 

livestock policies. At the institutional level, the programme support will facilitate 

good coordination of interventions and complementarity among the technical and 

financial partners.  

VI. Legal instruments and authority  
41. A financing agreement between the Republic of Senegal and IFAD will constitute 

the legal instrument for extending the proposed financing to the borrower. A copy 

of the negotiated financing agreement is attached as appendix I. 

42. The Republic of Senegal is empowered under its laws to receive financing from 

IFAD. 

43. I am satisfied that the proposed financing will comply with the Agreement 

Establishing IFAD and the Lending Policies and Criteria. 

VII. Recommendation 
44. I recommend that the Executive Board approve the proposed financing in terms of 

the following resolutions: 

RESOLVED: that the Fund shall provide a loan on highly concessional terms to 

the Republic of Senegal in the amount of forty million five hundred thousand 

euros (EUR 40,500,000), equivalent to forty-six million three hundred 

thousand United States dollars (US$46,300,000), and upon such terms and 

conditions as shall be substantially in accordance with the terms and 

conditions presented herein. 

RESOLVED FURTHER: that the Fund shall provide a grant to the Republic of 

Senegal in an amount of four hundred and forty thousand euros  

(EUR 440,000), equivalent to five hundred thousand United States dollars 

(US$500,000), and upon such terms and conditions as shall be substantially 

in accordance with the terms and conditions presented herein.
