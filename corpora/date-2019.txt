B. Introduction and Context 

 

RDP II is the largest rural development investment in the Solomon Islands, and the only one with national coverage. To 
date, the Project has benefitted 66,642 people (11 percent of the population) through 123 completed sub-projects. In 
addition, linkages to markets are being strengthened for more than 7,000 people through 35 agribusiness partnerships 
currently under implementation. Under the disaster risk recovery activities 2,846 beneficiaries affected by the floods of 
April 2014 have received agriculture and livestock recovery assistance – exceeding the expected number of beneficiaries 
for this activity. 

The Project was approved by the World Bank Board on November 21, 2014 and is scheduled to close on February 28, 
2020. The Project was approved for a total of US$46.9 million (including SDR6 million (US$9 million equivalent) in IDA 
financing). However, based on prevailing exchange rates, the amount available for the Project is now US$39.4 million. 
Project financing includes IDA - Financing Agreements IDA-55740 (Credit) and IDA-D0220 (Grant); parallel co-financing 
by IFAD C1360 (COFN); trust fund co-financing grants by the European Union (EU) TF-A5083 and Australian Department 
of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) TF-19256; and SIG counterpart financing. To date, the Project has disbursed 100 
percent of the IDA financing and 80.26 percent of the trust fund financing (received in the trust fund account to date).

Overall Implementation Progress has been rated ‘Moderately Satisfactory’ for the past 12 months. The Project is making 
substantial progress and is on track to implement all planned activities provided timely financing is available.  The 
Project Development Objective (PDO) rating was rated ‘Moderately Unsatisfactory’ between April 2017 and November 
2018 primarily due to concerns about financing shortfalls. The PDO rating was upgraded to Moderately Satisfactory in 
November 2018 to reflect SIG’s reaffirmation of its intention to provide the remaining counterpart funding, which made 
it likely that the project would meet the revised PDO targets indicators in the Results Framework (following a 
restructuring in early 2018). Apart from a financing shortfall, the Project has been performing at satisfactory levels on 
all fronts within a low capacity and logistically challenging fragile and post-conflict environment.  

Financial audits received to date have all been unqualified, and there are no outstanding financial audits for the Project. 
The project is rated ‘Moderately Satisfactory’ for overall safeguards. 

 

Rationale for Additional Financing 

 

The Project was restructured in January 2018 to address a financing gap of approximately US$5.8 million dollars 
(approximately 12% of the original Project amount) caused by the depreciation of the relevant financing currencies 
(AUD, EUR, and SDR).  The restructuring included reductions in the scope and target areas of some Project activities, as 
well as adjustments to the Results Framework.  At the time of the restructure Government counterpart funding was 
still anticipated.  

However, due to fiscal constraints the Solomon Islands Government’s (SIG) annual budget for 2018—approved in April 
2018—did not include the counterpart allocation anticipated for the project.  To date SIG has contributed SBD26.3 
million in counterpart financing (53 percent of the original commitment), leaving a financial shortage of SBD23.7 million 
(approximately US$3 million equivalent). In addition, the scope for utilizing EU co-financing, which only became 
available in May 2018 and closes in August 2019, is limited due to administrative complexities. This has further 
compounded the risks of a financial shortfall for the planned range of activities. These uncertainties and complexities 
have resulted in postponement of some activities meaning resources to make up the financing shortfall are urgently 
required to avoid further delays in undertaking these activities.  Due to these delays an extension of the Project closing 
date is also required to allow enough time to complete all of the activities necessary to achieve the PDO (the extension 
of closing date will be applicable for sources of funding from IDA and EU). 

SIG has indicated its intention to budget and transfer the remaining counterpart financing by early 2019. To date, the 
budget plan for 2019 by SIG (Care-taker Government at the time of decision) has shown an amount of SBD20 million 
(approximately USD2.5 million) allocated to the project.  However, no funds have been transferred to the project. 
National elections held in April 2019 means that a new Government will be formed. As a consequence of the election 
cashflow delays are expected and these could further delay Project implementation and jeopardize achievement of the 
PDO.  

In order to address the financing shortfall and also to deliver some of the activities that had been scaled down through 
the project restructuring of January 2018, SIG made an official request to the Bank for additional financing, as well as 
for an extension of the Project’s closing date by 12 months to February 28, 2021. The request resulted from the partial 
cancellation of IDA financing for the Solomon Islands Pacific Islands Regional Oceanscape Program (PROP, P151777), for

which SIG requested the Bank reallocate the SDR 1.58 million (approximately USD2.23 million at the time of 
cancellation) of national IDA.  

Therefore, the additional financing will allow the Project to finance the remaining round of support under Component 
1 – Community Infrastructure and Services and Component 2 - Agriculture Partnerships and Support; and help to reduce 
the financing gap (if SIG funds fall through or the closing date of the EU grant is not extended). This AF and restructuring 
will also support extension of the project closing date by 12 months to allow enough time to complete project activities. 
There will be no change to the current PDO.  

 
 
C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  

  
The proposed development objective for the additional financing is the same for the parent project which is to improve 
basic infrastructure and services in rural areas and to strengthen the linkages between smallholder farming households 
and markets. 
 
Original PDO  
The project development objective of the parent project is to improve basic infrastructure and services in rural areas and 
to strengthen the linkages between smallholder farming households and markets. 
 
Current PDO  
The current PDO of the parent project is the same as the original PDO which is to improve basic infrastructure and services 
in rural areas and to strengthen the linkages between smallholder farming households and markets. 
 
Key Results 

The Result Framework (RF) has been revised to reflect the new annual and end targets enabled by the AF and proposed 
extension.

D. Project Description  

 

The Project consists of three components: Component 1 – Community Infrastructure and Services; 
Component 2 – Agriculture Partnerships and Support; and Component 3 – Program Management. The 
Project operates in all 172 rural wards of the country and provides subgrants comprising: (a) Community 
Development Grants; (b) Disaster Recovery Grants; (c) Agribusiness Partnership Grants; and (d) 
Agriculture Supplemental Equity Facility (ASEF) Grants.  

The primary focus of the AF is to fill the financing gaps caused by the depreciation of various financing 
sources and delay in counterpart financing, no changes are expected for PDO, PDO indicators, nor will 
there be any new types of activities. The proposed changes include: 

a. Additional IDA financing of SDR 1.58 million (USD2.23 million) (50 percent grant and 50 
percent credit) to fund the project activities, thus updating the total project amount to 
USD41.6 million (noting that this is still less than the original appraised project cost of 
USD46.9 million).   

b. Adjustments to the financing plan to reflect the actual IDA and RETF financing received 
taking into account the exchange rate fluctuations between project appraisal and the 
receipt of these sources of financing. 

c. Adjustments to the project costs to reflect the available financing. 

d. Extension of project’s closing date for 12 months, from February 28, 2020 to February 28, 
2021 (for IDA as well as that of EU co-financing) 

e. Adjustments to the Results Framework to reflect changes in the scope and timing of 
project activities (amendments to the values for annual and end targets).

E. Implementation 

 
Implementation arrangements for the additional financing will follow that of the parent project. Overall program 
coordination and implementation responsibility would still be with the MDPAC, as currently under RDP II. A 
Project Steering Committee (PSC) will continue to provide project oversight, guidance and monitoring, and would 
be comprised of the Permanent Secretaries, or their delegates, from the Ministries of: Finance and Treasury; 
Agriculture and Livestock; Infrastructure Development; Provincial Government and Institutional Strengthening; 
Education and Human Resource Development; Health; Rural Development; Development Planning and Aide 
Coordination and Provincial Secretaries (representing participating provinces). The Permanent Secretary in 
MDPAC (Program Coordinator) will be assisted by a full time national Program Manager and a full time 
international Program Advisor responsible for the daily coordination of program activities, and: (i) for fiduciary 
aspects, finance and procurement specialists, (ii) coordinators and other support staff for component 1 (based in 
MDPAC) and Component 2 (based in MAL) and (iii) for additional cross-component implementation support, an 
M&E/MIS officer, and an environment officer. The Program Manager (reporting to the PS MDPAC) will coordinate 
implementation of program activities managed by the provincial governments and by MAL (as regards component 
2). 
 
Component 1 management and coordination at the provincial level would still be the responsibility of the 
Provincial Secretary assisted by a Provincial Team Leader, Finance Officer and Community Helpers operating at 
the ward and village level. These will all be national positions. Central Province activities will be managed from 
Guadalcanal, and due to the small number of community grants, the Renbel Province Team Leader will also be 
responsible for finance. The provincial government will continue to be responsible for activities in the province, 
through MOUs with MDPAC. Technical support would be engaged from line agency staff at provincial level (e.g. 
Environmental Health; Works; Agriculture; Home Affairs; Education). Management of Component 2 activities will 
be the responsibility of MAL. A Component 2 Manager will be responsible for coordinating all Component 2 
activities and report directly to the Undersecretary, Technical of MAL. In addition to reporting directly to the PS 
MAL, the C2 Manager will work together with the RDP Program Manager and Program Advisor as an overall 
program management team. Two national consultants will be hired to support the partnership and training 
aspects of Component 2, two staff will be hired to provide M&E support, and MAL will assign a Program Assistant 
to support the C2MU team. 

 
 
 .    
F. Project location and Salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 
 
The additional financing does not involve changes to the project location. 

The project will be implemented in the 9 provinces including: Makira, Isabel, Guadalcanal, Central, Choiseul, 
Malaita, Western, Temotu and Rennell and Belona. Choiseul and Temotu are small provinces with a 
population of approximately 20,000 each and Rennell and Belona province has a combined population of 
approximately 3,000; all four island groups are remote from the capital city, Honiara; while Malaita is the 
most populated province (population approximately 120,000) and centrally located, and Western province 
has a population of approximately 60,000.

A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential 
large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
 
The additional financing does not entail changes to project activities and will not trigger additional safeguards policies.

The project’s Environmental and Social Management Framework does not require revision and will continue to be 
used for management of the project’s environmental and social risks. Regarding the safeguards performance to date, 
the Project is compliant with social and environmental safeguards requirements. Land commitment letters are 
secured prior to construction to ensure the sustainability of subprojects. Each subproject has prepared social and 
environmental mitigation measures as part of the Technical Design Form. During the ESMF implementation, there 
have been several cases where enhanced oversight and support were required. The project team has satisfactorily 
addressed those cases with support and guidance from Bank team. Safeguards issues have related to staffing, 
monitoring and training and have therefore been addressed without revision of the ESMF. 
 
Environmental impacts or issues associated with Component I and II subproject investments are not expected to be 
significant. They are expected to be temporary and can be mitigated. Likewise, social risks will continue to be minor, 
with small portions of land needing to be acquired for infrastructure subprojects and Indigenous Peoples to be 
engaged with during subproject preparation and implementation. The Environmental and Social Management 
Framework (ESMF) and Pest Management Plan (PMP) used for RDP II will continue to be applied, and incorporated 
into procedures within the Project Implementation Manual.  
 
The potential impact of any subproject will depend on the nature, location and specific characteristics of the 
investment. In most cases, adverse environmental impacts are expected to be temporary and limited to the 
construction phase. They could include temporary disturbance of drains or streams, noise and dust during 
construction, small-scale vegetation loss, and pollution from inappropriate construction materials waste disposal. 
 
Most adverse impacts will be highly localized (construction work site), temporary, and easily mitigated through 
appropriate siting of the sub-projects and good construction and operation practices. The subproject screening 
process described in the ESMF, and the use of standard construction practices and mitigation measures will ensure 
adequate mitigation of those risks. 
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area: 
As with the parent Project, there are no long-term impacts anticipated due to the small scale and dispersed nature of 
the planned activities. 
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts. 
To minimize adverse impacts, a screening process and standard mitigation practices has been established in RDP II and 
will continue to be used in the additional financing. The screening process will include considerations for alternative 
subprojects and/or alternative siting as appropriate. The procedures to be followed are included in the ESMF. The 
project promotes good agricultural practices, including disaster and climate resilience. 
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower 
capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The project aims to address social and environmental issues through the planning and subproject selection process for 
each Component. Guidelines for environmental assessment, including screening for forests and natural habitats 
issues, of proposed subprojects and activities managed by the communities and the private sector agribusiness 
partners have been developed and they are integrated in the planning, selection, appraisal, monitoring and audit at 
the time of project completion. 
 
With regards to Component 2, OP 4.09 the Pest Management Plan (PMP) which was implemented under RDP I has 
been revised and included in the ESMF.

Indigenous Peoples: OP/BP 4.10 is also triggered for the additional financing. However, since virtually all of the 
beneficiaries of the project are rural Solomon Islanders who are living on their ancestral lands and are indigenous (as 
defined by the policy), the project documentation itself constitutes the Indigenous Peoples Plan (IPP). Relevant 
aspects include: 
 
(a) Free, prior and informed consultations during preparation: As with RDP II, community consultations will be 
conducted in all participating provinces in local languages, with separate discussions with vulnerable groups (such as 
women and youth). 
(b) Free, prior and informed consultations during implementation: Under RDP II, activities under both Components of 
the project are demand-driven and have to follow a rigorous process of identification, appraisal and approval. This will 
be followed under the additional financing; Consultations will be systematically carried out as part of the project 
design, and decision-making structures at the community level include representatives of traditional authorities, 
women, youth and churches. The project will include a comprehensive set of communication activities, with the use of 
various media to increase outreach (local radio talk-talks, village-based facilitators, NGOs, pamphlets explaining 
safeguards policies and project mechanisms, etc.) at all stages. This also includes complaint mechanisms and 
independent monitoring of project activities and processes. 
 
Involuntary Resettlement: Like the parent Project, this policy is also not triggered as the additional financing does not 
finance any activity that requires involuntary resettlement, and any “new” land acquisition is done only on a voluntary 
basis. The “Land Commitment Letter” will continue to be obtained and used as the main mode of land acquisition. 
However, it must be noted that the experience of RDP II with regard to such is that the process of consultation that 
takes place in accomplishing the Land Commitment Letter makes land acquisition successful more than the document 
itself. With the Borrower having learned from past experience with RDP I and II on land acquisition, it is expected that 
very minimal issues will be encountered, if at all. 
 
Physical Cultural Resources: The objective of OP/BP 4.11, Physical Cultural Resources, is to avoid, or mitigate, adverse 
impacts on cultural resources from development projects that the World Bank finances. Cultural property includes 
monuments, structures, works of art, or sites of significance, and are defined as sites and structures having 
archaeological, historical, architectural, or religious significance, and natural sites with cultural values. This includes 
cemeteries, graveyards and graves. The project poses limited risks of damaging cultural property since sub-projects 
are identified by the communities themselves who are most likely aware of their own cultural property in the area of 
operation. The Safeguard Screening, Monitoring and Audit Form, which is included in the PIM, includes questions that 
assist the community in deter mining what to do if cultural property is identified. While there have yet to be any 
“chance find” (when project activities discover unanticipated cultural artifacts) events during the parent project, a 
simple set of procedures have been incorporated into the PIM, and provided in the ESMF Supplement, in case such 
events should occur during the construction of sub-projects during the period of additional financing. 
 
The borrower has demonstrated an effective ability to manage environmental and social safeguards under RDP I and 
II. A qualified safeguard specialist is in the Project Coordination Unit who is responsible for screening and resolving 
safeguard issues both prior to a sub-project being included in the program and during sub-project implementation. 
Through RDP I, the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock has built its capacity to regulate agriculture-related 
environmental safeguards, including the formation and regular convening of a Pesticide Registration Advisory 
Committee (PRAC) to regulate the use of pesticides. Periodic training will be conducted for safeguard and other 
project staff as well as for funding recipients under Components 1 and 2.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, 
with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
Key stakeholders of the additional financing will still be rural Solomon Islanders who are residents of the villages in the 
wards and provinces covered by the project, specifically farming communities, with respect to Component II. In 
addition to individual farmers and their associations and farmer groups, stakeholders include agribusiness dealers, 
national research and extension service providers, national and local institutions. To reiterate, the ESMF for the 
original project remains valid for the AF activities and therefore requires no changes, and will continue to be used. The 
document will not be re-disclosed. The ESMF was last disclosed on 24 August 2014. 
 
Community consultations are an integral part of the selection and appraisal of subproject activities in RDP II and this 
will be carried over in the additional financing. Project beneficiaries will participate through public consultation 
meetings and discussions of local development priorities, representation in ward development committees and 
provincial development councils, and representation in the Subproject Implementation Committees (SICs). No 
subproject will be selected that does not flow from this planning process. This includes the social and environmental 
information, training and the screening process described in detail in the ESMF. Village-based facilitators (Community-
Helpers) are trained on the project's environmental and social guidelines. Since environmental and social criteria will 
be fully integrated throughout the planning, selection and appraisal process, stakeholder participation and 
information disclosure will be assured at every stage of project implementation.

B. Introduction and Context 

 
Country Context 

 
1. Chad is sparsely populated, with only 13 million people, and vast in size (being more than 1 million km²). 
It is a low-income country, with a gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of about US$823 in 2018, and, has 
among the lowest human development indicators in the world. The country is divided into 23 regions located in 
three main geographical zones: a desert zone in the north, an arid Sahelian belt in the center, and a more fertile 
Sudanese savanna zone in the south. It faces adverse climate conditions including prolonged droughts in some 
areas and yearly flows in others, as well as wind erosion, and desertification, leading to recurrent food crises, as 
well as population displacement. Combined with security risks due to political instability and transit through Chad 
by terrorist groups such as Boko Haram, and al Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), as well as an uptick in 
migration, urban populations are projected to reach nearly 6 million by 2030, or 27 percent of the total population. 
Chad is home to an estimated 450,000 displaced people, the large majority of which are refugees1.  
 

2. The economy is largely dominated by agriculture and extractive industries, mainly oil. However, the 
recent fall in oil prices has had a dramatic impact on an economy in which oil accounted for 30 percent of total 
GDP and 70 percent of Government revenues in 2017. Almost half (47 percent) of the population was living under 
the national poverty line in 2011, the most recent year for which poverty numbers are available. The high level of 
poverty is accompanied by low human development, and Chad currently ranks 157 out of 157 in the recent World 
Bank Human Capital Index (HCI) with an index estimated at 0.29 meaning that Chad is losing 71 percent of its 
potential productivity. Life expectancy at birth is 51.9 years, expected years of schooling is 7.3 years, and mean 

                                                           
1 Based on the UNHCR definition refugees are people who are recognized as refugees under the 1951 Convention Relating to the 
Status of Refugees or its 1967 Protocol, the 1969 Organization of African Unity Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of 
Refugee Problems in Africa, people recognized as refugees in accordance with the UNHCR statute, people granted refugee-like 
humanitarian status, and people provided temporary protection. Asylum seekers--people who have applied for asylum or refugee 
status and who have not yet received a decision or who are registered as asylum seekers--are excluded. Country of asylum is the 
country where an asylum claim was filed and granted.

years of schooling stands at just 2.3 years. Education attainment is highly unequal with people in the wealthiest 
quintile having an average of 6.7 years of schooling, compared with 1.0 for those in the poorest quintile. 

 

3. Two thirds of the population are less than 25 years old and the proportion of young people will continue 
to increase dramatically in the coming years. Those under the age of 24 will continue to grow faster than the rest 
of the population through 2050 creating an even bigger “youth bulge.” The growing population and increasing 
dependency ratios are challenging for increasing employment, improving productivity, and adequately providing 
public services. The high population growth rate alone will result in extreme pressure on the health and education 
sectors, requiring a continuous increase in expenditures just to maintain coverage. The “youth bulge” will lead to 
a sharp rise in the number of young people seeking employment, and urbanization will push and increasing 
proportion of these youth to seek employment outside of the agricultural sector, though this increase is slow, and 
the majority will remain in informal work in agriculture.  

Sectoral and Institutional Context 
 

Sector Context  

4. Low education and literacy levels are severe constraints to a productive labor force. The education 
system in Chad is subdivided into early childhood education (almost inexistent, gross enrolment rate (GER) of 2%), 
six years of primary education, four years of lower secondary education, three years of upper secondary 
education, and higher education. However, according to the DHS 2014-15, almost half (46 percent) of primary-
school-age children in Chad did not attend school. Stark gender and regional inequalities remain, with a gender 
parity rate at 0.75. For those who do attend school, low learning outcomes are a perennial challenge, with only 
15.7 percent of sixth graders equipped with sufficient competency in reading according to the 2014 PASEC results. 
The low supply of science and technology skills is particularly acute, with just 67 girls nationally enrolled in 
mathematics and science tracks in the last year of upper secondary – or 0.1 percent of the total baccalaureate 
candidates.  
 

5. While the unemployment rate for the working age population is low in Chad (as in other parts of SSA), 
the youth unemployment rate is notably higher. It was estimated at around 9 percent for both 2016 and 2017 
with young women more likely to be unemployed (at a rate of 10.6 percent). Comparatively, the working age 
population unemployment rate is estimated at 5.8 percent in 2017 up from 5.7 percent in 20162. Educated youth 
and youth in urban areas appear to be more likely to be unemployed, and if Chadians are working, the quality of 
their jobs tends to be low.  According to ECOSIT 3 data, more than 35 percent of the working age population is 
underemployed, especially in rural areas (36.4 percent, compared to 27.2 percent in urban areas). 

 

6. A high concentration of the labor force in self-employed informal and low-productivity operations. Most 
of the workers are in the informal sector which represents 95 percent of the workforce. Jobs in the informal sector 
are highly vulnerable, with low earnings, and low dependability. Even outside of agriculture, 60 percent of jobs 
are in the informal sector. Of the 400,000 informal establishments outside of agriculture, most are engaged in 
trade and repair of vehicles or equipment, followed by manufacturing of food and beverages.  As above, 
underemployment remains a major challenge. Within the informal sector 39.2 percent of the workers in the non-
agricultural sector are estimated to be underemployed vs. 40.2 percent for agricultural workers.

7. The agriculture sector employs 80 percent of the Chadian workforce and accounts for 52 percent of 
GDP. It is also the second largest source of export income for the country after oil. The Government has, among 
other actions, prioritized the industrialization of agriculture with the aim of boosting exports to diversify the 
economy, but the sector is struggling to modernize and remains largely dependent on weather conditions3. Family 
farming often has low productivity and profitability and lacks resilience to shocks. While lack of equipment and 
technology contribute to low productivity and profitability, low education levels and lack of skills are also key 
determinants. Support for more productive self-employment and diversification of rural livelihoods is critical to 
supporting the high proportion of vulnerable rural Chadians.  

 

8. A multi-tier system of technical and vocational education and training (TVET) exists, with several 
institutions that focus on providing differing levels of skills but is complex and poorly coordinated. Students at 
the lower secondary level can seek a DFFTP (Diplôme de Fin de Formation Technique et Professionnelle) which is 
awarded after two years of vocational study at a technical college. Students who pass the exit examination at the 
end of the lower secondary cycle can also enroll in a three-year program taught in a lycée technique, leading to 
the degree of BT. Students who successfully complete middle school can also seek a BEP degree which can be 
obtained with two years of technical or vocational training in a college technique following successful completion 
of middle school. The technical and vocational education sector includes two industrial technical high schools, 
four industrial technical secondary schools, twenty-one high schools specialized in commerce. In addition to these 
institutions there are eighteen apprenticeship and training centers with varying levels of capacity, which tend to 
focus on shorter term training.  
 

9. Although TVET and skills development efforts are a critical pathway for improving the stock of skilled 
workers for market relevant jobs, the subsector has suffered from numerous challenges which undermine their 
potential. These include the following:    

 

(a) Unsustainable Funding.   Public technical and vocational training institutes receive funding from 
multiple resources, including a payroll tax on private businesses and a tax on foreign workers, but little 
coordination exists among these groups, and allocations do not rely on formal criteria related to needs or 
priorities. In many cases equipment, basic inputs such as electricity, raw materials, and ventilation are 
outdated or non-existent within centers. Further, centers lack autonomy, have no way to generate 
additional revenue, and lack basic governing procedures at the institutional level.  
(b) Low enrollment. TVET centers have extremely low absorptive capacity despite demand and do 
not make use of efficiency measures in scheduling and shifting to maximize space and enrollment. In the 
school year 2014 - 157,042 students were enrolled in technical colleges, and 1,039 in vocational schools. 
The majority of students (5,563 students or 78.3 percent) chose the technical commercial schools while 
the remaining 21.7 percent enrolled in the technical and industrial streams. Private institutions account 
for 27 percent of total enrollment. 
(c) Lack of diversity and access. Access is particularly limited for Chadians living in rural areas, as well 
as women both in rural and urban areas. Furthermore, inclusion measures for participants with 
disabilities, even very basic ones, do not exist within the centers. Just 1.5 percent of enrollment at the 
secondary level is occupied by rural Chadians, given that the centers are concentrated in major cities and 
there are few offerings focused on key sectors such as agriculture,4 and the female imbalance is acute 

                                                           
3 Agriculture Sector Review Report (ASRR) 2017.  
4 N’Djamena is home to 37 percent of the TVET institutions and 48 percent of the sector’s students. In Moundou, the country’s 
second largest city, these numbers stand at 9 percent and 18 percent respectively.

(except for the commercial streams5. Girls accounted for only 5 percent of the total 2,518 enrollees in the 
industrial streams of the TVET institutions and there are extremely small numbers of female teachers and 
no female directors in any of the TVET institutions.6  
(d) Limited relevance and low quality. The key factors driving low quality are (i) program offerings 
do not appear to be driven by employment offerings and do not result in required skills for employment7; 
(ii) equipment is outdated or nonexistent, and hands-on application is often not possible; and (iii) poorly 
trained trainers and staff as well as outdated heavily theoretical curricula diminish the quality of training 
to students.   
(e) Lack of industry involvement. AFD is supporting development of standards which were previously 
non-existent or defunct, however there remains very little input from industry on training design. Further, 
for entrepreneurship and self-employment, even though these remain the main sources of employment. 

 

Institutional Context and Government Strategy  

 

10. The technical and vocational training sector is highly fragmented in terms of both service delivery and 
financing. At least seven ministries intervene in one way or another in the training sector. The three main 
ministries are (i) the Ministry of Vocational Training and Micro Commerce (Ministère de la Formation 
Professionnelle et des Petits Métiers, MFPPM); (ii) the Ministry of National Education and Civics Promotion 
(Ministère de l’Education Nationale et de la Promotion Civique, MENPC); and (iii) the Ministry of Higher Education, 
Research and Innovation (Ministère de l’Enseignement Supérieur, de la Recherche et de l’Innovation, MESRI). Each 
of these ministries manages training centers or schools which deliver diplomas or certificates to its graduates. 
However, many other ministries also manage training schools and centers in their specific sector without any 
relationship to the three major ministries. The Ministry of Civil Service, Labor, and Social Dialogue manages eight 
training centers and the Ministry of Agriculture has 35 centers. The Ministries of Health, Justice, Livestock, Post 
and Telecommunications, and Youth to name a few all manage technical and vocational centers.   
 

11. The National Development Plan (2017-2021), aims at developing Chad into an emerging regional 
country by 2030. It champions the four strategic objectives of (i) strengthening of national unity; (ii) strengthening 
good governance and the rule of law; (iii) the development of a diversified and competitive economy; and (iv) 
improving the quality of life of the Chadian population. As part of this approach, there is an emphasis on improved 
human capacity development and specifically improvement of technical and vocational education through 
Outcome 4.2.2 which stipulates that the actions planned to improve the sector are: (i) building the human and 
material capacities of institutes of technical education; (ii) improving governance of the sector; (iii) improving 
access to, and the fairness and quality of, technical training centers; and (iv) vocational training centers; and (v) 
building the capacities of human resources.  

 

12. President Idriss Deby, reiterated the importance of education and youth employment, following the 
new constitution, in a speech in May 2018, in which he presented the country’s commitment to human capital 
development. This includes significant education reforms which aim to connect education to the world of work, 

                                                           
5 Technical commercial streams graduate students in fields such as management, commerce, or business. 
6 According to 2017-18 institutional annual reports there was one female out of 26 teachers (or 3.8 percent) and 10 females out 

of 70 teachers (or 14.3 percent) in the TVET school of Moundou (CETIM) and N’Djamena (LETIN) respectively 

7 Opportunities in areas such as agriculture, forestry, and fishing, even though they are the main sub-sectors of employment are 
rarely offered.

ensure that skills development of young people is responsive to the most pressing needs of the country especially 
in the critical sector of agriculture, and ensuring more and better job opportunities for young women and men.  

 

13. The specific policy objectives for Technical and Vocational training are further outlined in the 2017 
National Employment and Training Policy, and the 2014 Interim Strategy for TVET which is not yet validated. 
These strategic documents main objectives are to equip young and adult Chadians with the necessary skills to find 
decent jobs or create their own jobs in the growth sectors. To that end, the Government is cognizant of the 
necessity to reform the technical and vocational training sectors by improving its quality and creating stronger 
links with the private sector. The system will also need to improve its absorptive capacity to be able to train even 
a small share of the massive number of youths that will enter the labor market during the next decade, estimated 
at 2.5 million. Without comprehensive and profound reforms, the sector is very unlikely to be able to deliver the 
expected results.

D. Project Description  

 
14. To improve skills, employability, employment prospects, and labor market outcomes for its youth Chad 
will need to adopt a multi-pronged strategy: (i) improve the quality of its general education especially the pre-
primary and primary cycles (PARSET2 is focused on primary education); (ii) improve the quality and relevance of 
its formal technical and professional skills formation system which will lead to higher quantity and better 
employability; and (iii) support the skills acquisition system for those in the informal sector or out-of-school. The 
project is designed to support these through four components. Component 1 will support the expansion of 
quality training opportunities by strengthening the public sector system, while Component 2 aims at improving 
the school to work transition for those in secondary technical or post-secondary education and bringing training 
opportunities to out-of-school youth and those living in rural areas. The main objective of Component 3 is to 



 

The World Bank  
CHAD Skills Development for Youth Employment and Competitiveness Project (P164297) 

 

 

  
Apr 12, 2019 Page 8 of 23  

 

strengthen the governance of the TVET public system which will have medium to long term impacts on the 
system’s ability to deliver quality training and make quality improvements implemented by the project self-
sustaining. Lastly, component 4 will focus on the project management and instilling a culture of monitoring and 
evaluation.  

 

Component 1. Expanding Access to Skills through Improved Technical and Vocational Education 

(US$14.7 million) 

 

15. This component aims to improve access to training and improve the overall quality of vocational 
training to meet the needs of the of the Chadian economy in sectors with high labor potential. This objective 
will be achieved through two sub-components: i) creation of a new model Centre de Formation Technique et 
Professionnelle (Center of Technical and Professional Training -CFTP), including the construction of the CFTP and 
the development of new management and training methods; and (ii) the improvement of the quality and 
upgrading of existing technical and vocational secondary schools in the industrial stream (Collèges and Lycèes 
d’Enseignement Technique et Industriel, CETIN and LETIN). Youth aged 14-29 will be targeted who meet the 
qualifications for entry into the newly created and restructured institutions and will benefit at least 30 percent 
females.  
 

16. Component 1 will roll out a new institutional management and operations model which utilizes industry 
linkages and reorientation of the programs around labor insertion for graduates. This includes adopting sector 
specific curricula currently under development with support from AFD and in-depth training of school managers 
and trainers to upgrade quality of teaching and institutional management. To this end multi-year performance-
based contracts (PBCs) will be signed between the government and targeted institutions which incentivize 
improved relevance, quality, access, and employment outcomes. Greater autonomy of training institutions and 
several sector reforms are required to create an enabling environment for this results-based management and 
operations model, which will be supported under Component 3.  

 

Sub-component 1.1 Improving Access to Quality Skills through the Creation of a new CFTP and 

Expanded Opportunities through preexisting CFTPs (US$5.3 million) 

 

17. The construction of a new CFTP will be funded by the project. The new institution will incorporate the 
new pedagogical and management models including participation from the private sector. The site for the center 
will be X.  
 

18. The project will finance development of the PBC between the CFTP and Ministry which elaborate clear 
targets namely: (i) the establishment of a Board of Directors; (ii) a minimum private sector and civil society 
participation of 40 percent in the Board of Directors; (iii) number young people registered by specialty area; (iv) 
the share of girls enrolled; (v) the share of enrollees participating in dual-training programs; (vi) number of 
graduates certified ; (vii) monitoring of graduates’ insertion in the labor market; (viii) effective in-service training 
of trainers; and (ix) the implementation of a new financing model. The performance contracts will be monitored 
by the MFPPM and each CFTP through their own monitoring and evaluation systems. They will also be supported 
by PARSET2 monitoring and evaluation specialist.

19. Main activities: this sub-component will finance the construction of a new CFTP and the following 
activities through the PBCs: (i) the development and implementation of new pedagogical models and curricula; 
(ii) new administrative management involving the private sector; (iii) strengthening of the professional and 
teaching competencies of trainers; (iv) the provision of relevant equipment; (v) the purchasing of adapted 
textbooks; (vi) rehabilitation of existing infrastructures and equipment; (vii) information and sensitization 
campaigns to attract more female students; and (viii) governance reform and institutional financing. 

 

Sub-component 1.2 Rehabilitation and upgrading of Lycees Techniques et Industriels (US$9.4 million) 

 

20. The project will support the reform and upgrading (modernization) of two to four collèges and lycées 
techniques et industriels through performance-based contracts to improve the quality of service delivery and 
the efficiency and effectiveness of the LETINs. These institutions currently offer courses in construction, 
electricity, and automotive, among others. The institutions are characterized by outdated equipment, limited 
hands-on and relevant training, heavily theory based teaching, and weak links with the private sector. The aim is 
to focus the course offerings, improve the management of the schools, strengthen practicum-based teaching and 
learning, introduce entrepreneurship and non-cognitive (socio-emotional) skills development8, and improve 
linkages with related industry to better prepare graduates for employability, in addition to upgrading of hardware. 

 

21. The project will provide support for the preparation of operational manuals regarding the management 
of TVET schools, performance monitoring, relationship with the private sector relations and the preparation of 
regulatory texts. Technical assistance will be recruited to support the teams responsible for the management of 
TVET schools and the ministerial directorates in charge of technical education and vocational training.  

 

22. Technical auditors will be recruited to conduct an external evaluation of each performance contract and 
certify the level of achievement of the expected results. The technical audit report will be used to determine the 
amount of funds to be allocated for the following year. 

 

23. Main activities: this sub-component will finance the following activities through the PBCs: (i) the 
development and implementation of new pedagogical models and curricula (in coordination with AFD programs); 
(ii) new administrative management involving the private sector; (iii) strengthening of the professional and 
teaching competencies of trainers; (iv) the provision of relevant equipment including for ICT; (v) the purchasing of 
adapted textbooks; (vi) rehabilitation of existing infrastructures and equipment; (vii) information and sensitization 
campaigns to attract more female students; (viii) governance reform and institutional financing; and (ix) study 
tours for all relevant actors especially at the central level, directors, and a select number of teachers. The sub-
component will also finance technical assistance to the TVET school to help them navigate through the 
institutional changes envisioned in the project and improve their financial management capacity.

24. This component seeks to provide first work experiences, and skills relevant to labor market demands, 
including entrepreneurship training, to youth. Targeted young people may have completed the full education 
cycle or dropped out of the school system prior to completion. The objective is to provide quality hands-on job 
training and entrepreneurship training, to improve employability, employment prospects, and ultimately 
livelihoods. This would include (a) internships for skilled graduates in their prospective professions; (b) 
apprenticeships; and (c) entrepreneurship for agricultural development. Apprenticeships and entrepreneurship 
approaches focus heavily on unskilled workers given that they are the most promising approaches to helping the 
large scale of low-skilled individuals within Chad transition into employment/self-employment.

Sub-component 2.1 Internships to Improve School-to-Work Transition (US$6.8 million) 

 

25. The internship program aims to improve the employment outcomes of graduates transitioning from 
secondary or post-secondary general education and TVET institutions into the labor market. Chad’s educational 
system does not have sufficiently strong linkages with the private sector to facilitate the immersion of young 
graduates in enterprises during their time at school or following their graduation. The subcomponent aims to 
address this practical skills gap of current graduates, while simultaneously reorienting the TVET institutional 
approach to focus on employment.  

 

26. Internships will last 6 months during which the internships are funded fully by the project. After the first 
6 months, the contract will be renewable for another 6 months, at which point the intern would be partially funded 
(50 percent) by the enterprise. Internships could for example include placements in hotels, healthcare, other 
service sectors, and construction firms which have been shown through data from ONAPE to recruit the highest 
numbers of workers. After one year, the intern then becomes eligible for recruitment, at which point the company 
would be wholly responsible for funding. The number of interns a company can hire over the course of the project 
and at any point in time will be limited (with optimal limit to be determined) to avoid abuse of the system by 
companies, as well as limits on the number of trainees a company can take without hiring any. The monthly

internship stipend amount will not exceed 60,000 XOF with girls receiving a higher stipend to cover for potential 
day care cost. 

 

27. Main activities: The sub-component will finance (i) employment and internships recruiting camps in 
technical schools, training centers, and universities jointly hosted by ONAPE and the private sector, (ii) 
communications campaigns and partnership building in private companies; (iii) internship payments that include 
stipends, accident and medical insurance coverage, and (iv) technical assistance to ONAPE to implement the 
program and setup a website and the support to its decentralized branches outside of the capital city. 

 

Sub-component 2.2 Expanding Opportunities for Apprenticeships (US$9.2 million).  

 

28. An apprenticeship scheme will be developed to facilitate improved labor market integration for youth 
through a dual apprenticeship program which combines adapted training programs with on-the job training 
opportunities with craftspeople and professionals. Dual training refers to a combination of practical, on the job 
training, and theoretical education to ensure an optimal blend of theory and practice. Training programs will 
combine practical training and theory with an emphasis on hands-on experiences in various types of workshops. 
Training in training institutions will constitute 25 percent of the program, with 75 percent focused on hands-on 
practical application, and will be targeting to youth with a minimum level of education. Additionally, training in 
functional literacy, numeracy and life skills will be coupled with the job specific training to improve employability. 
 
29. To encourage female participation the project will pay a higher stipend to girls especially those with 
children who need to pay for day care costs. The payment of the stipend will depend on attendance. The project 
will also encourage girls to join male-dominated trades which provide better employment prospects and higher 
earnings in the labor market through a targeted sensitization campaign. 

 

30. Main Activities: the sub-component will finance (i) training fees for the training providers and master 
craftsmen; (ii) stipends for the trainees paid via mobile money; (iii) training in functional literacy and numeracy 
and life skills by qualified training providers; (iv) a defined package of materials and equipment including all 
necessary protections, (v) accident and medical insurance coverage for apprentices; (vi) costs associated with 
training of trainers, upgrading of skills of apprentice instructors, (vii) costs associated with selection and placement 
of apprentices; (viii) development of new training guidelines and the design and implementation of the regulatory 
and operational framework for the apprenticeship program; and (ix) an institutional and organizational audit of 
FONAP as well as monitoring and evaluation. 

 

Sub-component 2.3 Development of Agricultural Entrepreneurship (US$9.0 million) 

 

31. The sub-component will aim to provide entrepreneurship training to youth in rural communities to 
improve livelihoods. The goal is to provide necessary skills for addressing constraints related to (i) lack of 
entrepreneurship know-how (equipping small scale farmers with knowledge to diversify options and ideally 
transition out of subsistence farming); ii) community organizing along agro-value chains (i.e. building the value 
chain so that it is possible to grow, harvest, transform products, and get them to markets) and (iii) limited means 



 

The World Bank  
CHAD Skills Development for Youth Employment and Competitiveness Project (P164297)

of food processing (i.e. loss of mangos during mango season due to limited technical skills and small scale 
equipment which result in not being able to transform/conserve them).  The approach is consistent with the large 
numbers of youth who remain in rural communities in Chad, and the majority of workers who are engaged in 
informal employment in the agriculture sector.  

 

32. Linkages between producers and sources of financing will be critically important and will be facilitated 
by connecting promising small-scale agriculture entrepreneurs with micro-loans via ONAPE. ONAPE has prior 
experience providing micro-lending to agriculture entrepreneurs, thus the program will build on the current 
mechanism, improve capacity and scale the approach. 

 

33. Main Activities: The sub-component will finance (i) a campaign to promote training activities and 
agriculture as a viable livelihood; (ii) the development of the training modules; (iii) delivery of training sessions via 
contracted local NGOs; (iv) training of trainers; (v) agriculture micro-loans through the existing ONAPE financing 
mechanism; and (vi) monitoring and evaluation. 

 

Component 3. Improving TVET System Governance and Institutional Capacity Building (US$5.9 million) 

 

34. This component is designed to strengthen the TVET system which suffers from weak governance and 
chronic underfunding.  Given the relative neglect of the sub-sector, the sustainability of the project depends on 
the capacity of the collèges, lycées, and CFPT to self-finance their activities.  It is critical that the status of these 
schools is revised to provide them with more autonomy and allow them to generate revenue, and flexibility to 
spend it.  Thus, a new regulatory framework will be necessary as is improved institutional and management 
capacities of the ministries and institutions involved in project implementation and project execution.  
 

35. This component will also build the leadership and management capacity of CFTP and TVET school 
directors to improve service delivery and implement a new finance model. TVET schools have often very low 
teacher-student ratios and teachers are underutilized - working less than 12 hours per week on average. Re-
organizing school calendars, better planning the use of classrooms and workshops, and organizing dual-training 
could substantially increase the number of students the institutions receive without jeopardizing its quality. To 
provide more training opportunities to the youth restructuring the current  financing model which currently 
operates using several uncoordinated sources of funding is critical. Rethinking the highly fragmented nature the 
training fund and address the financing challenges and the fractured nature of the skills development sector in 
Chad in terms of both service delivery and financing is also necessary.  

 

36. Because the reforms envisioned in this component are necessary for the public sector TVET to perform, 
their effective implementation will condition disbursement for the activities in Component 1. As noted earlier, 
if the CETIN, LETIN, and CFTP continue to operate under the current model i.e. with no public financing, no 
possibility to generate own funds, no cooperation with the private sector, and an outdated governance structure 
with little accountability it is very unlikely that any investment in this system will be sustainable. New equipment 
will become old and rusty because of lack of maintenance funds, teachers will quickly revert to theory-only 
teaching because they would lack the necessary material for labs.

37. Main Activities: this component will finance (i) TA to revisit the TVET national strategy and the national 
employment policy; (ii) roundtable and national consultations around the revised strategy; (iii) training of CFTP 
and TVET institutions’ staff; (iv) capacity building activities of selected training institutions, government 
departments, private sector associations, and employment agencies; (v) south-south exchanges through study 
tours; (vi) the revision of the national strategy of technical and vocational education and training, (vii) revision of 
the national employment policy; (viii) ONAPE’s capacity building to manage a website and generate databases to 
match supply and demand sides; (ix) national awareness campaigns that promote TVET and especially girls in 
TVET; (x) a study on the supply of training in Chad; and (xi) organizational and institutional audits of ONAPE, 
FONAP, and other important institutions. 

 

Component 4. Project Management and Monitoring and Evaluation (US$5.0 million) 

 

38. This component will support the Project Coordination Unit (PCU), M&E activities, and capacity building 
activities associated with the implementation of the project. PARSET2’s PCU which has successfully managed 
several projects is retained to manage the project. The PCU will be responsible for overall coordination and 
implementation of project activities, as well as financial management (FM) and procurement. The project would 
finance the salaries of PCU staff, operational costs and the cost of equipment. Additionally, this component would 
cover specific technical assistance (TA) and capacity building needs for project implementation, and M&E 
(including third party validation, surveys, and impact evaluations). The proposed capacity building activities under 
this component could include: (i) trainings, study tours, and other initiatives to enhance the capacity of relevant 
ministry or agency staff to implement, coordinate, and monitor their programs; and (ii) capacity building of TVET 
institution administrators to increase their capacity to design surveys, conduct tracer studies and utilize the data 
for analysis and action.  

 

39. Assessment activities – including, impact evaluations and beneficiary surveys of interventions under 
component 2, as well as support to the Gender Innovation Lab which will work with local institutions to carry out 
statistical analysis/employment surveys/labor studies/etc. monitoring of youth and follow-up activities during 
internships, survey of youth after the completion of the internships, apprenticeships, and entrepreneurships. 
There will also be at least two impact evaluations embedded in the project. This includes working with the Gender 
Innovation Lab to evaluate the impact of the inclusion of socio-emotional in the skills training program on labor 
market outcomes such as likelihood of wage employment, self-employment, or net income. There will be a special 
focus on rural areas and girls.

E. Implementation 
 

Institutional and Implementation Arrangements 
 
40. The project will be implemented over a five-year period. The proposed closing date is October 31, 2024. 
The Ministry of National Education and the Promotion of Civics (Ministère de l’Education Nationale et de la 
Promotion Civique, MENPC) and the Ministry of Vocational Training and Micro Works (Ministère de la Formation 
Professionnelle et des Petits Métiers, MFPPM) will be the main implementing agencies for the project. 
 
41. Steering Committee (SC). A system-wide Steering Committee (SC) will be established to provide 
guidance to the project on an annual basis. The representative of the MFPPM will be the President of the SC and 
the representative of the MENPC will assume the Vice-Presidency. The SC will have representatives of MEPD, the 
Ministry of Higher Education, Research, and Innovation (Ministère de l’Enseignement Supérieur, de la Recherche 
et de l’Innovation, MESRI), the Ministry of Finance and Budget (Ministère des Finances et du Budget, MFB), the 
Ministry of Civil Service, Work, and Social Dialogue (Ministère de la Fonction Publique, du Travail et du Dialogue 
Social, MFPTDS), the Ministry of Youth Promotion, Sports, and Employment (Ministère de la Promotion des 
Jeunes, des Sports, et de l’Emploi, MPJSE), the Ministry of Production, Irrigation, and Agricultural Equipment 
(Ministère de la Production, de l’Irrigation et des Equipements Agricoles, MPIEA). It should also include 
representatives of civil society and private sector. 

 

42. At the annual meeting, the MENPC and MFPPM with support from the PCU will provide results for the 
year and will set out its intended results and necessary resources for the following year. The annual meeting 
will be done before the end of September of each year to ensure that the decisions taken by the Steering 
Committee are reflected in the budget submission for the following year. The first meeting of the Steering 
Committee is expected to take place in November 2019 (the second in September 2020) while the first annual 
work plan will be devised by the preparation team with the support of PARSET2. 

 

43. The PCU will be responsible for daily project coordination, as well as the administration of the financing: 
procurement, financial management, disbursement, monitoring, reporting and evaluation, environmental and 
social safeguards. The PCU is already staffed with a qualified Project Coordinator, Procurement Specialist, 
Financial Management Specialist, Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Specialist, and Accountant. PARSET will be 
required to hire a team of engineers who will help oversee the CFTP construction and the rehabilitation program 
of the lycées and collèges d’enseignement technique et industriel. In addition, the DPEF will add a full-time 
Safeguards Specialist to ensure that the environmental and social safeguards requirements are met. Technical 
implementation of the Project will be the responsibility of each concerned department within the MENPC, 



 

The World Bank  
CHAD Skills Development for Youth Employment and Competitiveness Project (P164297) 

 

 

  
Apr 12, 2019 Page 15 of 23  

 

MFPPM, MFPTDS, and MEPD. Detailed project implementation mechanisms will be provided in the Project 
Implementation Manual (PIM), which will be completed by effectiveness. 

 

44. The role of the Steering Committee is to provide guidance and advice for strategic direction of the 
project and approve annual budget and action plan. In those cases where specific action is needed to address 
issues that go beyond the scope of any single ministry, the president of the Steering Committee can bring together 
the relevant parties to find solutions to problems that are inter-ministerial in nature, which may be presented to 
the Steering Committee, if necessary. 

 

45. The following implementation arrangements will be established. No more than three months after 
project effectiveness, each relevant MENPC and MFPPM director will nominate focal points who will be heads of 
components and sub-components who will work with the PARSET2 coordinator and the M&E specialist to convene 
the appropriate Government officials to finalize the work plan for each component. These will be key contributions 
to the overall project work plan to be developed by the project coordinator under the guidance of the Steering 
Committee which will be discussed with MENPC and MFPPM and communicated to the Bank. Thereafter, once a 
quarter, the PCU will report on progress to the MENPC and MFPPM as well as key development partners within 
the LEG and will share the work plan for the following three months. 

 

46. Annual reviews will be held in November/December of each year, bringing together all key stakeholders 
in the system. At those reviews, the MENPC and MFPPM officials will provide updates on the status of the technical 
and vocational education and training sector, including information regarding the start of the school year 
(enrollments, recruitments, trainings, and so on). Each functional/central directorate will present its results, and 
each regional directorate will do the same. The arrangements will be formalized in the project implementation 
manual. More details on the project implementation arrangements can be found in Annex 1.

SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY 

 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

Due to the civil works inherent to constructions 
and/or rehabilitation civil works activities of 
schools/centers, the potential social and 
environmental risks of the proposed project are 
expected to be moderate and mostly site-specific, 
with no significant or long-term negative risks and 
impacts, which are foreseen to be easily 
manageable; typical of category B projects. 
  
Since project’s physical footprint is presently 
unknown and would so be prior to appraisal, in 
compliance with OP/BP 4.01 (Environmental 
Assessment) core requirements, the Borrower will 
prepare, consult upon and publicly disclose – both 
in-country and on the world Bank’s website, prior to 
appraisal, an environmental and Social Management 
Framework (ESMF) to guide the way that potential 
negative environmental and social risks and impacts 
of future sub-projects will be identified and 
mitigated during project implementation.  If, during 
project preparation/implementation, any project 
specific site is known before appraisal, a site-specific 
an Environmental and Social Impact Assessments 
(ESIA)/Environmental and Social Management Plans 
(ESMP) will also be prepared, amply consulted upon 
and publicly disclosed, both in-country and on the 
World Bank website prior to appraisal the physical 
start of civil works  

Performance Standards for Private Sector 
Activities OP/BP 4.03 

No  

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 No  

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No  

Pest Management OP 4.09 No 

The project comprises no activity which may induce 
the purchase and/or the use of pesticides or related 
chemicals. The project will not finance pesticides 
acquisition or distribution. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 Yes 

This policy is triggered because of the nature of 
possible civil works to be financed under component 
1 – more precisely under sub-component 1.2 which 
might lead to the unearthing of such potential 
physical cultural resources (PCR).  Nevertheless, it is 



 

The World Bank  
CHAD Skills Development for Youth Employment and Competitiveness Project (P164297) 

 

 

  
Apr 12, 2019 Page 17 of 23  

 

highly unlikely that any physical cultural resources 
will be impacted; nonetheless, the existing a  
“Chance finds procedures” will be embedded in the 
ESMF to ensure that these aspects will be taken into 
account an adequate management of PSRs during 
project preparation and implementation. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 No 
The policy is not triggered as there are no 
Indigenous People in project targeted areas. 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

The project has triggered OP/BP 4.12 (Involuntary 
Resettlement) to enable the project to better tackle 
issues related to land acquisition, including 
economic and physical displacement. Since the 
project footprint is yet to be known, the Borrower 
will prepare project has updated the a Resettlement 
Policy Framework  (RPF) for each participating 
country. The RPF sets out the policies, principles, 
institutional arrangements, likely categories of 
affected people, eligibility criteria and categories, 
compensation rates, methods of valuing affected 
assets, community participation and information 
dissemination, Grievance Redress Mechanism and 
effective monitoring and evaluation. The RPF will be 
amply consulted upon, and once cleared by the Bank 
it will be publicly disclosed both in-country and at 
the WB’s external website prior to appraisal.  
 
 Further, when investment sites lead to land take 
that causes economic and/or physical displacement, 
the borrower will prepare a site-specific 
Resettlement Action Plan (RAP). Since the 
resettlement process is meant to be inclusive to 
encompass vulnerable social groups and guarantee 
that they receive fair and equitable treatment, the 
corresponding site-specific RAPs, wherever deemed 
necessary, will be consulted upon, cleared by the 
World Bank, and publicly disclosed both in-country 
and at the external WB’s website prior to the 
physical start of civil works  

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 No 
The project will not finance any activities related to 
the construction of dams nor affect operations of 
existing dams or affiliated reservoirs 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

No The project will not affect international waterways. 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No No activities are planned in any disputed areas.

KEY SAFEGUARD POLICY ISSUES AND THEIR MANAGEMENT 

 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential 
large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
The project is focused on improving skills of the Chadian youth, with an emphasis on improving the public TVET 
system, instituting performance-based contracts, building capacity, improving the governance of TVET institutions, 
creating linkages with the private sector, improving monitoring and evaluation, etc. As such, these activities have little 
to no environmental impact. However, civil works will also be financed, such as the construction of technical and 
vocational training centers, and the extension and rehabilitation of secondary technical schools, within existing 
schools, the provision of fencing, access to clean water, adequate sanitation, and electricity for which the most cost-
effective and environment-friendly options (such as solar panels) will be given preference. Impacts from these 
activities could include work-related health and safety impacts; noise, dust, reduction of air and water quality; loss of 
tree/vegetation cover; etc. The short, medium- and long-term socio-economic impact of the proposed project is 
expected to be largely beneficial. The project has a low probability of inducing physical or economic displacement. Its 
intervention is mainly focused on existing secondary schools and vocational training centers except for the 
construction of one new model center. As there may be some unforeseen resettlement. Therefore, the project will 
prepare a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF). The influx of male workers may increase the demand for sex. As a 
result, women in the project community may be subject to higher rates of violence. 
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area: 
Not applicable 
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts. 
Not applicable 
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower 
capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
As the impacts from Project activities on the environment are expected to be moderate, the Borrower will prepare an 
Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF). The ESMF will be used by the implementing agency as a 
defined procedure and guidelines to screen each activity as it is proposed for financing. The ESMF will be used to 
prepare site-specific Environmental and Social Management Plans (ESMPs) which will include impacts, mitigation 
measures, a responsible entity and a budget for each mitigation activity. Given the Recipient’s limited but growing 
experience with implementation of environmental and social safeguards instruments, close safeguards supervision 
and implementation support will be carried out during the early stage of project implementation until adequate 
safeguards experience is developed. The PARSET2 engineer, in collaboration with the relevant directorate and regional 
office of the MFPPM, will supervise the implementation of the safeguards instruments discussed above. IDA 
supervision will focus on: (i) providing regular implementation support; (ii) carrying out field reviews of safeguards 
implementation; and (iii) monitoring safeguards implementation based on periodic progress reports.  
 
The short, medium- and long-term socio-economic impact of the proposed project is expected to be largely beneficial. 
The project has a low probability of inducing physical or economic displacement. Its intervention is mainly focused on 
existing technical secondary schools and vocational training centers. However, the construction of a new vocational

training center is planned in Sahr region. As there may be some unforeseen resettlement. Therefore, the project will 
prepare a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF). The construction to be realized in this project are not large and the 
works will be realized by the local companies. Thus, the influx of foreign labor will be very limited, or-existent. 
Nevertheless, the project will also set in place mechanisms to prevent Sexual Exploitation and Abuse and sexual based 
violence. The project will emphasize the importance of having internal prevention and response systems and policies 
(sexual harassment policies, anonymous reporting mechanisms) in place and building staff capacity to recognize and 
address these issues at the project level during implementation. Finally, a The GRM will be prepared, in consultation 
with stakeholders, including communities. A project level GRM is outlined in the RPF and ESMF. It is designed to be a 
mechanism that is trusted by all relevant partners including the project affected persons (PAPs), if it turns out that 
impacts happened in the implementation stage. It will facilitate the redress of any grievance and conflict that may 
arise from the Project. The PIU will be notified of any disputes in the project zone. Project field staff should work 
closely with the communities and the community leaders to clarify and resolve any misunderstanding that could give 
rise to conflicts. The PIU will develop a clear plan and procedures for the GRM, including complaint collection and 
processing procedures, reporting format, database/records specifications, and committee membership using 
guidelines provided in the RPF and ESMF. Public participation and consultation will be a key part of the process at all 
times to promote understanding and prevent unnecessary complaints and disputes.  
 
IDA supervision will be carried out by field-based Bank technical staff, complemented by specialist consultants as 
necessary, during regular biannual supervision missions and during interim technical safeguards missions that will 
respond to emerging issues. Monitoring will be based on ESMF activities. It will also be an occasion to discuss the 
project safeguard requirements with the Recipient, including management plan and reporting requirements. 
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, 
with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
During the preparation of the ESMF and RPF, the Borrower held consultation with several public TVET institutions and 
communities located in the regions that will be targeted by the project such as Moyen-Chari, Sahr, and Moundou as 
well as in N'Djamena. The Borrower met with TVET schools directors, teachers, and students. Further consultations 
will be held before appraisal and will specifically ensure that vulnerable groups, like women, refugees, etc. are 
included

B. Introduction and Context 

 
Country Context 

1. The Kingdom of Lesotho is a small, mountainous, landlocked country in Southern Africa with a population of 
2.2 million. It is an open economy, traditionally centered on trade, with textiles, water, and diamonds as its 
main exports. Lesotho is a member of the Southern African Customs Union (SACU), the Southern African 
Development Community, and the Common Monetary Area all of which create strong opportunities for regional 
trade. As a member of the Common Monetary Area, its currency is pegged to the South African Rand.   
 

2. Lesotho is one of the poorest countries in the region, with high levels of poverty and inequality.  An estimated 
57 percent of the population lives below the national poverty line and 34 percent fall below the extreme poverty 
line. Income inequality is among the highest in the world. Rural areas, heavily dependent on subsistence and 
semi-subsistence agriculture, account for 70 percent of the population and 87 percent of all people living below 
the poverty line (SCD, 2015). A wide (30 percent) poverty gap, high rates of unemployment, wide prevalence of 
HIV/AIDS, and climate vulnerability further constrain the scope for inclusive growth and improvements in living 
standards. GDP per capita is estimated at US$1,181 (2017) and when adjusted by Purchasing Power Parity is 
equivalent to 16 percent of the world's average.    
  

3. Economic performance declined after 2012 as Lesotho’s growth drivers shifted from exports to high public 
expenditure and consumption. Real annual GDP growth was at a low 2.5 percent in 2016-2017 down from a 4.5 
percent average over the previous five years.  The sharp decline in SACU-related revenues over 2016-2017 and 
increase in public expenditures to 60 percent of GDP, fueled by wage and employment growth in the public 
sector, have resulted in a widening of the fiscal deficit and a difficult economic outlook for the country.  Output 
is estimated to have contracted by 1.6 percent in 2017 and is projected to remain subdued in the near term.

4. Recognizing the inherent unsustainability of this economic model, Lesotho has endorsed a new template for 
development. The recently completed National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP)-II 2018/19 – 2022/23 seeks 
to pursue inclusive, sustainable growth and private sector-led employment creation.  The Government of 
Lesotho (GoL) has identified four productive sectors, viz. agriculture, manufacturing, tourism and creative 
industries and technology and innovation as potential sectors for job creation and inclusive economic growth 
under a new growth path led by the private sector.   

 
 

Sectoral and Institutional Context 
 

5. Agriculture plays a significant role in Lesotho’s economy.  Over 70 percent of the country’s population lives in 
rural areas and depends, directly or indirectly, on agriculture for employment and livelihood.  The sector has 
the highest potential to increase food security, reduce rural poverty, and generate both on- and off-farm 
employment opportunities.  Main crops include maize, sorghum and wheat which are planted as monocrops on 
85 percent of the country’s arable land which comprises 10 percent of Lesotho’s total land area.  Livestock 
contributes 75 percent of total agricultural output, including semi-intensive and intensive production of pigs 
and poultry, as well as extensive (free range) production of goats and sheep on rangelands in the foothills and 
highland areas (Johane, 2011). Sheep and goats, which dominate the livestock sector, are reared mainly for wool 
and mohair.  
 

6. Lesotho’s agricultural sector suffers from low levels of productivity and commercialization which has made 
the country heavily dependent on food imports to meet domestic consumption needs.  Despite 70 percent of 
the rural population engaged in some form of agricultural activity, the sector contributes less than 10 percent 
to the national gross domestic product (GDP). Most of the rural population is engaged in subsistence farming: 
rain-fed, undiversified farming (primarily cereal production) and extensive livestock grazing characterize the 
sector. Productivity challenges in the sector, include, inter alia, limited size of arable land1, unfavorable farm 
structures (average land holding of about 1.0 ha per family), outdated farm technologies and farm management 
practices, limited technical expertise, sub-optimal use of inputs, lack of an adequate irrigation and drainage 
system, weak rural infrastructure, a rudimentary rural advisory system, and limited access to credit and 
investment capital. In addition, the country has experienced severe land degradation.  Massive soil erosion and 
loss of scarce agricultural land have resulted in extremely low agricultural productivity levels: land productivity 
averaged about USD 70 per hectare per year compared to the regional average of about USD 120 per hectare 
per year for the period 2008-2013; cereal yields average less than 1,000 kg per hectare, failing to meet the SADC 
RISDP target of achieving at least 2,000 kg per hectare2. Consequently, marketable surplus remains low.  A 
nascent private sector further constrains commercialization. Private sector activity in Lesotho is dominated by 
micro-enterprises, with a marked absence of the small and medium-sized enterprises that drive economic 
growth and job creation in most countries.3  

                                                           
1 While the agricultural land area of 2.36 million ha accounts for 78 percent of total land area, only 357,000 ha (12 percent) 
is suitable for crop production. Most agricultural land is mountain pasture, suited to extensive livestock production – which 
accounts for 75 percent of the total value of agricultural output. FAOSTAT 
2 Charles Nhemachena, Greenwell Matchaya and Sibusiso Nhlengethwa.  Agricultural Growth Trends and Outlook in Lesotho. 2016 
3 A survey of registered business enterprises in 2015 shows that of 9,625 registered business enterprises, 75.6 percent were 
micro-enterprises (1-4 employees) and 37.5 percent had a turnover of less than one million maloti (approximately 
$US70,000). Only 15 percent of the enterprises surveyed were small to medium (5-50 employees), and only 4.3 percent had 
a gross revenue of 1-5 million maloti ($US 70,000-$350,000). This pattern is even more evident in agro-processing and agri-
business. Five large enterprises dominate the food and beverage sector3, with few medium- or micro-enterprises.

7. Climate change poses major challenges to the development of Lesotho’s agricultural sector.  The Inter-

Governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) categorizes Lesotho as one of the countries highly vulnerable to 
the impacts of climate change.  The country has a temperate climate with subalpine characteristics and 
experiences regular droughts, floods, frosts, snow, hailstorms, and strong winds. The El Niño-Southern 
Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon particularly affects climate variation in Lesotho (MEMWA, 2013)4. High intra-
seasonal and inter-annual rainfall variability, with frequent droughts, has often resulted in delayed planting or 
farmers not planting at all, reduced seed germination due to hardened soil and lack of water, crops failures, 
deterioration of rangelands and pasture, water scarcity for livestock, and increased food prices of staple grains 
such as maize.5  Chronic droughts have also negatively impacted the livestock sector, resulting in rangeland 
degradation and limiting the carrying capacity of pastoral land. The drought of 2015-16 growing season was the 
most severe on record putting over 534,000 people at risk of food insecurity. The current rain-fed crop 
production system with its focus on maize at the expense of diversification to more drought-tolerant crops 
(sorghum, millet, cowpeas) increases vulnerability to climatic shocks. The crop production system also makes 
limited use of climate smart agricultural technologies such as new varieties, conservation agriculture, 
intercropping, integrated pest management and simple water harvesting technologies, all of which compromise 
productivity. The erratic and severe weather patterns and land degradation reinforce the need to mainstream 
climate resilience in Lesotho’s agricultural sector.  
 

8. Provision of irrigation is critical for addressing climatic risks in Lesotho’s agriculture; however, the subsector 
is beset with challenges. Despite the ready availability of water from the mountains, only 2,600 ha of arable 
land has been developed for irrigation.  Poor management and inadequate maintenance have reduced the area 
under irrigation, with only an estimated 1,200 ha under irrigation in 2014.  The modernization of national water 
resource management policies and institutions has been slow and physical infrastructure has deteriorated due 
to lack of public funds for maintenance. Many pump stations are no longer operational and existing headworks 
and reservoirs have silted up. On-farm irrigation systems have also deteriorated due to ill-defined property 
rights over infrastructure and weak local capacity for management. There are few effective community-based 
irrigation management systems and poor links between the existing institutions and the local public institutions 
responsible for water management. Combating the effects of climate change and increasing productivity 
towards food security and commercialization will require sustained efforts to provide adequate, reliable and 
timely delivery of irrigation to Lesotho’s crop and livestock farmers.    
 

9. Development of high value cash crops, such as fruits and vegetables and potatoes as well as dairy and small-
scale pig and poultry production offer opportunities for moving from uncompetitive maize monocropping 
production to a more diversified production base responsive to climatic risks.  Lesotho’s higher altitude, 
potential for early season production and access to cheap water and labor combine to create favorable 
conditions for the production and export of vegetables, fruit and seed potatoes. Regional demand for fruit and 
vegetables is increasing as urban populations grow, incomes rise, and the popularity of healthy diets increases. 
Higher production and sales of these high value crops would also deepen domestic agricultural markets, 
generate rural employment and improve nutrition. Diversification and commercialization need a much broader 
base than this however, as current commercial vegetable production currently ranges from 100-600 ha and 
commercial potatoes are less than 500 ha. Government and donor support for increased production and

commercialization of small-scale dairy, pig and poultry enterprises will also be necessary, in addition to 
continued support for mohair and fine wool.   
 

10. A more diversified production base, with greater emphasis on horticulture and livestock production also 
offers a means to increase dietary diversity and reduce child malnutrition. Lesotho’s high rates of child 
malnutrition are attributed to poverty, low dietary diversity and inadequate consumption of fruits and 
vegetables. Limited dietary diversity affects all children - only 23 percent of children have minimum dietary 
diversity and 11 percent have a minimum acceptable diet. Fruit and vegetable availability was estimated at 128 
grams in 2013, compared with the WHO recommended daily intake of 400 grams. Increased horticulture and 
livestock production would contribute to improved nutrition by (a) increasing the availability of fruits and 
vegetables as well as protein-rich foods; and (b) improving incomes and so access to a more diverse diet.   

 
11. Recognizing the significant role of agriculture in Lesotho’s overall economic growth agenda, the Government 

of Lesotho (GoL) is undertaking critical measures to build a commercial and climate resilient agricultural sector.  
The National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP) II (2018/19-2022/23), which prioritizes the development of the 
agricultural sector, identifies three broad areas of strategic action: (i) sustainable commercialization and 
diversification of agriculture, (ii) a well-functioning agri-food system, and (iii) rehabilitation of range lands and 
wet lands. Priorities for action within these areas include: (i) improved technology and infrastructure (including 
irrigation and climate smart agriculture); (ii) increased production of high value crop and livestock products; (iii) 
the development of institutional frameworks for producer and industry organizations; (iv) building the capacity 
of farmers to benefit from these institutions; and (v) the development of value chains and agricultural markets. 
The NSDP II also calls for the need to scale up current nutrition systems towards strengthening human capital 
and expanding the use of water harvesting for irrigation. Gender and climate change are indicated as critical 
cross-cutting issues. Several policies and strategies, including Vision 2020, National Climate Change Policy (2017), 
Lesotho Food and Nutrition Policy (2016) and Lesotho Zero Hunger Strategic Review (LZHSR) accord high priority 
to scaling up climate-smart practices and actions to promote agricultural adaptation and increased food security, 
achieving zero hunger by 2030, access to adequate food and healthy diets all year round, ending malnutrition, 
doubling of smallholder productivity and incomes, and eliminating food loss and waste. The GoL has also initiated 
reform of the water sector to promote sustainable and productive use of Lesotho’s water resources.  
 

12. The Bank has provided substantial support to the development of Lesotho’s agriculture sector over the past 
decade. Through the ongoing Smallholder Agricultural Development Project (SADP) as well as Private Sector 
Competitiveness and Economic Diversification Project (PSCED) the Bank has provided financial and technical 
assistance  to improve commercialization and competitiveness in Lesotho’s agricultural sector. SADP is providing 
training and competitive grants to smallholder farmers for improving marketable surplus in several value chains, 
including horticulture (fruit and vegetable production), poultry, piggery and dairy.  The project is also supporting 
the development of an irrigation master plan to assist the government in its efforts of defining strategic priorities 
for improving the irrigation subsector in terms of alignment with agriculture growth potential, improving 
resource utilization, water delivery service, and institutional and financial sustainability and identify a pipeline of 
high priority irrigation investments for support from donors, government, private sector and other non-state 
actors. The PSCED is assisting in building an  enabling business environment, leveraging private investment 
support, providing access to finance to increase productivity and increasing market opportunities in Lesotho’s 
horticulture subsector.  The Bank has also supported the preparation of the Lesotho Climate Smart Agricultural 
Profile which provides an overview of the agricultural challenges in Lesotho and recommends country-specific 
climate smart agricultural practices that can help the country adapt to and mitigate climate change.

13. The proposed Lesotho Climate Smart Agriculture Project (LCSAP) is being prepared at the request of the 
Government of Lesotho to contribute to its efforts in developing a climate smart agricultural sector.  The 
proposed project, an IDA credit in the amount of US$50 million and a Japanese Policy and Human Resources 
Development (PHRD) grant of US$2.0 million aims to harness the triple wins of CSA in Lesotho’s agri-food sector, 
i.e., improved productivity, increased adaptive capacity to climate risks and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.  
Through the provision of technical assistance and investment support, the proposed project would introduce and 
scale up best practices in CSA and sustainable land management thereby mainstreaming climate and 
environmental considerations into agriculture as well incentivize a shift from uncompetitive maize monocropping 
to high potential value chains, all of which are expected to result in positive outcomes of enhanced climate 
resilience, increased commercialization, food security, job creation, improved rural livelihoods and improved 
nutritional outcomes.  

 
 
C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  

 
Development Objective(s) (From PAD)  
The development objective of the project is to support increased adoption of climate smart agricultural technologies in 
Lesotho's agriculture, enhanced commercialization and improved dietary diversity among targeted beneficiaries. 
 
 

Key Results 

• Land area brought under climate-smart agriculture and sustainable landscape management  

• Household Commercialization levels (value of produce sold as a % of value of produce 

• Farmers adopting improved agricultural practices 

• Households with increased dietary diversity (disaggregated by women and children) 
 
 
D. Project Description  

 
 

25. The project will build on the achievements and lessons learned under SADP as well as the Lesotho Climate 
Smart Investment Plan (CSIP).  Through a robust, multi-stakeholder process, the CSIP has developed a normative 
vision and CSA goals for Lesotho’s agriculture sector and pathways for achieving the vision and goals. It has 
prioritized key policy actions and investments towards building a productive, climate-resilient and low-
emissions agriculture sector in Lesotho.  The CSA goals, developed under the three pillars of CSA, call for, inter 
alia, increasing yields of major crops, reducing losses across agricultural value chains, including post-harvest 
losses, increasing arable land under stress-tolerant crops, conservation agriculture, and agroforestry as well as 
reduced livestock emissions.  Strategies for achieving these goals include measures reflected in project design, 
i.e. climate resilience and nutrition security (such as agricultural diversification, CSA practices at the farm level, 
stress tolerant crops); commercialization (agricultural value chain, market infrastructure development) and 
capacity development (knowledge development, integrate weather and market advisories using ICT).     
 
26. The following four components are envisaged under the project: (i) Promoting Climate-Resilient 
Agriculture; (ii) Improving Agricultural Commercialization and Nutrition; (iii) Project Management, Coordination 
and Monitroing and Evaluation; and (iv) Contingency Emergency Response.

Component 1: Scaling Up Climate-Smart Agricultural Practices and Advisory Services (Total Cost: US$20.0 
million) 

27. This component aims at strengthening the adaptive capacity of smallholder farmers to adjust and modify 
their production systems to minimize the potential future impacts from climate variability. The overall goal is to 
enhance climate resilience through solutions that improve soil health, increase water use efficiency, and 
increase farm productivity and crop diversification. The component focuses on: (i) capacity building for scaling‐
up the adoption of climate‐smart agriculture technologies by farmers and enhancing farm management 
practices aimed at improving soil health, water‐use efficiency, crop diversification, and farm productivity; (ii) 
promoting a more efficient use of surface water accompanied with a more sustainable use of groundwater, 
leading to improved availability and quality of water at the farm level; and (iii) improving access to climate and 
market advisory services through ICT, thereby strengthening farmers’ adaptation and resilience.   
 
Component 2: Improving Agricultural Commecialization and Nutrition (US$30.0 million of which IDA 

US$23.0 million; PHRD Grant US$2.0 million; Beneficiary Contribution US$5.0 million) 

 
28. The objective of this component is to support the development of high potential value chains (VCs) in 
Lesotho’s agricultural sector by strengthening backward and forward linkages within selected VCs with overall 
aim of promoting diversification from uncompetitive maize monocropping to high value cash crops and 
sustainable livestock production animal husbandry, improving productivity, quality, value addition and market 
linkages towards increased agricultural commercialization and improved nutrition.   
 
29. Component interventions will foster the integration of a greater number of smallholder producers that 
dominate Lesotho’s rural landscape in potentially remunerative VCs, promote sustainable intensification of 
production through adoption of  CSA and environmentally friendly agricultural technologies supported under 
Component 1, incentivize contract farming, strengthen horizontal alliances and encourage farmers to establish 
producer groups, strengthen vertical alliances by building trusted commercial partnerships between farmers 
and private agri-businesses and drive enterprise operations towards more lucrative domestic and export 
markets.  Activities under the component are expected to result in the positive outcomes of job creation, 
improved beneficiary incomes, better nutritional outcomes and increased economic opportunities for women 
and youth in the rural sector.   
 
30. The component will finance services to support the formation of new as well as strengthen the existing 
(e.g., those established under SADP-1) farmer groups in Lesotho’s agriculture sector.  Special attention will be 
accorded to the need and interests of women and youth6.  Where feasible, the formation and strengthening of 
horizontal alliances will draw on the Smallholder Horticulture Empowerment Project (SHEP7) approach 
developed by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).  This approach shifts smallholder thinking from 
subsistence farming to farming as a business by training farmers to conduct their own market surveys to identify 
local crops with potential for commercialization; training them to grow these crops profitably; organizing 
stakeholder forums to exchange information with other like-minded farmers, input suppliers and potential 
buyers; and by helping them to build good relations with these market agents.

31. Two matching grant programs are envisaged under the component: grants up to US$30,000 for 
smallholder farmers for increased productivity and grants ranging from US$30,000 to US$100,000 to agri-
enterprises for post-harvest infrastructure and management.  All grants will require an equity contribution: 25 
percent for the smaller grants and 40 percent for the larger grants.  The procedures and selection criteria used 
for both matching grant programs will be detailed in a Grant Manual which will be prepared in a manner 
satisfactory to the Bank. The Grant Manual will specify implementation arrangements of the Matching Grant 
Programs and include appropriate technical, fiduciary, environmental and social safeguards provisions to ensure 
that the grant funds will be used for intended purposes only. It will also include the Bank’s Anti-Corruption 
Guidelines and consequences should the agreed commitments not be met. Any changes to the Grant Manual 
during project implementation will require prior Bank approval. The PMU will be responsible for administering 
the Grant Scheme. 
 
32. Towards improved nutrition, the project will support a broad advocacy campaign to increase the 
knowledge among the people of Lesotho of the benefits of dietary diversity. In addition to media campaigns, 
the project will finance the development of industry guidelines for sugar, salt, and fat content, nutrition 
fortification in food products, and labelling through stakeholder consultations. This work will be coordinated by 
the Food and Nutrition Coordination Office (FNCO) in collaboration with CGIAR and other partners. Activities to 
enhance knowledge on diets and nutrition will include nutrition education and demonstrations on production, 
processing, cooking demonstrations, food safety and storage.  The project will also provide grants to individuals 
for increasing household-level production and consumption of safe and nutritious foods. This activity will target 
women to increase their capacity to feed their families a diversified diet through the consumption of inter alia, 
a variety of fruits and vegetables as well as protein-rich food such as eggs and meat. Grants will be provided for 
cultivation of horticulture products as well as purchase and rearing of small livestock and ruminants.  Grants will 
also be provided for small-scale processing which will generate income opportunities for grant recipients.  Under 
this window, small grants in the size of USD 2,000-20,000 (up to 80 percent of total investment cost) will be 
available for production of nutritious foods and small-scale, nutrition-sensitive processing (e.g. purchase of 
small equipment such as dryers, canning). Women and youth will be given priority under this program.  
 
COMPONENT 3: Project Management, Coordination, Monitoring and Evaluation (US$7.0 million) 
 
33. This component will support project management, coordination, monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of 
project activities.  The existing Project Management Unit (PMU) within the Ministry of Agriculture and Food 
Security will be responsible for project implementation including fiduciary aspects (including audits); knowledge 
management/communication (including public awareness campaigns); grievance redress mechanism; citizen 
engagement; and monitoring the implementation of safeguard related measures. It will finance PMU staff 
related costs (training etc.), goods, equipment and vehicles, incremental operating costs, 
assessments/analyses/studies for preparation of future projects/operations, and other eligible expenses 
associated with overall project implementation. Support will also be provided for social/results/impact surveys 
at project mid-term as well as project completion. Additional periodic surveys will be supported to improve 
project implementation, for example to assess and improve women and youth participation. The monitoring 
and evaluation (M&E) system will be strengthened to improve the efficiency of data collection, analysis, 
evaluation and reporting.  The capacity of the PMU will be enhanced by hiring additional technical and 
administrative staff as needed,

34. A Contingency Emergency Response Component (CERC) with zero allocation to partially cover emergency 
response via implementation of key activities by the appropriate agencies to respond to the emergency. The 
CERC could also be used to channel additional funds should they become available as a result of an eligible 
emergency. 
 

 
E. Implementation 

 
Institutional and Implementation Arrangements 

 
35. Project oversight. The project will be implemented under the direct oversight of Principal Secretary 
MAFS. A Project Management Committee (PMC) that was established under SADP will be maintained given the 
multi-sectoral nature of project interventions. The PMC will include representatives from several ministries 
such as Ministry of Finance (MoF), Ministry of Development Planning (MoDP), Ministry of Agriculture and Food 
Security (MAFS), Ministry of Forestry and Land Reclamation (MFLR), Ministry of Trade & Industry, Cooperatives 
and Marketing (MTICM), Ministry of Environment and Tourism (MoET), Ministry of Local Government and 
Chieftainship (MLGC). The PMC, which is an extension of the Technical Working Group formed during project 
preparation of the ongoing SADP will review all project reports and Annual Work Plans and Budgets (AWPB). 
The PMC will meet quarterly with the Project Manager acting as the Secretary to the PMC. 

 
36. Project Implementation. The existing Project Management Unit (PMU) within the Ministry of 
Agriculture and Food Security (MAFS)will be responsible for project implementation including fiduciary aspects 
(including audits); knowledge management/communication (including public awareness campaigns); 
grievance redress mechanism; citizen engagement; and monitoring the implementation of safeguard related 
measures. It will finance PMU staff related costs (training etc.), goods, equipment and vehicles, incremental 
operating costs, assessments / analyses / studies for preparation of future projects/operations, and other 
eligible expenses associated with overall project implementation. Support will also be provided for 
social/results/impact surveys at project mid-term as well as project completion. Additional periodic surveys 
will be supported to improve project implementation, for example to assess and improve women and youth 
participation. The monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system will be strengthened to improve the efficiency of 
data collection, analysis, evaluation and reporting.

F. Project location and Salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 
 

The Project will be undertaken in all the ten districts of Lesotho–Teyateyaneg, Butha-Buthe, Leribe, 
Mafeteng, Maseru, Mohale’s Hoek, Mokhotlong, Qacha’s Nek, Quthing and Thaba-Tseka. Lesotho is 
predominantly mountainous, with the highlands and mountain zones covering approximately 59 percent of 
the total land area. This land is mostly characterized by steep slopes with fragile soil formations which are 
extensively degraded. The highlands cover approximately 15 percent of the country, while the lowlands and 
Senqu (Orange) River Valley make up approximately 17 percent and 9 percent of the country, respectively. 
The cultivable land is largely confined to the lowlands and highlands along the Western border and the

Senqu River valley in the south, the latter being densely populated and resulting in much pressure on 
natural resources. Land degradation in various forms is a dominant landscape feature in the country, and 
inherent infertile soils affect the productivity of both arable and rangelands. Lesotho is highly susceptible to 
climate-related events such as frost, drought, strong winds, snow, hailstorms and floods, all of which have a 
devastating effect on agricultural productivity, including crop failure and increased incidences of invasive 
plants and infestation by pests. Specific geographical locations for the proposed sub-projects have not been 
identified yet but will be selected on a demand-driven basis during the implementation of the Project. Site-
specific environmental and social assessments will be carried out during implementation and biophysical 
characteristics comprehensively described. The designs of the sub-projects will also incorporate climate 
resilience engineering measures and take into consideration the various environmental conditions which 
could exacerbate impacts on the natural resource base.

SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY 

 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

The environmental risks of the Project are moderate 
given the potential adverse but manageable impacts 
likely to be generated from the construction and 
operation of small-scale irrigation and drainage 
schemes. The project will finance minor 
rehabilitation works, the purchase and installation of 
on-farm pipeline systems and irrigation auxiliaries, 
irrigation canal and head work repair, provision of 
pressure pipes and network repairs. The project will 
also finance the rehabilitation of existing pump 
stations and construction of water harvesting and 
distribution reservoirs and where feasible also 
establishment and repair of existing vertical wells 
(boreholes). The total command area (hectares) for 
rehabilitation of the on-farm irrigation infrastructure 
is not known, but will be determined from the 
recommendations of the Irrigation Master Plan

currently being developed with full participation of 
key stakeholders, including smallholder farmers who 
will directly benefit from the Project. Key 
environmental impacts associated with the 
construction and operation of irrigation schemes 
include (a) changes to the low flow regime of rivers 
which may have significant negative impacts on 
downstream users, (b) changing hydrological regime 
associated with irrigation schemes may alter the 
capacity of the environment to assimilate water 
soluble pollutants, (c) excessive use of both natural 
and chemical fertilizers may result in excess of 
nutrients which might have impacts on water bodies 
and human health, (d) areas with water tables that 
have a low hydraulic gradient are at risk from 
salinization, (e) reduction in low flows and flood 
flows may alter the river morphology, reducing the 
capacity to transport sediment and thereby causing 
a buildup of sediments in slower moving river 
reaches, (f) irrigation schemes may fail if the 
sediment load of water supply is higher than the 
capacity of the irrigation canals to transport 
sediment loads, (g) irrigation schemes may have 
ecological impacts, particularly in wetland areas 
affecting natural habitats. 
 
The Resettlement Policy Framework has been 
prepared to  guide the PMU in avoidance, 
minimization and mitigation of any potential 
resettlement impacts associated to rehabilitation of 
irrigation infrastructure and activities related to 
commercialization of agricultural that will require 
land acquisition or restricted access to land and land 
use.The Resettlement Policy Framework has been 
prepared to guide the preparation of Resettlement 
Action Plans 

Performance Standards for Private Sector 
Activities OP/BP 4.03 

No  

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 Yes 

The policy is triggered. Reduction in natural river 
flow and discharge of polluted return flows from 
irrigation schemes, have potential impacts to 
habitats both within and alongside rivers. Significant 
changes to low flows (+/-20%) will alter micro-
habitats particularly wetlands.

Mar 13, 2019 Page 13 of 20  

 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No 
The Project will not support sub-projects located 
within forested areas or plantations as defined 
under OP 4.36. Therefore, the policy is not triggered. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

The Pest Management Policy is triggered as agro-
chemicals will be used for irrigation subprojects. 
Based on observations from the ongoing Smallholder 
Agriculture Development Project, the risk of 
pesticide use is considered low to moderate due to 
the small quantities of pesticides currently being 
used in the sub-projects. An Integrated Pest 
Management Plan (IPMP) will be prepared to 
provide guidance on the sustainable application of 
fertilizers and pesticides taking into consideration 
the soil type and slope to ensure protection of both 
surface and ground water. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 Yes 

The policy is triggered given the likelihood of chance 
finds in conjunction with earth works and/or an 
encounter of graveyard sites from the experience 
implementing infrastructure projects in Lesotho.The 
ESMF will include Physical Cultural Resources 
Management Plan (PCRMP) that includes measures 
for avoiding and mitigating any adverse impacts on 
physical cultural resources as well as providing 
Chance Find Procedures (CFP).  The CFP will entail 
measures to screen for and manage potential 
impacts on cultural heritage or property that could 
be affected by project activities. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 No 
The policy will not be triggered as there are no 
indigenous peoples in Lesotho. 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

OP 4.12 will be triggered. The project will likely 
expand the irrigation service area; however, this will 
only be confirmed once the Irrigation Master Plan 
has been prepared and investments to be supported 
under SADP-2 are identified for support during 
project implementation. At this stage while it is 
unknown whether there will be any land acquisitions 
as a direct result of the project, there might be 
restricted access to resources (whether related to 
private or communal resources) related to 
rehabilitation of irrigation infrastructure and 
therefore Involuntary Resettlement OP 4.12 is 
triggered to address any adverse impacts.  Since the 
exact location of these structures is not known, a 
Resettlement Policy Framework will be prepared, 
consulted and disclosed prior to appraisal. The

Resettlement Policy Framework will guide the 
preparation of Resettlement Action Plans. The 
Resettlement Policy Framework will guide the PMU 
in avoidance, minimization and mitigation of any 
potential resettlement impact. 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 Yes 

This policy has been triggered as a precautionary 
measure. At this stage, Tthere is insufficient 
information to determine whether irrigation 
schemes and drainage canals would rely on water 
from existing dams or new small dams would need 
to be supported under the project. An exclusion 
clause will be included in the ESMF indicating that 
the project would not support activities that are high 
risk and trigger a full environmental assessment. 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

Yes 

Exception notification to be sent to riparian states 
will be requested since the proposed small-scale 
irrigation schemes will not adversely change the 
quantity and quality of water flows to other riparian 
states.  In addition, the proposed schemes will not 
be adversely affected by the use of water 
downstream by the other riparian states. 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No 

The project will not finance activities located in any 
known areas under territorial dispute as defined in 
OP 7.60. Therefore, the 
policy is not triggered. 

 
 

KEY SAFEGUARD POLICY ISSUES AND THEIR MANAGEMENT 

 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential 
large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
Potential environmental impacts are anticipated under Component 1: Support for Irrigation and Component 2: 
Agricultural Commercialization. The provision of grants may result in agricultural intensification and increased 
application of fertilizers and pesticides by grant recipients.  The grants will be awarded based on screening criteria set 
forth in the ESMF/ IPMP currently under preparation. The screening criteria as set forth in the ESMF will help to  
screen out project activities corresponding to a category A, and to provide adequate due diligence on a case-by-case 
basis for the grants. The approach outlined in the ESMF/IPMP will apply to the matching grants, irrigation 
rehabilitation and any activity that would be proposed to be financed within the project or the subsequent AFs.  
The environmental impacts associated with the grants program and irrigation rehab should be readily mitigated 
through sound construction practices (dust and noise, waste management, material sourcing) while the operational 
impacts can be mitigated through environmentally friendly farming approaches (manure management, waste 
disposal, emissions from food processing facilities, improved water resource use). 
Under Component 1rehabilitation of the irrigation schemes is foreseen to lead to better management of water

resources. This activity will potentially entail minor construction related impacts that can be mitigated through a site-
specific ESMP.  The overall project would lead to an increase in agricultural practices therefore having implications on 
pest management, which should apply and follow the Integrated Pest Management Plan as prepared under the ESMF.   
 
The potential social issues are likely to be on restriction to land use and access and possible land acquisition for the 
rehabilitation of irrigation infrastructure and agricultural commercialization activities. The project will likely expand 
the irrigation service area; however, this will only be confirmed once the Irrigation Master Plan has been prepared and 
investments to be supported under SADP-2 are identified for support during project implementation. At this stage 
while it is unknown whether there will be any land acquisitions as a direct result of the project, there might be 
restricted access to resources (whether related to private or communal resources) related to rehabilitation of 
irrigation infrastructure and activities under commercialization of agriculture, as a result Involuntary Resettlement OP 
4.12 is triggered to address any adverse impacts.  Since the exact scope of works for rehabilitation of irrigation 
infrastructure and commercialization of agriculture activities is not known, a Resettlement Policy Framework has been 
prepared for the project. The Resettlement Policy Framework will guide the preparation of place specific Resettlement 
Action Plans. The Resettlement Policy Framework will guide the PMU in avoidance, minimization and mitigation of any 
potential resettlement impact. 
 
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area: 
There are no long term or indirect impacts associated with the project, beyond the potential increase in agricultural 
production and therefore implications on pest management, where the  Integrated Pest Management Plan as 
prepared under the ESMF should apply. 
 
There are no long term adverse social impacts anticipated for the project, however, the project is expected to have 
significant positive effects on households, by improving dietary diversity in households, increasing climate resilience of 
farmers and promote adoption of climate smart agricultural technologies for enhanced agricultural commercialization. 
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts. 
NA 
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower 
capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The Government of Lesotho has prepared an ESMF/IPMP and RFP.    
The project will be implemented by the Project Management Unit (PMU) under the MAFS that is currently 
implementing SADP.   The PMU has demonstrated limited capacity in assessing environmental and social (E&S) risks 
and impacts, developing appropriate mitigation measures and implementing and monitoring E&S aspects of the 
project. Currently, it does not have full-time and qualified E&S safeguards specialists to oversee the monitoring and 
implementation of safeguards. Before LCSAP appraisal, the PMU has prepared a comprehensive Environmental and 
Social Management Framework (ESMF) and Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) and carried out stakeholder 
consultations in line with both the Lesotho Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) law and regulations and the World 
Bank Safeguard Policies. The ESMF and RPF will provide clear procedures and methodologies for carrying out site-
specific E&S assessments, review, approval and implementations of physical investments (sub-projects) to be financed 
by LCSAP.  During implementation, the PMU will be responsible for carrying out site-specific E&S impacts assessment 
for each sub-project including the associated Environmental and Social Management Plans (ESMPs) and Resettlement 
Action Plans (RAPs) according to procedures outlined in the ESMF and RPF. The site-specific ESMPs and RAPs will be 
included in the bidding documents for any civil works to be implemented. The PMU will ensure that all the mitigation

measures recommended in the site-specific ESIAs and RAPs are implemented, monitored and reported in progress 
reports submitted to the Bank.  The Bank will also work with the PMU in recruiting full-time dedicated and qualified 
E&S specialists whose responsibilities will be to screen sub-projects, determine the level and degree of E&S risks and 
impacts, prepare site-specific ESMPs and RAPs, and ensure that mitigation and management measures are 
implemented, monitored and reported in progress reports. The E&S specialists would also train/re-train PMU staff and 
district agriculture officers in the implementation of appropriate mitigation measures for types of impacts expected. 
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, 
with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
The key stakeholders include representatives of the Project Management Unit and the Ministry of Agriculture and 
Food Security (MAFS), farmers associations, entrepreneurs, local authorities, irrigation schemes, as well as the 
members of the local communities where the project will be implemented. The ESMF/IPMP, RPF have been subjected 
to public consultations and disclosure before appraisal while each of the subsequent ESMPs and RAPs prepared for 
each specific subproject will also be subjected to disclosure and public consultations. The ESMF/IPMP and RFP will be 
disclosed through the MAFS website and Bank's external website.

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 

 
1. Following years of recession and slow growth, the Serbian economy expanded by 1.8 percent, on average, over 
the previous three years (2015–2017), while a stronger growth of 3.5 percent was estimated for 2018. Over the previous 
three years, growth started to recover on the back of higher investment (average annual growth of 8.3 percent) and strong 
growth of exports (up 10.7 percent annually in real terms). Consumption recovered as well, but at a slower pace (at 1 
percent annually in real terms). Growth of the industry and services sectors contributed most to the overall growth of the 
economy over the previous three years, while agriculture had a negative contribution to growth in 2015 and 2017. For 
2018, growth was broad-based with all three major sectors growing faster than last year. As a result, the growth in 2018 
reached 4.2 percent. The medium-term growth projections depend crucially on deeper and timelier structural reforms 
and progress with European Union (EU) accession. 
 
2. The Government of Serbia (GOS) has implemented a successful fiscal adjustment but economic vulnerabilities 
remain. In 2014, the GOS adopted an ambitious fiscal consolidation and structural reform program supported by the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. In the short term, the program focused on the control of 
aggregate wage and pension expenditures, improvements in tax administration, and reductions in subsidies to state 
owned enterprises. The implementation of these measures led to the reduction of budget deficits in 2015–2016 and 
budget surplus of 1.2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2017 and 0.5 percent of GDP in 2018, underpinned by 
strong revenue collection and lower than planned public spending ensuing, among others, from the interest payment 
savings and under-execution of public investment. As a result of prudent fiscal policies, public debt continues to decline 
and stood at 54.3 percent of GDP (at the end of December 2018), and is expected to continue declining during 2019, albeit 
at a slower pace. However, the country remains vulnerable to spillovers from regional developments and market volatility, 
thus ensuring fiscal sustainability and supporting private sector development, growth, and formal employment are 
important for Serbia’s economic performance in the long term. 
 
3. Over this same period, the prospects for accession to the EU provided an impetus for a broad spectrum of 
reforms. In November 2007, Serbia initiated a Stabilization and Association Agreement with the EU. In 2012, it was granted 
an EU candidate status. Since the formal start of the accession negotiations in 2014, progress has evolved largely following 
its predicted trajectory. As of December 2018, Serbia opened 16 out of 35 chapters of the EU’s Acquis Communautaire, of 
which two are provisionally closed. 
 
4. Regional disparities of living standards are evident. There is a high degree of variability of living standards within 
the country, with 25 percent of the population of Serbia (close to 1.8 million people) being at risk of poverty. Municipalities 
in the Southern and Eastern part of Serbia have high poverty incidence as compared to the rest of the country, with risk 
of poverty rates ranging between 13 and 63 percent within these regions. Better understanding of these geographic 
disparities can help the Government of Serbia design and target policies and programs to support growth, jobs, poverty 
reduction and social inclusion.

Sectoral and Institutional Context1 
 
5. Agriculture plays an important role in the economy of Serbia. Agriculture is the third largest sector, accounting 
for around 6 percent of GDP and 19 percent of formal employment, and the most important export sector, representing 
23 percent of total exports. The impressive growth of exports of both primary and processed food products provides 
evidence of the competitiveness of Serbian production in international markets and of significant potential to further 
leverage the sector’s growth to create jobs and income. From 2005 to 2016, the country’s exports of primary food and 
beverage products increased 148 percent and of processed food products increased 83 percent. In 2016, Serbia 
accumulated an agricultural trade surplus of US$650 million in primary products and of US$525 million in processed food 
and beverage products. 
 
6. Agriculture is undergoing a process of structural transformation towards a modern agri-food system. Primary 
agriculture, an important source of income and employment in the past, has diminished its contribution to the rapidly 
diversifying economy of Serbia. The declining share of primary agriculture in GDP and employment signals a process of 
transformation that provides ample opportunities for developing a modern, dynamic and more competitive agri-food 
system, able to generate better jobs up and downstream and improve income and livelihoods in the rural space. 
Improvements in labor and land productivity have contributed towards the expansion of agricultural output in Serbia. This 
is important as it leads to an increase in the supply of raw materials at lower costs to agri-processors, which in turn 
supports a much larger scale of operation, promotes horizontal integration, and reduces overall costs, all factors that 
increase the competitiveness of the whole agri-food system, as the country prepares for EU accession. Improving 
productivity is more than just raising yields and decreasing costs; it is also about raising food quality, moving into higher 
value products by using improved technology and practices2. 
 
7. Sector growth is geographically differentiated and narrow based in terms of composition of production. Growth 
patterns in agriculture are influenced by regional disparities in sector performance and composition, with a positive sector 
growth in the Northwestern parts of the country and contraction of production in Southeastern Serbia. The autonomous 
province of Vojvodina, in the North, is the key driver of agricultural output in Serbia, with 43 percent contribution to 
national agricultural GDP (in 2014) with large scale production of commodities. Between 2003 and 2013, crop output in 
Serbia expanded, mainly due to increased production in Vojvodina, as the other three regions recorded only a marginal 
expansion or even a decline (South and East Serbia). Livestock output declined over the same period, with all regions, 
except Vojvodina, recording contraction rates between 24 percent (Sumadija and West Serbia) and 33 percent (South and 
East Serbia). In the same period, livestock output in Vojvodina increased by around 13 percent.  
 
8. Despite regional comparative advantages, structural factors underpin the regional disparities. There are 
important structural limitations to agriculture in Serbia - very small and fragmented land holdings, ageing and declining 
farm labor force, low efficiency and productivity, low use of technology, high labor intensity, low financial liquidity and 
capital availability for investment (especially for smallholders) and outdated production management practices. Despite 
all of these, economic opportunities exist in rural areas. Cereals, vegetable oils and edible fruit have historically driven 
growth of agricultural production and exports, with Vojvodina’s larger producers benefiting the most. Only one percent 
of the farms in Serbia have 50 hectares or more of land and most of them are in Vojvodina3, while farmers who own less

than 5 hectares of land account for 78 percent of all holdings and 25 percent of the total cultivated area in Serbia and are 
concentrated in the South and East Serbia.  
 
9. Broadening the scope for sector growth to include small and medium scale producers may be key to sector 
transformation. Although fragmented farm structures are often perceived as a challenge to scale economies and 
competitiveness, with high transaction costs preventing the many small producers from engaging in markets, in the case 
of Serbia, recent public expenditure analysis shows that smallholders4 are the most technically efficient producers in the 
country and hence, supporting their development can improve sector growth. Hence, consolidation at the product level, 
through aggregation and economic clusters, may hold the key to development, enabling the specialization of small 
efficient units and their integration into broader value chains. Middle size farms, which are often seen as the drivers of 
growth in the sector, are found to be the worst performers in terms of technical efficiency in Serbia, posing a question on 
the adequacy of the enabling environment for their agricultural development. These producer segments also specialize in 
agricultural products that are not scale intensive yet can hold important value proposition and drive the generation of 
jobs and growth in rural areas. Improving the enabling environment to support the productive inclusion of small and 
medium scale producers can drive the process of structural transformation of agri-food systems in Serbia.  
 
10. Rethinking and redirecting policy instruments and incentives can increase the speed of sector transformation. 
Agricultural budget support has been aligned with the EU budget support framework, and a Directorate for Agrarian 
Payments has been established to administer national direct payments (subsidies) and rural development investments 
(both national and EU Instrument for Pre-Accession and Assistance for Rural Development (IPARD) grants). Subsidies and 
transfers dominate agricultural spending (2011-2017) and, on average, account for 82 percent of sector expenditure. They 
are found to negatively affect sector productivity and efficiency and are thought to contribute towards freezing the current 
dual farm structure. Emphasis on area and headage payments5 reduce the incentives to increase productivity, preserve 
farm structures dominated by smaller farms and do not contribute to the acceleration of the structural transformation 
process6. Further, coupled output subsidies distort the allocation of productive resources. When the above are combined 
with the low (at least until 2017) level of funds dedicated to rural development, including the provision of public goods 
(agricultural infrastructure, R&D, advisory services, etc.), it creates a policy framework which constrains farm restructuring 
and the potential of smaller and medium-sized farms, that currently dominate Serbian agriculture, to increase their size, 
modernize production systems, benefit from expanding markets and contribute to a competitive agri-food sector and to 
a vibrant rural economy. 
 
11. Despite ample EU resources, productive investments, through rural development grants, are underutilized. 
IPARD funds in the amount of EUR230 million (including national co-financing) have been allocated to Serbia for the 
programming period of 2014-2020 in annual instalments. Serbia has received accreditation for 2 of the 11 IPARD 
measures7. Although the scope of these measures is broad, actual number of beneficiaries is limited, with most small and 
medium scale producers not being able to take advantage of this productive support due to the complex application 
process and the requirement for upfront financing. A key constraint in the uptake of IPARD grant support is the complexity 
of the application process, due to the numerous requirements which applicants often can’t fulfill, added to limited capacity 
in the Directorate for Agrarian Payments for review and approval. In addition, a limiting factor is the requirement of an 
upfront payment of the full grant amount by the applicant, which assumes availability of financial resources, with 

                                            
4 In the context of Serbia, small producers are those with an economic size of up to 8,000 euros; medium producers are those with an economic size 
between 8,000 and 25,000 euros. 
5 Criticized for not relying on objective and valid baseline indicators, as well as the poor definition of eligibility criteria (Bogdanov et al., 2017) 
6 It is noted that leased agricultural land is excluded from farm support (Bogdanov, 2016). 
7 Accredited measures in 2018 are Investments in Physical Assets of Agricultural Holdings and Investments in Physical Assets for Processing and 
Marketing of Agriculture and Fisheries Products; 2 more are planned for accreditation in 2019 - Farm diversification and business development and 
Technical assistance; and 2 additional ones for 2020 – LIDER program for local development and organic production.

reimbursement of 50 percent after all investment criteria have been fulfilled, ex post. This requirement alone makes IPARD 
grants difficult to access for the majority of small and medium scale producers in Serbia. 
 
12. National program resources can shift the sector equilibrium from low productivity to high value for small and 
medium scale producers in Serbia and encourage convergence of the National and EU programs over time. For rural 
development grants, boundaries are established between eligible beneficiaries of the national rural development program 
and those eligible to apply for IPARD support, based on either size or production potential. All producers not eligible for 
IPARD support, are eligible for national program support. Reaching out with national investment funds to the small and 
medium producers of Serbia, especially in the South and Southeast of Serbia, can improve these producers’ productive 
inclusion and competitiveness, and enable them to actively participate in the process of structural transformation of 
agriculture in Serbia and preparing them for EU accession.  
 
13. Improving financial inclusion for productive investments can stimulate broader private sector participation. 
While around two thirds of adults in rural areas in Serbia have accounts with financial institutions, only 14% of them have 
loans to operate, start or expand farm and small business activities. Most medium and larger farmers and medium/larger 
SMEs have access to finance as banks have the right expertise, systems and products to serve these agricultural segments 
profitably. However, smaller farmers have very limited access to bank financing and mostly rely on off takers and input 
suppliers to finance their inputs. This type of value chain financing does not cover longer term funding for equipment, 
machinery and is currently decreasing as these players try to re-focus on their core business. The long-term goal is the 
development of efficient, competitive markets, producing to EU standards which requires better inclusion of small-scale 
producers (among them women and youth) in modern supply chains, an increase in investments in machinery, equipment 
and knowledge as well as the modernization of processing and marketing. For this to be achieved, however, public funds 
are not sufficient resources and bank financing can play a catalyst role in the further development and competitiveness 
of the sector. 
 
14. A combination of targeted public incentives and private financing can improve sector productivity and 
competitiveness. A policy mix that focuses on the improvement of competitiveness and value addition capacity of the 
agri-food system in Serbia can have important sectoral and economy-wide growth effects by inducing positive spillovers 
to other economic sectors and contributing to employment, poverty reduction and economic prosperity of rural areas. 
The public expenditure analysis has shown that direct payments do not promote technical efficiency and productivity 
growth and slow down the structural transformation in Serbian agriculture. Reducing the direct payments envelope and 
significantly increasing the rural development one (including advisory and farm extension services and R&D) is therefore 
paramount for improving the performance of the sector. To enable that, a different set of financial mechanisms may be 
required, to enable small and medium scale producers to access finance and participate in productive decisions, such as 
matching grants8 and public guarantee funds that reduce the risk to producers and other financial institutions, hence 
stimulating financial and productive inclusion. At present, small farmers do not have financial records, do not have 
business plans, they find bank requirements challenging and, most importantly, they lack collateral. Matching grants and 
technical assistance (TA) can create the conditions for banks to finance investments of farmers that are not their typical 
clients. Matching grants can create the required equity for the banks and TA can ensure bankability of the business plan 

                                            
8 Matching grants are an instrument aimed at promoting private sector development which has been used extensively over the past years, in 
particular for agriculture development. A matching grant is defined as a one-off, non-reimbursable transfer to project beneficiaries, for a specific 
purpose, based on the condition that the recipient makes a contribution for the same purpose. These grants can be used for a variety of activities 
including technical assistance, investment in assets or financing of working capital. Total grant financing dedicated to agriculture reaches 650 million 
USD or almost twice the volume of those outside of agriculture. In addition, the proportion of matching grants projects supporting agriculture has 
significantly increased in the 2000s. Recent interest for this instrument to support agriculture might be due to growing concerns about other forms 
of support which distort financial markets such as interest rate subsidies, as well to the compatibility of such agricultural subsidies with World Trade 
Organization requirements.

and prepare the client to approach the bank. Finally, if commercial banks require additional safeguards for their 
investments, they will be able to access credit guarantees to be soon provided by the Development Credit Authority 
(USAID Guarantee Program) and European Investment Fund (EIF) including risk sharing through a new IFC project. 
 
15. Greater resilience to climate and market risks can further boost the overall sector performance. The reliance on 
agricultural commodities increases Serbia’s exposure to price volatility, which added to the increasing number of extreme 
climatic events in Serbia (droughts and floods) further exacerbates agricultural growth volatility. Projected increases in 
temperatures and declines in precipitation will affect rainfed crops, which dominate Serbian agriculture. Production is 
concentrated in the north (Vojvodina), where crops are vulnerable to decreasing precipitation and increasing 
temperatures, primarily during the summer growing season. Rainfed maize may decline by as much as 58 percent due to 
reduced rainfall and higher temperatures in summer. Increases in temperature have already brought about increases in 
fungal diseases and pests that reduce crop production. Cereals and fruits are the most important agricultural products in 
terms of production area and economic output; fruit production is particularly vulnerable to spring frost, hail, extremely 
low winter temperatures, low precipitation and/or heavy rainfall events9. Hence, diversifying the sector base has 
important climate mitigation (reducing risks) and climate adaption (improving resilience) implications for the country.  
 
16. As Serbia advances in the process of sector transformation and alignment to EU acquis, the effectiveness of 
public service delivery becomes critical to improving sector performance. Serbia has committed to align its national 
agricultural policy to the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the EU by the date of accession. To this end, the country is 
required to have all the necessary systems in place to manage and receive funds from the EU and to make payments to 
beneficiaries in Serbia in accordance with EU rules and procedures. An Integrated Administration and Control System 
(IACS), along with other tools, are necessary for the efficient utilization and monitoring of support funds. Systems for 
monitoring results (and not only expenditures) will also be required by the reformed CAP, starting in 2020. EU membership 
unlocks significant financial assistance to farmers under the EU’s CAP, yet it also imposes stricter food safety and other 
trade-related requirements to agricultural production. Enhancements in digital approaches can improve targeting, 
efficiency of spending, food safety monitoring, as well as support the governance structure of the sector.  The innovation 
environment in Serbia would need to be strengthened and uptake of emerging digital technologies by farmers improved 
to help lower transaction costs and facilitate information access about best farming practices, inputs, prices, access to 
credit and markets. This will improve transparency, reduce innovation hurdles and support an enabling environment for 
productive and financial inclusion of agricultural producers in Serbia. 
 

Relationship to CPF 
 
17. The proposed project is consistent with the Serbia Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for the period of FY16-
20. While the SCD identified agriculture as a priority sector for the twin goals, the CPF did not originally envisage an 
operation because of counterpart readiness. However, engagement with a new team at the MAFWM demonstrates a new 
strategic drive and opportunity to make an impact. Therefore, as part of the program update permitted under the PLR, 
the Bank decided to re-engage in this sector. Through productive investments targeting small and medium scale producers 
and strengthening the information systems of the agricultural sector, the project aims at increasing sector 
competitiveness, while providing economic opportunities in rural areas, as the country moves closer to EU membership. 
The Performance and Learning Review (PLR) of the CPF identifies agriculture as one of the high priorities for the 
Government with an important dimension of shared prosperity. The project is also aligned with the strategic goals of the 
National Agricultural and Rural Development (NARD) strategy for 2014-2024: i) growth of production and income stability; 
ii) growth of competitiveness with adjustments to domestic and foreign markets requirements and technical-technological

C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  

 
18. To improve access to markets and information systems for agricultural producers in Serbia.  
 
This will be achieved through a) improving productivity of small and medium scale farmers by strengthening advisory 
and technical support; b) supporting market access of small and medium scale farmers (including finance and business 
planning capacity); c) improving government systems to strengthen the enabling environment for all agricultural 
producers (including capacity building for the Ministry, information systems, data platform). 
 
Key Results (From PCN) 
 

19. The project will achieve the following results: 
 

(i) Productivity10: Increase in gross value added per utilized agricultural area 
 

(ii) Competitiveness11: Increase in the share of production sold by project beneficiaries 
 

(iii) Financial inclusion12: Number of beneficiaries accessing commercial bank loans for their productive 
investments (disaggregated by gender)  
 

(iv) Use of information systems13: Number of unique users of the integrated information platform (disaggregated 
by gender) 

 
D. Concept Description 

 
A. Concept 
 
20. Scope: The project will support the Government of Serbia with the implementation of the National Agriculture 
and Rural Development Program. This will complement Serbia’s on-going efforts to align its national programs to the EU 
CAP programs. In particular, the project will provide financial and technical support to all productive investments in 
agriculture in Serbia through the national rural development program14 and will not participate in the financing of direct 
payments (subsidies). This delimits the scope of project interventions outside of all IPARD measures that the country has 
been accredited for or plans to be accredited for and puts it in the center of national rural development program.  
 

                                            
10 Improved on-farm productivity (use of better management practices, climate smart agriculture, etc.) 
11 Improved linkages between producers and buyers/markets (volume, quality and uniformity of production, value and volume of sales, market 
segmentation strategies, etc.; building entrepreneurial capacity of the production units) 
12 Improved access to finance to drive the process of value-addition on and off-farm (enable investments in equipment, small infrastructure, technical 
assistance, and other services that improve the competitiveness of the production units) 
13 Improved information systems for decision making at the level of the Ministry of Agriculture Forestry and Water Management (MAFWM) and 
information flow with agricultural producers 
14 In 2018, the program received 8,000 applications from small and medium scale producers.

21. Beneficiaries: Small and medium scale agricultural production units (including producers, producer groups, 
agribusinesses/agro-processors that can provide direct link to smallholder farmers) that have or can have commercial 
focus and are not covered by accredited IPARD measures. Although large producers will not be directly targeted, the 
project will also benefit them with the enabling environment it will create through the improvements in information 
systems and the financial services provided. Small and medium size producers are defined by the economic size of holding 
expressed in euros of standard output. For the purposes of this project and the context of Serbia, small producers are 
those with an economic size of up to 8,000 euros; medium producers are those with an economic size between 8,000 and 
25,000 euros. 
 

 
Description 
 
22. The project activities are structured into three Components. Component 1 will focus on improving the productive 
and entrepreneurial capacity of small and medium farmers by supporting business and financial planning for productive 
investments, as well as supporting market access and strengthening sector competitiveness. Component 2 will focus on 
improving the capacity of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management (MAFWM) to provide core public 
goods for improving sector performance. This includes establishing and information system aligned with EU CAP 
requirements to enable evidence-based policy making and monitoring of results, enhance market information for 
stakeholders and build capacity for regulatory roles aligned with EU CAP. Component 3 will focus on project management. 
 
23. By addressing sector needs at the level of producers (Component 1) and the MAFWM (Component 2), the project 
will support a broader policy reform process in the agriculture sector through: i) improved targeting of policy instruments 
to different typologies of producers, ii) strengthened enabling environment for investment for small and medium 
agricultural producers, by improving the delivery of services to these productive segments (advisory, financial, 
information, etc.), iii) improving the monitoring of public resources and their utilization, as well as sector performance. It 
is expected that this will bring about a significant shift in the utilization of public resources in agriculture from subsidies 
(direct payments) to rural development investments.  
 
 
Component 1: Improving the value-added of agriculture (US$35 million) 
 
24. The objective of this component is to improve the economic performance of small and medium agricultural 
producers in Serbia on- and off-farm. The component will support the building of entrepreneurial capacity of agricultural 
producers through the integration of production decisions with market requirements and technical and financial services. 
Activities will focus on improving land and labor productivity, broaden access to productive assets, technology, 
information, and credit, diversification of agricultural products, and access to markets, including traceability and 
differentiation strategies. Unlocking agricultural finance for productive investments, strengthening productive and 
entrepreneurial capacity of producers, developing short value chains and market linkages will stimulate economic 
activities in rural areas and can lead to the creation of jobs. It will also create capacity for better absorption of IPARD funds 
for improving the rural development of Serbia, while also strengthening alignment to EU CAP. 
 
25. The component is structured into two sub-components: (i) Improving entrepreneurial capacity – focusing on 
capacity building activities required to formulate business plans, investment decisions and financial support, from public 
and private sources; (ii) Improving productivity and competitiveness – comprising investments in equipment and technical 
assistance to support their implementation. The detailed description of the sub-components is provided below.

Sub-component 1.1: Improving productive and entrepreneurial capacity (US$5 million) 
 
26. This sub-component will focus on technical assistance to producers, producer groups and agri-businesses for the 
formulation of business plans that normally bundle three key elements: i) investment in equipment, ii) working capital, 
and iii) technical assitance for productivity improvement and entrepreneurial capacity. The sub-component will finance 
the preparation and implementation of business plans for proposed investments, including: (i) business skills and 
organizational training for small-scale producers; (ii) preparation of subprojects, including information on financial cash 
flow as per bank requirements, including the formulation of matching grants15 for capital investments in equipment, 
machinery, processing units16, packaging, storage, etc., (iii) specific technical studies and consultancies that would 
contribute to the implementation and the execution of approved business plans; (iv) a communication strategy designed 
to raise awareness of and stimulate participation of the SME agribusinesses in the project; (v) support banks with 
developing methodologies suitable for assessing credit for the types of investments and beneficiaries of the project.  
 
27. The scope of the business plan will depend on the capacity of producers and the complexity of the sought 
investment. Activities will take place on- and off-farm. To enable greater participation of potential beneficiaries, emphasis 
will be placed on improving the entrepreneurial capacity of producers by providing technical assistance and seed capital 
for analysis of investment options. The business plans will also include public good/ compliance elemtns (environemntal 
and social aspects, food dafety compliance, etc.). Strict eligibility criteria will be set forth to enable the participation of 
small and medium producers. The selection and eligibility criteria and the governance and management aspects of the 
matching grants will be detailed in a Grant Operational Manual to be formulated during project prepration.  
 
Sub-component 1.2: Improving productivity and competitiveness (US$30 million) 
 
28. This sub-component will focus on improving the productivity and competitiveness of project beneficiaries through 
specific investments, as defined in the business plans and implemented through matching grants (defined in Component 
1). The total cost of the business plan depends on the type of investment, the amount of working capital and the scope of 
the technical assistance. This cost also varies by the productive activity and the typology of the producers. For example, 
in Montenegro (under the MIDAS project), the total cost for agricultural producers ranges between 10,000 and 70,000 
euros, while for agricultural processors it ranges between 50,000 and 250,000 euros. In Kosovo, the range for producers 
ranges between 10,000 and 100,000 euros, while for processors it is between 30,000 and 400,000 euros. The project will 
finance only a share of this cost (through a marching grant of typically 50%), as a one time incentive to leverage private 
investment, including own resources and/or credit. 
 
29. The sub-component will finance i) the use of good environmental and agricultural practices to improve on-farm 
productivity, ii) in on-farm inputs and equipment required for the optimizatoin of production and/or diversification, as 
well as technical advice for the use inputs, technologies, alternatives, etc., iii) support digital agriculture approaches to 
improve productivity on-farm and enhance linkages between producers and markets, iv) support compliance with food 
safety standards, traceability, geographic denomination of origin and other market-related activities as part of the 
improvement of the competitive position of beneficiaries; v) carry out market demand assessments to identify differential 
market potential for products; vi) support beneficiary participation in trade fairs and other events; vii) support the 
commercialization of agricultural products by improving access to medium-term finance, providing start-up capital for 

                                            
15 There is a strong public good argument for using matching grants – stimulate cross compliance (improving enviornmental outcomes), stimulate 
use of innovations, new technologies, development of skills, modernization, horizontal integration, financial inclusion. Through the project, capacity 
for the use of matching grants will be improved in the sector, which can lead to a consecutive better absorption of IPARD grants. 
16 Under IPARD grants, investment grants for processing facilities is only provided for new structures; national rural development program can provide 
investments for rehabilitation and upgrade of existent facilities.

small- and medium-sized farms involved in productive partnerships, and by ensuring the availability of financing for value 
chain support. Considering the high risk of lending to small producers, the project will support the enabling environment 
for de-risking by working with existent public credit guarantee funds. There are various guarantee schemes applicable to 
Serbian agriculture and, in particular, the EIF and DCA17, which the project seeks to leverage as a risk mitigating mechanism 
for crowing-in private investment through lending by commercial banks.  
 
 
Component 2: Improving the capacity of MAFWM to support modern agriculture (US$10 million) 
 
30. The objective of this component is to improve capacity of MAFWM and related agencies to facilitate the enabling 
environment for improved sector performance through evidence-based policy making and provision of public goods, such 
as information systems and open data platforms. A digital platform for decision making18 will benefit all agricultural 
producers of Serbia, whether they apply for support through IPARD or national program or don’t. A unique registry 
system19 would be required to support decision making and to also support pension reform efforts in the country.   
 
Sub-component 2.1: Improving information systems 
 
31. This sub-component will support the Ministry of Agriculture Forestry and Water Management (MAFWM) to 
modernize its information systems and strengthen its decision-making capacity, through the improvement of hardware, 
software and human capacity for information support to the sector. Modernizing the information systems is critical in the 
process of alignment to EU CAP, including sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) delivery and monitoring, advisory information, 
land parceling (LPIS), paying agency data management, etc. In addition, the project will support a digital producer 
identification card (“one card”) to enable the better monitoring of the access to resources, support services and 
information by all farmers in the country. The project will finance the following: i) technical assistance to improve the 
coordination within and across existing information systems across Directorates and enhance delivery of information for 
decision making at different levels; ii) acquisition of hardware and software to improve the scope, functionality and 
compatibility of information systems and establish digital data collection and processing of current paper-based processes. 
 
32. The project will also assist the Ministry of Agriculture Forestry and Water Management (MAFWM) with technical 
assistance to develop capacity to assess the demand, structure, and modalities for agricultural Guarantee agency in Serbia, 
similar to these in other neighboring and EU countries, with the potential of establishing in the medium term such a 
guarantee agency (state-owned or PPP). Options to capitalize the guarantees would also be part of the assessment. 
 
 
Sub-component 2.2: Open data platform 
 
33. This sub-component will establish an open, public information platform where key information is accessible to all 
agriculture stakeholders. The project will finance the software, hardware and technical assistance required for the set-up 

                                            
17 Two public donor guarantee schemes with agricultural windows are expected to be available in early 2020 – European Investment Fund (EIF) 
(backed by EU funding) and the DCA (guarantee facility of USAID), still under negotiations with MAFWM – and can be tapped on by commercial banks 
in the first couple of years of project implementation. IFC is already engaged with the EIF. Although a public guarantee fund exists in Serbia (the 
Serbian Development Fund, SDF), it is weak and does not cater to agriculture. Hence, a capacity building (through a TA) activity may be warranted 
under the project to provide guidance on future needs by the public sector for unlocking private investment in agriculture. 
18 A PHRD grant on strengthening M&E capacity of MAFWM, implemented in parallel to this project, will support this platform thro ugh capacity 
building within the Ministry and technical assistance, as needed. 
19 For example, only farm household applying for IPARD grants are registered in the national farm registry (around 335,000), excluding a large number 
of agricultural producers.

and functionality of the platform. Access to important production and market information, including weather variables, 
prices of key products, etc. is critical for on and off-farm decisions. This platform can also be a support system for advisory 
services in Serbia and can link to digital approaches on farm, ensuring a two-way communication on plan and animal 
health, and other risks that can constrain agricultural competitiveness. Maintaining the content and enabling public access 
to this platform is a key role that the Ministry can play in the enabling environment for agricultural sector transformation.  
 
34. A digital information platform can play an important role for the spatial tracking and connectivity of production 
and market demand, thus contributing to improved positioning of products, sales and overall competitiveness. In addition, 
by including weather and climate information modeling, the project could contribute to early warning systems, helping 
producers to better prepare and adapt to changing climatic conditions. The project will use existing digital agriculture tools 
and will collaborate with private sector IT companies for finetuning electronic delivery mechanisms for monitoring 
production, access to technical information, traceability of goods and identification of market opportunities.  
 
Component 3: Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation (US$5 million) 
 
35. This component will support the establishment of a project management team (PMT) in the Directorate of 
Agrarian Payments (DAP) and capacity needs related to project implementation, as well as project monitoring, including 
a comprehensive baseline, mid-term review and a final impact assessment of project investments.

Summary of Screening of Environmental and Social Risks and Impacts 

 
The project is classified as Moderate Risk taking in account the low risk nature of the interventions, the limitations on 
implementation capacity, the application of environmentally friendly practices and new technologies, and the difficulty 
of enforcing workers’ rights in multiple SME agribusinesses. No adverse impacts such as involuntary land acquisition, 
impacts on community health and safety, on cultural heritage, are expected. Some of the project funded activities may 
include support to small scale community agriculture that is undertaken within areas under some level of environmental 
protection. The project will introduce new technologies and support improvement of technical knowledge and skills of 
beneficiaries on, amongst other, water and energy efficiency, pollution prevention and best practice use of herbicides 
and pesticides. The project’s anticipated social impacts are predominantly positive, such as increased income and 
employment in the agricultural sector as well as protection from climate related economic losses for farmers through the 
introduction of an early warning system. As labor informality is prevalent in the agricultural sector, the Borrower will 
prepare Labor Management Procedures to manage risks related to workers’ rights in project supported agribusinesses. 
The environmental and social screening criteria developed for the agricultural grant schemes and the credit guarantee 
fund will screen for relevant risks and apply mitigation hierarchy.

B. Introduction and Context 

 
Country Context 

Benin is a coastal State in West Africa located in the tropical zone with a total surface area of 114,763 km². It is bordered 

by Togo (West), Nigeria (East), Burkina Faso and Niger (North), and the Atlantic Ocean (South).  In a politically stable 

and democratic regime for nearly 30 years, the Government of Benin (GoB) maintains a decentralized territorial 

administration comprising 77 municipalities (elected) in 12 departments. The population was estimated at 11.2 million in 

2017, of which 51 percent are women, 52 percent are 18 or younger, and 55 percent live in rural areas (national census, 

RGPH4). If the current growth rate of 3.2 percent per year is maintained, the population could reach 17.6 million by 2030. 

With a per capita income of just US$820 in 2016, Benin is among the poorest countries in the World.  The share of the 

population living below the national poverty rate was estimated at 40% in 2015, of which 63.5% earn less than a dollar/day 

(EMICov 2015).  Poverty rate is higher in rural areas (42%) than in urban areas (32%).  In 2014, youth (15-29 years old) 

unemployment rate was at 14.3% and the percentage of youth in the informal sector was 89.6% (ETVA 2014).  The 

country ranks 163 out of 189 on the UNDP Human Development Index (HDI) 2017. 

In addition to transit trade with neighboring countries, especially Nigeria, Benin’s economy relies heavily on agriculture 

(cotton, in particular). The agriculture sector is the second largest contributor to GDP (25 percent) and employs around 

70 percent of the labor force (15-64 years old)1. Benin's agriculture—primarily extensive, slash-and-burn—is one of the 

major drivers of deforestation and forest degradation.  

 
 

Sectoral and Institutional Context 

The Benin's forest areas are divided into two categories: 

                                                           
1 The informal economy represents 65 percent of GDP, engaging 90 percent of the labor force and more than 95 percent of the female labor 
force. Services and agriculture, accounting for approximately 50 and 25 percent respectively of total value added, are both dominated by the 

informal sector. The large share of services reflects Benin’s role as a transit and trade hub for landlocked countries in the north, primarily Niger 

and Burkina Faso, but also the large amount of informal re-export trade and commerce with Nigeria, which amounts to some 20 percent of GDP 

and 25 percent of government revenue. (Source: Benin CPF 2018)

a) the Classified Estate Domain (CED), a national heritage belonging to the Central State, is managed 
by the Directorate General of Water, Forests and Hunting (DGEFC: Direction Générale des Eaux 

et Forêts et Chasse), the National Office for Wood (ONAB: Office National du Bois), and the 

National Center for the Management of Wildlife (CENAGREF), all three entities being under the 

authority of the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development (MCVDD: Ministère du 

Cadre de Vie et du Développement Durable). The CED includes: (i) 46 Gazetted Forests (GFs), of 

which 39 (as well as seven Reforestation Perimeters) are managed by the DGEFC and seven 

managed by ONAB mainly for timber production for export; and (ii) two National Parks (Pendjari 

and W) with three hunting zones managed by the CENAGREF. 

b) the Protected Estate Domain (PED), which comprises the rest of the forest areas in the Rural 
Domain. The PED forests, authorized for multiple usages, including agriculture, are under the 

territorial jurisdiction of the municipalities and managed by the mayors under the supervision of the 

DGEFC. 

 

The forest policy (law 93-009 of July 1993) that governs the forest regime in the Republic of Benin was 

revised in 2012.  It is currently being updated with funding from the European Union to incorporate new 

guidelines for sustainable forests management and is expected to be submitted to Parliament approval by 

mid-2019. A number of policy and strategy documents have also been produced to improve the 

management of forest and natural resources, including the: (i) National Program for Sustainable 

Management of Natural Resources (2008); (ii) National Strategy for Rural Wood Markets (2008); (iii) 

National Strategy and Action Plan on Biodiversity 2011-2020 (2011) and (iv) National Strategy for Climate 

Change mitigation and adaption (2018). In addition, Benin has also ratified several international 

conventions relating to the management and conservation of forest resources. 

Despite this institutional context for management of the sector, the decrease of Beninese forest cover, 

particularly over the decade from 2007-2016, is concerning:  Benin’s national forest cover, estimated at 

8.12 million hectares in 2007 (70.4% of the national territory), fell to 7.9 million hectares in 2016 (68.5% 

of the territory), a loss of over 215,000 ha. If the current deforestation rate is maintained, the per capita 

forest area, which more than halved from 1.63 ha in 1980 to 0.87 ha in 1995, will fall even further, to 0.29 

ha by 2025 (MEHU/DGFRN 2012).  

The root cause of deforestation and forest degradation in Benin is the weak capacity of the Forest 

Administration to ensure management operations in Gazetted Forests. The Administration has personnel in 

the field who, although technically competent, lack adequate operational means to monitor the GFs. This 

presence in the field is limited by serious shortcomings in physical assets, most glaringly in forest rangers 

living quarters, which are in poor condition (lacking in access to water, electricity, means of 

communication). With surveillance being carried out sporadically and in half-measure, Gazetted Forests 

have become the theater of: (i) expansion of clandestine farms, which rely on extensive slash-and-burn 

agriculture; (ii) transhumance or the settling of herds in GFs; (iii) unregulated removals of fuelwood; and 

(iv) establishment of human settlements in GFs. 

The indirect causes of deforestation include increasing demographic pressure and climate change, the latter 

of which is slowing down the forest cover regeneration process and reducing biomass in the GFs through 

faster drying up and silting of streams, more frequent flooding, and increased soil erosion.

D. Project Description  

The project will consist of four components: 
1) Support to Forests Governance; 
2) Integretaed Management of Gazetted Forests; 
3) Development of Selected Non-Timber Forests Products Value Chains; 
4) Project Management. 
 
E. Implementation 

 
Institutional and Implementation Arrangements 

An Integrated Projects Management Unit (IPMU) will be responsible for the implementation of all WB-

financed environment, forestry and NRM projects, under the responsibility of the Ministry of Environment, 

and Sustainable Development, including West Africa Coast Areas (WACA), the GFM project and the 

upcoming Green Climate Fund (GCF) project.   

The current WACA PIU will be upgraded to an IPMU.  It will be composed of the following shared units 

by all projects under its responsibility: (i) Financial Management, (ii) Procurement, (iii) Safeguards, (iv) 

Monitoring & Evaluation, (v) Communication and (vi) administrative support, as well as a shared Steering 

Committee.  The shared Steering Committed will be in place before project effectiveness. These units will 

be strengthened as needed with fiduciary, safeguards, M&E and Communication staff to support the GFM 

project implementation.   

Each project under the IPMU will have a dedicated project coordinator and a Technical Assistant depending 

on the project workload. For the GFMP, the dedicated coordinator will be supported by an international 

top-notch forestry specialist. Both will be recruited competitively before project effectiveness.  

The Director General of DGEFC in his role as National Coordinator of the Government Forestry Program, 

will be the Director of the GFMP to mainly ensure synergies with that Program. The decentralized 

Technical Forests Management Units (CTAF) in the field will ensure technical execution of project 

activities.  The CTAF will report to the GFM project coordinator, who will in turn report to the General 

Director of DGEFC.  The headcount of CTAF employees has been increased by the Government to include 

personnel fully dedicated to project implementation, especially for timely implementation of production 

forests activities.

SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY 

 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

The project will finance works for the physical 
demarcation of conservation areas, the restoration 
of selected urban GFs in major cities as urban parks. 
The operation under preparation will also support 
the development of timber production, fuelwood 
production as well as the Income Generating 
Activities(IGA)such as animal husbandry, vegetable 
gardening and Non Timber Forest Products(NTFP) as 
well. Such activities are most of the time, associated 
with potential adverse impacts on environment even 
though these impacts are considered as being 
moderate. However, the locations of specific 
investments will not be known with certainty prior 
to board approval. Consequently, an Environmental 
and Social Management Framework (ESMF) was 
developed ,reviewed, consulted upon and disclosed 
both in Benin and on the Bank’s website on March 
12, 2019. 

Performance Standards for Private Sector 
Activities OP/BP 4.03 

No This policy is not triggered under this project. 

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 Yes 

Activities related to the physical demarcation of 
conservation areas, the restoration of selected 
urban GFs in major cities as urban parks, the 
development of timber production, fuelwood 
production as well as the Income Generating 
Activities could impact negatively Natural Habitats if

not well managed. The ESMF developed in line with 
OP4.01, includes a chapter related to Natural 
habitats  proper management during physical works. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 Yes 

Some activities such as the agro-forestry, the 
physical demarcation of conservation areas, could 
also impact forests. In addition, the objective of the 
Government objective to increase the volume of 
timber produced annually from the current 65,000 
to 250 000 m3 through large-scale plantations in 
selected GFs (Alibori Supérieur, Ouémé Superieur, 
Dogo and Lama) in order to increase the sector 
contribution to the economy could lead to some 
forests overexploitation. A specific section focused 
on forest resources protection was developed and 
included in the ESMF. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

The project will support adoption of agricultural 
intensification and agroforestry methods through a 
stocktaking of existing successful national and 
regionally employed agroforestry methods and 
agricultural intensification techniques in order to 
recommend those practices most suitable to the 
project target zones. For that reason the O4.09 is 
triggered. Consequently, a Pest Management 
Plan(PMP) was developed and included in the ESMF 
to guide any potential use of chemical products as 
part of the project. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 Yes 

The project intends to support the physical 
demarcation of conservation areas as well as IGA 
such  vegetable gardening. Such activities could 
induce excavations with potential cultural properties 
discoveries. In order to anticipate and to be sure 
that all the precautions were taken to protect and 
safeguard physical cultural resources, the ESMF 
includes a section on how to handle in a proper way 
chance finds of cultural assets within the project 
area. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 No 
There are no Indigenous People as per the definition 
of the policy in the project areas. 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

No involuntary resettlement is anticipated. 
However, the demarcation of conservation areas 
could lead to the limitation of access of resources. 
To anticipate any issue related to these aspects,  the 
project has prepared a Process Framework. Once 
prepared, that document was reviewed, consulted

website on March 13, 2019. 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 No The project will not finance dams nor rely on dams. 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

No 
The project is not expected to affect international 
waterways. 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No The project will not be located in a Disputed Area. 

 
 

KEY SAFEGUARD POLICY ISSUES AND THEIR MANAGEMENT 

 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential 
large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
Overall, the Benin-gazetted forests management project aims at safeguarding gazetted Forests as well as restoring 
degraded areas. Based on that, it will induce essentially positive impacts. However, some activities such as the physical 
demarcation of conservation areas, the restoration of selected urban GFs in major cities as urban parks, the 
development of timber production, the fuelwood production as well as the Income Generating Activities(IGA)such as 
animal husbandry, vegetable gardening and Non Timber Forest Products(NTFP) might produce potential adverse 
impacts. However,such adverse impacts are expected to be moderate, site specific and manageable at an acceptable 
level. That is why the project is rated as a category B. 
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area: 
The Benin-gazetted forests management project aims to protect the forests by limiting significantly their degradation. 
This measure could involve  a reduction of the agricultural productions' yield by stopping the itinerant agriculture. The 
impossibility to expand henceforth farming areas in conjunction with demographic explosion could exacerbate land 
disputes.  
However, the project will support adoption of agricultural intensification and agroforestry methods through a 
stocktaking of existing successful national and regionally employed agroforestry methods and agricultural 
intensification techniques in order to recommend those practices most suitable to the project target zones.  
 
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts. 
N/A 
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower 
capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
As the exact geographic locations of project specific interventions are not yet determined with certainty, the Borrower 
has developed two environmental and social safeguards instruments, namely an Environmental and Social 
Management Framework (ESMF) including a Pest Management Plan,  in compliance with the triggering of  OP/BP 4.01 
(Environmental Assessment) and OP 4.09 (Pest Management)  and a Process Framework(PF) as per OP/BP 4.12 
(Involuntary Resettlement) triggering. 
Further to that, the ESMF includes two chapters focusing on Natural Habitats and Forests safeguarding. Both chapters 
make the project fully in compliance with the OP4.04 and OP4.36. Additionally, a section related to a procedure of

“chance find” was also included in the ESMF in line with the triggering of the OP4.11. 
The ESMF lays out procedures for screening and mitigating impacts from construction and operation of the irrigation 
schemes, and includes the following: (a) checklists of potential environmental and social impacts and their sources; (b) 
procedures for participatory screening of proposed sites and activities and the environmental and social 
considerations; (c) procedures for assessing potential environmental and social impacts of the planned project 
activities; (d) institutional arrangements for mitigating, preventing, and managing the identified impacts; (e) typical 
environmental management planning process for addressing negative externalities in the course of project 
implementation; (f) a system for monitoring the implementation of mitigation measures; and (g) recommended 
capacity building measures for environmental planning and monitoring of project activities.  
 
The Pest management’s section deals with safeguard measures to be taken in the case of the use of pesticide to fight 
against agriculture predators. However, organic fertilizers and biological technics are supplies recommended to be use 
first. Moreover, that section sets up guidance and guidelines with the aim of protecting population health and 
environment integrity in promoting best practices. 
 
Specific ESIAs will be prepared for relevant activities before project implementation along with Environmental and 
Social Management Plans (ESMPs). The ESIAs will provide mitigation measures for all the potential impacts as a result 
of the triggering of the above-mentioned safeguard policies. 
The Process Framework will guide new modalities of gazetted forest as well as restored areas access and use of their 
resources. 
Responsibility and oversight of the Project’s overall compliance with national legislation and Bank safeguard policies 
will rest with the environmental and social specialists in the PIU, as the main persons in charge of project 
implementation and monitoring of safeguard aspects. They will be working in close collaboration with the national 
entity responsible for ensuring the compliance of the project’s activities with the national legislation namely 
ABE(Beninese Environment Agency). That government’s body will conduct periodic monitoring of project’s compliance 
with proposed mitigation. It also receive guidance and technical support from bank’s environmental and social 
safeguard specialist during implementation support missions or through sessions of training. 
 
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, 
with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
The populations who will be impacted by the project activities are mainly the rural communities. They are the forest 
owners, the farmers, the hunters, the coalmen and forest loggers. During the  project preparation, these various socio-
professional layers have been consulted. In addition, these consultations have concerned the Civil Society 
Organizations (CSO) such as  the NGOs opening in the environmental management and the natural resources fields , 
producers organizations, associations, private operators, deputies, etc. These meetings are held in the form of 
workshops, of meetings, meetings of work.  
After the preparation of safeguard instruments, a validation workshop with the participation of the ABE  and all the 
above-mentioned stakeholders was held on February,2019. At this occasion, comments and suggestions from 
participants were taken in both documents.

Other Decision (as needed) 
 

B. Introduction and Context 
 
1. High rates of poverty and inequality remain a persistent development challenge in Honduras. Poverty reduction 
in Honduras over the last decades has been slow compared to regional averages for Central and Latin America. Of 
Honduras’ national population of about 9.1 million people, 70 percent live at or below the national poverty line and about 
1 in 6 of the total population lives in extreme poverty (less than US$ 1.90 per day). Honduras’ rate of economic inequality 
is among the highest in Latin America, with a Gini Index of .50. World Bank data indicate that about 54 percent of income 
in Honduras is held by the highest-earning 20 percent of the population and only 3 percent of income is held by the 
lowest-earning 20 percent.  Unemployment in 2017 was estimated at 4.5 percent, with unemployment among youth at 
8.2 percent. 
 
2. The absence of a robust economic base for generating more and better jobs remains a central challenge for 
poverty and inequality reduction in Honduras.  Average earnings per worker vary widely across and within sectors in 
Honduras, with self-employment in agriculture as the least remunerative activity of all (average monthly earnings of  
L 2,404 per person in 2016, in contrast to formal wage work at an average of L 9,300). Informal work persists across all 
sectors (agriculture, industry, services) and in both urban and rural settings, and is characterized not only by low earnings 
but also by low quality and productivity, undermining GDP growth. Inclusive approaches to rural growth will require 
promoting diversification of rural incomes through combining formal and informal work, non-farm activities, and the 
intensification of agricultural activities.  
 
3. Honduras is considered significantly vulnerable to climate and weather events, with poorer populations in 
particular having a low capacity to cope and adapt. Honduras is seen as one of the countries most affected by extreme 
weather events and has increasingly felt the impacts of climate change, El Niño, and other weather-related events that 
have affected landscapes and infrastructure (communications, housing, public health, etc.). In 1998, Hurricane Mitch 
generated economic damages estimated at around 81 percent of GDP.  In addition, the 2015 drought season affected 1.3 
million people and small-scale farmers had an average loss of agricultural production of about 80 percent. Several 
underlying factors limit capacity to cope with these impacts, including a lack of means to recuperate lost assets, limited 
livelihood options, and lack of basic support services.

Sectoral and Institutional Context 
 

4. The agriculture sector continues to be a strong pillar of economic growth in Honduras.  Underpinned by 
favorable agro-ecological conditions, agriculture, forestry, and fishing together the sector grew by 10.7 percent in 2017, 
accounting for 12.9 percent of GDP (primary production only) and representing a 5-year peak in sector growth. This figure 
understates the importance of agriculture in the Honduran economy, however, as it does not reflect the many backward 
and forward linkages between primary agriculture and other sectors, both upstream and downstream. Based on 
experiences from other countries in the region, the contribution to Honduras’ GDP of its broader food and agriculture 
system would be about 1.5 times higher than that of primary agriculture alone. 
 
5. Notwithstanding strong agriculture sector performance in recent years, much more needs to be done given the 
scale of poverty and food and nutrition insecurity in rural areas. In Honduras, more than half of the poor, and two-thirds 
of the extreme poor, live in rural areas. Rural poverty is most heavily concentrated in the western and southern areas of 
the country, known as the “Dry Corridor” (Corredor Seco). The rural poor overwhelmingly rely on agriculture as their 
principal livelihood source, with an estimated 72 percent of agricultural families in Honduras engaged in semi-subsistence 
farming. This type of farming is typically characterized by low productivity and competitiveness, low revenue generation, 
and high vulnerability to shocks.  
 
6. Climate change and the increasingly frequent occurrences of extreme weather events are widely recognized as 
one of the most important risks affecting the Honduran agriculture sector. Honduras’ endowment of water, fertile soils, 
forests, and other natural capital is a central foundation for much of the country’s economic activity. However, the health 
of these resources is highly vulnerable to climate change, El Niño, and other weather-related events, as well as to 
environmental mismanagement. These vulnerabilities exacerbate rural poverty and food and nutrition insecurity.  
 
7. Investing in rural productivity, resilience, and innovation to boost export competitiveness will be a critical 
component of efforts in Honduras to reduce poverty and inequality. While the 2008 launching of the Dominican 
Republic–Central America Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA) has increased access to foreign markets, it has also exposed 
rural producers to new and increasingly competitive markets. Honduras benefits from strong comparative advantages in 
the agriculture sector: proximity to major regional and international markets, and agro-ecological conditions favorable 
to diverse agricultural value chains that are capable of meeting market quality demands. 

 
8. The COMRURAL project is currently GoH’s flagship project for promoting agricultural competitiveness and 
exports in Honduras. COMRURAL, approved by the World Bank Board of Executive Directors in 2008 and extended 
through an Additional Financing in 2017, is widely recognized throughout Honduras for its success in linking smallholder 
farmers to domestic and international markets. This success has been achieved through support to commercial 
production and post-harvest value addition structured under the “productive alliances” model.  

 
9. The decade-long implementation of COMRURAL has shown that Honduras needs to work on several fronts to 
enhance its business-enabling environment and promote agribusiness development.  Regulations and financial services 
that enable and incentivize entrepreneurship in the agriculture sector have not been a subject of sufficient public-sector 
attention. The modernization of critical public services is required for governance and the agricultural business climate 
to be stronger. The National Service for Agri-food Health and Safety (SENASA: Spanish acronym) and the Sanitary 
Regulation Agency (ARSA: Spanish acronym) are also in need of modernization. The public sector in Honduras can 
significantly improve its efficiency and the returns of agriculture public expenditures, and there is a general need to 
redefine the spaces for public-private coordination and partnerships in agribusiness, potentially by drawing on the 
concept of “Maximizing Financing for Development” (MFD).

10. Poor agro-logistics has also shown to be a critical barrier to improving agricultural competitiveness in Honduras.  
Lack of adequate agro-logistics, both hard (infrastructure) and soft (services), is a major bottleneck. The 2018 World Bank 
Logistics Performance Index awarded Honduras an aggregate ranking (according to 6 dimensions of logistics over the 
period 2012 to 2018) of 106 out of 167 countries, based on evaluations by its international trading partners. Honduras 
ranked particularly low, including lower than the regional averages for Latin America, in terms of customs regulations 
and timeliness. Investing in the upgrading of agro-logistics infrastructure will be critical for enabling Honduran farmers 
to diversify into higher-value, often perishable agriculture products that cannot thrive under the country’s current agro-
logistics infrastructure. 

 
11. Harnessing recent innovations in technology and data collection will be critical for improving competitiveness 
and creating new employment opportunities. Developing countries around the world are improving the competitiveness 
of their products through well-established research programs as the basis to promote the use of innovation, big data 
analysis and the Internet of Things. Honduras ranks 129 on the information and communications technology (ICT) 
Development Index 2017 (out of 176 countries worldwide). According to the International Food Policy and Research 
Institute (IFPRI), the total agricultural research spending index is US$ 8.0 million and the spending as a share of 
agricultural GDP for Honduras is 0.17 percent, the lowest in LAC. Honduras’ rapidly growing Information Technology 
Services sector may position it well for developing similar agricultural “intelligence” services and other innovative 
platforms to modernize and innovate in the agriculture sector.  

 
12. The Government of Honduras (GoH) through the 2020 Plan has defined a new development strategy to promote 
the transformation and modernization of the agro-industrial and agribusiness sectors, showing a keen appreciation 
for needs on the ground as well as strong commitment to supporting agriculture sector development. A recent GoH 
exercise identified and prioritized value chains based on the commercial potential and the country’s comparative 
advantages, as well as their impact on the generation of new jobs and income for rural families. Primary value chains 
prioritized include: livestock (beef), avocado, soy, cocoa, coffee and specialty coffee, black and red beans, cashew, 
vegetables, pitahaya, tilapia, coconut and agro-forestry initiatives, which all together have a required investment 
program estimated at US$ 1,200 million. The development of these value chains requires a business model guided by 
private public initiatives, and GoH's vision for these value chains includes the generation of up to 120,000 new full-time 
jobs. 

 
13. GoH considers the continuation of the COMRURAL approach to be one of the pillars to support implementation 
of the 2020 Plan. As requested by GoH, the proposed project – informed by valuable lessons learned during 10 years of 
COMRURAL implementation – will help to fulfill the 2020 Plan objectives by expanding the “productive alliance” model 
to agribusiness initiatives in additional regions and value chains and deepening the participation of the private financial 
sector in financing small rural producers.  
 
Relationship to CPF 
 
14. The proposed project is in line with GoH’s vision and the with all the focus areas of the World Bank Group's 
Honduras Country Partnership Framework FY16-FY20 (CPF) Report No. 98367-HN, as discussed by the Executive 
Directors on December 15, 2015. The World Bank’s strategic engagement for reducing poverty and inequality in Honduras 
are structured into the following three pillars: (i) fostering inclusion; (ii) bolstering conditions for growth; and (iii) reducing 
vulnerabilities to enhance resilience. The proposed project will contribute to all three of these focus areas by supporting 
financial inclusion, technical assistance, and market access for small rural producers, improving the enabling conditions

for agribusiness and rural entrepreneurship, and reducing agriculture sector resilience to climate change and other 
weather-related threats. 
 
15. The proposed Project is aligned with the IDA18 overarching theme, “Towards 2030: Investing in Growth, 
Resilience and Opportunity” and with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  The Project will contribute to 
implementing several themes prioritized by the World Bank Group: (i) Maximizing Finance for Development, (ii) climate 
change; (iii) gender; (iv) jobs and economic transformation; and, (v) governance and institutions, which present specific 
development challenges in the case of Honduras.   

 
C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  

 
The PDO is to improve access to markets and climate-smart practices and contribute to the economic inclusion of 
targeted beneficiaries in select agricultural value chains. 
 
Key Results (From PCN) 

 
The achievement of the project development objective would be measured through the following indicators: 
 

• Number of beneficiaries (farmers and agri-entrepreneurs) adopting climate-smart practices promoted by the 
project, disaggregated by gender, youth, Indigenous, Afro-descendants (“climate-smart” indicator) 

• New jobs created under subprojects financed by the project (“economic inclusion” indicator) 

• Percentage increase in the value of gross sales of agricultural enterprises based on implementation of the 
business plans approved in the first 3.5 years of project implementation (“access to markets” and “economic 
inclusion” indicator) 

• Percentage of rural producer organizations (RPOs) working under a productive alliance approach 24 months 
after first disbursement (“sustainability” and “access to markets” indicator) 

 
D. Concept Description 

 
A. Concept 
 
Description 

 
16. The proposed project is an Investment Project Financing (IPF), comprising an IDA credit of US$ 150 million that 
is expected to leverage an expected additional US$ 150 million in private commercial finance and US$ 30 million in 
Rural Producer Organization (RPO) contributions. The proposed IPF will be implemented over an 8-year period and 
modeled on the well-established success of COMRURAL. The total project cost is estimated to be US$ 330 million. 

17. The proposed project aims to improve access to markets and climate-smart practices and contribute to the 
economic inclusion of targeted beneficiaries in select agricultural value chains. Innovation, defined as approaches that 
are new and/or different for project beneficiaries, will play an important role in achieving this objective in the form inter 
alia of practices, technologies, and systems. Moving beyond a focus on specific value chain nodes or aspects, the project 
will promote competitive improvements along the full spectrum of backward and forward value chain linkages.

18. The proposed project will benefit farmers and agri-entrepreneurs in the Honduran agriculture sector directly 
and indirectly. The direct beneficiaries will be: (i) members of the agricultural or agribusiness enterprises (formal groups, 
associations, or cooperatives of small/medium size producers and agri-entrepreneurs) participating in subprojects (about 
100,000 farmers and their families); and (ii) other agricultural enterprises (either other groups/cooperatives or private 
individual firms) participating as partners/allies in the proposed subprojects (as agro-processors, aggregators, 
wholesalers, traders, etc.) or providing essential services for their successful operation (e.g. the rental of agricultural or 
processing specialized equipment etc.) and receiving matching grant funds. The project will also have secondary 
beneficiaries: participating public sector agencies and their staff (the capacities of which will be strengthened and 
modernized by the project) and participating private commercial financiers (who will gain capacity through the project 
for engaging with the agriculture sector). The proposed project will also have indirect benefits for a much broader range 
of stakeholders in the agriculture sector through enhancing the overall agriculture sector business environment and 
through strengthening and modernizing the public entities that provide services to those engaged in the agriculture 
sector (nearly one million Hondurans). 

 
19. The project will be national in scope and will target select GoH-prioritized value chains. The institutional 
strengthening and business climate enhancing activities (as in Component 1) will have a national coverage. For 
Component 2, project interventions will be identified through a geospatial approach to prioritizing value chains and 
agribusiness initiatives by region. 

 

20. The PDO will be achieved through the following Components: 
 

21. Component 1: Support to the Modernization of Honduras’ Agribusiness Environment The purpose of this 
Component will be to contribute to the modernization and strengthening of select public sector services and institutional 
capacity to enable and promote competitiveness in the agriculture sector. This Component will finance works, goods, 
technical assistance, consulting and non-consulting services, and operational costs to support: (i) institutional 
modernization of the Secretariat of Agriculture and Livestock (SAG: Spanish acronym), National Service for Agri-food 
Health and Safety (SENASA: Spanish acronym), and Agency of Sanitary Regulation (ARSA: Spanish acronym) for the 
improved provision of public services and governance structures in the agricultural sector; (ii) operation of the National 
Agricultural Council and its technical unit, including for the provision and adoption of ICT and facilitate uptake of other 
innovative solutions for market intelligence, agro-climate systems, agro-finance, and agro-logistics to promote a better-
informed decision-making process for effective policy dialogue; and (iii) increasing the quantity and quality of the 
agricultural man-/woman-power required for enabling the agribusiness environment in project areas by supporting the 
modernization of agricultural technical training facilities, e-learning training programs, innovation labs and incubation 
centers, among others.  
 
22. Component 2: Support to enhance the competitiveness of agribusiness initiatives. The purpose of this 
Component is to support competitive agribusiness initiatives (“subprojects”) in prioritized agricultural value chains. This 
would be achieved through improving and expanding the productive alliances model, increasing complementarity 
between public and private investments, as well as expanding the participation of private commercial banks and micro 
finance institutions in financing small rural producers. Specifically, this Component would finance: (i) works, goods, 
technical assistance, and services for the selection, preparation, and implementation of selected subprojects by 
participating partners; (ii) incentives for the adoption of innovative agribusiness practices and technologies to improve 
productivity, market access, and climate resilience, and (iii) complementary investments in small-scale agro-logistics 
services and infrastructure. These subprojects will contribute to improved management of water resources in project 
activities, particularly in the Dry Corridor, to ensure the viability and sustainability of the agribusinesses that they support. 
A minimum threshold for women and youth participation will be determined, and separate procedures to promote the

inclusion of Indigenous and Afro-descendant communities as beneficiaries in more favorable conditions, and adapted to 
their sociocultural reality, will be included. In addition, the proposed project will target a minimum number of small 
farmers with sufficient potential to exit PROSASUR (which focuses on the extreme poor in the Dry Corridor) as well as 
bring in poor farmers beneficiaries from the social protection program mainly known as Vida Mejor. 
 
23. Component 3: Project management support.  This Component will finance the overall project management, 
coordination, and implementation. 

 

24. Component 4: Contingency Emergency Response (CER). This Component will provide immediate response to 
eligible emergencies. As such, in the event of such an eligible emergency (as defined in the Contingency Emergency 
Response (CER) Operational Manual prepared and adopted by the GoH), this Component would finance emergency 
activities and expenditures through the reallocation of funds from the Project. 

 
 
 
    

  SAFEGUARDS 

 
A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 

 
The project will be national in scope focusing on rural areas of Honduras. Priority agricultural products have been 

identified as coffee, cattle, cacao, avocado, cashew, leaf vegetables, fruit and non-traditional products, among others. 
The specific locations of the specific subprojects to be financed will not be known during the preparation of the project, 
but it is highly likely that indigenous peoples and afro-descendant communities may be present in the area of influence of 
the project, particularly in areas such as La Esperanza and Copan. There is a significant incidence of crime and violence in 
the country. This project will include private sector funds contributing to the co-financed resources for the project. In that 
regard, the environmental and social requirements will apply to all the funds administered under the COMRURAL II. 
 
B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 

 
The main agency involved in the implementation of the project, INVEST-H, has experience implementing safeguards 

policies and World Bank procedures because of their implementation of the COMRURAL I and its additional financing 
project since 2007 (P101209). COMRURAL I has a tracking system for the subprojects, and beneficiary organizations are 
required to have environmental management plans. The environmental and social management capacity of INVEST-H, 
however, will be assessed during project preparation, and it is expected that the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) will be 
improved based on the results of the due diligence, strengthening their procedures and frameworks for monitoring 
environmental and social sustainability to enhance effective implementation and monitoring of the safeguards 
instruments that will be developed.

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

The aim of the project is to support the development 
of increased economic benefits for small farmers in 
particular, through the creation of strategic alliances 
with technical service providers, financial institutions 
and markets, and to increase agricultural productivity 
through capacity building and value chain integration. 
Component 1 activities are expected to mostly finance 
the rehabilitation of existing infrastructure and the 
acquisition of equipment for activities like the 
modernization public agricultural schools and public 
agricultural universities. Component 2 will fund 
agribusiness initiatives across the country, such as 
water harvesting and water storage, construction of 
small-scale irrigation and drainage schemes, on-farm 
irrigation technologies, low-cost pumping systems 
(including solar), the acquisition of agricultural 
machinery and vehicles the construction of modules to 
store agricultural products and the maintenance of 
vehicles, mounting structures, etc. The infrastructure 
to be funded is expected to be small-scale only. The 
overall impact of the project is expected to be positive 
and the foreseen activities are not expected to 
generate significant risk or irreversible adverse 
impacts. As such, based on the available information 
this project has been classified as Category B. 
 
Potential adverse environmental impacts include 
degradation of natural habitat, including forests, 
streams and rivers and health and safety of farmers 
through pesticide mismanagement. The main social 
impacts and risks of the project associated with OP 
4.01 are related to community health and safety, 
particularly in relation to health risks for local 
populations in areas surrounding the agricultural 
projects (including health impacts associated with the 
use of pesticides), as well as labor conditions, 
including those related to the working conditions of 
agricultural employees, including those in the supply 
chains, and the possibility of situations involving child 
and/or forced labor, migrant workers, and potential 
gender exclusion. 
 
To manage the impacts and risks of the project, the 
Borrower will prepare, prior to Appraisal, a Social

Sep 14, 2018 Page 10 of 15  

     

Assessment (SA), with a strategic focus on the 
agricultural sector, with an emphasis on the issues 
mentioned in the previous paragraph, and the 
identification of vulnerable and disadvantaged 
populations, with a gender, ethnic, and generationally 
sensitive approach. The SA will include potential risks 
related to threats to human security through the 
escalation of personal, communal or interstate 
conflict, crime or violence. The SA will build upon the 
SA prepared for the COMRURAL I project in 2007 
(P101209) and for its additional financing (2016). The 
SA will also identify and analyze the main social risks 
identified in the COMRURAL I project and its social 
management measures, incorporating the lessons 
learned in that operation. Agribusiness subproject 
allocation will be demand-driven and that subprojects 
will be selected during implementation. Since the 
specific locations and impacts of the subprojects 
cannot be clearly defined during project preparation, 
the Borrower will prepare an Environmental and Social 
Management Framework (ESMF), in consultation with 
stakeholders, to identify, manage and mitigate 
potential adverse impacts during implementation, and 
guide the preparation of specific EAs, SAs, and ESMPs 
for each of the subprojects to be defined during 
project execution. The ESMF will guide the 
strengthening of elements like a Grievance Redress 
Mechanism, gender strategy, labor influx, and the 
system to track the environmental and social aspects 
in the subprojects. The ESMF will include guidelines 
for the development of labor management procedures 
(to prevent forced and child labor) and community 
health and safety plans for the subprojects. The ESMF 
will also include a screening mechanism to assess the 
environmental and social impacts of the subprojects, 
and will exclude from project funding subprojects 
likely to cause irreversible or significant environmental 
or social impacts (Category A), excluding activities that 
would impact protected areas, key biodiversity areas, 
and other terrestrial and aquatic natural habitats. 
High-risk agribusiness activities, such as palm oil 
plantations, will be also excluded from the program. 
The ESMF will also incorporate criteria for the use of 
water resources, taking the analysis of watersheds in 
the analysis. The ESMF will also include a table of 
mitigation activities, implementation arrangements,

Integrating Innovation for Rural Competitiveness in Honduras - COMRURAL II (P168385) 

 
 

  
Sep 14, 2018 Page 11 of 15  

     

capacity building plan, and a monitoring and 
evaluation framework as well. The ESMF will also 
include a specific section describing the requirements 
for preparing the safeguard aspects of the CERC 
(Component 4), describing the potential emergencies 
and the types of activities likely to be financed and 
providing a preliminary identification of potential risks 
and mitigation measures associated with them, taking 
into account the Bank Guidance on Contingent 
Emergency Response Components. The ESMF will 
include the WBG EHS General Guidelines, and the 
specific Guidelines on Annual Crop Production 
 
The project will also promote the participation of the 
local communities and other relevant stakeholders, 
preparing and implementing a Stakeholder 
Engagement Plan (SEP), to guide the stakeholder 
engagement process throughout preparation and 
implementation, strengthening the existing 
Participation Plan. The SEP will build upon the Social 
Participation Plan prepared for COMRURAL I in 2007. 
The ESMF and SEP will be disclosed and consulted 
prior to appraisal. The disclosure arrangements will 
include virtual disclosure and availability of physical 
copies of such instruments in accessible locations. 

Performance Standards for Private Sector 
Activities OP/BP 4.03 

No 
The project will not finance activities that are 
implemented by a private entity. 

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 Yes 

Project activities will not involve significant loss or 
degradation of natural habitats. In fact, prioritization 
of investments in organic production will enhance 
positive impacts on aquatic habitats, particularly in 
areas that currently have issues with pesticide and 
fertilizer runoff. 
 
Any investment funded under the project will be 
screened for its potential to cause negative impacts to 
natural habitats under the ESMF procedures, including 
critical natural habitats. Any activity likely to cause 
irreversible or significant damages to habitats will be 
excluded from project funding.  

Forests OP/BP 4.36 Yes 

The ESMF will guide assessment of potential impacts 
of the planned productive investments upon forests. It 
will include a negative list of activities/impacts that 
could lead to degradation or conversion of forests to 
exclude them from financing. In general, the project 



 
The World Bank  
Integrating Innovation for Rural Competitiveness in Honduras - COMRURAL II (P168385) 

 
 

  
Sep 14, 2018 Page 12 of 15  

     

promotes use of agroforestry and silvo-pastoral 
practices on already cleared land. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

The project finances agricultural activities expected to 
involve use of different types, quantities and 
management styles of agrochemicals or natural 
products/measures for pest management. The project 
will emphasize Integrated Pest/Crop Management 
through technical assistance. The ESMF will provide 
the necessary initial guidance for related screening 
and good practices. Procurement will screen any 
proposed purchases of agrochemicals to secure 
exclusion of red or yellow label chemicals and those 
prohibited by national regulations. During 
implementation, proposed business plans will be 
assessed in detail and managed based on good IPM 
practices. A Pest Management Plan (PMP) will outline 
the various elements of and actions needed to be 
taken to adequately address concerns during project 
implementation. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 Yes 

Project activities are not expected to involve any 
major civil works. No major movement of earth or 
excavation is anticipated, nor is it expected that 
natural features and landscapes with some level of 
cultural significance might be adversely impacted by 
the project. As such, it is unlikely that known physical 
cultural resources will be impacted. Nevertheless, as a 
precautionary measure, chance finds provisions will be 
included in the ESMF. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 Yes 

Given the presence of Indigenous Peoples such as 
Lenca, Maya- Chortis, Tolupan, Misquito, Pech, 
Tawakas o Sumos located in specific areas of the 
country, as well as afro-descendant communities, and 
considering that agribusiness subprojects will be 
demand-driven and will be selected during 
implementation, an Indigenous Peoples and Afro-
descendants Planning Framework (IPAPF), which will 
be prepared and disclosed as a standalone document, 
will define the guidelines for the development of 
separate procedures to promote the inclusion of 
indigenous communities as beneficiaries of the project 
in more favorable conditions, adapted to their 
sociocultural reality and with provisions to reduce the 
potential impoverishment risks for the indigenous and 
afro-descendant beneficiaries. The IPAPF will build 
upon the Indigenous Peoples Development Plan 
prepared in 2007 for the COMRURAL I project 



 
The World Bank  
Integrating Innovation for Rural Competitiveness in Honduras - COMRURAL II (P168385) 

 
 

  
Sep 14, 2018 Page 13 of 15  

     

(P101209) and for its additional financing prepared in 
2016. The SA to be prepared will include OP 4.10 
requirements specific for IPs and will to inform project 
design and preparation of the IPAPF. The IPAPF will 
define the criteria and procedures for the preparation 
of specific Indigenous Peoples and Afro-descendent 
Plans (IPAP), through open, fair and culturally 
appropriate processes, including free, prior and 
informed consultation processes leading to broad 
community support for the sub-projects. The IPAPs 
will assess the potential impacts to Indigenous Peoples 
and define the necessary mitigation measures, as well 
as provide information on practical ways in which the 
Indigenous Peoples and Afro-descendants can become 
project beneficiaries, and to ensure that they do so in 
a culturally appropriate manner. 
 
Gender considerations will also be addressed so that 
indigenous women and men are able to benefit from 
the project. The IPAPF and IPAPs will also identify 
culturally-specific mechanisms that can be adopted to 
address any grievances that may arise through project 
implementation, as part of the project’s Grievance 
Redress Mechanism. The IPAPF will be prepared, 
disclosed and consulted with Indigenous Peoples 
Organizations at the national and regional levels prior 
to appraisal. 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

Project activities are not likely to involve involuntary 
resettlement. Subproject allocation will be demand-
driven and that subprojects will be selected during 
implementation. Since project locations are not know 
yet, the project will include a Resettlement Policy 
Framework (RPF) to guide the preparation of specific 
Resettlement Action Plans (RAP) or Abbreviated 
Resettlement Plans (ARAP) to address the cases of 
involuntary resettlement and land acquisition if they 
are identified during project execution. The RPF will be 
disclosed and consulted prior to appraisal as a 
standalone document, along with the ESMF 
consultation process. 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 No 
Project activities will not involve dams and project 
activities will not rely on the performance of any dam. 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

TBD 

The locations of Project activities is not yet known so it 
cannot yet be determined if activities will  take place 
in 
international waterways.

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No 
Project activities will not be located or take place in 
disputed areas. If an area were to be in dispute, it 
would not be eligible for financing under the project. 

 
E. Safeguard Preparation Plan  
 
Tentative target date for preparing the Appraisal Stage PID/ISDS 
 
Jan 15, 2019 
 
Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed. The specific studies and 
their timing should be specified in the Appraisal Stage PID/ISDS 
 
Some environmental and social safeguards related studies and management instruments will be prepared during the 

project preparation process (October 2018 - January 2019), while others will be prepared after project approval. The 
safeguards instruments to be prepared alongside the project, and disclosed and consulted before the project’s appraisal 
process has concluded, are the following ones: SA, ESMF, SEP, IPAPF, and RPF. The safeguard instruments to be prepared 
after project appraisal or approval, when the subprojects have been preliminarily defined but before finalizing their 
approval process, are the following ones: SAs and ESMPs for each of the specific subprojects, which will provide the 
necessary information to determine if additional social management instruments, such as PMPs, IPAPs, RAPs or ARAPs, 
will need to be prepared.

Other Decision (as needed) 
 

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 
1. Zambia is a landlocked country in Southern Africa, surrounded by Malawi, Tanzania, Democratic Republic of Congo, 

Namibia, Angola, Botswana, Zimbabwe and Mozambique. It has a surface area of 752,614 km2 and population 

estimated at 17.6 million people that is growing at an annual rate of 3.2%. The country is endowed with rich natural 

resources including minerals, freshwater, forests, wildlife and fertile land. Nearly 56% or 42 million hectares of the 

total land area is arable. The country is also home to globally significant ecosystems and biodiversity. About 40% of 

freshwater resources in the southern African region are found in Zambia alone. Zambia is characterized as a service-

oriented economy with the tertiary sector at 53.7%; Mining (principally copper, emeralds, zinc, lead and cobalt) at 

12.9%; Agriculture; Forestry and Fisheries at 9.9%; and Manufacturing at 7.9%. The 2017 World Bank Zambia 

Economic Brief indicates that Zambia’s national economy experienced domestic pressures in 2015. Economic growth 

fell to 2.9 percent in 2015 and contributed to increased poverty in rural communities. Among the main factors are 

the reduction in the price of copper, El Nino induced lower seasonal harvest, political uncertainty and the power 

crisis which impacted local business operations of all sectors. Economic growth increased to 3.8 percent in 2016 and 

to 3.5 percent in 2017. Economic growth is expected to continue rising with a projected GDP growth of 4.1 percent 

in 2018 and 4.7 percent in 2019. 

 

2. Zambia's economy is heavily dependent on natural resources, particularly mining and increasingly forestry 

resources. Agriculture is largely rain-fed. Rural economies and livelihoods depend almost entirely on renewable 

natural resources i.e. biodiversity, forests, wetlands, fisheries, water, etc. The productive capacity of landscapes 

nation-wide is compromised by various drivers across agriculture, infrastructure development, unsustainable use of 

forest resources, land use, energy and mining activities. These drivers solely or in combination reduce productive 

capacity and resilience of landscapes and undermine ecosystem services, particularly due to the impacts of climate 

variability and climate change.  

 

3. Zambia is endowed with vast forests. These productive landscapes support rural livelihoods and investment 

opportunities that hold potential for national socio-economic development. About 65% of land is covered by 

forests, of which 40% constitutes miombo woodland. The country has an array of protected areas that include 20 

National Parks; 39 Game Management Areas; 432 Forest Reserve; 59 Botanical Reserves; 42 Important Bird Areas; 

and 2 Bird Sanctuaries. The forest lands, therefore, represent the life-line of rural economies and daily subsistence. 

For example, the forest sector currently contributes about 5.2% to the nation’s GDP, and provides formal and 

informal employment to about 1.1 million people in the country. The forest sector is also the greatest contributor to 

carbon emissions (61% of total emissions in 2011). It is a sector, therefore, that holds opportunity to contribute to 



 
The World Bank  
Transforming landscapes for resilience and development in Zambia (P164764) 

 
 

  
July 12, 2018 Page 4 of 16  

     

national reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and for equitable sharing of both carbon and non-carbon benefits 

among stakeholders. However, the forest sector is under increasing pressure. From 2001 to 2017, Zambia lost 2.5 

million hectares or about 6% of total tree cover. This led to the release of 252Mt of carbon into the atmosphere1. 

According to FAO, current annual deforestation in Zambia is 160 000 hectares, which is approximately twice the size 

of New York City. Zambia is among the top ten deforested country’s in the world.  

 

Sectoral and Institutional Context 

4. Zambia has been implementing the World Bank led Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR) aimed at 

strengthening Zambia 's institutional framework for climate resilience (while) improving the adaptive capacity of 

vulnerable communities in selected sub-basins. Investments supported by the Zambia PPCR on the ground include 

participatory adaptation, climate-resilient infrastructure and strategic program support in agriculture, water, 

livestock, fisheries and natural resources and climate information services. Adaptation to climate change is one of 

the nation’s development priorities because the Zambian economy, particularly the rural economy, is highly 

vulnerable to the impacts and effects of climate change. This has become very important because the country has 

already been experiencing frequent droughts, extreme temperatures and dry spells in some parts, and seasonal and 

flash floods in others. Floods and droughts have increased in frequency over the past three decades, costing the 

nation an estimated 0.4% in annual economic growth. These trends are expected to intensify in the future. Based on 

records from 1960 to 2003, the mean annual temperature has increased by 1.3oC. This gives an average of 0.3oC per 

decade. Within the same period, mean rainfall has decreased by an average of 1.9mm/month (2.3%) per decade 

since 1960.  

 

5. Through different land and forest-related policies, the Government seeks to manage productive landscapes to 

enhance forest products and services for improved income generation, poverty reduction, job creation and 

protection and maintenance of biodiversity, and contribute to mitigation of climate change. In the Forest Act 2015, 

the Government has given direction on the new configurations of forests to increase people’s participation in the 

management of forests and forest resources and in their ownership of forest benefits at micro-level. This therefore, 

forms basis for a firm socio-economic and legal engagement in the collective management, including the private 

sector to transform landscapes for resilience and development in Zambia.  

 

6. Zambia is a Party to a number of global Multilateral Environmental Agreements. It is a Party to the three Rio 

Conventions: the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change; the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (UNCBD); 

and the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD). In 2015, Zambia joined the Paris Agreement and 

submitted its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC). As a Party, Zambia is mandated to respond to the 

policy directions and obligations of these Conventions. In this regard, the Government continues to pursue 

development goals that complement efforts from other development partners for socio-economic and 

environmental benefits. To realize the international as well as national development priorities, the Government has 

continued to pursue efforts to establish conducive policy and legislative instruments as well as strategic plans to 

address climate change and other sectoral development challenges. Among the pieces of legislation, the following

constitute a set of important policies that can anchor the development objective of TRALARD to increase the 

ecosystem resilience and productivity within vulnerable landscapes and enhance the disaster related preparedness 

of Zambia: Vision 2030; Seventh National Development Plan (7NDP, 2017); Second National Biodiversity Strategy and 

Action Plan (NBSAP2, 2015); National Policy on Environment (NPE, 2007); National Policy on Climate Change (NPCC, 

2017); National Climate Change Response Strategy (NCCRS, 2012); Zambia National Forest Policy (ZNFP, 2014) and 

Forest Act (2015); National Agriculture Policy (NAP, 2016); Environmental Management Act (EMA, 2011); and the 

National Energy Policy (NEP, 2008) 

 

Relationship to CPF 

 

7. The proposed TRALARD project is aligned with the draft Zambia Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for the period 

FY18-FY21 which puts forward an integrated World Bank, IFC, and MIGA strategy to support Zambia’s development 

through the Seventh National Development Plan (7NDP). The project contributes to the CPF Objective Two on 

Increased resilience to hydrological, climate and environmental shocks and to associated outcomes: a) Local level 

community infrastructure and natural resources management practices reduce impact of hydrological shocks 

(droughts, floods) on livelihoods; b) Climate adaptation support to communities harmonized, institutionalized and 

decentralized; and c) Institutions for environmental governance strengthened. 

 

8. The Government has embraced an integrated approach to development investments at landscape level. This project 

builds on this vision, the CPF and Bank’s experience on climate resilience, particularly through the implementation 

of projects on resilience and adaptation priorities, including i) Zambia Strengthening Climate Resilience (PPCR Phase 

II); ii) Livestock Development Animal and Health Project (LDAHP); iii) Zambia Water Resources Development Project; 

iv) Irrigation Sector Development Project (ISDP); and v) Zambia Integrated Forest Landscape Project (ZIFLP). 

 

C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  

 

9. To improve natural resource management in the northern region of Zambia to support sustainable livelihoods, and 
in the event of an eligible crisis or emergency, to provide immediate and effective response to the eligible crisis or 
emergency. 

 
10. The PDO will be achieved through activities under the following components: (a) Institutional Development and 

Capacity Building for Landscape Restoration and Resilience, (b) Sustainable Landscape Management Practices, (c) 

Infrastructure for Resilience and Market Access, and (d) Project Management, Coordination, and Monitoring. 

Through these components, TRALARD will offer a selection of interrelated activities that can be tailored to the needs 

of participating areas. The project also includes standard Contingency Emergency Response component. 

 
Project beneficiaries and expected outcomes 

 

11. Project beneficiaries include communities increasingly reliant on the exploitation of natural resources due to the 

absence of alternative sources of livelihoods and energy, partially resulting from the lack of sound management and 

planning. Rural communities, including women and children, will have an opportunity to take advantage of diversified

selection of livelihood options based on prudent, environmentally sound natural resource management. Local 

authorities will gain from strengthened institutions and policies and capacity to manage, plan, operate, and enforce 

regulations to achieve both environmental improvement and poverty reduction. Rural and urban communities will 

benefit from reliable and environmentally sound infrastructure that will improve market access and in a broader 

context will promote the creation of new economic opportunities for the region. 

 

Key Results (From PCN) 

 

12. Project activities will be designed to advance and develop three dimensions of the resilience capacity of the 

vulnerable communities: absorptive capacity, adaptive capacity, and transformative capacity. This approach will 

facilitate measuring resilience at project level with Results Framework (RF) indicators being connected to these three 

capacities. In addition, RF will include Predictive Proxy Indicators (PPI) to evaluate the effectiveness of forest related 

interventions, as suggested in the Forest Action Plan2.  

 
13. Key outcome indicators 

 

1. Land area under sustainable landscape management practices (CRI) (ha) 

2. Forest area brought under management plans (CRI) (ha) (intermediate) 

3. Fisheries management plans implemented (CRI) (count of water bodies and/or area) 

4. Diversified livelihoods activities adopted by households (count), of which households headed by women (percent) 

5. Number of households using resilience infrastructure supported by the project (count) 

6. Small scale farmers/producers with improved market access (count), of which households headed by women 

(percent) 

7. Protected Areas approved management plans (count) (intermediate) 

 

Project level and intermediate indicators will be defined in the Project Appraisal Document. 

 

D. Concept Description 

 

14. In the 7th National Development Plan of Zambia for 2017-2021, the Government of Zambia recognizes the need to 

implement measures to reduce poverty through harnessing the potential of Luapula, Muchinga and Northern 

Province in agriculture, forestry, and tourism among other areas, and addressing the challenge of poor infrastructure. 

 

15. Given the complexity of socio-economic, environmental and climate change induced challenges facing the NRZ, 

TRALARD is proposed to bring the northern region to a new level of sustainable management of natural resources 

with expanded options for non natural resource based livelihoods and improved market access. The implementation 

of the program aims to trasform the region into a vibrant ecological and socio-economic system preserving the 

environment, resilient to climate change consequences, and offering communities broader development 

opportunities.

16. TRALARD is focused on addressing the main drivers of environmental degradation, natural resource exploitation and 

persistent poverty. The project aims to contribute to improving the sustainability of poor rural community livelihoods 

in an environment already stressed by climate change impacts and rapid population growth. TRALARD will build on 

the lessons learnt from the successful PPCR currently under implementation in Zambia. For example, PPCR has 

worked with local structures and implementation partners to improve and mainstream climate risk into livelihood 

option decisions, local development planning, and implementation capacity and has gained experience in conducting 

microprojects in the intervention area. This experience informs the design of TRALARD.  

 

17. The examination of economic realities during the fact-finding mission to the NRZ reveals closely interconnected and 

mutually determined processes of natural resources degradation and deepening poverty. For example, declining fish 

stock in Lake Tanganyika and other water bodies forced some fisherman to switch to charcoal burning as an 

alternative source of income. While fish stock still continues to decline due to climate change impacts and increasing 

consumption by the growing population, forests are under increased pressure from the population whose economic 

options are severely limited and alternative sources of energy are absent. Unchecked access to natural resources and 

the lack of enforcement to protect them by authorities invite their unsustainable expolitation. As a result, the poverty 

level in the region is increasing while the natural resource base that those communities rely on is being destroyed.  

 

18. Funding and implementation capacity constraints mean that not all 26 districts will participate in TRALARD in the first 

phase. The selection criteria for districts that will be included in the first phase will include: (i) most vulnerable 

districts based on assessment of poverty and vulnerability maps; (ii) proximity to protected areas; (iii) districts 

bordering Lake Tanganyika; (iv) preparedness and commitment of districts and capacity of implementing 

stakeholders. The number of districts will be determined during preparation.  

 

19. TRALARD aims to improve value chains through greater community and private sector engagement, better market 

information and priority infrastructure. Sustainable resource management requires that environmental benefits are 

strongly linked to improved livelihoods and poverty reduction. The project design promotes greater community and 

private sector participation in sustainable natural resources management as the most direct path to fostering this 

linkage.  

 

20. Contributing to the sustainability aspect of the project, TRALARD intends to facilitate establishing robust mechanisms 

to monitor key environmental, climate and weather parameters, model longer-term challenges, including climate 

change and population growth, and develop measures to address issues in a long-term perspective. 

 

21. The project places emphasis on the adoption of advanced technologies in the natural resource management practices 

and in the measurement, monitoring, and reporting of project impacts. The application of innovative and disruptive 

technologies such as remote sensing, drones, mobile phone and online apps, biotech, water and energy saving 

technologies, will be examined during the preparation stage.  

 
22. The following areas of activities have been determined at the initial preparation stage of the project. These 

components are defined with a view of (a), (b) tackling immediate tasks of reversing degradation through adaptation 



 
The World Bank  
Transforming landscapes for resilience and development in Zambia (P164764) 

 
 

  
July 12, 2018 Page 8 of 16  

     

and alternative livelihoods measures, and (c) improving infrastructure for resilience and facilitating creation of new 

opportunities through more developed market access. 

 

23. Component 1. Institutional Development and Capacity Building for Landscape Restoration and Resilience 

(indicative amount US$8 million) 

The aim of this component is to strengthen government institutions at the national, local and community level to 

develop and implement new approaches for sustainable natural resource management This will be achieved by 

reviewing and updating certain policies, providing better information, and improving the development planning and 

budget process by mainstreaming climate risk and environmental considerations into development plans. This 

component will finance policy and regulatory reviews, province, district and ward level development planning, 

technical assistance (TA), workshops, and trainings.  

 

1.1. Policy and Institutional strengthening and capacity building: This component will support the review of key 

natural resource policies and regulations relating to the forestry and fisheries sector. It will support the 

government to implement the Statutory Instrument NO 11 of 2018 which allows for community management 

for forests. In addition, this component will support policy analysis on the options and alternatives for charcoal 

production, enforcement, and government regulation to license charcoal production. The activities will also 

help development and disseminate a manual on community participatory co-management; as well as the 

establishment of effective interdepartmental structures to organize collaboration at the ecosystem level to 

enhance integrated approaches to natural resource management and coordinated land use planning and 

management. The outputs will focus on: integrated approaches for community mobilization, partnerships for 

sustainable forest landscape restoration (FLR), and targeted studies, for example, on models, resource 

mobilization for sustainable PA management. This will enhance the ability of the government to determine 

sectors that hold greater promise to transform landscapes for resilience and development and scale up 

interventions. 

 

1.2.  Advance the beneficial use of hydro-meteorological information: The project will finance the improvement of 

early warning systems and related institutional systems to improve the resilience of communities to climate 

change impacts. This will include technical assistance to develop a long term strategic plan to strengthen the 

institutions i.e. Zambia Meteorology Department (ZMD), Disaster Management and Mitigation unit(DMMU), 

Water Resources Management Authority (WARMA) etc. responsible for delivering meteorological and 

hydrological information, data management and forecasting systems. This sub-component will introduce the 

concept of using hydro-met information for better decision making and delivery that information to local 

governments and primary producers: (for water resources, landscape management, disaster management, 

agriculture, environment, hydropower utilities, PAs.); (c) priority infrastructure rehabilitation identified in the 

Hydromet Master Plan developed under the World Bank Water Resource project (including hydromet 

infrastructure and related office refurbishment and equipment); and (d) community training, awareness 

campaigns, knowledge on improved climate information use and disseminationto end-users nationaly, with 

specific focus in the Chambeshi-Luapula catchment area.

24. Component 2. Sustainable Landscape Management Practices (indicative amount US$32.5 million) 

The component aims to improve the livelihoods and resilience of rural communities by improving the management 

of the rich natural resources base that rural communities are dependent upon through: (a) ecosystem based 

integrated natural resource management planning; (b) improved management of protected areas and protection of 

environmental services; and (c) diversification and increased sustainability of rural livelihoods.  

 

2.1. Invesment in ecosystem based Integrated Natural Resource Management Planning (INRMP): This activity will 

support the preparation and implementation of INRMP plans in the project targeted area. These plans will be 

based on the assessment of the available natural resources and their conditions, as well as the sustainable 

levels of production. The plans will be done in year one. They will be developed and implemented with the 

involvement of relevant stakeholders, including communities, cooperatives, and local government, and will 

be based on physical, ecological, and socio-economic baseline data. 

 

2.2. Improved Management of Protected Areas (PA) and Reserves: This activity will support the effective and 

sustainable development of the three PA systems in the northern region of Zambia – Lavushi Manda National 

Park, Lusenga Plain National Park and Nsumbu National Park – to preserve the biodiversity and ecosystem 

services for the well-being of people with focus on forest dependent communities and potenital to develop 

tourism opportunities. This support will include: (1) preparation of protected areas management plans; (2) 

capacity assessment of the staff and analysis of the financial resources required to fully protect the protected 

areas; (3) priority park infrastructure such as staff offices and housing nearer to the park; (4) equipment 

including vehicles, GPS, computers; disruptive technology for monitoring animal populations, poaching 

activities; (5) training.  

 

2.3 Strengthen opportunities for primary producers to transform their livelihoods into market based enterprises: 

The main aim of the activity is to identify key challenges, risks and opportunities for transforming livelihoods 

of producers into market based enterprises. The project will provide resources to conduct value chain studies 

(including secondary sources of information) to identify key challenges to market entry and design 

interventions to incentivize smallholder producers to initiate viable enterprises for increasing productivity, 

incomes and resilience to climate change. This component will draw from the lessons learnt during the pilot 

to support primary producers and small business operaters under the Zambia PPCR private sector approcah. 

 
2.4. Sustainable livelihoods: Rural populations in the north are dependent on subsistence agriculture and fishing, 

both of which have seen severe declines in productivity and have increased risk due to climate variablility. 

This activity aims to: increase smallholder production and productivity of diversified value chains; reduce 

farmers risk through insurance and prudent and informed risk taking strategies; improving access to markets; 

and diversifying into alternative livelihoods that are non resource based enterprises. This will be done through 

a program of support which encourages farmers to adopt conservation agriculture practices, promotes 

savings, provides technologies to reduce post harvest loss, establishes rural aggregation centers and linkages 

to buyers and advanced purchase contracts, and persue alternative livelihoods that are non natural resource 

based businesses. The alternative livelihood activities will target women and youths to lifting up the socio-

economic situation particularly of women who use natural resources with inferior financial value compared

to men. The roster of alternative livelihoods will include increased rearing of livestock, agroforestry, 

agroprocessing, aqua culture, fingerlings production, fish processing, feed making for fisheries, bee keeping, 

caterpillars and mushrooms production, and other service industries such as tailoring, hair dressing etc.  

 

25. Component 3: Infrastructure for Resilience and Market Access (indicative amount US$27 million IDA) 

Activities under this component aim at supporting and improving NRZ infrastructure in vulnerable areas that suffers 

from the lack of investments and is additionally adversely impacted by climatic changes. Such impacts include drastic 

changes in rain patterns resulting in floods and droughts, shortages in water, changes in wind patterns, lack of 

passable roads and damaged bridges leaving entire communities cut off from the basic services and goods during 

floods where durations are becoming extended. This increases the likelihood of lack of water and nutrition, diseases, 

livestock loss etc. In addition, this component will help identify ways to improve market access for primary producers 

who often lack opportunities and/or knowledge on the ways to make their produce accessible to the market. 

 

3.1.  Investments in resilience strengthening infrastructure: identify in concert with stakeholders the most sensitive 

pieces of small-scale infrastructure in the most vulnerable areas that require prompt investments. 

Infrastructure is the backbone of well-being and safety of people and its reliability and even presence in such 

poorly serviced regions is central to communities’ resilience. Potentially, they include (a) feeder roads, 

bridges, culverts, (b) water harvesting structures (check and sand dams, earthen bunds, solar-powered 

irrigation), and (c) traditional and alternative energy sources.  

 

3.2. Examining opportunities for restoration of traditional canals: conduct feasibility study on possible restoration 

of traditional canals in the North. Traditional canals in Zambia play multiple roles: transportation, water body, 

fish harvesting, and traditional ceremonies. The canals in the North are in a state of disrepair after decades of 

no investment or maintenance, yet their potential for transportation and commerce remains high. This sub-

component will draw from the experience acquired from similar successful operations under the PPCR in the 

Barotse sub-region.  

 
3.3. Facilitated access to markets: determine ways and forms to support producers in establishing access to 

markets. Jointly with stakeholders, including producers, authorities, private companies and consumers, the 

project will examine constraints and bottlenecks in establishing connection between products and markets 

and suggest measures to address them. It is not an uncommon situation when farmers’ produce – mangos, 

oranges – goes to waste because farmers have no ability to deliver their products to potential consumers. This 

inability undermines income and negatively affects resilience of producers.  

 

26. Component 4: Contingency Emergency Response Component (CERC) (Standardized)  

This contingency component can be triggered by a joint Government and World Bank agreement in case of an 

emergency. This component had been embedded in the project to finance early recovery and/or specific emergency 

works, goods, and services, in case of eligible emergencies/crises/disaster caused by natural or man-made hazard 

including public health crisis. The mechanism is designed to support enhancement of preparedness, early recovery 

activities, and provision of rapid response to disaster that can be implemented in a relatively short period. This 

component was considered necessary because of the inherent in Zambia’s current socioeconomic and climate related 



 
The World Bank  
Transforming landscapes for resilience and development in Zambia (P164764) 

 
 

  
July 12, 2018 Page 11 of 16  

     

hazards (unexpected flooding or drought, an aggravation of the state of fragility, as a result of influx of large groups 

of displaced people ( cross boarder and internal displacements) could potentially shift priorities. Reallocation of funds 

to CERC can only be done when there is a serious disruption of the functioning of a community or society causing 

widespread human, economic, or environmental losses that exceed the ability of the affected community or society 

to cope using its own resources. Following such a disaster event where both the region and national resources cannot 

sufficiently and adequately address the situation, the Government of the Republic of Zambia (GRZ) may trigger 

activation of CERC according to national law and subject to the World Bank’s activation policy.  

 

27. Component 5: Project Management, Coordination, and Monitoring (US$7.5 million IDA) 

This component will finance TA, works, goods, workshops, and operational costs to support the project’s day-to-day 

implementation and management, including procurement, FM, environmental and social safeguards, and 

preparation of annual work plans and organization of audit reports. The component also includes the design and 

implementation of a communication strategy to report on the project results and to raise awareness about land 

degradation, restoration and climate change impacts, vulnerability, and adaptation. It also supports the M&E system 

to report on the expected project’s results (disaggregating by gender, where appropriate) and systematizes the 

project’s lessons learned. The component also finances impact evaluation to assess project’s impacts on specific 

elements such as adopted livelihoods.  

  

  SAFEGUARDS 

 
A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 

 
The project covers the Northern region of Zambia (NRZ), which includes Luapula, Northern, and Muchinga provinces. This 

area has vast coverage of pristine Miombo forest, four national parks, four lakes, water falls and many rivers. They lie in 
the third agro ecological zone with the annual rainfall of about 1200 mm. NRZ encompasses over 35% of managed lands 
which contribute to protecting and maintaining large intact natural landscapes. The region is endowed with natural 
resources that include rich biodiversity and half of the wetlands of international importance listed under the Ramsar 
Convention. These wetlands contain habitats for several important fauna and flora species, are a natural flood controller 
and important for groundwater recharge. The natural resources in the area also represent a life-line for rural economies 
and daily subsistence.  
 
The provinces are home to over 3.5 million people with record high levels of poverty 81% (Luapula), 79% (Northern) and 

69% (Muchinga). The main economic stay for the people of this area is agriculture due to the availability of arable land, 
abundant water bodies and good annual rainfall. The area has experienced vulnerabilities due to climate variability and 
human related activities posing a challenge to conserving natural resources. Factors contributing to vulnerabilities include 
forest lands under threat from human encroachment for settlement and growing food insecurities due to population 
growth. Increased mining activities result in growing demand for energy met through heightened production of charcoal 
and logging. An estimated 16,000,000 hectares out of 21,423,600 hectares total land (75%) is under threat of degradation 
from these activities.. 
 
B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 

 
The PPCR PIU under Ministry of National Planning and Development has implemented and monitored safeguard 



 
The World Bank  
Transforming landscapes for resilience and development in Zambia (P164764) 

 
 

  
July 12, 2018 Page 12 of 16  

     

compliance in accordance with Bank policies. The project performance has been rated satisfactory, while the risk has 
been moderate. The PIU has a dedicated Safeguard Specialist who is supported by Community Adaptation Specialists in 
each district. The PIU has gained substantial experience with Bank funded projects through their active participation in 
the design and preparation of the Forest Investment Project, Displaced Person's and Border Communities, and the 
Zambia Integrated Forest Landscape Project (ZIFLP). The PIU played a pivotal role in setting up the ZIFLP PIU which is now 
operational. 
  
Given the PIU's involvement in design, preparation and implementation of climate resilient projects, the PIU is being 

transformed into a national coordinating unit that will assume a supervisory role in monitoring implementation of the 
TRALARD project at the national level.To fulfill  this new role, more experts (including Environmental and Social) will be 
recruited to strengthen their capacity to manage environmental and social risks.  
 
For the implementation of the TRALARD project, three PIUs will be established at provincial level (i.e. one for each target 

province). The staffing structure will include Environmental and Social experts as key personnel. These will collaborate 
with District officials that will be assigned to the project. Working through existing district structures will enhance project 
ownership and contribute to sustaining project investment. However, this being the initial engagement with Provincial 
and District counterparts in the 3 provinces, a capacity assessment will be undertaken as part of project preparation. 
Results on the assessment will feed into the a capacity building plan that will be developed for the project.

D. Policies that might apply 

 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

The  policy on environmental assessment has been 
triggered as the proposed  TRALARD project will 
involve infrastructural works. The  infrastructural 
works are envisaged to be undertaken under 
component  2 and 3 of the project. Component 2: of 
the project will involve the promotion of sustainable 
landscape management practices and this will 
incorporate the improved management of protected 
areas  and reserves. Lavushi Manda , Lusenga Plain 
and Nsumbu National Parks and their buffer Game 
Management Areas (GMA's) have been identified as 
potential beneficiary parks. The project will support 
the construction and rehabilitation of  infrastructure 
such as, park structures, staff offices and their housing 
in the vicinity  of the parks. Component 3: of the 
project will involve the investment in infrastructure for 
resilience and market access. Investments will focus 
on the  sensitive pieces of small-scale infrastructure in 
the most vulnerable areas that require urgent

attention. These will include  the periodic 
maintenance of  feeder roads (existing dirt or gravel 
roads) and support structures such as small access 
bridges and placement of culvert,  water harvesting 
structures (check and sand dams, earthen bunds, 
solar-powered irrigation), and the restoration of 
existing traditional canals.  
 
Since the project is at concept stage,  the scope and 
beneficiary areas have not yet been fully defined, an 
ESMF and  associated RPF is currently under 
preparation to assess potential safeguards 
risks/impacts associated with project activities and 
subprojects.In addition, line with the Bank's guidance 
on Contingent Emergency Response 
Components(CERC); Component 4 (CERC): This 
Component requires that the ESMF includes specific 
section (or a CERC-specific ESMF) describing the 
potential emergencies and the types of activities likely 
to be financed, and provide a preliminary evaluation 
of potential risks and mitigation measures associated 
with them. The ESMF will ensure to include a section 
addressing the CERC guideline. Once finalized, ESMF 
will be formally cleared by the Bank and disclosed at 
national level and on the Bank’s website.   
 
 
Furthermore, a Strategic Environmental and Social 
Assessment (SESA) covering 4 out of 10 provinces was 
conducted under a similar project,  PPCR in 2013. 
Since the  proposed TRALARD beneficiary areas were 
excluded in the initial assessment. The SESA will be 
updated to include Northern, Luapula and Muchinga 
provinces. For the benefit of future project, expanding 
the scope to cover the entire country will be 
considered. It is anticipated that TRALARD project will 
benefit from the findings of the SESA which will be 
incorporated in the development of INRM Plans and 
PA Management Plan.

Luapula, Northern and Muchinga Provinces where 
there is no presence of Indigenous Peoples as defined 
by Bank Policy. 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

Policy on Involuntary Resettlement has been 
triggered. This will apply to selected project activities 
which may result in land acquisition for the 
establishment of priority infrastructure to support 
local tourist operators. A RPF will be prepared in 
consultation with key stakeholders. The RPF will guide 
preparation of the RAP to address physical and 
economic impacts that may arise from project 
implementation. 
Luapula, Muchinga and Northern provinces are 
endowed with forests and national parks where

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 
 

1. Over the past decade, the expansion of export-oriented agriculture production has significantly contributed to 
GDP growth and poverty alleviation. During the period 2004 and 2016, Paraguay’s average growth was 4.7 percent per 
year, with high volatility. Key drivers of growth were the agriculture and hydroelectric power sectors. Crops alone 
contributed to one-quarter of total growth, with expanded agriculture (comprising backward and forward linkages) 
contributing a higher share to overall GDP growth. Agricultural products constitute the bulk of Paraguay’s exports. There 
is a strong duality in the sector with a significant share comprised of a lagging subsistence farming component, but in 
parallel there is a vibrant and substantial commercially-oriented agricultural industry segment (individuals, cooperatives 
and corporations), which engage in value chains such as soybean and meat. Capitalized agriculture uses about 70 
percent of the country’s productive area. Since 2003, the boom in export-oriented production has contributed to a 
significant fall of national poverty rates: 45 to 20 percent in urban areas, and 58 to 36 percent in rural areas. These 
prosperous years have also resulted in an increase in income for the bottom 40 percent and in the expansion of the 
middle class, which currently comprises 38 percent of Paraguay’s population.    
 
2. However, a large rural population accompanied by extensive rural poverty are among the salient features of 
Paraguay. In 2017 Paraguay’s population was estimated at 7 million inhabitants, with 40 percent of the population –
roughly 2.8 million-- living in rural areas. This represents the highest percentage of rural population of any country in 
South America, and among the highest in all of Latin America. About 97 percent of Paraguay’s population live in the 
Eastern Region, roughly 40 percent of the total territory, whereas only 3 percent of the population reside in the Western 
Region (Chaco). Most of the total poor live in rural areas, with a fair share engaging in agriculture-related activities, with 
informality as the hallmark.   
 
3. To build on the gains during the past decade in terms of growth and poverty alleviation, Paraguay must focus 
on creating sustainable economic opportunities for the poor and vulnerable population. Approximately 60 percent of 
Paraguay’s population are considered either poor or vulnerable, that is, they are at risk of falling back into poverty. 
Indigenous peoples, slightly under 116,000 inhabitants –a 2 percent of the total Paraguayan population, are one of the 
most vulnerable population groups. Indigenous peoples are essentially rural and have very limited access to basic 
infrastructure and services. For instance, not more than 6 percent of indigenous households are connected to a supply 
system of potable water. Among indigenous groups, monolingual Guaraní speakers are particularly disadvantaged. 
Another important vulnerable group is made up of subsistence producers and small or medium-sized producers in 
transition to commercial schemes. This group forms the end of a spectrum of farmers, which as noted above, at the 



 
The World Bank  
Productive Alliances Project (P168153) 

 
 

  
Oct 29, 2018 Page 4 of 12  

     

other end, includes the highly capitalized farmers and corporations. This group of producers who are primarily poor and 
vulnerable, comprise at least 200,000 households; they are particularly affected by the lack of access to markets, 
finance, technology, land, human capital, and connectivity, and are harshly impacted by extreme weather events and 
the risks posed by climate change. They have not succeeded in keeping up with the pace of modernization of Paraguay’s 
agriculture, led by the large farmers and corporations. A third group that is considered vulnerable is the youth. Half of 
the young people that neither study nor work reside in rural areas, with many of them performing unpaid family labor in 
agriculture-based activities gender. Despite the progress made in Paraguay in recent years, creating economic 
opportunities for these groups is an unfinished agenda. Efforts must focus on improving incomes and reducing 
vulnerability through creating conditions to enable opportunities for self-employment and access to jobs, which are 
indispensable for reducing poverty in Paraguay.    
 
4. Paraguay enjoys many innate advantages which provide it with a great potential for driving pro-poor growth 
through the development of a resilient and responsible agro-industrial sector.  To do so however, it must overcome 
the inter-linked challenges of creating economic opportunities while conserving its natural endowments and 
improving resilience to climate change. Recent growth in Paraguay has taken a toll on its natural resource base. For 
example, logging and clearing land for crops, cattle ranching, and charcoal/biomass have resulted in extensive forest 
degradation and deforestation.  Combined with lack of planning around soil and water resources management, this is 
contributing to increasing the vulnerability to extreme weather events. It is critical that the expansion of agro-industrial 
productive activities and the creation of jobs go hand in hand with sound management of Paraguay’s rich natural capital 
comprising, fertile soils, abundant water, and pastures and forest resources; in addition, the enhancement of its capacity 
to develop and implement a strategy for integrated management of climate change risks are all keys to securing the 
basis of long term growth and development for the generations to come.      
 
 

Sectoral and Institutional Context 
 

5. The bulk of the rural poor and vulnerable population, a good part of which are indigenous peoples, rely on 
agriculture to make a living. In 2017, 76 percent of households in rural areas were engaged in family farming or small, 
informal agri-based activities, individually or in an organized way. If looking only at indigenous peoples, 71 percent of 
households rely on agriculture along with forestry, hunting and freshwater fishing. The impressive growth of capitalized 
agriculture has not translated into significant benefits for smallholders, who are left far behind in terms of per capita 
income and other socio-economic indicators, even when compared to rural households that do not rely on agriculture.  
Such subsistence and transition producers tend to combine agriculture with multiple sources of income such as off-farm 
labor, migration and remittances as a coping mechanism; but, on-farm production and associate income constitutes a 
key source of income which is critical for overall sustenance of these households. In addition, their capacity to mitigate 
against and adapt to climate risks is extremely limited. In 2011 agricultural households in rural areas were found to be 
more than twice as likely to report a negative shock than non-agricultural households. Exposure to climate or other 
shocks can push vulnerable households back to or further into poverty since the economic gains in years with good sales 
can be drawn down with just one season of severe drought .   
 
6. Global experience demonstrates that building resilience against natural disasters and climate change, 
integrating value addition opportunities and removal of barriers to accessing markets for agriculture creates 
economic opportunities for the rural poor and vulnerable population. Recent evidence in Paraguay confirms that 
vulnerable rural inhabitants can lift themselves out of poverty and begin to prosper when they receive assistance in 
accessing markets and technology. It is the case of about 25,000 households who have benefited from the Sustainable 
Rural Development Project (PRODERS, P088799 ). By selling their surpluses in open-air markets or through farm-gate

Productive Alliances Project (P168153)

intermediaries, subsistence and transition producers have significantly enhanced their agricultural earnings and half of 
them were able to rise above the poverty threshold, according to the measurement of June 2018 in relation to the 
baseline.   
 
7. There is untapped potential to enhance outcomes through linkages with formal supply chains, to enable 
transition of subsistence and transition producers toward greater value addition. Paraguay’s food system has formal 
supply chains with larger potential, such as organic yerba mate for export, horticulture for supermarket, and nutrition-
rich grains and beans as inputs for processed foods. Empirical experience in Paraguay indicates, however, that multiple 
barriers prevent rural producers from becoming providers in more modern chains, especially due to the lack of critical 
assets, infrastructure, knowhow and/or organization. In this regard, women find it particularly difficult to access 
financial services and technology. Only 30 percent of the credits issued by the Enabling Agricultural Credit Office (in 
Spanish “Crédito Agrícola de Habilitación”) and 5 percent in the case of the Livestock Fund (in Spanish “Fondo 
Ganadero”) are assigned to women . It is almost universally challenging for smallholders to meet demand requirements, 
including supplying consistent quantities of quality goods that comply with sanitary and phytosanitary standards and are 
delivered on time.     
 
8. Fostering sustainable and inclusive value chain integration has become a priority for the current 
administration. The National Development Plan of Paraguay (2014-2030) seeks to shift the overarching orientation of 
the national economy towards a knowledge-based approach, with diversified and competitive sectors, and increased 
technology adoption. Creating opportunities for the most vulnerable population groups and reducing inequalities are 
essential elements of the Plan. Building on the same in 2016, Paraguay submitted its Intended Nationally Determined 
Contribution (INDC) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Paraguay’s INDC identifies 
agriculture, forestry, land use and land use change as strategic sectors for adaptation and mitigation actions. More 
recently, the administration of President Abdo, who took office in August 2018, has committed to take family farming to 
the next level. To do so, the Government is promoting technology adoption and long-lasting linkages with competitive 
markets, so that producers improve their income in the short and medium-term and acquire economic and climate 
resilience in the long term.   
 
9. The sectoral agenda is led by the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Production in partnerships with its 
decentralized institutions. The Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Production (MAL) focuses on producers, for whom 
agriculture represents a critical source of income (see beneficiaries for a more specific classification). It is responsible for 
the sectorial policy and is at the helm of a set of decentralized sectoral institutions such as the Paraguayan Institute for 
Agricultural Technology (IPTA,: in Spanish “Instituto Paraguayo de Tecnología Agraria”), the National Service for Quality 
and Safety in Vegetables and Seeds (SENAVE: in Spanish “Servicio Nacional de Calidad y Sanidad Vegetal y de Semillas”), 
and  National Service for Animal Quality and Health (SENACSA, for “Servicio Nacional de Calidad y Salud Animal”), and 
the aforementioned Enabling Agricultural Credit Office. To fulfill its mandate, the MAL not only formulates the national 
policy, but also carries out projects at the grassroot level with finance of the International Fund for Agriculture and the 
Interamerican Bank for Development.   
 
 

Relationship to CPF 
 
 
10. The Concept Note has been drafted at the time of preparation of the Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for 
the period FY19-23. By appraisal of the project, the CPF will have been approved by the World Bank Board of Directors.

11. The Strategic Country Diagnostic (SCD) completed in June 2018 flagged the following three structural challenges 
for Paraguay: (i) concentration of inputs, production, exports, income and political influence; (ii) informality of 
production, labor, land and trade; and (iii) inefficient provision of public services. To address them in the CPF, the SCD 
proposed four policy priority areas: (i) accountable institutions, the rule of law, and business environment; (ii) quality of 
public services; (iii) natural wealth management; and (iv) human capital. The proposed project is mainly aligned with 
policy areas (i) and (ii). 
 
C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  

 
To enhance access to markets and adoption of climate risk management approaches by project beneficiaries in a 
sustainable manner.

D. Concept Description 

 
12. The project will contribute to creating long-term economic opportunities for the rural poor and vulnerable 
population by applying a two-fold approach: i) intervene at the grass-roots level via capacity building and subprojects 
(components 1a and 2a/b) focused on improving access to markets and resilience to extreme weather events and 
climate change; and ii) improve critical institutions, systems, and infrastructure (component 1b and 2c). In the short and 
medium term, the project will put into operation an inclusive agribusiness model: productive alliances. Producers will 
enhance their income-generating capacity by becoming more engaged in business activities, while incorporating more 
climate resilient technologies and approaches. In the long term the project will spark the creation of both on-farm and 
off-farms jobs and strengthen resilience.    
 
13. The project will have national coverage. Because Paraguay is a diverse country, activities will be tailored to fit 
the diverse ecological and productive contexts. Prioritization criteria for specific activities will be determined.  
 
14. Project beneficiaries will include the following categories:  
- rural indigenous communities; afro-descendants. Participation by women and youth will also be prioritized 
- organized rural smallholder producers from any of the following categories used for family farming policies in 
Paraguay: subsistence, transitional or capitalized producers, 
- producer cooperatives, small- and medium-sized agro-entrepreneurs, and other partner institutions; 
- and selected public institutions.  
Based on the experience of comparable interventions in Paraguay and other countries and counting a household as a

single beneficiary once it receives any type of support, the project will benefit over 30,000 poor and vulnerable rural 
households, with the target figures for both women-headed households and young producers to be determined later. 
Beneficiaries of investment support will be selected on a competitive basis (see component 2) and using screening 
mechanisms that ensure that the benefits reach the poor and vulnerable groups. This operation will adopt a customized 
approach to targeting indigenous peoples and afro-descendants, drawing upon the experience of PRODERS. 
Beneficiaries of PRODERS will be eligible for this project, provided they meet the specific criteria for each type of 
support.  
 
15. Four critical changes will distinguish this project from PRODERS: (i) promoting activities that ultimately help the 
beneficiaries profit from business opportunities –this project will take up where PRODERS left off in terms of promoting 
market access ; (ii) including calls for proposals and co-financing schemes (with counterpart contributions mainly in cash) 
for subproject investments to strengthen ‘buy in’ and sustainability of investments; (iii) capitalizing on the capacity and 
engagement of a larger spectrum of partners (alliances at various levels); and (iv) integrating a risk management 
approach across the board in order to minimize the shocks of extreme climate events, while investing in resilience 
against climate change and enhance the sustainability of project outcomes.  
 
16. The project will address the gender gaps that are critical to attaining the PDO, namely (i) increasing women’s 
access to resources and technology; (ii) strengthening the earning-generating capacity of women; and (iii) fostering the 
participation of women in critical institutions.   
 
17. The project will mobilize private capital in multiple ways in line with the Maximizing-Finance-for-
Development Agenda. Besides the inclusion of counterpart co-financing in all types of subprojects, the project will 
promote access to credit for smallholder producers by providing technical assistance to beneficiaries and financial 
institutions. Credit to small agricultural businesses is often considered risky and poorly profitable for financial 
institutions. By linking productive alliances that have been successfully implemented to commercial banks that can 
continue financing their business plans, the project will contribute to reducing the risk exposure of private financial 
institutions. With this experience, conditions can be put in place to removing barriers to crowding in private sector 
finance for small rural entrepreneurs. 
 
Component 1: Capacity building (approximately US$ 20 million IBRD loan) 
 
18. This component will address the need to build both human capital of targeted communities and producer 
organizations (1a), and to improve critical factors (1b), in order to facilitate access to markets and integration with 
formal and lucrative value chains. It will fund workshops, courses, field days, study trips, and public events. In addition, 
the subcomponent will finance the provision of expert assistance, as needed, such as lawyers and the preparation and 
dissemination of printed and audiovisual education material. 
 
1a Strengthening human capital of targeted communities and strengthening producer organizations  
19. This subcomponent will help remove barriers that prevent potential beneficiaries, in particular indigenous 
peoples and Afro-descendants, from taking advantage of investment opportunities. Furthermore, it will strengthen 
organizations that have already made investments, so that they are more sustainable. 
 
20. Assistance will cover areas such as legal issues during the formalization of land titles in indigenous communities 
or pending formal registration of the organization, technical and operational know how around select value chains, as 
well as management capabilities such as financial literacy, with an emphasis on understanding barriers to credit access 
notably for women and women’s organizations; creating and administering revolving funds; and monitoring and 



 
The World Bank  
Productive Alliances Project (P168153) 

 
 

  
Oct 29, 2018 Page 8 of 12  

     

assessing results of investments.   
 
21. Moreover, under this subcomponent, the project will disseminate calls for proposals among potential 
beneficiaries and provide technical assistance to the organizations for preparing the detailed proposals for investments, 
as described in component 2.    
 
1b Strengthening critical institutions and systems  
 
22. This subcomponent will focus on strengthening the institutions and systems that are pivotal to promoting access 
to markets, including a risk management and sustainability perspective as well as a gender angle. By doing so, the 
project will contribute to creating a conducive environment for improved partnerships between organized producers 
and firms. 
 
23. Attention will be paid to improving the capabilities of the MAL to provide the sector with updated risk-related 
information and services that mitigate and/or transfer risk. This includes existing climate information services, forecast 
models, and weather insurance, which will cover both indemnity-based and parametric/index-based insurance. The 
ministerial Risk Management Unit will lead these activities.   
 
24. Furthermore, the MAL and its dependent institutions will improve their ability to support productive integration 
in strategic value chains; for instance, studies and technical assistance will be undertaken to identify key constraints as 
well as policy and systems reforms and financing requirements to enhance Paraguay’s capabilities in terms of 
strengthened traceability systems and food quality governance for select (prioritized) value chains will be undertaken.  
Actionable roadmaps for implementing the salient recommendations would be developed under the project.   
 
25. In addition, the component will strengthen the existing ministerial centers that serve to collect, store, and sell 
products for associated farmers (CECOPROA: its name in Spanish “Centros de Comercialización para Productores 
Asociados”), and replicate the model in at least two additional locations. In this regard, alternatives for crowding-in 
private financing for building and managing the centers will be analyzed. 
 
26. Finally, the subcomponent will provide support to private firms, with a focus on small- and medium-sized 
enterprises, to put Supplier Development Programs into operation. These efforts will be complemented by advisory 
services provided by the International Finance Corporation to its client firms in selected value chains. The project will 
also examine the possibility to work with select private commercial banks in understanding and where feasible, helping 
address barriers to formal financing by producers (especially, women, subsistence, small or even medium-sized entities).   
 
Component 2: Investments to foster market access (approximately US$ 70 million IBRD loan, US$ 20 million 
counterpart funding from communities, organizations, and municipalities) 
 
27. Component 2 will provide matching grants to beneficiaries (organizations and institutions) to carry out 
investment subprojects (productive partnerships, 2a)) complemented by two sets of investments in innovation 
subprojects and small infrastructure works, 2b and 2c.  
 
28. Investment support under component 2 will be mainly granted on a competitive basis following calls for 
proposals. Special focus will be paid to promoting access to matching grants for afro-descendants, women farmers and 
young people. Clear beneficiary profiles and categories, as well as the criteria and process for selection will be 
elaborated during preparation.  A key consideration will be households and individuals that benefit under component 1 



 
The World Bank  
Productive Alliances Project (P168153) 

 
 

  
Oct 29, 2018 Page 9 of 12  

     

in terms of capacity building and technical assistance will be able to apply for investments under component 2.  
Different levels of counterpart contribution will be established based on categories of beneficiaries. The experience in 
multiple alliance projects in the region shows that providing counterpart co-financing in cash can help generate buy-in 
and ownership and contribute to more sustainable outcomes.  This finding will be applied appropriately during project 
design.  
29. The project will stimulate the access to financial services that can provide funds for subproject implementation 
and/or continue supporting the alliances once the project ends. To narrow the gender gap regarding access to credit for 
women, the project will include tailored training for women and provide additional support for women-led businesses.  
Similar attention will also be paid to participating afro-descendants and youth.    
 
2a Productive partnerships 
 
30. Indigenous and afro-descendent communities and producer organizations will be supported in establishing 
partnerships with purchasers and preparing business plans that aim to meet the purchasers’ requirements in terms of 
product type, quantity, and quality. These business plans will determine the investments needed either on-farm or off-
farm as collective assets, as well as the technical or administrative assistance.  
 
31. Since the project aims for all subprojects to incorporate climate-smart features to enhance their resilience to 
natural disasters and climate change, beneficiaries will be encouraged to incorporate climate risk management 
practices, such as small-scale water harvesting and irrigation schemes, soil management or other improved on- and off-
farm practices into their business plans, and adopt technologies that, besides boosting yields, are climate-smart and 
environmentally sound.  
 
32. Purchasers will include the following domestic public and private and potentially international actors: public 
institutions, such as schools, the military and hospitals, and businesses, such as supermarkets or agri-processors, with a 
focus on formal supply chains in dynamic markets. 
 
33. The scheme will finance subprojects with agricultural and livestock products, forestry products, such as yerba 
mate, aquaculture, and rural and ecosystem-based services, including agritourism. It will also support partnerships for 
both primary and processed products. The subcomponent will promote the participation of women in the organizations 
and provide customized assistance to women-led alliances. Attention will also be paid to Afro-descendants and youth.  
 
2b Complementary innovation subprojects 
 
34. Indigenous communities and producer organizations will partner with public or private institutions to carry out 
investment subprojects that aim to pilot, disseminate and adopt innovative technologies, and also to move downstream 
along value chains by piloting new processing techniques, products/product development and agro-industry based 
services. These investments seek to stimulate the sector to go beyond traditional agricultural schemes and introduce 
new products, concepts and activities that can translate into better access to lucrative markets and higher economic 
benefits in the medium term. Groups of alliances supported under subcomponent 2a will be eligible to this type of 
support to expand the adoption of technologies such as improved genetic plant varieties at a more regional level.  
 
35. Technologies and practices refer, for instance, to innovative integrated landscape approaches for agricultural 
products, drought-tolerant and disease-resistant plant varieties, integrated agro-forestry or pastoral-forestry systems, 
information and communication technologies, and new (green) business models, all of them with either promising or 
demonstrated benefits. Incentives will be provided for subprojects led by women, afro-descendants and young

producers.  
 
2c Complementary small infrastructure subprojects 
 
36. Municipalities will partner with the MAL to carry out small infrastructure works that are critical to facilitating 
agro-logistics and access to markets for communities and organizations, such as basic market/fair structures and spaces 
and storage facilities. The project will support analytical work to examine the opportunity to establish more 
sophisticated public-private investments in needed infrastructure such as wholesale markets, cold chains and processing 
plants.  
 
Component 3: Project Coordination, Monitoring and Evaluation (approximately US$ 10 million IBRD loan) 
 
37. This component will provide support to the MAL for project coordination and management; monitoring, results 
evaluation, and assessment of project activities; project fiduciary administration, internal controls, and audits; project 
environmental and social risk management following the new Environment and Social Framework; a citizen engagement 
mechanism and a grievance redress mechanism; and project-related studies. In addition, this component will finance the 
strengthening of cross-cutting areas in the MAL, such as financial management and results-based monitoring. It will fund 
consultants, goods and services need to perform the activities.

Summary of Screening of Environmental and Social Risks and Impacts 

A baseline environmental and social risks and impacts assessment (ESA) will be conducted under ESS1 at a 
framework level to verify the necessary scope of addressing ESS2-8. ESS2-4 and 6 will require close attention, 
given several related and critical challenges that include e.g. securing sound labor conditions and considering 
potential use of child labor, efficient use of living natural resources and all materials, consideration adaptation 
to increased climate variability and change and minimizing GHG emissions, sustained provision of ecosystem 
services, prevention of further expansion of the agricultural frontier, contamination and/or overexploitation 
of water resources, and promotion of biodiversity-friendly productive systems. ESS7 will require careful 
consideration during project preparation and implementation since the prevalence of indigenous and afro-
descendant communities will be a substantial criterion for the selection of subprojects. Based on the lessons 
learned in PRODERS, the project will adopt a customized approach to targeting Indigenous Peoples (IP, see 
ESS7 for more details) and the approach will be broadened to afro-descendant communities. ESS9 is the only 
ESS that is not expected to have relevance for the project, yet the institutional arrangements for matching 
grants/revolving funds remain to be determined. Due implementation of ESS10 will be critical to promote 
broad and transparent participation of project-affected and other interested parties and to prevent elite 
capture.

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 
 

1. The collapse of global oil prices caused a fiscal and economic crisis in 2016 and 2017. Low oil prices left Chad’s 
external debt unsustainable and threw the economy into deep recession. Falling revenues, together with the obligation 

to service an oil collateralized commercial loan, rendered the government illiquid. In fact, more than 80 percent of oil 
revenues were used to directly service debt owed to Glencore, with only about 15 percent entering treasury accounts in

cash terms. Real GDP contracted by 6.3 percent in 2016 and 3 percent in 2017, opening a large negative output gap. This 
was reflected in a sharp drop in CPI inflation from 3.7 percent in 2015 to -1.1. percent in 2016, and 0.2 percent in 2017.  

2. In response to the oil price shock, the government had to pursue severe fiscal consolidation. In early 2016, the 
authorities introduced cash-based budgeting and adopted an Emergency Fiscal Plan aimed at mitigating the short-term 
impact of the crisis. Significant expenditure cuts led to a fall in the non-oil primary deficit from 9.7 percent of non-oil GDP 
at end-2015 to 3.8 percent at end-2017, while the overall fiscal deficit (cash basis) was contained at 2.5 percent of non-oil 
GDP in 2017. In 2018, the overall fiscal balance is estimated to be at -0.6 percent of non-oil GDP. Domestically financed 
public investment took a major hit and dropped from 9.8 percent of non-oil GDP in 2014 to 0.7 percent in 2017, while 
recurrent spending dropped from 16.6 percent to 13.7 percent and arrears accumulated. 

3. To return to fiscal and debt sustainability, commercial debt restructuring as well as strong external budget support 
were necessary. An important challenge has been to close an original financing gap of US$1.222 billion in 2017 and 2018. 
Following almost a year of negotiation, Chad and Glencore signed a final debt restructuring agreement in June 2018, notably 
linking debt service to oil revenues through a dynamic cash sweep mechanism. This arrangement reduces the debt service 
to revenue ratio, mitigates the fiscal risk of oil price volatility, reduces the financing gap and returns Chad to a sustainable 
debt path. Furthermore, authorities have financed part of the deficit by issuing bonds in the regional market, however, banks 
have approached their regulatory limits on Chadian Government securities. Ultimately, Chad’s development partners have 
provided budget support requiring the Government to adhere to the rules and mechanisms as agreed for the restructuring 
of its commercial debt while further rationalizing public financial management (PFM) and tightening expenditure controls. 

4. Despite fiscal stabilization translating into gradual recovery, years of recession and austerity have constrained 
social welfare and poverty-reduction.1   Real GDP expected to grow at an estimated 2.6 percent in 2018, largely supported 
by increases in oil prices and oil production. In the non-oil economy, favorable weather conditions and the privatization 
of the cotton public enterprise are expected to improve the agriculture sector’s contribution to (non-oil) GDP growth. 
However, in the absence of a well-targeted and effective social safety net (SSN), the poor and vulnerable have been deeply 
affected by the crisis. During the oil boom, poverty rates declined (from 55 percent in 2003 to 47 percent in 2011), 
however, the absolute number of poor increased from 4.9 million to 5.6 million due to population growth. Progress on 
non-monetary poverty also presents a mixed picture. Since 2014 and up until 2018, dwindling fiscal resources and poor 
social spending execution have disrupted vital public services despite efforts to protect priority social and productive 
spending 

Relationship to CPF 
 

5. The Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for FY16-FY202 is based on three engagement themes: (i) 
strengthening management of public resources; (ii) improving returns to agriculture and building value chains; and (iii) 
building human capital and reducing vulnerability. The program supported by the proposed second Development Policy 
Grant is closely aligned with the three pillars of the CPF and designed to leverage World Bank investment lending projects 
and Technical Assistance activities across the four pillars, notably in the areas of domestic resource mobilization, tax policy 
and administration, SOE management, oil sector capacity building, agriculture value chain support and productivity 
enhancement, and social safety nets development.

The Program Development Objectives and pillars of the proposed operation are to (1) enhance fiscal risk management; 
(2) improve oil revenue transparency and management; (3) promote resilience and economic diversification in key real 
sectors; and (4) increase social protection for the poor and vulnerable. 
 
Key Results  
 

6. This second programmatic Economic Recovery and Resilience (ERR) DPO will support Chad in building resilience 
and consolidating transition to a sustainable, structural growth path. Building on the First Economic Recovery and 
Resilience DPO (P163424), this second grant in a series of two solidifies the shift of World Bank support towards a 
structural resilience and growth agenda. The authorities aim at sustaining recovery, fostering economic diversification, 
and developing coping mechanisms for the poor and vulnerable. Four intertwined pillars combine structural measures to 
enhance fiscal risk management with boosting economic diversification and social resilience. Improved debt, Public 
Financial and oil revenue management are complemented by increased productivity in agriculture and competitive, open 
access information and communication technologies (ICT). Finally, putting in place a well-targeted and fully operational 
social protection system adds an explicit micro layer of resilience. 

 

D. Concept Description 
 

7. The proposed operation supports structural policy reform to improve debt and oil revenue management, 
increase productivity in agriculture and ICT telecom sectors and build a well targeted social safety net.  The operation 
is programmed under IDA18 with a total amount of US$40 million. It follows the First Programmatic Economic Recovery 
and Resilience DPO that passed Board in September 2018, as well as a 2017 standalone Emergency Fiscal Stabilization 
Operation that was conceived as a first stage supporting Chad in its stabilization effort while preparing the ground for the 
second stage, i.e. structural measures to build resilience and start sustainable recovery in the context of this programmatic 
DPO series. 

8. The main policy pillars are to (1) enhance fiscal risk management; (2) improve oil revenue transparency and 
management; (3) promote resilience and economic diversification in key real sectors; and (4) increase social protection 
for the poor and vulnerable. First, this programmatic series aims at enhancing fiscal risk management through (a) 
improved debt management; (b) rationalization of tax expenditures; (c) streamlining the payroll for enhanced fiscal space; 
and (d) improved oversight and transparency in the management of SOEs. Second, to improve the contribution of the oil 
sector to fiscal sustainability and economic resilience it promotes (i) a functional oil revenue management mechanism; (ii) 
transparency in the financial performance of the SHT; and (iii) improved control over oil production costs. Third, to 
increase diversification and resilience of Chad’s population in face of economic and climatic shocks, the operation (a) 
contributes to greater agricultural productivity for more sustainable and inclusive growth; and (b) strengthens the 
contribution of the ICT sector to inclusive growth through enhanced affordability and coverage of services, as well as 
improved transparency for public and private service delivery. Fourth, it increases social protection for the poor and most 
vulnerable groups including refugees, by developing an effective and well-targeted SSN system, and implementing cash 
transfers.  

9. The operation is well aligned with the strategic objectives of the 2017-2021 National Development Plan (NDP). 
It focuses on three of the four strategic Pillars of the government’s program, including Pillar 2, strengthening good 
governance and the rule of law, Pillar 3, development of a robust and competitive economy, and Pillar 4, improving the 
quality of life of the Chadian population.

10. This second programmatic DPO will also help catalyze private investment through improving the investment 
climate and creating opportunities in key sectors of the economy. Maximizing the impact of development financing is a 
central medium-term objective. The importance of concessional finance in supporting inclusive economic growth should 
be gradually reduced and compensated by private sector activity and investment: 1) Improved debt management and SOE 
oversight will reduce fiscal risk and create fiscal space for effective public investment able to crowd in private investment; 
2) at the same time, enabling competitive input markets in agriculture (here through effective agricultural extension 
services and high-quality seeds) and telecommunication (here through a competitive, open access fiber optics 
infrastructure) will not only break power of inefficient SOEs, but also lower entry and business costs across the economy. 
In the medium-term, it creates permanent opportunity for competition and innovation as well as significant consumer 
welfare gains. 

 

E. Poverty and Social Impacts and Environmental Aspects 
 
Poverty and Social Impacts 
 
11. The proposed programmatic Development Policy Grant is expected to have a positive impact on poverty 
reduction in the medium- and long- term. Actions supported by this operation are expected to help decrease poverty in 
the medium- and long-term through the promotion of inclusive growth in agriculture, and the development of more 
affordable ICT services and broader coverage in underserved areas. In addition, a properly targeted expansion of the 
Social Safety Net system has the potential to have a significant impact on allowing households to move out of poverty 
and strengthen household resilience to shocks.  
 
Environmental Impacts 
 

12. The reforms and policy actions supported by the proposed operation are not likely to have significant negative 
effects on the country’s environment, forests and other natural resources. All the actions are policy-oriented; they do 
not support direct investment in environmentally impactful projects or involve policy actions with significant 
environmental consequences. The assessment of potential impacts related to actions supported by the DPO will rely on 
the existing national legal and regulatory framework and will be monitored and addressed through the national 
procedures in place in Chad. Environmental Assessment (EA) is a legal requirement in Chad and is widely applied to all 
developmental projects. The EA process is based on Presidential Decree No. 630/PR/PM/MEERH/2010 on EA regulations 
and the ministerial decision No. 039/PR/PM/MERH/SG/DGE/DEELCPN/2012 with respect to the general guidelines and 
procedures for EA. The department of EA and pollution control in the Ministry of Environment and Fisheries is 
institutionally charged with reviewing and clearing environmental impact assessment (EIA) documents.

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 

1. After decades of slow growth, past reform initiatives have cumulatively strengthened structural 
competitiveness and positioned Senegal among the fastest-growing economies in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) in recent 
years. Driven by progressively resurgent exports, the Senegalese economy has been expanding at almost 7 percent 
annually since 2015, when external conditions have also become more supportive, as global oil, commodities and food 
prices declined. Growth decomposition highlights the critical role of more competitive and diversified exports not only in 
the past three years, but starting from 2010, when the country reversed a historic trend of declining international 
competitiveness, although this positive effect was initially offset by large negative external shocks. The recent progress 
contrasts starkly with decades of paradoxically modest economic development, when Senegal’s per capita GDP, almost 
uniquely in Sub-Saharan Africa, remained below its level at Independence, as the economy was persistently stifled by high 
vulnerability to shocks, weak productivity and omnipresent informality.  

2. Wide-based accelerated growth since 2015 has been driven by expanding exports, fueled by economic reforms 
and a robust external demand. GDP growth accelerated from 6.5% in 2015 to 6.7% in 2016, positioning Senegal among 
the fastest growing economies in the African continent. All sectors of the economy contributed significantly to growth in 
2016 with services being the sector that contributed the most due to its large size as a share of GDP. Other demand 
components performed well, but their role as growth drivers were not as strong as exports. Total investment grew by 
8.8% in 2016 (up from 6.3% in 2015) as a result of the investment program adopted as part of the Plan Senegal Emergent 
(PSE-2014-2035, and its ongoing 5-year Priority Action Plan 2014-2018), as well as policy interventions in specific sectors, 
including agriculture. While the strong import component of investments reduces their short-term impact on growth, the 
increase in both public and private investments bodes well for future growth, particularly if the efficiency of public 
investment can be enhanced. Private consumption accelerated also as its growth rate increased from 5% in 2015 to 5.3% 
in 2016 thanks to higher income and optimistic expectations about the future of the Senegalese economy.  

3. The recent structural turnaround is anchored in prudent macro fiscal policies and supported by a favorable 
environment. On the fiscal side, the balance has improved significantly with the fiscal deficit reduced to 4.2% of GDP in 
2016 (from 4.8% in 2015) as a result of rationalized current spending stemming from the current fiscal consolidation efforts 
and higher revenues driven by better collection of custom taxes. According to the latest IMF-World Bank (WB) debt 
sustainability analysis, public debt in Senegal (60.6% of GDP in 2016) remains at a low risk of distress, but indicators are 
showing emergent strains with respect to sustainability. Also, inflation has remained under control and below the 2% 
target set by the regional central bank, thanks to the prudent regional monetary policy, exchange rate stability and 
ongoing fiscal consolidation efforts.  

4. Higher growth has resulted in an estimated drop in poverty incidence by 4 to 7 percentage points since 2011 
(from 47 percent, to 38 percent based on the international poverty line). Agriculture appears to have been one of the 
main drivers of this reduction, as it has registered low, but positive growth with two exceptionally good years in 2015 and 
2016. At the same time, rural areas have witnessed some job reallocation out of the primary sector, as households have 
diversified their livelihoods, tapping into a growing rural non-farm economy. Moreover, moderate improvements in 
general value added per agricultural worker have reversed a negative trend of more than a decade, pointing to signs of

nascent structural transformation. In urban areas, labor income among the poor has been boosted by growth in labor-
intensive sectors, such as construction.  

5. However persistent spatial disparities are evidenced, with rural areas- particularly the Groundnut Basin (GNB)- 
lagging behind their urban counterparts on a wide range of non-monetary indicators. In 2011, nearly 70 percent of the 
poor and 84 percent of the extreme poor lived in rural areas, accounting for 57 percent of the total population and 
suggesting rural poverty to be deeper and more severe. Female-headed households were less likely to be poor, as women 
tend to head smaller households, and are more likely to receive cash and in-kind transfer1. The poorest communes are 
located in the center of the country known as the Groundnut Basin (particularly in the region of Diourbel, Fatick, Kaolack 
and Kaffrine), and in the Kolda (south) and the eastern part of Tambacounda (south-east), which is also part of the 
extended groundnut basin. The poverty profile constructed using the DHS wealth indicators for 2015 suggests that the 
characteristics of the poor have largely remained unchanged since 2011 in terms of geographic distribution, households’ 
size and education levels. The extended Groundnut Basin is the country’s bread basket, supplying key staples (mostly 
millet, sorghum, and maize) and fodder from groundnuts and cowpeas. Those areas have the highest population density 
(100-120 people/km2) after the capital city area. 

6. Agriculture employs the largest share of the poor, particularly in the Groundnut Basin. Indeed, 62 percent of 
the rural population depend on agriculture, which employs more than 36 percent of the total labor force of the country, 
according to the 2015 Labor Force Survey, and poverty incidence among farmers is the highest. In rural areas, nearly 80 
percent of paid workers in the bottom quintile of the distribution of consumption worked in agriculture, while the more 
prosperous are engaged in largely informal services. Among the poorest are the farmers growing rain-fed crops particularly 
in the Groundnut Basin. Households having animal production as a main source of livelihood are also among the poorest. 
On the other hand, poverty is at its lowest rates among horticulture farmers, mainly based in the Niayes, on the coast 
between Saint-Louis and Dakar, or rice producers along the Senegal River valley. Groundnut farming is a primary source 
of income for a vast majority of family farms, accounting for about half of the total cropped area in the country and 
employing two-thirds of the rural population, mostly below the official poverty line. In fact, groundnuts are grown by 27 
percent of all households in Senegal, and by 52 percent of households in extreme poverty (ANSD, 2011). Moreover, 
supporting labor-intensive activities down the value chain, such as transportation, storage, and processing, remains an 
important source of non-farm employment in both formal and informal sectors.  

7. While the economic prospects are good with a projected real GDP growth at 7.0% in 2019, much more needs to 
be done in implementing the Government’s longer-term strategy (PSE) to transform the rural economy and reduce 
poverty and spatial imbalances. Supported by robust macroeconomic fundamentals, Senegal is expected to remain one 
of West Africa’s top growth performers, if the current internal and external conditions continue supporting this trend. 
Indeed, higher exports from the agriculture, fishery and extractives sectors would continue to drive economic growth. 
However, external shocks, delayed critical reforms to remove bottlenecks to competitiveness of key sectors and increase 
private investments, insufficient funding and/or delays in implementation major PSE programs, poor quality of public 
spending, uncertainties or slow pace of critical reforms to address key bottlenecks due to non-technical motivations are 
major risks to growth expectations. In particular and despite recent improvements in competitiveness and diversification, 
the agriculture sector would continue to be adversely exposed to volatile climatic conditions, particularly if adequate 
reforms are not implemented and substantial investments not made to reduce agricultural dependency on rainfed 
cropping systems, to adapt the groundnut value chain to changing markets, and to improve the overall resilience of the 
crops and livestock production systems to worsening climate conditions in the poorest regions, particularly the groundnut 
basin.

characteristics.

B. Sectoral (or multi-sectoral) and Institutional Context of the Program 

8. The agriculture sector has played a critical role in the Senegalese economy, but remains vulnerable to external 
shocks, which are likely to intensify with greater openness of the economy and climate change. The agriculture sector 
grew at an average rate of 3.2 percent between 2000 and 2016, but volatility around that average was large. The big 
swings in agriculture growth, which are highly correlated to large changes in the Senegalese economy’s growth rates, are 
mainly the result of weather and climatic hazards which heavily impact pastoralism and rain-fed crops such as groundnut, 
millet and other cereals that have traditionally dominated the sector. This suggests that for Senegal to maintain the high 
output growth attained since 2015, more efforts are needed to protect the agriculture sector against climatic variability 
and enhance the resilience of livelihoods in rural areas. Deteriorating climatic conditions in areas surrounding cities are 
likely to increase human migration into cities, further increasing already high urbanization rates. If left unmanaged, urban 
sprawl may worsen or even cause natural hazard events.   

9. Recent improvements in agriculture output in the past few years have been driven by expansion of cropped 
areas and an increase in the use of inputs encouraged by public policies, with limited impact on productivity and job 
creation. The Senegalese government has adopted several policies to modernize and develop the agriculture sector over 
the past few years. These policies, such as developing the skills and financial capabilities of farmers, subsidizing of high 
quality seeds, and supporting agricultural mechanization, have helped boost agriculture yields and production, in cereals, 
horticulture and pulses. The main crops that have benefited are those tagged as priority value chains under PRACAS (rice, 
onions and groundnuts, with steady increases by 160%, 74%, and 108% respectively between 2013 and 2017). Continued 
public support for rice over the last two decades - by increasing investments and implementing reforms in the irrigation 
management systems and expanding low land (and rainfed) cropping systems - is paying off with higher rice yields, 
surpassing the African average and closing the gap with the World average. The private sector has contributed to the 
improvement in agriculture productivity due to the modern processing units that were developed along the Senegal River 
Valley. However labor productivity did not improve over time - and even decreased for certain crops - mainly due to a 
decreasing land-to-labor ratio. In fact, the increase in agriculture output was largely due to an expansion of input use per 
unit of land, and to a much lesser degree to overall improvements in Total Factor Productivity (TFP), through innovation 
and better skills. Therefore, to achieve the objective of poverty reduction - poverty remains prevalent in rural areas - and 
to drive the agricultural transformation agenda, total factor productivity, and labor productivity in particular, should 
significantly increase. This requires creating more jobs for the rural workforce ('move-out' track), while supporting farmers 
to modernize and better connect to downstream segments of value chains and with the rest of the economy ('move-up' 
track) 

10. Low productivity, a weak land regime and underdeveloped infrastructure and logistics limit the potential of 
agriculture to reduce poverty. Despite the importance attributed by the Government to the agricultural sector in the Plan 
Senegal Emergent, agriculture still has the lowest productivity among all sectors, the average farmer being more than six 
times less productive than his average counterpart in the rest of the economy. This result is not surprising if one thinks 
that only 3 percent of cultivated land is irrigated; the production system is still archaic; harvest losses span between 10 
and 30 percent and access to inputs is problematic. Productivity is particularly low among the poor for whom these 
problems are exacerbated by the lack of access to productive assets and financing for farm operations. The recent success 
recorded in the subsectors of horticulture and rice, where productivity increased significantly during the last 10 years, was 
made possible by addressing some of those constraints, including through improved water management particularly in 
the Senegal River Valley, increased access to inputs (seeds, fertilizers) and machinery, and better connectivity.  

11. Addressing the overreliance of the agriculture and livestock production systems on rainfall in the Groundnut 
Basin is critical to secure agricultural growth and sustainable development. The World Bank Disaster and Risk Climate 
portal recorded the following extreme events in the past years, which have certainly influenced performance of the 
agriculture sector : (i) statistically significant decrease in wet season rainfall between 1960 and 2006, with the 500 mm 
isohyets regressing about 100 kilometers (km) to the south; (ii) high variability on inter-annual and inter-decadal

timescales, which can make long-term trends difficult to identify ; (iii) a period of particularly high rainfall in the early 
1960s, whilst the early 1980s were particularly dry; (iv) some unusually high rainfalls have occurred in the dry season in 
very recent years (2000-2006), but this has not been part of a consistent trend; (v) increased mean annual temperature 
by 0.9°C since 1960, an average rate of 0.20°C per decade. Recent projections indicate that those phenomenon are likely 
to amplify with : (i) mean annual temperatures projected to increase by 1.1 to 3.1°C by the 2060s, and 1.7 to 4.9°C by the 
2090s, with projected rates of warming faster in the interior than in those areas closer to the coast; (ii) substantial 
increases in the frequency of days and nights that are considered ‘hot’ in the current climate, with such increases occurring 
more rapidly in the south and east of the country; (iii) decreases in the frequency of days and nights considered ‘cold’ in 
the current climate; (iv) a wide range of changes in the mean annual rainfall averaged over the country, from -41 to +48% 
by the 2090s—but more models show decreases. While it is difficult to draw robust conclusions of changes in precipitation, 
it is likely however that a greater proportion of precipitation will occur in heavy rainfall events, so it is important to 
incorporate scenarios of both precipitation increases (which will further fuel soil erosion) and decreases (amplifying 
drought frequency) in future planning.  

12. The production systems in the Groundnut Basin, both for crops and livestock, are overwhelmingly rainfed and 
driven by small farmers with holdings of less than 5 ha per households. Unlike other major agroecological areas of the 
country (Senegal river valley which concentrates major irrigation investments, Costal Niayes which is the traditional 
horticultural region, and Casamance with significant water resources both from rainfall and surface water), the natural 
resource base in the Groundnut basin is poorly endowed and fragile. The majority of the area is composed of poor quality 
sandy-low organic matter content of tropical ferruginous, with allomorphic brown soils located on low lands (Badiane et 
al., 2001). Rainfall regime is increasingly erratic (600 to 900mm per year) while water quality (salinization and high 
presence of chlorine) is a major constraint to use of surface and superficial groundwater around the Sine and Saloum river 
system. Good quality and productive deep water for agriculture is available in significant amount in the deep groundwater 
tables (the Miocene and Maestrichien) in the eastern part of the Groundnut Basin but requires important investments 
well beyond the capabilities of small-scale farmers.  

13. Demographic pressure and high exposure of production systems to climate risks have led to unsustainable 
short-term coping strategies, e.g. overgrazing, extension of cultivated area, which further contribute to accelerating the 
depletion of the agricultural resource base in the Groundnut Basin. Whilst land degradation has become a genuine issue 
across the country, with 64% of the country’s 3.8 million hectares of arable land affected, the Groundnut Basin alone 
carries the heaviest burden with 47% of the total degraded land. Negative impacts of land degradation include stagnant 
or decreasing agricultural productivity, imbalanced ecosystems, which threatens waterways and the viability of wildlife 
habitats. Continuous land degradation and recurrent droughts in the Groundnut Basin increases the volatility of 
agricultural production, resulting in increased poverty and vulnerability, with a strong rate of rural and international 
migration.  These migratory flows are also at the origin of land conflicts, particularly in the Senegal River valley and in 
Casamance. 

14. Delayed adjustments to global markets trends and inefficient policies in the groundnut value chains have 
trapped groundnut farmers into a vicious cycle of low productivity-low-income-poverty loop. The global groundnut 
trade has gradually shifted from oil and meal to whole nuts, and Asia has become the major producer. Indeed, shifts in 
relative transport costs and in consumer preferences have led to a decline in global trade in groundnut products and 
significant increases in the export of whole nuts. As a result, even highly industrialized exporters tend to produce cake and 
oil only for domestic consumption, while exporting the rest as whole nuts that now dominate global trade flows2.  
Furthermore, high public spending on the groundnut value chain through various subsidies schemes (46% on seed 
subsidies, 30% on price subsidies directed to oil industries, 13% on fertilizers subsidies) accounted for around 50% of total 
public expenditures on agriculture but resulted in less than proportional impact on the added value created in the

economy. Completing the longstanding reforms in the groundnut value chain and establishing a stable and credible policy 
framework for whole nut exports would unleash the economic potential of the groundnut value chain and accelerate the 
modernization and realignment of the groundnut sector to the international markets trends. The government could also 
reorient its agricultural spending from less productive fertilizer subsidies, which were found to play little or no role in 
substantially boosting productivity across several Asian countries, to productivity-enhancing input factors such as 
agricultural R&D, climate resilient technologies and advanced irrigation techniques. This could be paired with well targeted 
social protection mechanisms to support the poorest rural households. 

15. Young men and women are subject to considerable social pressures and norms in general, and more so in rural 
areas. Key gender-based constraints facing women in the agriculture and economic growth sector are: limited access to 
and control over land because of discriminatory inheritance and land allocation practices; social beliefs about women’s 
primary roles as mothers and wives; limited access to credit and/or cash that constraints purchase of agricultural inputs; 
limited literacy and numeracy skills among rural women; and limited opportunities for business development training or 
access to agricultural extension. Finally, social norms limit youth empowerment, particularly their occupational choices or 
access to productive inputs3. School drop- out is high among young girls to marry early with limited time left for productive 
activities. Young men are encouraged to start working early, before getting married, and / or to take over the family 
business. Furthermore, access to key assets, such as land, is largely determined by customary inheritance practices4. When 
active in business, women face different challenges depending on their profiles. Those in the processing Economic Interest 
Group (EIG) are faced with the challenge of growing their operation from a semi-domestic processing unit to a high-density 
industrial production. Access to energy, growth markets, and financing are decisive factors for the expansion of their 
business. Women group may have much more complex challenges, as they have to migrate from an organizational model 
of individualized work to a collective model under a group form, with access to training and to management of group 
project, access to production inputs (fertilizers, seeds) and access to land amongst the key challenges they have to face5. 

16. The proposed Program for Results would support the Government’s Development Plan for Economic 
Emergence (Plan Senegal Emergent- PSE- 2010-2035) and its Agriculture Chapters (the Accelerated Agricultural Growth 
Program- PRACAS6, and the National Livestock Development Plan- PNDE7). The strategic objectives of PSE are to: (i) 
stimulate structural transformation of the economy to support a sustainable and dynamic growth; (ii) facilitate broad 
access to social services while preserving conditions for sustainable development, and (iii) meet requirements for good 
governance through strengthening the country’s institutions and the promotion of peace, security and regional 
integration. The PSE specific objective for the agricultural sector- understood in its broader scope (e.g. including livestock, 
fisheries and agroindustry) which is meant to spearhead the structural transformation of the economy are to : (i) 
strengthen the country’s food security to reduce the food import bill; (ii) develop competitive, high-value added and 
integrated value chains; and (iii) preserve socio-economic balance and reinvigorate the rural economy. This will be driven 
by the development of commercial agriculture as detailed in the sector operational Program (PRACAS).   

17. Implementation of the first phase of PRACAS in the period 2014-2017 has yielded significant results and 
contributing to redressing the overall performance of the agriculture sector and to the country’s economic 
performance. In the groundnut sector in particular, the Government's performance targets under PRACAS were met or 
exceeded by 2016, both in terms of seed capital renewal with 55,000 metric tons (mt) of certified seeds produced against 
a target of 40,000 mt, and in terms of total output with 1,050,000 metric tons of groundnut produced against a target of 
1,000,000 mt for 2017. Furthermore, the government has taken significant steps to eliminate monopsony around the

supply chain of oil mills, SONACOS in particular, and to improve competition for the collection and marketing of 
groundnuts in the region. The government has encouraged the entry of new operators in the collection, processing and 
export of groundnut oils and seeds, and took over SONACOS from the main shareholder for its next privatization. In 
addition, the government has also launched initiatives to encourage the diversification of cropping systems in the 
groundnut basin, with expansion of rain-fed and low-land rice cropping systems, sesame and horticulture in addition to 
livestock. 

18. Deepening the reforms in the groundnut sector, including a stable policy framework for private investments in 
the value chains and mitigating climate risks and price volatility will lay the foundation for agricultural transformation 
in the Groundnut Basin (GNB). Reforms undertaken by the government since 2014 to liberalize the groundnut market 
have started to yield results, with larger exports of nuts and new investments in the value chain (storage, deshelling 
facilities, with significant potential in term of off-farm employments). However, distortive policies to keep alive the less 
profitable segment of processing of crude oils have prevented farmers from getting the full value of expanding to global 
whole nuts markets. Within that context, developing a new value chain centered on producing high quality groundnuts 
for whole nuts exports and for the confectionery industry is needed. This requires establishing a level playing field for the 
private sector to invest and innovate in the processing and marketing segments. A key step in this direction would be to 
privatize SONACOS. At the farmers’ level reforms should address the issue of revenues volatility, including safety net 
mechanisms when both international prices and domestic production are low. 

19. The proposed Program will support the adaptation of the groundnut value chain to evolving climate and 
markets conditions and accelerate the diversification of the agricultural production systems in the Groundnut Basin for 
greater resilience to external shocks. To seize emerging market opportunities, Senegal would need to substantially 
increase and stabilize groundnut yields (actually 60% of the world average yield, compared to 200% for China), tackle the 
protracted issue of aflatoxins to meet the requirements of the high quality confectionery nuts export market, improve 
competition along the value chain and particularly in the inputs and processing segment, while accelerating the 
diversification of production systems and scaling up the adoption of climate smart-agriculture in the groundnut basin.  
This will require implementing several  adaptation measures including the wide adoption of agro-forestry techniques and 
crop diversification; the use of short-cycle varieties and that of varieties tolerant to salinity; improved collection and water 
storage (i.e. dams, retention basins, anti-salt structures, windbreaks); the expansion of community woodlots; the 
prevention of bush fires; the dissemination of fertilization techniques; the establishment of an early warning system in 
rural areas, and preventing and tackling  pest infestations, such as the West Africa Desert Locust and fruit flies which are 
major threats to expanding the lucrative business of mangoes exports from the groundnut basin 

Relationship to CAS/CPF 

20. The World Bank Group’s Strategic Country Diagnostic (SCD) for Senegal identifies four main constraint areas to 
inclusive growth and equity, three major constraints to the sustainability of this inclusive growth and two underlying 
institutional constraints (see diagram). Summing up, the constraints and solution areas identified by the SCD delineate 
three main pathways to poverty reduction and increased shared prosperity in Senegal.  

• Boosting Senegal’s Competitiveness to ensure a dynamic private-sector led growth and capitalize on the growing 
young urban population by focusing on reforms of the fiscal and monetary frameworks and improvements of the business 
environment as well as measures aimed at an increased and equitable availability of productive inputs, such as skills and 
land, and improved critical infrastructure, including energy and ICT.  

• Enhancing Equity and Resilience unlocking the economic potential of non-extractive natural resources, including 
agriculture and livestock, from which most of the poor still derive their livelihoods, while enhancing the ability of the 
population in rural areas to engage in the growth process and cope with shocks through appropriate government support 
allowing for the accumulation and protection of their asset base.

• Managing Risks Associated with Natural Resources by addressing the perils inherent in the nascent oil and gas 
sector, particularly the ‘resource curse’ and potential erosion of the competitiveness of labor-intensive exports, as well as 
diverse impacts of the climate change, threatening to erase years of progress in poverty reduction.  

21. The proposed Program aligns well with the three pathways outlined in the SCD and the World Bank Groups’ 
Africa Region’s Climate Change Business Plan, in particular the one on ‘Enhancing Equity and Resilience’. While the 
Country Partnership Framework is being developed, it is likely that it will be consistent with the proposed pathways which 
all echo the priority areas of the proposed Program. By fusing its intervention on climate change adaptation, the Program 
also   contributes to the Region’s climate change business plan. 

 
C. Program Development Objective(s) (PDO) and PDO Level Results Indicators 

 
Program Development Objective(s) 

22. The Development Objectives of the proposed Program are to improve the competitiveness of the groundnut 
value chain and to increase the resilience to climate and market risks of farmers and herders in the Groundnut Basin.  

    PDO Level Results Indicators 
 

23. At PDO-level the following indicators are proposed to assess the Program’s results: 

(i) Number of farmers/herders reached with climate-smart agricultural practices and technologies (e.g. drought 
resistant varieties, new seeds/feedstocks for crop diversification; soil and land management practices and 
technologies); 

(ii) Increase in yields of groundnuts and selected crops; 
(iii) Increased exports of high value crops (shelled groundnuts and horticultural produce); 
(iv) Reduced variability in production of groundnuts and selected crops. 

 
D. Program Description 

 
PforR Program Boundary 

1. Government program objectives and results 

24. The objective of the Government’s updated agriculture program as set in the LPDSA is “to develop a performant, 
competitive, diverse and sustainable agriculture that provides stable income to farmers and promotes economic and social 
development”.  This is further broken down into four specific objectives, five programs and 15 lines of activities:  

(i) Increased agricultural production and productivity with the following activities. This objective aims to 
sustainably increase agricultural production and productivity through diversified and qualitative products, able to 
meet the consumption needs of the population, to provide raw materials for the domestic processing industry 
and to be competitive in international and regional markets;  
(ii) Diversified agricultural production systems. This objective aims at developing diversified agricultural value-
chains, taking full advantage of the various agro-ecological zones of the country, in order to give rural populations 
more income opportunities, in particular through increased support to high added-value agricultural value-chains;  
(iii) Strengthened agricultural services framework. This objective aims at developing agricultural and rural 
research, training and advice, facilitate farmers’ access to finance and creating a regulatory environment 
conducive to private sector investments;

(iv) Improved agriculture sector governance facilitating the dialogue between all relevant stakeholders to ensure 
an efficient implementation of the sector’s development policies 

2. Proposed Program for Results operation context 

25. The proposed Program will contribute to the government’s programs addressing the volatility of agricultural 
production and farmers revenues, while positively impacting longer term productivity in the Groundnut Basin, and is 
anchored within PSE’s vision regarding the development of the agriculture sector, and its sectoral program’s (PRACAS) 
objectives. In agreement with the GoS, the proposed Program would focus mainly on the Groundnut Basin, the traditional 
area for peanut production that is lagging behind in terms of development. The proposed Program will focus on areas of 
intervention identified in Senegal’s agriculture development strategy that are key to addressing the high vulnerability of 
farmers to climate and market risks and improving the competitiveness of the groundnut value chain.   

26. The proposed Program will support the economic transformation of agricultural households, in particular through 
the supply, through public and private entities, of quality agricultural services. Two different trajectories have been 
identified to achieve that purpose: (i) the diversification of family farms through increased technologies adoption and 
digitalization and (ii) the creation of jobs opportunities along agri-food value-chains of high commercial potential. 

27. The approach will consist in putting the private sector8 at the heart of the proposed Program’s interventions. For 
that purpose, the proposed Program would support the GoS’s efforts in establishing a favorable environment for the 
development of private sector, via the pursuit of reforms initiated in the agri-food sector, the institutional strengthening 
of dedicated organizations and targeted public investments to improve the factors of competitiveness (e.g. productive 
and market infrastructures, research and development, agricultural extension, quality management…). 

28. Given the vulnerability of the country’s agricultural sector to climate change, particularly in the targeted areas of 
intervention (Groundnut Basin), the proposed Program would carry-out several activities to achieve climate Co-Benefits. 
The proposed Program aims at enhancing the adaptation of production systems to climate change (mainly increase in 
temperatures and reduction in rainfall) and to strengthen the resilience of farmers to climate shocks. This will be achieved 
through better management of water resources with improved irrigation systems, the adoption of climate-smart 
technologies and climate-resilient crops, and higher integration of agriculture and livestock production systems. The 
proposed Program also aims at achieving climate Co-Benefits by reducing GHG emissions. It will promote climate-smart 
agricultural and husbandry practices, favor restoration of soil to allows greater carbon absorption, and reduce food losses 
and waste through increased connectivity of farms to markets and improved storage and processing capacity.  

Results areas 

29. To achieve its development objective, the proposed Program would focus on three results areas: (i) increased 
productivity and diversification to strengthen resilience, (ii) increased market access, and (iii) sector governance, 
coordination and programs management private sector development. Those results areas have strong synergies and are 
mutually supportive. 

30. Result area 1: Increased productivity and diversification to strengthen resilience. The proposed Program would 
aim at developing solutions to mitigate the risks that farmers face in the targeted areas of the Program, in particular 
market and climate-related risks.  

• Development of the agricultural resource base in the Groundnut Basin. The Program would aim at strengthening 
the sustainable use of natural resources the agricultural sector relies on. In particular, the Ministry of Agriculture 

                                            
8 In the context of the Program “private sector” includes all type of entrepreneurial activities, from smallholder’s farms, to cooperatives, small and 

medium agri-business enterprises, national and multinational agri-food industries…

and Rural Equipment (MAER) and the Ministry of Livestock and Animal Resources (MERA) would closely 
coordinate with the Ministry of Water on ongoing assessments of water resources for an integrated and 
sustainable use of existing resources, in order to scale up efficient water and soil management programs in the 
Groundnut Basin. Those would include use of existing water infrastructure or the development - where 
conditions for sustainability so allow - of small scale water infrastructure to expand efficient irrigated systems in 
the Groundnut Basin, improvement of livestock watering points, the rehabilitation of degraded land/soil through 
investments and building capacity of farmers and herders on water and soil management infrastructure and 
techniques. The proposed Program would also enhance knowledge management on the state of these natural 
resources (water, soil, climate) in the Groundnut Basin.  

• Strengthening family farms’ productivity and resilience. The proposed Program would support the 
transformation at scale of part of the rainfed dependent family farms to more resilient, irrigation-based 
diversified farming systems. Both the development of irrigation and the diversification of production systems in 
the Groundnut Basin would allow farmers to reach higher labor productivity and full employment all year long. 
Furthermore, better water management through access to irrigation as well as adoption of climate-smart 
technologies would improve the resilience of farmers to climate-related risks, reducing their exposure to 
droughts. Based on ongoing analysis of the agricultural and livestock resources base in the Groundnut Basin, 
MAER and MERA will assess during the Program’s preparation, value-chains, business models and business 
alliances, which the proposed Program will help expand, through technical assistance, training, and investments. 

• Facilitating access to improved seeds. Access to adapted and productive panting material is a prerequisite for 
successful development of modern farms. This result would be achieved through increased availably of breeder 
and foundation seeds from the research system and efficient seed multiplication system. The Program would 
support development of a market-driven, private-sector-led seed multiplication system to disseminate quality 
seeds adapted to climate change, notably the new breeds recently released in Senegal and West Africa under 
the West Africa Productivity Program (WAAPP). The national agronomic research institute (ISRA) and public 
institutions (e.g. MAER’s Division of Seed control) would be strengthened in their role on breeder seed 
production and seed quality control.  

• Insuring commercial herders and farmers against shocks. The Program would support the expansion of the 
ongoing agricultural index-based-insurance scheme9 to address residual production risk and reduce the 
incidence of systematic shock on farmers’ and herders’ revenues. The insurance program would be part of a 
package of support to project beneficiaries aimed at accelerating uptake of improved technologies and adoption 
of good farm management practices, and de-risking access to credit. The Program’s support on insurance could 
be coupled with ongoing social protection programs such as the Government “Bourses Familiales” and upcoming 
World Bank Social Protection program to ensure that poorest and non-insurable households in the Groundnut 
Basin are provided with the adequate instrument to emerge from climate related disasters, with emergency 
relief and the provision of assets to re-start production cycles. 

31. Result area 2: Increased market integration. The proposed Program aims at strengthening the links between 
agricultural production and other segments of the value-chain, promoting inclusive business alliances, removing critical 
impediments (physical impediments as well as capacity building) to promote the development of private-sector-led 
services and agro-industries along the value chains.   

                                            
9 Index based Insurance was been introduced in Senegal with WBG support since 2009, but its development has been very slow until recently with 

increased interest from the private sector and contract farming in the groundnuts value chain. See more on the design of the product in “The World 

Bank : Index-based Crop Insurance in Senegal – Promoting Access of Agricultural Insurance for Small Farmers. Sustainable Department-Africa Region, 

and Finance and Private Sector Department, March 2009

• Structuring farmers associations and promoting contractual farming. This result area would focus on the 
improvement of storage, processing and marketing of agri-food products so as to improve the connection of 
production systems to the agro-industry and markets in general. The proposed Program would (i) identify and 
support business models strengthening the links between producers and agro-industries, (ii) support the 
development of farmgate small scale crops and animal feed/fodder storage facilities, as village aggregation 
centers and cottage processing center within the production areas to facilitate linkages with off-takers;  

• Increasing control of aflatoxins and fruit flies. The proposed Program would tackle these major hurdles to access 
to markets for key produces which could otherwise develop rapidly in the Groundnut basin, such as 
confectionery groundnuts, maize for animal feed, and exportable mangoes10. The Program would support (i) the 
dissemination of appropriates technologies to control aflatoxins on groundnuts and maize along the value chain; 
(ii) the Department of Plant protection (DPV) to extend the coverage of areas infested by the fruit flies; (iii) the 
strengthening of the quality control system for agri-food products on aflatoxin and fruit flies. 

• Supporting the emergence of Agropole-Centre. While large scale infrastructure, such as roads, power plant and 
construction of manufacturing or industrial processing facilities are excluded from PforR financing, the proposed 
Program may support the feasibility studies for the Agropole Centre, which aimed at addressing critical 
impediments to the development of processing and marketing of agricultural products. In parallel, the Program 
would support the construction and rehabilitation of small-scale rural infrastructure such feeder and connecting 
roads, aggregation/storage and processing parks in and/or around selected economic poles. The Program would 
ensure climate-resilience of implemented investments. 

32. The World Bank and IFC teams are working closely in the preparation of the proposed Program and will further 
deepen the collaboration during implementation to promote private investments in agricultural value chains and facilitate 
access to domestic and international markets. Specific areas of collaboration could include the extension of the warehouse 
receipt systems to value chains of interest for the groundnut basin (groundnuts, and animal feed crops such as cowpeas 
and maize), agricultural finance including insurance, and structuring contract farming between producer associations, 
traders/aggregators, agro-processing companies and exporters. 

33. Result area 3: Improving sector governance, coordination and programs management. The proposed Program 
would address the policy and markets failures that prevent efficient private sector development in the agri-food sector, 
focusing in particular on the groundnut value chain which development has been affected by inefficient interventions. The 
Program would also support the strengthening of the organizational and institutional environment to facilitate the 
development of diversified and resilient agri-food value-chains and improve coordination and execution of government 
programs in the agriculture sector. 

• Improving the policy environment for production, processing and marketing of agri-food products. The Program would 
focus on implementing key reforms to create an efficient and conducive environment for private sector development 
in agri-food value chains. This include (i) implementing the policies and activities defined in the Groundnut sector 
strategy (Note d’orientation pour le Développement et l’Optimisation des Performances de la Filière Arachide- Draft 
May 2018), (ii) establishing a more targeted – both in terms of beneficiaries and technologies focusing on climate-
smart agriculture- and cost-efficient inputs and mechanization support program, (iii) setting up a permanent public-
private sector dialogue on the agricultural sector, strengthening quality control and improving governance of 
government’s inputs subsidy programs, (vi) implementing a conducive fiscal environment for the development of 
agro-processing, and (vii) implementing sustainable financing of agricultural services (research-development-
extension) and facilitating access to finance for productive activities.

• Program Performance tracking, Sector coordination and capacity building. To accelerate the implementation of key 
reforms in the groundnut sector and implementation of investments supported by the proposed Program there is a 
need for capacity building and institutional strengthening. Key capacity building efforts under the Program would be 
directed at (i) selected inter-professions to enable them to carry out their mandate and become effective and inclusive 
platforms for intra-branch coordination and public-private dialogue, (ii) the Ministry of Agriculture (MAER) and its 
regional directorates to strengthen its ability to plan and coordinate different stakeholders and projects in 
implementing the second phase of PRACAS; (iii) national institutions in charge of data collection, treatment and 
analyses (MAER-DAPSA, DHORT, PAPA, DRD, MEFP-ANSD, PM-BPE) to improve their capacities to inform policies and 
monitor implementation programs; (iv) national organizations and institutions providing business development and 
technical support services to the agri-food sector; (v) authorities and laboratories ensuring quality control  of 
agricultural inputs and food products (DPV, CERES-Locustox, ITA, LCI) in particular for the control of aflatoxins and 
fruit flies (vi) national institutions in charge of monitoring natural resources (soil and water) management and 
infrastructures. 

E. Initial Environmental and Social Screening 

34. It is assumed that the proposed Program by its nature will yield significant positive environmental and social 
benefits by promoting climate-smart agriculture, soil restoration, reduction of food losses, improved water management, 
etc., while its environmental and risk from  the promotion of PRACAS and PNDE, of increasing yields, developing 
infrastructure (such small catchment dams/weirs, retention basins, cattle watering points, crop and fodder storage 
facilities, cottage processing platforms, etc ), use of chemicals, will be limited. Interventions proposed for the Program’s 
support exclude activities which normally would be considered as Category A under Investment Financing Projects. For 
this reason, the proposed Program for Results is not considering heavy infrastructure on irrigation or infrastructure 
necessary to establishing a full Agropole, such as power plant or connection to high voltage power grid and connecting 
roads. Furthermore, intervention on irrigation will not consider transfer of significant flow of groundwater for irrigation 
development, but rather small-scale irrigation around existing water infrastructure or small-scale infrastructure such as 
catchment weirs and boreholes fit for purpose. Environmental and social impacts of such infrastructure would be limited 
in scope and manageable. Implementation of some investments may require acquisition of land or displacement of 
people, even though affected people during construction may also be ultimate beneficiaries of such investment. Regarding 
land acquisition, the structure of farming systems in the Groundnut Basin, overwhelmingly dominated by small scale family 
farming holdings, and the high population density prevent distribution or acquisition of massive amount of land for 
agribusiness operations, which in any case the project cannot support. Therefore, the proposed Program’s approach 
consists of developing targeted value chains around family farming.  

35. Although the Program will strive to promote climate friendly agriculture, agricultural intensification including 
agroforestry, drought-tolerant and salt-tolerant varieties, crop diversification, efficient soil and water management 
techniques) may involve increased use of chemicals for soil fertilization and for plants diseases, weeds and pest control. 
For instance, the control fruit flies on fruit crops and may involve use of pesticide at a significant scale or acquisition of 
advance technology to produce sterile males of ceratitis.    

36. Ministries of agriculture and livestock have long-standing experience of managing World Bank operations and are 
relatively well familiar with the Bank's guidelines and procedures on environmental and social risks management, but 
mostly through dedicated projects implementation units with qualified and competitively selected staff. As part of the 
Program's preparation, the Bank task team will prepare an environmental and social systems assessment (ESSA). The ESSA 
will review existing regulations and policies, their legal and practical applicability at the program level, institutional 
capacity, and the effectiveness of implementation in practice, using empirical information and data to be provided by the 
GoS and supplemented with information from other stakeholders and other available sources. The ESSA will include 
measures required to manage environmental and social impacts and risks and will include actions to strengthen 
institutions and increase the capacity of the whole program.

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 

 
1. Malawi is a small, peaceful and democratic country, with a population of about 17 million people. Most of the 
population (85 percent) lives in rural areas. Population growth rate is estimated at 2.8 percent per annum. At this growth 
rate, Malawi’s population is expected to reach 23 million by 2025. The country is land-locked and is highly vulnerable to 
climatic shocks. Despite a recent difficult economic period, Malawi has a stable democratic political system and has 
initiated economic and political reforms. The country remains one of the world’s poorest, with over half of its population 
living in poverty.  

2. Malawi has a narrow export base consisting mostly of tobacco, with high dependence on imports and external 
aid flows. Investment climate constraints hinder private investment. The 2018 Doing Business report ranks Malawi 111 
out of 190 on the ease of doing business.  The main obstacles to doing business include poor infrastructure and services 
such as electricity, water, transport, an uncertain economic environment, poor legal and regulatory framework, lack of 
access to long-term finance and a limited skills base. Business confidence remains subdued following two years of 
drought conditions and weak economic growth. 

3. Poverty levels in Malawi are high. In 2017, poverty headcount at US$1.9/day (2011 PPP) remained stubbornly 
high at 70 percent of the population1. Gross National Income (GNI) per capita2 was estimated at US$320 in 2017. Malawi 
is ranked 170 out of 188 countries on the United Nations Human Development Index, and 125 out of 157 on the World 
Bank’s Human Capital Index. Almost half (47 percent) of the children under age five in Malawi are short for their age 
due to long-term effects of malnutrition and 20 percent are severely stunted.   Malawi’s economic growth rates have 
fallen below the average of 2.8 percent in non-resource rich African economies during the last twenty years.  Real per 
capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has grown at an average of just above 1.5 percent per year between 1995 and 
2014.  With these persistent low growth rates, successive governments in Malawi have struggled to lift people out of 
poverty.   Wealth accounting data3 shows that more than half of Malawi’s wealth (estimated at US$10,442 per capita in 
2014) is renewable natural capital, mainly cropland with smaller shares contributed by pastureland, forests and 
protected areas. The natural capital base however is under extreme pressure due population growth, agricultural 
expansion and climate change. There is also a strong correlation between areas with highly degraded land and those 
with a high incidence of poverty, although there is currently insufficient evidence to point to a causal link4.

4. Natural resources underpin Malawi’s productive sectors and are the main source of livelihood for over 80 
percent of the population.  For instance, the agriculture sector contributes 28 percent of Malawi’s GDP and 78 percent 
of export earnings, and employs 64 percent of the workforce, which consists mainly of subsistence farmers. Smallholders 
account for 80 percent of agricultural production and 70 percent of agricultural GDP.  The forestry sector contributes 
6.2 percent to the GDP (and this does not account for the value of non-wood forest products, processed timber or the 
enormous informal trade in wood fuel and charcoal). Some 33,000 jobs are heavily dependent on the existence of 
Malawi's forests.  Forests provide a range of environmental services, such as GHG mitigation, watershed regulation, 
climate regulation, soil and water conservation, biodiversity support and nutrient cycling. The nine protected areas in 
the Shire river basin store an estimated 80 million tons of CO2e5.  Malawi is also heavily dependent on hydropower for 
its energy needs, with about 98 percent of current electricity generation coming from run-of-river6 hydropower plants 
on the Shire River. 

5. Agriculture remains the lifeblood of Malawi’s economy, and growth in GDP has historically followed growth in 
agriculture.  However, most of the population is engaged in smallholder, low-productivity rain-fed agriculture which 
regularly suffers exogenous climate-induced shocks with significant negative impacts on overall growth and poverty 
reduction. In recent years, weak fiscal policy, low investor confidence, significant weather shocks and land degradation 
have had detrimental effects on agricultural output and food security.  Malawi regularly suffers from droughts and 
floods, and its economic growth is closely correlated with hydrological variability. In recent years, the country has 
suffered from weather shocks with increasing frequency, including both floods and droughts in early 2015, followed by 
another major drought in 2016. Irrigation potential has not been fully developed. Only about four percent of crop land 
is currently irrigated, severely constraining agricultural intensification and commercialization. 

6. Medium-term economic prospects however appear positive as the country recovers from the recent weather-
induced shocks in 2016. Real GDP growth after two consecutive years of drought, fell below three percent in 2016 but 
is projected to pick up in the range of four to five percent over the next two years. Increased output is expected to be 
driven by a rebound in the agriculture sector, although this outlook is susceptible to downward risks such as a potential 
El Niño-induced weather shocks.  The continued vulnerability of Malawi’s agricultural sector and spillovers to other 
sectors point to the critical need to promote measures that improve resilience.  The Government of Malawi (GoM) has 
recently developed a medium-term strategy7, looking beyond the recent crisis, to establish strong foundations for a 
productive, competitive and resilient nation. 

 
Sectoral and Institutional Context 
 
7. Malawi’s water resources are under threat from severe land degradation and loss of forest cover.  Critical 
watersheds are becoming degraded leading to reduced water availability, deteriorating water quality, increased 
vulnerability to droughts and floods, reduced energy security and reduced agricultural productivity. Malawi has a large 
network of surface waterbodies covering about 21 percent of the country’s total area; about 20 percent of this area is 
Lake Malawi itself.  Malawi’s drainage system is divided into 17 Water Resources Areas (WRAs)8. Major river systems 
include Shire (WRA 1), Ruo (WRA 14), Linthipe (WRA 4), Bua (WRA 5), Dwangwa (WRA 6), South Rukuru (WRA 7), North 
Rukuru (WRA 8) and Songwe (WRA 9).  Most of the rivers are subject to natural seasonal flows but maintain at least 
some base flow (at least in their lower reaches) throughout the dry season. The total renewable water resource available 
in Malawi is estimated at 17.3 km3/year, or 1,027 m3/capita/year.  While availability of water resources in the aggregate

6 ‘Run-of-river’ means that there is little or no storage capacity upstream of the power plant except small pondage for peaking. The amount of 
electricity that can be produced depends on the daily flow of the river.  
7 Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (2017-2022) 
8 A Water Resources Area is essentially a single large, or in some cases a collection of smaller, hydrological catchments.

is considered satisfactory, per capita water availability has been declining at a rapid rate.  Malawi is now dangerously 
close to becoming water scarce9. Further, water resources in Malawi are highly variable between wet and dry seasons 
and from year to year, and the country’s stock of water storage infrastructure is one of the lowest in the region. GoM’s 
Water Resources Investment Strategy (WRIS, 2011) identifies poor catchment conditions and deteriorating water quality 
as significant risks to water resources and associated infrastructure (dams, hydropower plants, irrigation systems), and 
recommends investments in catchment management in strategically important WRAs.     

8. Land degradation10 in Malawi’s most important watersheds has reached alarming levels, with major impacts on 
water security, agricultural productivity, and hydropower generation.  Recent studies suggest that land degradation 
hotspots cover about half (41 percent) of the land area in the country11. Soil erosion and nutrient depletion are major 
forms of land degradation that are reported to affect more than 60 percent of the entire land area. The average annual 
national soil loss rates in 2014 was 29 tons per hectare12. Chemical land degradation, including soil pollution and 
salinization/alkalization, has led to 15 percent loss in the arable land in Malawi in the last decade alone. Projections for 
future land degradation and soil loss under different climate and population growth rate scenarios suggest that land 
degradation will become increasingly severe, with one study suggesting that overall rates of soil loss will increase by 
between three and four times 2010 baseline levels13. The Shire River Basin (WRA 1) remains the most prominent hotspot 
of land degradation. High loads of sediment are deposited in river beds, reservoirs and floodplain wetlands, affecting 
irrigation canals, fisheries and hydropower generation.  Existing hydropower plants on the Shire River are often unable 
to meet peak demand, partly due to low flows and sediments in the river caused by degradation of catchments upstream 
of the plants14.  

9. Forest degradation is a major contributor to land and water resources degradation.  Over the last 40 years, more 
than half of Malawi’s forests and woodlands have vanished and those that remain are being ‘thinned’ through over-
extraction and more frequent forest fires. Yet, forests make a substantial contribution to livelihoods and the economy 
and are needed to protect vital ecosystem services. They also provide the bulk of Malawi’s energy supply in the form of 
charcoal and firewood.  Wood fuels dominate Malawi’s energy sector and are used by 98 percent of the population. The 
industry provides large numbers of jobs and is worth nearly US$295 million per annum – equivalent to four percent of 
GDP15.  Forests and woodlands also play a key role in protecting watersheds from erosion, sustain the biodiversity that 
underpins a large proportion of Malawi’s tourism sector and make an important contribution to mitigating carbon 
emissions.   

10. The underlying drivers of land degradation in Malawi are well known. These include a growing demand for 
agricultural land due to increased population pressure and reduced agricultural productivity; insecure land tenure which 
reduces incentives to invest in soil and water conservation measures; and limited access to markets and rural finance. 
The proximate causes of land degradation include a wide range of biophysical factors and poor land management

practices. Important biophysical factors that affect land degradation include topography, land cover, climate and soil 
erodibility.  

11. Efforts to address land degradation are hampered by a multitude of factors.  The major challenge is the weak 
institutional capacity for natural resource management at both national and local levels and the severe lack of funding 
for these activities in local government budgets. With insufficient resources, weak capacity and incentives, local 
governments are generally unable to play an effective role in addressing land degradation at the local level. In addition, 
changes to climate and weather patterns exacerbate the impacts of natural resources degradation, making it harder to 
address the problem.  Future climate change scenarios suggest that Malawi will see increasing climatic variability, higher 
temperatures, longer dry periods, and more erratic and intense rainfall events16. More intense flood events will cause 
greater soil erosion and land degradation. Hotter and drier periods will contribute to forest fire risks. Droughts will 
continue to negatively impact food production, causing food insecurity and increased poverty. Increased poverty results 
in greater demand for agricultural land, thus exerting more pressure on the natural resources base.  Yet, Malawi remains 
unprepared to anticipate, respond to and recover from the effects of climate change.  The country lacks reliable hydro-
meteorological information that is needed for building climate resilience.  For example, out of the 140 hydrological 
monitoring stations in Malawi that are considered a priority, 70 percent are not operational.  Systems for data storage 
and quick relay to modelling and forecasting systems are either non-existent or not integrated across agencies. Building 
a national and more integrated hydrometeorological service is key to building climate resilience across productive 
sectors and reducing pressure on the natural resources base.  

12. Reversing the rate of land degradation remains a government priority. The Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and 
Water Development (MoAIWD) and the Ministry of Natural Resources, Energy and Mining (MoNREM) recognize the 
interdependence between natural resource management, agricultural production, water and energy security. Sound 
policies and institutional frameworks for natural resources management exist. A new Environmental Management Act 
2017 has been enacted to strengthen environmental management and protection, while the Water Resources Act of 
2013 provides for the management, conservation, use and control of water resources, including management of 
watersheds.  

13. The recent establishment of the National Water Resources Authority (NWRA)17 is expected to help strengthen 
multi-sectoral planning and management of water resources in the country, and pave way for establishment of 
sustainable watershed management institutions at the community level. Land reforms introduced in 2016 are 
expected to improve land tenure security and strengthen incentives for small-holder farmers and businesses to invest 
in sustainable land and water management practices. Further, a new National Charcoal Strategy has been approved, 
which for the first time, provides an opportunity to legalize the charcoal value chain and move towards more sustainable 
charcoal production, and thus reducing pressure on forests and community woodlands. However, the ability to 
implement policy and legislation, both nationally and locally, remains weak.  Monitoring is often limited and ineffective, 
compliance is low and the structures necessary for providing guidance and procedures are not in place. Weak 
institutional capacity is particularly acute at district and local levels, partly because of the slow pace of decentralization 
and severe under-funding18 which constrains the effective functioning of institutions at district and local level, limiting 
their ability to implement policy. 

14. To reverse landscape degradation and protect watersheds, Malawi needs to invest at scale in the protection of 
renewable natural resources and their restoration where appropriate and cost-effective, using a broad suite of

17 GoM recently appointed the governing board for NWRA – a move that is seen as an important milestone in operationalizing the institutional 
framework for water resources management as laid out in the Water Resources Act of 2013.  
18 For instance, the share of agricultural spending on extension support – a critical service for promoting the uptake of SLM practices –reduced 
from 25 percent in 2005 to just 5 percent in 2012.

interventions. These will include sustainable forest management and restoration interventions, development of water 
management infrastructure, scaling-up of climate smart agriculture and resilient livelihoods. At the same time, GoM 
needs to invest in strengthening institutions and improving the monitoring, management and use of hydro-
meteorological information.  GoM’s National Forest and Landscape Restoration Strategy (NFLRS), published in July 2017, 
proposed that land restoration should be elevated to a higher national priority level, backed by financial investment to 
implement a large scale national program for land restoration. In this regard, GoM has committed to restore 4.5 million 
hectares19 of landscape by 2030, through a combination of interventions, including soil and water conservation, river 
and stream bank restoration, conservation agriculture, farmer-managed natural regeneration and agroforestry; natural 
forest management; community forests and private woodlots. The total cost of achieving this target is estimated at 
US$385 million (or US$86 per hectare). GoM is currently in the process of mobilizing finance from development partners 
to support implementation of the strategy, either through a new large scale national program or a series of separate 
programs targeting major river basins 20.    

15. One such program which GoM has been implementing since 2012 with World Bank support is the Shire River 
Basin Management Program (SRBMP) 21. Part of the investment under SRBMP targets degraded hotspots in the basin 
covering a total area of 129,500 ha (about 5 percent of the basin land area). These catchments have been undergoing 
rehabilitation over the past two years with promising results.  Available data shows that a total of 35,385 ha (i.e. 27 
percent of the targeted catchment area and 1.3 percent of the entire basin) has been rehabilitated, including 10,173ha 
of previously degraded community forests which have been regenerated. Vegetative protection measures have been 
implemented on 4,000km of water courses (rivers and streams) in the targeted catchments. Various infrastructure 
packages–rural feeder roads (80km), bridges (11) and markets (13)–designed to support alternative livelihoods and 
improve market access have been completed and commissioned. A total of 366 Common Interest Groups (CIGs) have 
been established, trained and provided with start-up capital for various non-farm business enterprises.  Finally, a total 
of 80 Farmer Field Schools (FFS) are now promoting conservation agriculture and improved farming practices using a 
farmer-to-farmer extension approach. To date, about 77 percent of households within the targeted catchments are 
reported to be engaged in sustainable land and water management.  These results, although achieved at a small scale, 
have demonstrated that it is possible to restore degraded landscapes through an integrated package of interventions 
involving land and water management, forestry management and livelihood support.  GoM would like to scale up these 
interventions in other degraded hotspots in the Shire River Basin and elsewhere in line with the national landscape 
restoration strategy. The proposed Resilient Productive Landscapes Project (RPLP) has been conceived in response to 
GoM’s letter of request for World Bank support dated June 28, 2017. 

 
Relationship to CPF 

 
16. The project is aligned with the new growth-oriented Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for Malawi which is 
currently under preparation. The CPF focus on four themes which emerged from the Systematic Country Diagnostic 
(SCD).  These are: (i) human capital; (ii) governance and macroeconomy; (iii) energy and infrastructure; and (iv) 
environment and rural resilience.  The project contributes to the environment and rural resilience theme by addressing 
land degradation, improving natural resources management and boosting agricultural productivity.  Addressing these 
issues will contribute to protecting critical watersheds and securing water resources for existing and proposed 
hydropower plants on the Shire river as well as the large-scale irrigation scheme currently under implementation as part 
of the Shire Valley Transformation Program.   

                                            
19 This represents about half of the entire land area in Malawi 
20 So far, GoM has developed and is implementing two river basin management programs – Shire River Basin Management Program supported by 
the World Bank and the Songwe River Basin Management Program – supported by African Development Bank 
21 Current World Bank support to SRBMP ends on January 31, 2019

17. The project is also expected to contribute to the human capital agenda in Malawi. A recent study22 found that 
upstream watershed conditions were a strong predictor children’s health across 35 developing countries, including 
Malawi.  Specifically, the study found that in areas with no access to improved water sources, higher upstream tree 
cover is associated with lower probability of diarrheal diseases downstream, even after controlling for socio-economic 
and climate factors23. This suggests that improving watershed management is not only an investment in environmental 
resilience, it is also an investment in public health. 

18. The project responds directly to GoM’s priorities as laid out in the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy 
(MGDS III) 2017-2022.  The objective of the strategy is to move Malawi to a productive, competitive and resilient nation 
through sustainable agriculture and economic growth, energy, industrial and infrastructure development while 
addressing water, climate change, environmental management and population challenges.  The project contributes 
directly to the MGDS III priority areas of agriculture, water development and climate change management by supporting 
investments that address land degradation and its impacts on water resources, agricultural productivity and rural 
resilience.  Given the critical role water plays in Malawi’s economy, and given that the country’s wealth is still largely 
dominated by natural resources (largely cropland), future growth will depend on reversing land degradation to improve 
productivity, and sustainable management of natural capital (especially forests) to protect water security.     

19. The project also contributes to the WBG’s twin goals of ending extreme poverty and promoting shared 
prosperity. The project area targets the poorest region of Malawi, where rural poverty rates are above 80 percent.  A 
recent study24 shows a strong correlation between areas with highly degraded land and those with a high incidence of 
poverty, implying that increasing levels of land degradation may be contributing to the poverty of millions of Malawians. 
The project will contribute to reversing this trend.

D. Concept Description 

 
22. The proposed project responds to Malawi’s most pressing environmental challenge – severe degradation of the 
renewable natural resources base (land, forests and water resources) that underpins the productive sectors of the 
economy.  The project’s central thesis is that degradation of the renewable natural resources base and high exposure 
and vulnerability to climate change have adversely affected energy and water security, agricultural productivity and 
livelihoods.  The project will contribute to breaking the cycle of degradation in selected watersheds and reducing climate 
vulnerability by (i) strengthening the institutional enabling environment for landscape management at the national, 
local and community level; (ii) investing in productive landscape management and livelihoods in targeted watersheds; 
and (iii) improving hydrometeorological information and services for resilience.  Intervention in these three areas is 
expected to result in increased adoption of resilience-enhancing landscape management practices, which would 
ultimately contribute to improving water and energy security, agricultural productivity and livelihoods.   

23. The proposed project will support GoM’s National Forest and Landscape Restoration Strategy (NFLRS). The 
overall objective of the NFLRS is to restore degraded landscapes for improved water and energy security, agricultural 
productivity and livelihoods. The project will contribute to achieving this objective by investing in restoration activities 
in selected priority watersheds, while at the same strengthening institutions and information for resilience and 
sustainability. Proposed project activities will be organized under five components as outlined in the following 
paragraphs.  

24. Component 1 – Institutional capacity strengthening.  This national level component will finance a package of 
activities designed to strengthen the institutional and policy framework for integrated landscape and water resources 
management at national, district and local levels and will also support the development and piloting of a Payments for 
Ecosystem Services (PES) mechanism for the Shire river basin that could deliver longer-term financing for efforts to 
address land degradation and protect natural resources that generate ecosystem services.    

25. Component 2 – Landscape management and livelihoods support. This component will finance an integrated 
package of interventions designed to protect environmental services and restore degraded landscapes in selected 
watersheds in ways that will also build resilient livelihoods. The component will support: 

• Sustainable land and water management (SLWM) interventions that will focus on catchment planning, river 
and streambank management; and soil and water conservation.  The approach will be based on the successful 
participatory approach tested under SRBMP and codified in the new national guidelines on integrated 
catchment management; 

• Agriculture and resilient livelihoods interventions that will support climate smart agriculture practices to 
increase the resilience of both farmers and landscapes. Support for livelihood diversification through stronger 
engagement with the private sector will also be encouraged; 

• Forestry and protected areas interventions that will be delivered in the context of the NFLRS and will focus on 
strengthening the management and productive contribution of existing natural forests in both state-managed 
forest reserves and on customary land, and protected areas. Forest reserves and protected areas comprise a 
large proportion of the upper part of the landscape, play a key role in protecting ecosystem services and offer 
cost-effective opportunities for avoid the need for costly restoration of natural resources; and

• Development of water management infrastructure will focus on small-scale investments for harvesting, 
storing, and delivering water for people, livestock and agriculture. The menu of water infrastructure 
investments will include small-to-medium dams, small sand and sub-surface dams in dry river beds, area 
infiltration interventions such as semi-circular bunds or soil bunds, and rock catchments. The component 
could also support rehabilitation and/or construction of boreholes for groundwater extraction. Diversification 
of water sources in each target watershed will increase the supply of water for multiple use and therefore 
mitigate against the risk of droughts. 

 
26. Component 3- Hydro-meteorological monitoring and climate services improvement.  This component will invest 
in the expansion and modernization of Malawi’s hydrometeorological monitoring network and associated data 
management and decision-support systems. It will also support the integration, efficiency and scaling up of climate 
information services.  It will support Malawi’s efforts to establish a National Framework for Climate Services (NFCS) 
through investments in the entire value-chain of climate products and services. This component will complement an 
ongoing Green Climate Fund-supported initiative by extending geographical focus to cover southern Malawi and by 
strengthening development of digital solutions.  

27. Component 4–Project management support. This component will finance a package of project management 
support activities to ensure cost-efficient, timely and quality delivery of project activities and results, and will include: 
(i) establishment of a project management support unit with specialized project management professionals to provide 
support to the lead implementing ministry/department and the multi-sectoral technical team; (ii) incremental 
operating costs for day-to-day management of project activities at the national and district levels; and (iii) support to 
multi-sectoral coordination and implementation at the district and local levels.   

28. Component 5 –Contingency Emergency Response. A Contingency Emergency Response Component (CERC) with 
zero allocation will be created and made implementation-ready to allow the GoM to respond quickly in case of an 
eligible emergency. The CERC will complement those in place already under agriculture and nutrition projects and the 
forthcoming Malawi CAT DDO.   The mechanism will be defined in a specific CERC Operational Manual that will clearly 
outline the triggers, eligible expenditures, procurement thresholds, and procedures for using part of IDA resources of 
the project to respond quickly in the event of an eligible emergency. 

29. The project will use, where appropriate, community‐led landscape approaches—that is, an integrated approach 
to sustainably manage natural resources for multiple purposes and functions. Managing natural resources in an 
integrated way across different land uses and connecting them at the landscape level provides the basis for addressing 
trade‐offs and enhancing people’s livelihoods and resilience to climate variability and change.  In the context of the 
project, the operational boundaries of the landscapes are those of the watersheds or micro-watersheds targeted by 
the project.  The project area will include a total of 500 micro-watersheds located in the degradation hotspot areas of 
the Shire River Basin (upper and middle Shire), averaging approximately 500 hectares each.  This includes a total of 305 
micro-watersheds supported under SRBMP and a total of 195 new micro-watersheds to be selected in the upper and 
middle reaches of the Shire river basin, upstream of existing and proposed hydropower plants.  The watersheds 
supported under SRBMP will continue to receive support to allow for full implementation of the watershed 
management plans (or Village-Level Action Plans).  These watersheds will also receive technical assistance to graduate 
from project-based support, including establishment of catchment management committees, in accordance with the 
Water Resources Act 2013.   

30. The estimated cost of the proposed project is US$125 million.  It is proposed to finance this cost through an IDA 
credit of US$120 million and a GEF grant of US$5 million. The final project financing structure will be decided in 
consultation with MoFEPD.

Summary of Screening of Environmental and Social Risks and Impacts 

Project subprojects have not been identified, however screening of potential environmental and social 
impacts has been undertaken on similar subprojects. Possible risks and impacts that are likely to arise from 
some of the proposed subprojects include construction related health and safety risks to both labour and 
local communities; possible influx of populations and the social risks associated with that such as disease 
transmission and spread of HIV, potential for Gender Based Violence; and land acquisition leading to 
temporary or permanent physical displacement and loss of assets, land and livelihoods. Environmental risks 
include those related to civil works construction (controlling on-site erosion and pollution), localized changes 
in water use and distribution. unregulated wood cutting in areas with improved road access (absent adequate 
control measures), potential damage to patches of natural habitat (such as miombo woodland or dambos), 
and possibly increased agro-chemical use.

Other Decision (as needed) 
 

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 

1. Over the past ten years, India has seen strong economic growth - exceeding 7 percent per annum - driven primarily 
by robust private consumption, a resilient services sector, and a revival in some industrial activities. The reduced 
momentum in investment and exports notwithstanding, annual growth rates are still projected to average 7.5 percent per 
annum in coming years because of the diversity in the country’s drivers of growth and the vast scope for improvement in 
many areas.   

2. Alongside this growth, India has achieved significant progress in reducing extreme poverty - from 46 percent in 1993 
to 21 percent in 2011 (using the international poverty line of $1.90 per person per day in 2011 purchasing power parity). 
World Bank estimates point to continued reduction in poverty in more recent years, indicating that the country is on track 
to eliminating extreme poverty by 2030. Urban growth and rising labor earnings due to movement of labor from agriculture 
to non-farm work, an unprecedented rise in wages for unskilled labor, and demographic changes (e.g. a declining 
dependency ratio), underlie the rapid poverty decline.  

3. Over the past three decades, the economy has undergone a structural shift from agriculture as the dominant sector, 
to services and industry. Even then, agriculture continues to be essential for achieving India’s development goals, as the 
sector employs about 59 percent of the country’s total workforce, is a source of livelihood for 70 percent of India’s rural 
households, and is the main source of economic linkages in rural areas. In 2017, the sector contributed about 17 percent 
to the national Gross Domestic Product (GDP). While its contribution to the economy is likely to keep declining, agriculture 
will continue being the single largest contributor to employment and income of the rural population in the foreseeable 
future. 

4. Because of a complex web of policies and institutions that limit the performance of agricultural markets, diminishing 
returns to technologies that once sparked the green revolution, and suboptimal diversification among others, the 
agriculture sector continues to perform below its potential. Long-term agricultural growth has averaged about 3 percent 
per year1 and generally lags the growth rate for the larger economy. Sector growth is subject to large annual shocks, which 
as projected, are expected to be exacerbated by climate change. In addition, India’s agriculture has, for long, been based 
on an unsustainable resource-intensive model, predominantly characterized by inefficient use of water and land 
resources, and as an imperative, will have to shift to higher levels of resource use efficiency, given the country’s low per 
capita natural resource endowments2 and the projected impacts of climate change.  

                                            
1 With decelerating productivity growth of food grains. 
2 With annual per capita water availability of only about 1,000 m3, India is one of the most water-stressed countries in the world.

5. Moving away from its long-running policy focus on raising agricultural output and improving food security, the 
Government of India has now prioritized the doubling of farmers’ incomes by 2022 and through a number of interventions 
e.g. the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) is also committed to accord high priority to improving water use 
efficiency - more crop per drop - in a focused manner3. 

 

Sectoral and Institutional Context 
 
6.  Odisha ranks among the fastest growing economies in India, consistently growing at rates higher than the national 
average. Mirroring the national level, Odisha’s economic growth has been mainly driven by services (43.5 percent of GDP) 
and industry (36.6 percent of GDP). Between 2012 and 2017, per capita incomes in the State increased by 30 percent 
(from Rs. 47,632 to Rs. 61,678) and poverty reduced at an annual rate of 3.5 percent. Despite this good progress, Odisha’s 
per capita income still stands at only 75 percent of the national average.  

7. While Odisha’s economy has transformed from a predominantly agro-based economy, agriculture remains a key 
sector, providing employment and livelihoods to more than 62 percent of the State’s workforce, and contributing close to 
20 percent to its GDP. Indeed, a strong correlation exists between agriculture sector performance and overall state GDP, 
pointing to strong linkages between agriculture and other sectors. 

8. Like much of India, Odisha’s agriculture sector performance, relative to potential, is low. The officially reported 
compound annual average growth rate of 2.8 percent for the sector for the period 2011-17, is below the national average, 
and masks the highly volatile sector performance, which in reality is characterized by significant negative growth every 
alternative year. Consequently, because of low sector performance, Odisha ranks at the bottom in terms of annual farmer 
income (i.e. Rs. 16,884 per family), only outperforming West Bengal, where the average farmer income stands at Rs. 
11,748 per annum.4 

9. Among others, key constraints to the improved performance of Odisha’s agriculture sector include: (i) low 
productivity; (ii) limited diversification; (iii) high exposure and vulnerability to extreme weather events; (iv) access to 
reliable irrigation; and (v) dysfunctional or non-existing value chains for important crops. First off, average yields for major 
crops in Odisha still lag both those in neighboring states with comparable factor endowments and the national averages 
(Table 1), and are far below their potential5.

10. According to the findings of a State-level NITI Aayog Task Force on Agriculture6, these low farm-level yields are 
largely due to limited adoption of productivity enhancing technologies (including the use of improved germplasm), a

degrading natural resource base, inadequate and mostly unreliable irrigation7,8, and weaknesses in the extension system.  

11. Due to several factors9, Odisha’s progress with respect to diversification – an important vehicle for agricultural 
growth - has been mixed at best, even against a backdrop of real shifts in consumer demand towards more diversified 
food baskets. While the net area devoted to rice showed some reduction between 2006 and 2015, the latest year for 
which comprehensive data sets exist, the total area devoted to food grains has been increasing. In fact, according to the 
Odisha Economic Survey of 2017-18 example, the areas under spices, vegetables, fruits, and floriculture - a proxy for 
diversification - declined by 20 percent, 6 percent, 9 percent and 12 percent, respectively, between 2014 and 201710. 

12. In addition, extreme weather events, largely droughts, and to a lesser extent, floods and cyclones, also continue to 
undermine Odisha’s agriculture performance and have been the principal driver of the volatility in sector growth. Figure 
1 for example, shows percent annual growth in rice production-the major crop - over five decades, and attests to the 
vulnerability of the State’s agriculture to the debilitating impacts of extreme weather events, which seem to occur with 
almost predictable periodicity.   

Figure 1: Percent annual  growth in rice production, 1962-201411 

 

 

13. While Odisha has a long history with the menace of drought – going all the way to the drought of 186612 - recent 
trends point to an increasing frequency13 as well as more agricultural areas coming under the ambit of droughts. As 
pointed out in the Odisha Climate Change Action Plan, this trend will be further amplified in the future due to climate 

                                            
7 About 2/3 of the State’s gross cropped area is rain-fed and depends on monsoon – a vast reliance on nature in an environment with highly 
skewed annual rainfall availability.  
8 Of the total cultivable area of 8.7 million ha in the State, irrigation potential has been developed for 2.96 million ha in Kharif and 1.48 million 
ha in Rabi season.

change14. With 2/3 of its gross cropped area under rainfed production and an insignificant use of groundwater, the State 
has few and inadequate instruments to mitigate against climate change-induced weather vagaries.  

14. Moreover, even when Odisha has relatively more water resources than many States in India, Irrigation 
development is low and below the national average.  Of the total cultivated area of 8.7 million ha, only 1.9 million ha (21 
percent) is under irrigation. Only 34 percent of the total irrigation potential of 5.5 million ha has been developed and 
groundwater use is negligible. With limited irrigation development and seasonally skewed rainfall, Odisha is not making 
the most out of every drop of water. In fact, estimates indicate that about 40-50 percent of available rainfall is lost as non-
beneficial evapotranspiration, a loss higher than the neighboring states. In addition, many of the irrigation systems have 
become victim to a vicious cycle of the build-neglect-rebuild. Operation and Maintenance (O&M) is not conduced 
systematically as a result of insufficient funds, the quality of irrigation services degrades and further undermines farmers’ 
willingness and capacity to pay for services. Arrangements for irrigation management have not been adapted to the 
requirements of recent developments, including the use of groundwater, adoption of more individual irrigation 
technologies, and the need to adopt a cascade perspective on irrigation management. 

15. Furthermore, remunerative and reliable markets in Odisha, a precondition for sustained agricultural growth are 
limited, mainly due to poorly functioning value chains. For example, supply chains for otherwise high-value commodities 
(e.g. spices, vegetables) are fragmented and uncoordinated, often involving multiple layers of intermediaries in some 
places, and completely no players in many other places. 

16. The Government of Odisha (GoO) has identified increasing production and productivity, reducing the vulnerability 
of agriculture to climate change, diversification towards high-value crops, rainwater harvesting and improving efficiency 
of water use, improved produce marketing, and addressing absentee landlordism inter alia, as important issues to be 
addressed to improve the performance of the agricultural sector and raise farmer incomes. The proposed project 
contributes to these efforts. The proposal is to support higher agriculture growth, more efficient water use, better quality 
and reliability of irrigation service delivery, and strengthen the resilience to climate change of production systems in six 
districts (see Table 2) in Odisha.  

17. Characterized by highly skewed and variable rainfall patterns15, a lack of perennial rivers, these districts depend on 
a cycle of dry seasons alternating with increasingly uneven and erratic monsoons for water. On average, they suffer from 
marginal drought one in three to five years, moderate drought in six to eight years, and severe drought one in thirty years. 
Among other reasons, the undulating physiography and the predominantly small-sized land holdings limit the technically 
and economically efficient development of centralized major and medium irrigation systems (reservoirs and canals) to 
serve these areas and, they therefore, generally have comparatively lower irrigation coverage than other parts of the State 
(Table 2).

14 Climate projections indicate that drier areas will become drier and flood prone areas will be subject to more flooding. Other problems such 
as pest and disease outbreaks are also likely to increase due to climate change. 
15 When it rains, eighty six percent of the rains fall in the monsoon period (June-October), while the remaining 14 percent occurs during the 
other 7 months of the year, from November to May.

18. The districts therefore, have historically relied on water, stored in cascades of impoundments (tanks) for agricultural 
production and as a buffer against droughts. The tanks support livelihoods of over 300,000 households, most of whom 
are in the poorest quintile. Besides sustaining agricultural livelihoods, the network of tanks in these areas also serves other 
important purposes such as controlling and reducing the impacts of floods - when they occur-and recharging the 
groundwater table. Investing in these districts will also help meet a key policy objective of the GoO to more evenly spread 
the benefits of irrigation - currently confined to a few districts in the form of major and medium irrigation projects16.   

19. Specifically, the project will support sustainable and resilient intensification, judicious diversification17 to high-value 
commodities (especially during the Rabi season and for some areas under upland rice in Kharif), improved produce 
marketing and also incentivize and improve the quality of irrigation service delivery and the reliability of water supply to 
ensure a more efficient, productive and equitable distribution of water to beneficiary farmers throughout the year that is 
more responsive to the more demanding higher value crops. The project builds on the successes of an earlier Bank-
financed Odisha Community Tanks Management Project in bridging the gap between the then existing irrigation potential 
and actual irrigation coverage of selected tanks and expands the engagement further into institutional reforms and 
capacity strengthening for improved system performance, diversification and marketing of farmer produce. 

 

Relationship to CPF 
 

20. The India CPF (2018-2022) argues that for the country to maintain its trajectory of high growth and poverty 
reduction, it must: (i) embrace much more efficient use of the country’s resources, particularly water and land and address 
the impacts of climate change; (ii) foster inclusiveness both for poverty reduction and as a key condition for sustaining 
high rates of economic growth; and (iii) strengthen the agility, performance and responsiveness of public sector 
institutions. One of the three CPF focus areas (Focus Area 1) proposed for Bank engagement is “resource efficient growth” 
where one of the Objectives is promotion of a more resource-efficient, inclusive and diversified growth in the rural sector. 
The proposed project dovetails and is consistent with Bank support (to include inter alia, support to sustainable 
productivity gains, CSA practices, diversification, investments in irrigation and drainage for improved water use efficiency, 
value chains etc.) that is envisaged under this Objective.  

C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  
 
21. The Project Development Objective is to intensify and diversify agricultural production, enhance climate resilience 
and improve water productivity in selected cascades of Odisha. Project beneficiaries include small and marginal farmers, 
Water Users’ Associations (Pani Panchayats), farmer producer organizations, and other agro-entrepreneurs. Targeted 
investments will be undertaken to address any gender gaps as well as benefit other vulnerable groups. 

Key Results (From PCN) 
 

22. The project is expected to lead to increased average yields, increases in the range, volume and value of marketed 
agricultural output, more productive and efficient use of scarce water resources, a more reliable supply and a better 
quality of irrigation service delivery, and improvements in farmers’ capacity to adapt to climate change. Proposed key 
outcome level performance indicators include the following: (i) increase in productivity of selected agricultural

17 Diversification in this context is defined as reducing the emphasis on food grains and increasing the share of high-value 
agriculture. This would be done taking cognizance of the overall country policy intent to shift rice production towards relatively 
more water abundant states like Odisha.

commodities supported by the project (t/ha); (ii) farmers adopting improved agricultural technology (number); (iii) share 
of non-rice products in total production in project areas(percent); (iv) water users provided with new/improved irrigation 
and drainage services (number); (v) acreage under crops that are less water demanding (ha); (vi) productivity of water use 
(kg/m3), and (vii) number of direct project beneficiaries (disaggregated by gender).  

 
D. Concept Description 

 
23. Agricultural production system improvements (e.g. improving productivity, system resilience to climate change and 
resource use efficiency) and market development are known to reinforce each other and are therefore better pursued 
and accomplished together. The proposed project primarily seeks to improve and diversify farmer yields and production, 
improve water productivity and efficiency, build resilience to climate change risks, and improve market access for farmers 
who can generate a marketable surplus in selected districts in Odisha. Producing higher value and more diverse crops puts 
a high premium on the quality and reliability of irrigation service delivery, as they leave no room for water supply errors 
and the higher use of farm inputs significantly increases the stakes. Higher value horticulture crops generally use less 
water as compared to wheat, paddy, sugarcane and cotton. The conceptual framework underlying the proposed design 
therefore links efforts to promote adoption of CSA practices18, diversification and productivity increases, with 
improvements in incentives for technology adoption, quality of water service delivery and water resource management. 
The project will comprise three components as described below: 

Component 1: Climate-Smart Intensification and Diversification of Agriculture 

24. The objective of this component is to increase agricultural productivity, strengthen the capacity of organized farmer 
groups to cope or adapt to climate change stresses affecting crop production, and diversify production in Rabi in response 
to effective demand as expressed by pre-identified commercial off-takers or gleaned from other reliable market signals. 
Support under this component is proposed to be organized around two mutually inclusive, overlapping and reinforcing 
subcomponents. 

Subcomponent 1.1: Support to Improved Productivity and Resilience 

25. This subcomponent aims at supporting and incentivizing farmer adoption of technologies and practices that 
demonstrably deliver the triple-wins of increased productivity, improved resilience to climate shocks and reduced GHG 
emissions, as a co-benefit. The exact nature of technology support will be: (i) a function of the specificities of production 
environments and unique climate vulnerabilities19 in individual cascade; (ii) scaled to farmer capacities and endowments 
and (iii) based on the principles of response to market demand, good choice of improved germplasm, adequate plant 
nutrition, and effective pest and disease management. 

26. In this respect, project support is envisaged to go towards organizing farmers for technology transfer purposes (e.g. 
through farmer field schools), technology sourcing and demonstration, farmer training, improving availability and access 
to productivity enhancing and resilient germplasm by strengthening key segments in the State’s seed production and 
distribution system, and strengthening advisory service provision, currently plagued by weaknesses in the extension 
system - such as inadequate manpower and limited knowledge and skills.   

Subcomponent 1.2: Support to Diversification and Produce Marketing 

27. The objective of this subcomponent is twofold: (i) support farmers to reduce the current emphasis on food grains 

                                            
18 In this context, CSA practices are defined as practices that sustainably increase productivity and farmers’ income and build resilience to 
climate change, while reducing GHG emissions where possible and appropriate 
19 To be mapped for the target districts following approaches developed through a World Bank Non- Lending Technical Assistance to Support 
Implementation of Odisha State Climate Change Action Plan.

(especially rice and wheat) while increasing the share of high-value agriculture (e.g. fruits, spices and vegetables) in their 
overall production structure; and (ii) improve produce marketing to increase incomes and reduce price risks associated 
with diversification. A successful shift in favor of more diversified production would not only generate faster productivity 
and superior incomes for targeted farmers, but will also result into improved nutrition security, help reduce the water 
footprint of paddy, foster biodiversity, and strengthen resilience of the production systems to climate change.  

28. Project support to diversification and improved marketing is proposed to follow productive alliance approaches, 
which bring together organized farmers, produce buyers, technical service providers and leverage private sector financing 
to address market imperfections and build competitive value chains for select commodities. In this respect, the project 
could provide funding for several activities, including but not limited to: (i) awareness creation of diversification among 
farmers; (ii) identification of competitive value chains; (iii) farmer experimentation with new crops and 
training/demonstration of relevant production technology; (iv) strengthening of farmers for collective action (including in 
production, aggregation, technology transfer, among others); (v) business plan development; and (vi) selected productive 
investments - as would be identified in the business plans. Project support to crop diversification will be based on 
agronomic/agro-ecological suitability, comparative advantage of specific cascades, and local, national or international 
market opportunities. To further diversify farmer income streams (a key adaptation strategy) and maximize the utility and 
productivity of water stored in the tanks, during preparation, the project will explore the feasibility of using the tanks for 
seasonal aquaculture.  

Component 2: Improving Access to Irrigation and Water Productivity  

29. Access to reliable irrigation is generally critical to enhancing crop productivity, building resilience to climate change, 
promoting diversification and access to markets. It is doubly important in the targeted project areas that are characterized 
by frequent droughts and highly variable rainfall availability. Bridging increasingly longer dry spells during Kharif and 
producing more demanding higher value and more diverse crops during Rabi when the stakes are higher and when there 
is no margin for water supply errors, puts a high premium on the quality of irrigation services.   

30. Among others, reliability of irrigation services and a more productive use of water resources in the project areas is 
weighed down by: (i) the poor condition of hydraulic assets- mainly due to deferred maintenance; (ii) limited knowledge 
and skills in water management - often inadequate to provide supplemental irrigation during Kharif season, and to cover 
water-stress conditions during Rabi; and (iii) weak arrangements for O&M. Additionally, most of the tank irrigation 
systems have been developed for rice cultivation and need to be adapted for a more diversified and more demanding 
cropping system.  

31. The proposed project aims to improve the performance of irrigation throughout the year and across cascades of 
selected tank irrigation systems through modernization of hydraulic assets, institutional reforms, and capacity 
strengthening. The objective is to use water more efficiently, reduce water losses and save water during Kharif season, 
and transfer these savings to Rabi season. Capacities for irrigation management (including the introduction of asset 
management) will be strengthened to provide higher quality services. In addition, the project will promote sustainable 
groundwater use to supplement scanty rainfall and mitigate increasing rainfall variability. Key outcome indicators include 
the productivity of water use ($/m3) and the number of water users provided with new/improved irrigation and drainage 
services (number). 

Subcomponent 2.1: Irrigation Modernization 

32. The project will invest in the modernization of hydraulic assets. To that end, a comprehensive water assessment will 
be conducted in the Project cascades to identify opportunities for reducing water losses and for transferring the savings 
to Rabi season. For each of these opportunities, the implications on downstream water use will be identified through 
preparation of a pre- and post-project cascade-wide water balance. Investments include strengthening of canal bunds, 
modernizing hydraulic canal structures, installation of field channels and sub-surface pressurized pipes, and developing

groundwater extraction. The project will also help farmers access subsidies at central and state level for the promotion of 
pressurized irrigation at chak level. In line with GoO’s intention, where feasible, the project will finance investments 
through DBOTs on a Hybrid Annuity Basis. 

Subcomponent 2.2: Irrigation Management 

33. Crop diversification and intensification require a higher quality of irrigation service delivery to meet the 
requirements of more demanding crops. Traditional arrangements for irrigation management often lack the capacities 
and incentives to deliver these improved services. The project will pursue institutional reforms and pilot the use of private 
(publicly funded) operators that will be incentivized to deliver high performing irrigation and O&M services through DBOT 
contracts on a Hybrid Annuity basis – in conformity with GoO’s intentions.  

34. The Project will promote conjunctive management and sustainable use of both ground- and surface water resources 
by improving groundwater monitoring linking these with irrigation scheduling decisions. The Project will also establish a 
surface and groundwater monitoring and benchmarking system and will (i) link these data to decision making on irrigation 
scheduling, and (ii) significantly improve citizen engagement in the management of irrigation systems.  

35. The project will strengthen capacities of farmers and Pani Panchayats through Farmers’ Field Schools and 
demonstrations, among others in modern irrigation technologies, improving irrigation efficiency and rational hydraulic 
asset management. The project will also introduce the allocation of investment resources on the basis of scheme 
performance (including abidance by agreed water allocation, meeting efficiency targets and cost recovery). Capacities will 
also be strengthened to improve the management and maintenance of hydraulic assets. 

Component 3: Project Management 

36. This component will strengthen capacities for project management, monitoring and evaluation (M&E) (including, 
inter alia, the areas of procurement and financial management) through the provision of goods, consultant services, 
training, and financing of incremental operating costs. This component will also develop a comprehensive management 
information and data collection and reporting system on key performance outputs and impact indicators through baseline 
surveys, participatory assessments, mid-term reviews and final evaluations. Staffing of the PMU will include a number of 
technical, financial management, M&E and safeguards (social and environmental) experts. Detailed implementation 
arrangements will be spelled out in the Project Operational Manual. (POM). Regular training of PMU staff will be organized 
to strengthen their capacities to implement the project. 

 
    

  SAFEGUARDS 

 
A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 

 
Odisha is located on the east coast of India along the Bay of the Bengal. The state has coastal line of about 450 km, and a 

geographical area of 155,707 sq. km which accounts for 4.87% of the total area of India. The state of Odisha can be 
divided into five agro-ecological zones: (1) The coastal plains, (2) The middle mountainous range – part of Eastern Ghats 
mountain range, (3) The rolling uplands, (4) river valleys, and (5) subdued plateaus. While the state has a wide network of 
river basins and sub-basins, it is mainly associated with 3 major river basins; Brahamani, Mahanadi and Vansadhara. 
Despite such diverse natural resource base, it’s agriculture sector has been performing well below its potential. Among 
key constraints to the improved performance of Odisha’s agriculture sector include: (i) low productivity; (ii) limited 
diversification; (iii) high exposure and vulnerability to extreme weather events; and (iv) dysfunctional or non-existing 
value chains for important crops.

To address these concerns, the project will invest on repair and rehabilitation of about 600 tanks spread across the state 
to revive small holder farming. The interventions will include: improving the efficiency of water assets, modernizing the 
irrigation systems, enhancing agriculture productivity, promoting adaptive agriculture practices, enhancing fishery 
production,  and promotion of climate friendly agri-business practices. 
  
 
 

 
B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 

 
Government of Odisha has recently completed a project of this nature, reflecting that the implementation capacity has 

already been established to address environment and social safeguard implications. The PMU is already in place, and the 
consultancy services for conducting ESMF, IPNM and TDP are already in place. Safeguard compliance tools needed are 
already available with the Government of Odisha to be used during the proposed project.

D. Policies that might apply 

 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

The physical investments under the project would 
include rehabilitation of existing water assets such as 
strengthening of canal bunds, modernizing hydraulic 
canal structures, installation of field channels, etc. 
where improper construction could result in adverse 
impacts. The investments under the climate resilient 
agriculture practices could result in positive impacts 
on the environment with effective planning and 
implementation. The project has been categorized as 
category B. There is no large scale, significant and/or 
irreversible impacts envisaged due to the proposed 
project interventions. An Environmental and Social 
Assessment (ESA) will be undertaken to identify 
environment and social issues of significance. Based 
on ESA, an Environmental and Social and Management 
Framework (ESMF) will be prepared toadress the 
requirements of a category B project, to manage risks 
and maximize environmental and social opportunities. 
Both the ESA and ESMF will take into account 
experiences and lessons from the previous project.

Performance Standards for Private Sector 
Activities OP/BP 4.03 

No No impact is expected due to project interventions. 

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 Yes 

The rehabilitation and modernization of the tank 
system is likely to improve the water storage capacity 
and wetlands in the upper catchment. As the 
rehabilitation of tanks may impact natural resources 
including wetlands (if any). The ESA that  will help 
ascertain such impacts, and will develop a screening 
mechanisms that will help identify and avoid impacts 
on sensitive environmental habitats and important 
ecosystems. As details of the exact sites of the 
proposed investments are yet to be finalized, the 
ESMF would include all adequate measures for any 
negative effects on natural habitats. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No No activities impacting on forests will be undertaken 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

The project will not directly finance pesticides, but 
improved irrigation efficiency and subsequent increase 
in crop productivity and diversification may induce 
pesticide use. The project will strictly use IPNM 
(Integrated Pest and Nutrition Management) 
approach. In addition, the ESMF will have a detailed 
local specific IPNM strategy for the project. This will 
reduce the reliance on chemical pesticides, include all 
measure for labour health and safety for pesticide 
application and usage, and guidance on training and 
demonstrations, that will be provided so that there is 
no significant adverse impact on the environment and 
public health. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 No No impact is expected due to project interventions. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 Yes 

The state has a sizeable tribal population - 22.5% of 
the total population. In fact, Odisha is unique in having 
distinct tribal areas enshrined under the 5th Schedule 
of the Indian Constitution. At this stage, investment 
plans and locations are not known, and therefore, a 
Tribal Peoples Planning Framework (TPPF) will be 
prepared. Subsequently, sub-project specific Tribal 
Development Plans will be developed as and when 
sub-project locations are finalized. 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 No 

The project does not anticipate any form of land 
acquisition or involuntary resettlement impacts as it 
would cover the existing  tank with a focus on repair 
and rehabilitation only. 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 Yes 
No new dam construction will be  supported under the 
project. The project will rehabilitate and modernize 
the existing rainwater harvesting structures (known as

Tanks and each having more than 40 Ha of command 
areas). Some of them would be having earthen 
embankments above 10 meters high, hence the 
project is triggered. 
This policy was triggered during the previous project, 
and a Dam Safety panel was put in place. The same 
Dam Safety panel will continue for this project under 
the technical guidance from the Chief Engineer, 
Central Designs Organization. The project will seek 
better coordination with the Dam Safety panel and 
support safety enhancement of the tank system as 
part of the tank rehabilitation. 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

No 
There is no evidence that the project would impact on 
any international water ways 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No Project areas do not fall in any disputed areas. 

 
E. Safeguard Preparation Plan  
 
Tentative target date for preparing the Appraisal Stage PID/ISDS 
 
Mar 31, 2019 
 
Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed. The specific studies and 
their timing should be specified in the Appraisal Stage PID/ISDS 
 
The Borrower has already engaged consultants who shall commence preparation of the safeguards instruments soon. 

They shall undertake ESA to prepare Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF), Tribal Peoples Planning 
Framework (TPPF), Integrated Pest Management Plan (IPMP) / Integrated Nutrient Management Plan (IPNM). These 
instruments are expected to be ready by March 31, 2019, or before appraisal and will be publically disclosed.  
The ESMF will provide essential baseline data, confirm policies that are triggered, assess likely impacts of the project 

interventions. The ESMF will also propose mitigation measures for any adverse impacts that may be envisaged through 
the design and construction phases of various interventions. Recommendations for strengthening institutional capacity, 
and estimate the budget required for the implementation will also be included. Assessments will be participatory with 
extensive consultations with all the stakeholders.

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 

 

1. Uganda has made significant progress in economic growth and poverty reduction over the last 30 years, 

rural poverty remains a major challenge. Following policy reforms that allowed market liberalization and led to 

political stability, Uganda registered high economic growth between 1987 and 2010, with Gross Domestic 

Product (GDP) averaging 5.1 percent1 in the last five years. The structure of the Ugandan economy has also 

undergone a major transformation during the same period, with a notable shift from a primarily agriculture-based 

economy to one dominated by services and industry. In 20152, the service sector became the largest contributor 

to GDP (52.8 percent), followed by agriculture (25.8 percent) and industry (21.4 percent), respectively. In line 

with its economic growth, the country achieved remarkable results in poverty reduction, cutting extreme poverty 

by half, between 1993 and 20063. The recent National Household Survey has however showed an increase in 

poverty from 19.7% in 2012/13 to 27% in 2016/17. The main poverty challenges are food insecurity, low 

agricultural productivity, a degrading natural resource base, inadequate planning for the rapid urbanization and 

low access to basic infrastructure and services.  

 

2. Agriculture has been a key driver of economic growth and poverty reduction in Uganda, irrigation 

development is essential for food security and agriculture transformation. As Uganda’s largest single economic 

sector, generating about one quarter of GDP and employing 70 percent of the labor force, agriculture plays a 

critical role for income generation, employment and livelihoods, particularly for the bottom 40% of the 

population, as well as overall economic development. In spite of the gradual decline in its GDP contribution, 

typical of transforming economies, agriculture remains the key source of exports contributing 80% of total 

exports. The agriculture sector supports over 80% of the poorest of the population, the rural areas account for 

94% of the poor, and 85% of the population. This demonstrates the high potential multiplier effect of agricultural 

growth on the socio-economic development of the country. Irrigation development which is now very limited in 

the Uganda is essential to increase agricultural productivity, manage the increasing climate risks and enable

commercial cultivation in the country. In recognizing the critical roles of irrigation, the government in the Vision 

2040 and NDP II (2016-2020) lists irrigation investment as a high priority along with agricultural value-chain 

development. The goal is to transform the small-holder subsistence cultivation into modern commercial farming 

to increase production, productivity and farm income.  
 

Sectoral and Institutional Context 

 

3. The regulatory framework for irrigation in Uganda is generally aligned with international good 

practice although detailed implementation regulations and management institutions require strengthening.   

The Water Act (1995) provides the institutional framework and legislation for water resources management, 

irrigation, water supply and sanitation. The National Water Policy defines the responsibilities of different entities 

in water resource development, promotes water resource assessment and planning for irrigation, and calls for 

increasing the capacity of the farmers to access and use water for crop, fishery and livestock production. The 

Water Resources Management Reform Strategy (2005) provides for decentralized water resources management 

at the zone and basin levels. On the agricultural side, the 2010 National Agricultural Policy (NAP) stipulates the 

sectoral approach to the National Development Plan, emphasizes the need for rehabilitating government irrigation 

schemes, transferring the management responsibility of irrigation schemes to lowest appropriate levels, 

establishing new irrigation schemes, and increasing water storage for livestock and wildlife. The Agriculture 

Sector Strategic Plan (2015/16-2019/20) includes strategic interventions to increase access to water for 

agricultural production. The National Irrigation Policy (2017) lays out the guiding principles and general 

institutional arrangement for irrigation development and management, including coordinated planning, 

implementation, and service delivery, as well as cost recovery and beneficiary participation through water user 

associations (WUAs). The policy recognizes the role of farmers managing small-scale schemes, and encourages 

a community-based irrigation management approach. The National Irrigation Master plan (MWE 2011-2035) 

stipulates the priority irrigation development areas and schemes over short, medium and long terms.  

 

4. Irrigation, also called water for agricultural production (WfAP), is a shared responsibility between the 

Ministry of Water and Environment (MWE) and the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries 

(MAAIF). MWE takes overall responsibility for irrigation and off-farm irrigation development while MAAIF for 

water use and management of on-farm agricultural water facilities. Horizontal and vertical coordination is often 

lacking. Overall policy guidance to the water subsector is provided by the Water Policy Committee, comprising 

members from relevant sectors. Technical guidance to the sector is provided by the cross-sectoral Water and 

Environment Sector Working Group (WESWG), which includes recommendations of budget and programs, and 

sector performance assessment.   

 

5. Agriculture and irrigation are performing well below their potentials.    Uganda has a diverse agricultural 

production system primarily based on small-scale manual subsistence farming, and comprising a system of mixed 

agriculture with perennial and annual crops in most of the seven agro-ecological zones. The main crops are cereals 

(maize, sorghum, millet, rice) on some 1.7 million ha for the two cropping cycles out of the total 14.4 million ha 

agricultural area: root crops (25%), banana (17%), as well as pulses, oil seeds, coffee, vegetables and fruits. Export 

crops include coffee, tea, tobacco, cotton, cut flowers, and cocoa. Food crop production dominates the agriculture 

sector, contributing over 55% of the agricultural GDP, while cash crops contribute 17% and livestock 15%. 

Despite the dominance of food crop production, one third is marketed with export being less than 7%. The sector 

is seeing a trend of moving towards higher-value crops (perennial and seasonal) such as Tea, Cocoa, fruits etc.,

with more clear commercial and export orientation.  

 

6. Agriculture is mainly rain-fed with only 1.3% of total cultivated land under irrigation over a potential of 

1.1million ha (AICD/IFPRI, 2010) and 3.0 million ha (NBI 2012). Therefore, the sector is very vulnerable to 

climate change and variability. According to the 2017 National Food Security Assessment and IPC, around 31 

percent of the population was food insecure (in January 2017) and this deterioration was partly due to the drought 

conditions caused by the 2016/17 El Niño and La Niña climatic events. This highlights the inadequate climate 

resilience of agricultural production and farming communities. The crop yield and productivity in the country are 

well below their potentials, for example, the yield of maize in the country is around 2.4 tons/ha while in some 

parts of world farmers could easily produce with irrigation, 10-15 ton/ha of maize. The main contributing factors 

found by different studies are lack of reliable water supply (irrigation), quality of production inputs, poor 

extension services and little value-chain development. As a result, food insecurity and malnutrition as well as 

very low agricultural income are still major challenges for the country. Many households suffer from food 

insecurity and high levels of malnutrition, with 34% of children under 5 years being stunted. The most food-

insecure region is the North, followed by the East, in terms of dietary energy consumption. In the North, 59% of 

households consume only one meal per day. The number of food-insecure people in Uganda is projected to rise 

from 7 million in 2015 to 30 million by 2025. 

 

7. Irrigation development is still at preliminary stage in the country. To date, a total of some 15,000 ha of 

public small scale irrigation schemes (largest 600-800 ha) has been developed, mostly in the form of valley tanks 

and river diversion schemes. The government ministries are responsible for scheme construction, and once the 

schemes are completed farmers operate the schemes. There is no dedicated irrigation management authority and 

the irrigation service concept is not fully developed. Irrigation water charge is being exercised in some places. 

Operation and maintenance of irrigation schemes have been essentially informal until in the past few years when 

farmer-based irrigation management through WUAs and farmer cooperative societies were piloted under AfDB 

funded irrigation rehabilitation project, which has mixed results. Negligence and deferred maintenance are 

common phenomena, management capacity at national, district and scheme levels is rather limited, sustainability 

of the existing schemes are questionable. 

8. The Government has developed a strategy for irrigation development and management.     The NDP II 

(2016-2020) and the Country Partnership Framework (CPF) both recognize investment in irrigation as one of the 

keys to the country’s transformation. The NDP II Objectives related to irrigation include: increasing production 

and productivity along the value chain; addressing challenges in selected thematic technical areas including 

critical farm inputs, mechanization and irrigation; improving agricultural markets and institutional strengthening 

for agricultural development. Institutional strengthening is crucial, alongside investments in rural infrastructure 

and markets, farmer aggregation in producer associations and agricultural extension systems, to support the shift 

to higher-value agricultural production. The government has committed itself to increasing agricultural growth to 

6 percent per year and allocate at least 10 percent of the budget to the agricultural sector. In order to address the 

irrigation development and management challenges, the government has formulated an irrigation development 

strategy. The strategy includes the following key elements: (a) boosting irrigation infrastructure development 

investment through difference sources; (b) promoting integrated planning and coordinated implementation among 

irrigation, agriculture and related sectors; (c) rolling out the National Irrigation Policy and detailed 

implementation regulations; (d) developing  irrigation management institutions and farmer water user groups 

(WUAs) as well as service charge based cost recovery mechanisms for sustainable irrigation service delivery; and 

(e) strengthening agricultural support services through different pathways, including public service delivery,

farmer-based cooperatives/enterprises and partnership with the private sector. The 2017 National Irrigation 

Policy sets an ambitious target of total irrigated area of 400,000 ha by 2040, with the objectives of achieving 

national food security, transforming the agriculture sector and significantly increasing agricultural income, 

through increasing production and productivity, improving drought-resilience of farming communities, and 

investing in agricultural value-chain development. To implement the above strategy, the government requested 

the World Bank to support its irrigation development agenda with focus on irrigation infrastructure development, 

irrigation management institution development and value-chain development.  

 
Relationship to CPF 

 

9. The CPF of the World Bank Group for the Republic of Uganda for the period of FY16-21 responds to the 

Government of Uganda vision of a transformed society from a peasant economy to a modern and prosperous 

country by 2040, and its interim goal to attain middle income status by 2020 as described in the second National 

Development Plan (NDP II). The CPF is designed to contribute directly to achieving the Sustainable Development 

Goals, focusing on three strategic areas: (a) strengthening governance, accountability and service delivery; (b) 

Raising incomes in rural areas; and (c) boosting inclusive growth in urban areas. 

 

10. The proposed project, marked as an FY19 lending operation, directly supports the Strategic Focus Area B 

of the CPF: Raising incomes in rural areas, by increasing agricultural productivity, improving the climate 

resilience of the poor and vulnerable farming communities. The project aims to modernize both the physical 

infrastructure system (including technology) and management and service institutions, required for sustainable 

irrigation services and agricultural transformation. This is well aligned with the GoU’s Vision 2040 and 

agricultural development strategy.  
 
C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  

 

11. Program Development Objective:   The proposed program development objectives are to improve 

financially sustainable irrigation and drainage services, and increase farmers’ agricultural revenue in the project 

areas. The objective will be achieved through a phased investment program to be implemented over 10-12 years, 
with each phase focusing on one or two priority region(s). 

 

12. Proposed (Phase 1) Project Development Objectives:   The development objectives of the project are 

to develop irrigation and drainage infrastructure and services, and institutional capacity for irrigated agricultural 

production in the project areas. The schemes under Phase 1 will focus in one or two regions such as southwestern 

and northern regions. 

Key Results (From PCN) 

 

13. The key results (PDO) indicators for Phase 1 Project would likely include the following: (a) Farmers/Area 

provided with new/improved irrigation and drainage infrastructure services (no./ha); (b) Operational WUAs 

established or strengthened (number); (c) farmer cooperatives or organizations established or strengthened 

(number); (d) Change in crop intensity; and (e) Irrigation service fee established.

D. Concept Description 
 

14. Project concept and overall approach:    The proposed project will adopt a programmatic approach, 

based on the strategic vision that sustainable irrigation infrastructure operation and services depend upon 

helping farmers turn agriculture into a profitable business. The overall thinking is that reliable and affordable 

irrigation infrastructure and services enable high agricultural production and productivity leading to increase in 

farmer household income, that will enable farmers to pay for the irrigation and associated support services, and 

invest in high-value cultivation including value-chain development; and such investments demand high quality 

services to achieve the expected returns and foster a virtuous cycle of irrigated agriculture development. In view 

of the time required to complete the above development cycle, a three bite-sized program through a series of 

projects (SOP) is conceived for the proposed operation.  

 

15. The Program would be implemented over a period of 10-12 years. It targets a total irrigated area of some 

25,000-35,000 ha at a cost of US$400-500 million directly benefiting some 200,000 small and medium sized 

farmers (tentative, assuming an average 1 ha landholding for a household of six) in the water stressed areas with 

high development potential and/or where there is significant food insecurity issues. Phase 1 project will lay the 

foundation for the subsequent phases. Each phase will have different focus on infrastructure, institutions and 

productivity/income. Each phase prepares follow-up investments for the next phase, while every phase aims to 

bring the project objectives of the previous phase to a new level. Funding sources of the Program beyond Phase 

1 would be more diverse including possible private sector investments. The program focus, phasing, and coverage 

are shown in the Annex. 

 

16. Project Design Guiding Principles and Scheme Selection Criteria:  The project design will follow the 

guiding principles below: (a) integrated investment planning and joint preparation; (b) complementarity and 

synergy with related (agricultural) investment programs; (c) institutional design to ensure sustainability of project 

facilities and service delivery, with adequate arrangements, capacity building for cost recovery and user/private 

sector involvement; and (d) simple project design with adequate implementation readiness before approval.  

 

17. Project Composition:    The proposed Phase 1 Project at an initially estimated cost of US$150-200 

million, will have three components, i.e. irrigation infrastructure development, essential support services for 

agricultural production and value-chain development, and institutional strengthening including implementation 

support. At this stage, the project is estimated to develop some 10,000 ha of new irrigated area, directly benefiting 

around 60,000 poor small to medium farmers. The component description and indicative costs are as follows:   

Component 1.  Irrigation infrastructure development (US$175 million):   The objective of this component is to 

develop the irrigation and drainage infrastructure primarily for supplemental gravity irrigation services. It will 

finance construction and equipment for the water source works (storage reservoirs, river diversion weirs and 

pumping stations), related catchment management interventions, and three to five irrigation systems (including 

main canal and drainage system, cross structures, on-farm works, and operation and maintenance (O&M) 

facilities), associated resettlement and environmental management costs. It will also finance consultancies for 

scheme feasibility studies, designs and safeguards assessments including for the follow-up investments. The 

schemes are likely to concentrate on southwestern and northern regions. This is in view of the promising 

commercial production prospect (southwestern) and high drought-vulnerability and severe food insecurity 

(northern), and very importantly implementation readiness for a successful first phase. Scheme selection will be 

guided by the GoU irrigation master plan and groundwater option considered where adequate studies exist.

Uganda Irrigation Modernisation Project (P163836) 

 
 

  
Nov 27, 2017 Page 8 of 18  

     

Component 2.  Essential support services for agricultural production and value-chain development (US$15 

million):   This component aims at filling critical gaps in provision of essential support services for crop 

production and value-chain development.  It will include strengthening farmer groups/cooperatives for better 

access to quality inputs and appropriate technologies or practices with the aim of improving production and 

productivity. It will also support value chain development and market linkages to increase the value of traded 

items for better economic gains to the target population. The interventions will largely involve retaining experts 

for diagnostic assessments and for imparting knowledge and skills to the beneficiary communities; and provide 

financial support in form of credit or matching grants towards investment in produce storage facilities and value 

addition technologies. Interventions under this component will be complementary to the ongoing agricultural 

development operations by the government and other development partners, such as the Bank-financed 

Agricultural Cluster Development Project (ACDP), the Millennium Village Project (MVP), and the EU-funded 

Common Market for East and Southern Africa (COMESA) initiative. The approach to be adopted for this 

component would be consistent with that followed by the ACDP for improving farmer access to quality 

agricultural inputs and post-harvest handling.  

Component 3.  Institutional Strengthening and Implementation Support (US$8 million):  This component is 

intended to strengthen irrigation management institutions through technical assistance and capacity building and 

implementation support. The institutional strengthening will finance: (a) consultancies for irrigation regulations 

and guidelines development, and necessary supporting studies (e.g. irrigation water tariff) for implementing the 

national irrigation policy; (b) consultancies and training for formulation and capacity building of irrigation 

management organizations for irrigation service delivery and system O&M , including management entities and 

farmer irrigation water users associations (WUAs); and (c) training and consultancies for skills development for 

staff at national, district and scheme levels including beneficiary communities and farmers, in irrigation policy 

and regulations, irrigation technology and management, and agricultural water management. Implementation 

support will include technical and project management consultancies, necessary facilities (goods) and incremental 

operating costs for project implementation management.  

18. Lessons learned and considered in the project design:  The lessons learned from irrigation and irrigated 

agriculture operations supported by the Bank and other development partners in Uganda and elsewhere, which 

will be incorporated in the project design include the following: 

(a) Sustainable irrigation investments require development at adequate scale and support over a sufficiently 
long period to break the vicious cycle of irrigation (or irrigated agriculture) development; 

(b) Project design (complexity) should be compatible with the client capacity and development stage in the 
sector. The general implementation performance of Bank-financed agricultural operations in Uganda has 

been significantly below expectation, and therefore warranting a simple and realistic project design;  

(c) Integrated irrigation and agricultural investment planning, preparation, implementation and operational 
management are crucial prerequisite to successful irrigation projects;  

(d) Institutional design for irrigation operations should cover the entire project cycle. Participation of 
beneficiary communities through water user groups in irrigation system O&M and service delivery is 

essential for sustainable operation. Private sector involvements in irrigation and agricultural supporting 

services can enhance service delivery efficiency and performance;  

(e) Farmer-based irrigation scheme management arrangements have limitations particularly for larger 
schemes as reflected under the Uganda’s irrigation rehabilitation projects and other management models 

(options) need to be explored for managing the project schemes;

Uganda Irrigation Modernisation Project (P163836) 

 
 

  
Nov 27, 2017 Page 9 of 18  

     

(f) The project related social and environmental risks are adequately assessed and used to inform and 
influence the project design, and a robust institutional mechanism put in place for resettlement and 

safeguards risk management during implementation; and 

(g) Project implementation readiness at appraisal is critical for smooth implementation and timely completion 

19.    The proposed project will be implemented by the Ministry of Water and Environment (MWE). The 

Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fishery (MAAIF) will be involved in implementation of Component 

2. The district local governments (DLGs) and local communities at the locations of the project schemes will 

participate in implementation of different components. A project steering committee (PSC) chaired by the 

permanent secretary for water, and comprising senior officials from MAAIF and related ministries and districts, 

will be established to provide strategic directions, policy guidance, and high-level coordination. The existing 

project management unit (PMU) of MWE with experienced project management, procurement and safeguards 

staff, will function as the PMU for overall project management and coordination, and the secretariat to the PSC. 

An integrated implementation team comprising technical, agricultural and institutional staff from national and 

local government will be established at each location for execution of scheme-specific activities.    

  SAFEGUARDS 

 
A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 

 
The schemes are likely to concentrate on southwestern and northern regions. This is in view of the promising commercial 

production prospect (southwestern) and high drought-vulnerability and severe food insecurity (northern), and very 
importantly implementation readiness for a successful first phase. Scheme selection will be guided by the Government of 
Uganda (GoU) irrigation master plan and agreed selection criteria and process. Groundwater option shall be considered 
where adequate studies exist. As described in the project concept note, the project will finance construction of 20-30 m 
high storage dams on rivers and other water source works, several large scale new irrigation and drainage canal systems 
each with 1,000-4,000 ha of command area, as well as catchment management and agricultural water management and 
essential supporting services. Significant resettlement and labor influx are anticipated at some project schemes although 
land redistribution is not required. The project is expected to boost agricultural productivity through crop intensification 
and diversifications as well as value chain development. 
 
B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 

 
Although the ministry of water and environment (MWE) as the implementing agency for the project has substantial 

experience in implementing World Bank funded projects and have overall social and environmental safeguards capacity, 
the envisaged project implementation unit (Directorate of Water Development, DWD) may require capacity 
enhancement. As such, a project management unit (PMU) will be established in the ministry's liaison department which 
has long years of experiences in managing water infrastructure projects financed by the Bank, to augment DWD’s capacity 
to manage the project. At District/Local Government level, there are District and Community Development Officers whose 
Safeguards Capacity will be enhanced as appropriate. A comprehensive safeguards capacity assessment of the project 
implementers will be carried out as part of the formulation of safeguards instruments and where necessary, 
enhancement measures will be proposed and implemented before project activities start.

D. Policies that might apply 

 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

The project involves a number of interventions and 
investments such as large-scale irrigation 
infrastructure. Typically the irrigation infrastructure 
works will occur over a large area of some 10,000 
hectares in Phase 1 (25,000 – 35,000 hectares over 3 
phases) and may lead to large scale environmental and 
social impacts, affecting a wider area, and resulting in 
significant health and safety impacts, including labor 
influx and associated socio-economic aspects. Because 
of this, the project has been assigned EA Category A. 
This Category A project is preparing two independent 
Environmental and Social Impact Assessments (ESIAs) 
for the planned Nyimur (North East) and Kabuyanda 
(South West) schemes, which will respectively cover 
approximately 2,741 and 3,663 hectares, under Phase 
1 project. Civil works will include construction of dams 
20-30 meters high and associated reservoirs, and 
establishement of irrigation systems in the command 
areas. The studies will also include Environmental and 
Social Management Plans (ESMP), Pest Management 
Plans (PMP) for the priority schemes. During 
preparation of ESIAs for the individual sub-projects 
sites, Cumulative Impact Assessment will be part of 
the assessment and appropriate mitigation measures 
captured in the ESMPs for implementation. The ESIAs’ 
preparation has included extensive stakeholder 
consultations, which will continue after the ESIA 
reports are publicly disclosed and during project 
implementation. Since these two ESIAs are 
deliberative, their findings (including impacts) shall be 
included in the Appraisal ISDS after clearance by the 
RSA and disclosure by both the Bank and GoU. Since at 
this stage only two irrigation schemes shall be 
subjected to ESIAs and RAPs, Environmental and Social 
Management Frameworks (ESMFs) will be drafted to 
guide the mitigation of impacts for schemes whose 
detailed designs are to be completed during 
implementation stage. They will include an annex with 
an Environmental and Social Screening form for sub-
project activities under component 1.. The 
Frameworks will also cover auxiliary facilities which 



 
The World Bank  
Uganda Irrigation Modernisation Project (P163836) 

 
 

  
Nov 27, 2017 Page 11 of 18  

     

are normally not covered under the first set of 
ESIAs/RAPs, and these shall include guidance on 
acquisition, operation and management of facilities 
such as workers’ camps, equipment storage areas, 
material sites, waste management sites, etc. The 
ESMPs will include environmental rules for contractors 
that cover site-specific technical specifications, Labor 
Influx Management Plans, Labor Camp Management 
Plans, Code of Conducts for all construction personnel, 
and recommended penalties for non-compliance. 
These ESIAs and ESMPs will demonstrate how the 
project would comply with all applicable rules and 
guidelines, including: (i) all triggered World Bank 
Safeguard Policies; (ii) relevant World Bank Group 
Environmental, Health and Safety Guidelines; (iii) 
World Bank guidance on Managing the Risks of 
Adverse Impacts on Communities from Temporary 
Project Induced Labor Influx; (iv) Guidelines on the 
establishment of a functioning Grievance Redress 
Mechanism (GRM); (v) World Bank Africa Region’s 
Interim Guidelines for Safeguards Application in 
Agricultural Water Management Projects; and (vi) 
Uganda National Environment Management 
Authority’s (NEMA) Guidelines for Environmental 
Impact Assessment and Environmental Auditing for 
Irrigation and Drainage Operations. In addition, a 
Stakeholder Engagement/Communication Plan will be 
drafted during project preparation to ensure that two 
levels of consultations are carried out  with adequate 
involvement of all stakeholders, including women and 
members of vulnerable groups. These Plans will serve 
as a tool for having an open and continuous 
communication with the affected communities. The 
communications strategy will be updated to include 
measures to address specific issues related to labor 
influx that will be explored by the social assessments, 
such as child labor, harassment of any sort, safety and 
security, gender-based violence (GBV), Sexual 
Exploitation and Abuse (SEA), HIV/AIDS and so on. 
 
The ESIAs and RAPs, including ESMPs and PMPs for the 
priority schemes and the framework instruments 
(ESMF and RPF) will be cleared and disclosed in-
country and on the World Bank’s external website by 
project’s appraisal.

Performance Standards for Private Sector 
Activities OP/BP 4.03 

  

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 Yes 

The project is designed to minimize any adverse 
impacts on natural habitats as a result of irrigation 
development, while strengthening the management of 
vulnerable catchment areas. This policy is triggered 
because irrigation development will take place in 
wetlands and river areas and may have an impact on 
the remnants of natural habitats, both downstream of 
the command area, and in the catchments where 
deforestation and land clearing activities may be 
carried out. It is, however, expected that no 
environmentally sensitive habitats will be significantly 
converted under this project, rather environmental 
conservation will be encouraged at the project sites. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 Yes 

The policy is triggered because of envisaged potential 
impacts on forest habitats as a result of dam 
construction and water collection/harvesting and 
delivery systems. Detailed information on site specific 
impacts on forests will be provided in the ESIAs to be 
prepared for the different project sites and 
appropriate mitigation actions included in the 
respective ESMPs. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

The policy is triggered due to potential expansion, 
intensification of agricultural activities, and 
diversification into new crops that often require more 
frequent usage of combinations of agro-chemicals. A 
generic Pest Management Plan (PMP) will be prepared 
as part of the ESMF and disclosed by appraisal. Where 
use of pesticides will be anticipated, site specific PMPs 
will be included in the respective ESIAs. The PMPs will 
be adopted and included in the project 
implementation manual to address pest management 
issues that may arise in project sites due to both area 
expansion under irrigation and expected increase in 
pesticide use associated with productivity 
improvement. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 Yes 

The policy is triggered as construction activities may 
lead to opportunistic finds of archaeological artifacts 
and/or may have an impact on graves and other 
cultural sites. Chance find provisions will therefore, be 
included in construction contracts while potential 
impacts on other identified physical cultural resources 
will be addressed by site-specific environmental 
management plans (EMPs).

Nov 27, 2017 Page 13 of 18  

     

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 No 

This policy is not triggered because none of the people 
within the planned project area meet the specific 
criteria under which indigenous peoples are defined in 
OP 4.10. 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

This policy is triggered because of anticipated impacts 
under component 1, which objective is to develop the 
irrigation and drainage infrastructure (primarily for 
supplemental gravity irrigation services) and finance 
construction and equipment for the water source 
works (storage reservoirs, river diversion weirs and 
pumping stations), related catchment management 
interventions, and three to five irrigation systems 
(including main canal and drainage system, cross 
structures, on-farm works, and operation and 
maintenance (O&M) facilities), associated 
resettlement and environmental management costs. 
These activities may trigger land acquisition and 
involuntary resettlement as land requirements for 
purposes of construction of any of these facilities may 
permanently or temporarily limit access to both public 
or private land and other assets by local communities. 
The areas envisaged to be used as reservoirs for both 
priority schemes are currently used by a few PAPs for 
residence and farming while the rest is utilized by 
community members for growing perennial crops, 
hunting, gathering, apiary and fishing. 
 
Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) are being prepared 
for the two priority schemes and will be disclosed by 
project appraisal. For those where the scope and other 
details of works, including the exact locations of the 
infrastructure within each project site are not yet 
determined, a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) 
will be prepared and disclosed both in country and on 
the World Bank’s external website before project 
appraisal. 
 
In addition, some land consolidation might be required 
for some of the irrigation schemes and particular 
attention will be given to the process through 
extensive and inclusive consultations with affected 
communities to ensure that potential changes in 
ownership and land tenure are adequately addressed;  
All RAPs will be required to explicitly describe the 
modalities of these processes.

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 Yes 

The policy is triggered because of the project will 
finance construction of dams. In compliance with the 
triggered OP 4.37, a Dam safety panel is being 
constituted to provide the necessary oversight. The 
irrigation dams will be designed by qualified 
engineers, and dam safety measures will be 
incorporated in dam operations. Dam Safety plans for 
the proposed large dams (including an Emergency 
Preparedness Plan (EPP)) will be drafted, reviewed, 
endorsed and disclosed. For small dam construction, 
rehabilitation, and maintenance relevant oversight 
procedures will be included in the Project 
Implementation Manual. Kabuyanda scheme will 
iinclude construction of a 25m high dam, while the 
total number of dams to be constructed under each 
phase of the Program is not yet known at this stage. 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

Yes 

This policy is triggered by the Project as it will 
contribute to building infrastructure and enhancing 
the environment for irrigated agriculture in selected 
high potential sites across the country during project 
implementation that may have an impact on riparian 
water sources. Irrigation schemes under the proposed 
project may be located on rivers which are tributaries 
to international waterways such as the River Nile. The 
relevant notifications per the requirements will be 
sent to Riparian countries before appraisal. 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No 
All of the territory within the program undisputedly 
falls within Ugandan territory. Therefore this policy is 
not triggered. 

 
E. Safeguard Preparation Plan  
 
Tentative target date for preparing the Appraisal Stage PID/ISDS 
 
Jan 31, 2019 
 
Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed. The specific studies and 
their timing should be specified in the Appraisal Stage PID/ISDS 
 
Safeguards related studies (ESIAs, RAPs, and PMPs) for two priority schemes (Kabuyanda and Possibly Nyimur schemes) 

and the safeguards policy framework (ESMF and RPF) will be completed by Project Appraisal in August, 2018; Other 
scheme-specific ESIAs, RAPs, PMPs and the Cumulative Impact Assesment will be completed during early stage of project 
implementation.

20. The project is expected to trigger the following safeguard policies: OP 4.01 Environmental Assessment, 

OP 4.04 Natural Habitats, OP 4.09 Pest Management, OP 4.36 Forests, OP 4.37 Safety of Dams, OP 4.11 Physical 

Cultural Resources (TBD), OP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement, and OP 7.50 Projects on International Waterways.  

 

21. The project shall be required to prepare two sets of Safeguard Instruments – Policy Frameworks and 

Specific Instruments which include: Safeguard instruments for the project include (a) environmental and social 

impact assessments (ESIAs); and (b) environmental and social management framework (ESMF), (c) resettlement 

action plan (RAP), and (d) resettlement policy framework (RPF). The implementation agencies for the proposed 

Project is the Ministry of Water and Environment (MWE) responsible for overall implementation and 

Components 1, 3 and 4. The implementation agency has long experiences in preparation and implementation of 

safeguards policies and instruments under Bank funded projects in the water sector.  

 

Citizen Engagement and Gender Mainstreaming 

22. Community involvement and stakeholder consultation are essential for the success of the Project, and will 

be sought throughout the project cycle from conception to operation. In the course of scheme selection and design, 

the local communities and stakeholders will be engaged to ensure that the project investment benefit the poor and 

vulnerable of the population. They will also be involved in defining the irrigation services and identifying critical 

gaps in essential support services for crop cultivation and value-chain development, and engaged in discussions 

on resettlement action planning and implementation, irrigation service fee and scheme operation. Detailed 

consultation and mapping will be carried out with different community groups, particularly with the vulnerable 

groups including women and minority groups, on project intervention section, and value-chain development 

through matching grant (or credit), and so on. 

 

23. Gender analysis will be undertaken as part of the scheme-specific environmental and social impact 

assessment, and grievance redress mechanism included in the environmental and social management plan. During 

implementation, the farming communities will be required to take lead and organize themselves into farmer 

producer cooperatives for agricultural production and business development. The communities will also organize 

themselves into farmer water user associations (WUAs). The WUAs will be empowered to manage irrigation 

water distributions and participate in the system operation and maintenance. NGOs and/or consulting firms will 

be contracted to facilitate the process, and make sure that women and vulnerable groups are adequately 

represented in the cooperatives, enterprises and WUAs. Appropriate citizen engagement and gender 

mainstreaming indicators will be included in the project results framework for monitoring purpose.   

 Climate Risk Screening 

 

24. In general, Uganda is well endowed with water resources with per capita annual renewable water resources 

of over 2,000m3. However, the aggregate figures mask bot temporal (seasonal) and spatial variability, which 

translate into significant geographical differences in water availability. According to a study of MWE in 2009, by 

2035, 3 out 4 districts will be under high water stress. The main climate risks in the country are droughts and 

floods. Flood prone areas are generally located along rivers and major water bodies, wetlands and low lying areas. 

Floods in the past decades have caused severe infrastructure and property damages, community displacement and 

crop losses in different parts of the country. 

 

25. In contrast to floods, droughts are more pervasive, frequent and widespread in the country. In the recent

past, droughts have led to chronic food shortages and livestock deaths in various parts of the country, affecting a 

significant percentage of the population, particularly in the north, northeast, and the ‘cattle corridor’, where the 

rainfall tends to be highly variable from year to year. Drought impacts have been exacerbated by the lack of 

adequate water management planning and water infrastructure (e.g. water storage and irrigation/water supply 

facilities) to manage climate variability and risks. 

 

26. Building on earlier climate change vulnerability assessment and adaptation strategy studies for Uganda’s 

water sector, a further study was carried out in 2011 as part of the Bank’s country water assistance strategy for 

Uganda, to analyze the historical climate trends and future climate scenarios. All the models project increased 

warming and more ‘hot’ days in the future. There is very strong model agreement that mean annual precipitation, 

runoff, preparation during extreme storm events, and precipitation intensity will increase in Uganda. These results 

are consistent with other related studies such as the climate change impacts on Africa crop production under 

CGIAR’s program on climate change, agriculture and food security (Remirez-Villegas, J., Thornton PK, 2015). 

Both studies point to likely increase in temperature and evapotranspiration, and rainfall leading to potentially 

more frequent extreme weather events.    

 

27. In the process of project conception, an initial climate screen was undertaken using the dedicated climate 

resilience screening tool. To adapt to such projected climate change and variability, the Project will include as 

part of the design the following interventions: (a) water storage for schemes in areas where the water availability 

in the water sources are highly variable, this will be accompanied by necessary catchment management activities 

to ensure long term sustainable operation; (b) cost-effective soil and water conservation, and climate-resilience 

measures, particularly water-saving technologies and on-farm water management practices will be included to 

reduce crop water demand, evapotranspiration and GHG emission; (c) water balancing and supply reliability 

assessment will be undertaken during project feasibility study in the basin/aquifer context to ensure sufficient and 

reliable irrigation water supply; and (d) all the project infrastructure will be designed with sufficient flood 

protection, taking into consideration the climate change and variability factor.

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Regional and Country Context           
                            Figure 1: The Lake Chad 

1. Lake Chad is a large transboundary lake located in the Sahel as well 
as in the West and the Central Africa sub-regions. The Lake Chad is shared 

between Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria1 and a total of 49 million people 

live from the exploitation of its rich natural resources (fishing, livestock 

farming, flood-recession agriculture, hunting and gathering). A net exporter of 

food and a provider of seasonal jobs, it also contributed to the food and job 

security of people in its hinterlands2, including two regional metropolises, 

Ndjamena and Maidiguri, as well as the impoverished regions of the lake’s 

Sahelian hinterlands (Borno in Nigeria; Diffa in Niger, the Far North Province 

in Cameroon and the regions of the Lake, Lac, Kanem, Hadjer Lamis, and Chari 

Baguirmi in Chad). If the lake area represents such a food production hub, it is 

because it offers, all year long, a relative secure source of water, fodder and 

fertile land. Moreover, those mostly family fishing and farming systems are labor intensive and generate 

significant indirect employment (processing, trade, crafts, and transport). Finally, the ecological value of Lake 

Chad has been recognized by the Ramsar convention and the Lake is being classified a World Natural Heritage 

Site by UNESCO. 

2. Despite its potential of being a driver for development in West Africa, however, development in the 
Lake Chad area is challenged by multiple and interrelated drivers of conflict and fragility. Most recently, 

the Boko Haram regional insurgency has affected over 23 million civilians around the four countries (Cameroon, 

Chad, Niger and Nigeria). Violent acts caused by Boko Haram include coercion, abduction, forced recruitment, 

                                            
1 This project includes the three countries Cameroon, Chad and Niger. While the World Bank’s broader Lake Chad Program includes Nigeria, Nigeria 

is not participating in this concrete project. This project, however, is processed as a Series of Projects, and will thus allow for the participation of 

Nigeria to opt into the program at a later date and according to the country’s needs and specific requirements. 
2 The lake hinterlands, or its area of influence through trade and seasonal migration, extends-up to 300 km around the Lake and represents an area of 

about 250,000 km2.

indoctrination, human rights abrogation, violent extremism, etc. and besides causing immense psychological 

trauma and weakening social networks, these acts have also disrupted livelihoods and destroyed assets. The 

conflict has exacerbated pre-existing challenges and caused extensive damage. As a consequence of the Boko 

Haram conflict, the Lake Chad Region is also Africa’s largest forced displacement crisis. Latest estimates show 

2.3 million individuals (half of them are children) are now displaced in the Region, both internally and across 

borders as refugees.3 These significant numbers of refugees and IDPs have added pressure on host communities 

that are already food insecure. 

 

3. Vulnerable groups, in particular women and youth have been mostly affected by the consequences 
of the Boko Haram crisis. While youth account for most of the population in the countries around the lake and 

could be a potential driver for economic growth, they are faced with the highest rates of unemployment and the 

lowest levels of formal education and vocational training in the respective countries. Facing limited opportunity, 

youth are easily susceptible to recruitment into criminal activity or armed violence. Young women and men who 

have been recruited and used by armed groups are especially vulnerable as they are marginalized and stigmatized 

by their communities (when and if they return), thus facing many barriers to their reintegration.4 Gender-based 

violence (GBV) and violence against children, already widespread in the Lake Chad Region before the outbreak 

of the Boko Haram conflict has also increased since the crisis (reported acts include abduction, detention, rape or 

forced marriages, and the forced use of children as kamikazes). In addition, common to many young women in 

the Region is the experience of early marriage and childbirth and resultant health risks. 

 

4. The underlying causes of the Boko Haram crisis include high inequality, perceived social injustice, 

a lack of social service provision, historic marginalization, inadequate economic opportunities, high levels 

of poverty, rapid demographic growth and the impacts of climate change and land degradation. The conflict 

can be traced back to a range of fragility drivers and historical underinvestment in remote areas. Fragility drivers 

include i) lack of public services; ii) the pressure on the already fragile ecosystem which is significantly increasing 

due to a high population growth5, iii) poor natural resource management, and climate and disaster risks in the 

Region6; iv) weak governance and weak presence of state institutions; v) weak agriculture performance vi) poor 

connectivity around the lake and rural access roads which are old and not regularly maintained, and vii) missing 

international road corridor and energy transmission linkages. The lack of public services, basic infrastructure and 

social services within the areas surrounding the Lake Chad reflect systemic national development problems and 

are a result of many years of neglect by central authorities. Grievances of the populations living in the Lake Chad 

Region are further deepened by repeated unfulfilled promises of development and many have lost their trust in 

the government. As one of the results, the areas surrounding the Lake Chad represent the poorest, most 

                                            
3 Plan International, Lake Chad Snapshot, 15 Feb 2018. 
4 Young women have especially been negatively impacted as they have been facing the additional stigma of being survivors of sexual violence. 
5 The population of the four countries around the Lake Chad (Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria; entire territory of the countries, not vicinities of the 

Lake Chad) has more than quadrupled in the last 50 years – from 60 million in 1960 to more than 243 million inhabitants in 2017. See UNFPA: From 

crisis to development around Lake Chad, Strategy for an Integrated, Holistic and Sustainable Response, 2018. 
6 The project has been screened for climate and disaster risks. The exposure of the project locations and the impacts on the project’s physical 

infrastructure and assets have been rated as High. Extreme temperature, extreme precipitation, flooding and drought are projected to increase in all 

three participating countries of this regional project (Cameroon, Chad and Niger) and in particular in the Lake Chad Region. Future projections show 

that mean annual temperature is projected to increase between 1.0-3.4°C by 2060. Annual number of ‘warm’ days and nights are also projected to 

increase. Projected increase in inter-annual rainfall variability is likely to exacerbate drought risk in the future. Projected increases in seasonal rainfall, 

total runoff, and the proportion of rainfall in heavy events will have profound implications for flooding. These extreme climate and hazard events affect 

marginalized groups more severely.

marginalized and neglected part of each respective country and have been left susceptible to crime and violence 

and promises from radical Islamists. In Cameroon, for example, poverty is increasingly concentrated in the 

northern parts of the country – the Far North and the North present a poverty rate of 74.3% and 67.9% respectively, 

and the literacy rate is almost half in the North (43%) compared to the rest of the country (72% nationally). While 

the regions bordering the Lake Chad in Chad and Niger have been less marginalized and less excluded from 

development planning compared to equivalent regions in Cameroon and Nigeria, development indicators remain 

worse than the national averages.7 

 

5. As a result, a military victory and humanitarian assistance alone are not enough to create peace and 

stability in the Lake Chad Region and a focus on restoring and enhancing resilience is needed, even as 

humanitarian activities and security operations continue. As outlined in the joint World Bank Group’s (WBG) 

and United Nations “Pathways for Peace Study” (2018), conflict stems from the mobilization of people’s 

perception of exclusion and injustice, which are rooted in inequalities, and tackling these issues should be a 

priority to prevent further escalation of conflict. While military and security agencies have made some progress 

in limiting the activities of extremist groups, their own practices have, at times, been heavy-handed and have 

included violations of human rights, adding to the sense of insecurity and alienation which increase divisions 

among displaced persons and communities. Furthermore, social inclusion will also be key for a long-term 

stabilization and prevention of future conflicts. In this regard, preventive action needs to adopt a more people-

centered approach that includes mainstreaming citizen engagement. Enhancing the participation of women and 

youth in decision making, as well as long-term policies to address the aspirations of women and young people, 

will also be fundamental to sustaining peace. 

 

6. The conflict has significantly impacted livelihoods and economic productivity in the Lake Chad 

Region, which are largely based on farming, pastoralism and fishing. The main impacts of the conflict include 

inaccessibility and a loss of productive assets and inputs due to human displacement and the disruption of markets 

due to physical destruction of facilities, and the enforcement of security-related measures such as restrictions of 

movement and the prohibition to farm or trade in certain areas.8 As a result, agricultural production and access to 

land have declined sharply, resulting in a widespread loss of livelihoods and employment. In addition to direct 

losses in productive assets, agricultural trade has also been significantly impaired by damages to the road network 

and the closure of borders. The recent AFD/IRD study “Crisis and Development – the Lake Chad Region and 

Boko Haram” shows that the Lake Chad Region was a highly complex and interlinked regional system prior to 

2013, where the country’s borders did not represent real boundaries. Acts of violence by Boko Haram have 

destabilized the former regional system and have compromised productive activities in the rural areas around the 

Lake Chad. A growth of rural income and livelihood opportunities combined with connectivity improvements 

would build the resilience of the population around the Lake Chad and thus help to (i) give the population, and in 

particular those who are at-risk a viable livelihood option besides joining Boko Haram, (ii) restore the 

communities’ trust in the government and the prospect for development in the region, and (iii) reestablish 

community ties.

7. A regional and geospatial targeted approach will help to chart a path that promotes growth and 
economic clustering, while at the same time efficiently promoting inclusion, equal opportunities, and 

security. The contextual rationale for a regional response is three-fold9: (i) The Boko Haram insurgency is a 

regional crisis with significant cross-border spill-over effects; (ii) the Region is characterized by a web of 

economic, trade, historical, political, cultural, ethnic and religious ties, which makes its populations linked and 

interdependent across borders. Events in one country affect others, and the problems of weak community 

institutions, livelihoods and connectivity can only be solved through a broader regional response; and (iii) the 

Lake Chad area is a fragile and vulnerable socio-ecosystem and regional in nature. Furthermore, the “Lagging 

Lands, Violent Lands”10 framework for action suggests a combined spatial and social lens for such areas and 

around country borders where interventions as well as violence can have impacts that spill beyond national 

boundaries. In the Lake Chad Region, where violence is recurrent, and divisions are entrenched, area-based 

interventions that are spatially targeted at places with development deficiencies and socially targeted at factors 

that elevate the risk of violence are required in order to create areas which can become socially, politically and 

economically stable. Coordination between administrative areas at national and regional levels will also be key 

to ensure regional stability and exploit possible positive economic and social externalities, such as those achieved 

by public productive investments, livelihoods, value chain development and transport infrastructure investments. 

 
Sectoral and Institutional Context 

 
8. The current security crisis has forced countries of the region to coordinate and collaborate more 
extensively on security issues, though on development there is a general lack of regional leadership and 

collaboration on common problems. These issues surfaced during the Oslo Consultative Group meeting in 

Berlin (September 2017). The lack of collaboration between regional economic communities of the Economic 

Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the Economic Community of Central African States 

(ECCAS-CEEAC), and the weakness of the Lake Chad Basin Commission, means that a coherent regional 

response to the deeply-rooted drivers of fragility will remain challenging. While putting in place a sustainable 

platform for programmatic prioritization and coordination, regional dialogue, exchange of ideas and policy 

harmonization will take time and will require sustained support over many years, it will be an important and 

necessary early step for the long-term sustainable development of the Region and will help to restore citizens’ 

trust in government interventions. 

 

9. The Sahel Alliance has opened a window of opportunity for stabilization and recovery in the Lake 
Chad Region. Informed and sustained high-level dialogue and diplomacy in coordination with strong 

international commitment are the prerequisites to help build trust between neighboring governments in areas 

beyond security cooperation. During the International High-Level Conference on the Sahel in Brussels, Belgium 

on February 23, 2018, France, Germany, the EU, the African Development Bank, UNDP and the World Bank 

(the six founding members), joined by Italy, Spain and the UK, officially launched the Sahel Alliance, which 

paved the way for international cooperation following the guiding principles of (a) governance; (b) gender; (c) 

youth and (d) donor coordination. The AFD, EU/DEVCO, AfDB, Germany, the UK and USAID, amongst others, 

have already made allocations for stabilization and development activities in the Lake Chad Basin in parallel to 

humanitarian funding. This proposed Lake Chad Region Recovery and Development Project (i) builds upon the 

                                            
9 The IEG found that a regional approach is relevant if i) program objectives require cooperation among neighboring countries to address regional 

externalities, ii) program objectives align with country and regional development priorities, and iii) the program adheres to the principle of subsidiarity. 

These three conditions are fulfilled in the case of this proposed engagement.

momentum created by the launching of the Sahel Alliance, and (ii) constitutes the World Bank’s commitment to 

the Sahel Alliance by focusing on the stabilization of a main sub-region – the Lake Chad Region. The project 

aligns with the specific objectives of the Sahel Alliance by ensuring a strong coordination with the members of 

the Sahel Alliance, promoting multilateralism and better coordination and collaboration with humanitarian and 

development partners and security actors, in particular through the proposed Component 1, and by putting special 

emphasis on the development of rural areas and infrastructure development through the proposed Component 2 

and 3. 

 

10. The project contributes and will be guided by the World Bank’s Regional Recovery and 
Development Strategy for the Lake Chad Region (Lake Chad Region Business Plan) which is currently 

being developed. A first mapping of WBG responses in the Lake Chad Region has showed that the total amount 

of current World Bank activities in the Region is an estimated USD 470 million11 and that more than 10 million 

beneficiaries benefit from these activities. There is thus a considerable scope for the WBG to scale up its 

development support to the Lake Chad Region, though particularly in Chad and Niger. To this end, the World 

Bank is currently developing its longer-term strategy for the Lake Chad Region of which this project is an integral 

part of. In this context, a grant of the State and Peace-building Fund has been approved in September 2018 for 

the Cross-border collaboration in the Lake Chad Region Project to build the foundations of this Regional 

Recovery and Development Strategy for the Lake Chad region by enhancing cross-collaboration between the four 

countries around the Lake (the three countries participating in this proposed project and also Nigeria)12.

11. The project is part of the World Bank’s Lake Chad Region Program. The project constitutes the 
second phase (“Stabilization and early recovery) of the World Bank’s three-phased Lake Chad Region Program 

and prepares the transition from a national post-crisis response (Phase 1) to a long-term resilience and sustainable 

development response (Phase 3) in the Lake Chad Region. The World Bank’s broader Lake Chad Region Program 

                                            
11 USD 140 million have recently been spent on activities and USD 330 million are currently in progress. The national breakdown is the following: 

Nigeria: USD 230 million; Chad: USD 75 million; Cameroon: USD 150 million and Niger: USD 15 million. 
12 The expected outputs of the cross-border collaboration in the Lake Chad Region Project are: (i) Support to the Lake Chad Basin Governors’ Forum 

organization including an early 2019 meeting in Niger; (ii)  Citizen engagement consultation/awareness workshop; (iii) Establishment of a knowledge 

and monitoring platform for the Lake Chad; (iv) Establishment of a data center; (v) Study on multi-dimensional risks around the Lake Chad; and (vi) 

Stakeholder engagement including quarterly multi-partner meetings and support to key conferences (briefs, presentations and participation).

aims to address regional, national and sub-national drivers of fragility through a programmatic, coordinated and 

holistic approach. It is guided by the following five key principles of engagement: (i) a multi-phased and multi-

sector approach to increase the resilience of populations; (ii) flexibility for both riparian client countries and 

stakeholders in their degree of engagement; (iii) flexibility in resource allocation across project components and 

geographic locations; (iv) convergence of efforts with other donors and initiatives along the humanitarian-

development-security nexus; and (v) use of innovative project preparation and M&E mechanisms, such as third-

party execution or monitoring, on an as-needed basis. 

 

12. The World Bank’s Lake Chad Region Program was confirmed at the High-Level Conference on the 
Lake Chad Region in Berlin 2018. On September 3-4, 17 UN Member States, the European Commission, the 

World Bank and the African Development Bank combined announced US$2.17 billion and US$ 467 million in 

concessional loans to support a comprehensive response to the crisis in the Lake Chad Region. The conference 

also highlighted the regional dimension of the Lake Chad crisis, the crucial role of local actors, cross-border 

cooperation and ownership at all levels. Furthermore, stakeholders committed to address the immediate and 

longer-term needs and help build the resilience of crisis-affected people in the Lake Chad region – thus strongly 

endorsing the work along the humanitarian-development-security nexus.13

13. The project is aligned with the WBG’s priorities and UN Strategies in the Lake Chad Region. The 
WBG’s engagement in the Lake Chad Region is aligned with the two interrelated pillars of its Africa Strategy: 

(i) vulnerability and resilience; and (ii) economic opportunity and integration, the Bank’s corporate priority under 

IDA 18, aimed at scaling up its response to issues of fragility, conflict and violence, as well as the Lake Chad 

Development and Climate Resilience Action Plan and the Africa Climate Business Plan. The proposed project 

will be aligned with the International Finance Corporation’s (IFC) Sectorial Strategy and Operations in the three 

countries. Furthermore, the project is aligned and reinforces UNDP’s and UNOCHA’s “Resilience for Sustainable 

Development in the Lake Chad Basin”, UNFPA’s “From Crisis to development around Lake Chad – Strategy for 

                                            
13 Most activities in the region are almost entirely focused on a humanitarian response with very little development programming, in particular on the 
Chadian and Nigerien side. While humanitarian actors have begun incorporating resilience programming and small development interventions, there 

is an identified need for development actors to engage at scale and support the development of the regions adjoining the Lake Chad.

an Integrated, Holistic and Sustainable Response” and the “UN Support Plan for the Sahel – Working together 

for a prosperous and peaceful Sahel”. This will be done by supporting the transition from a medium-term response 

focusing on resilience and recovery to a longer-term response that will strengthen transformation and 

development. The project will adapt a comprehensive people-centered approach and will, as highlighted in various 

UN Strategy Documents, strengthen resilience of communities in the Lake Chad Region that improves coping 

capacity and reduces vulnerabilities. 

 

14. The project is also in strong alignment with existing regional and national strategies and plans. The 
project is in line with the recommendations of Cameroon’s RPBA to focus all efforts on achieving concrete results 

around the following objectives: (i) putting in place durable solutions for forced displacement; (ii) improving 

local development/decentralization processes and the functioning of local governance; (iii) improving the 

provision of basic social services; (iv) promoting the recovery of the economy and improvement of economic 

opportunities; and (v) improving individual and territorial security. Furthermore, the proposed project is aligned 

with the nine pillars of the “Regional Strategy for the Stabilization, Recovery and Resilience of the Boko-Haram 

affected areas of the Lake Chad Basin” which has been adopted by the Lake Chad Basin Ministers on August 31, 

2018. The nine pillars of the strategy are: (i) Political cooperation; (ii) security and human rights; (iii) 

disarmament, demobilization, rehabilitation, reinsertion and reintegration of Persons Associated with Boko 

Haram; (iv) humanitarian assistance; (v) governance and social contract; (vi) socio-economic recovery and 

environmental sustainability; (vii) education and vocational training; (viii) prevention of violent extremism and 

peacebuilding; and (ix) empowerment and inclusion of women and youth, respond to the multilayered challenges 

in the Lake Chad Basin region. 
 

Relationship to CPF and other strategies 
 

15. The project’s objectives are fully aligned with the Country Partnership Frameworks (CPF) for Chad, Cameroon and 
Niger: 

 Chad: The three identified themes of engagement for FY16-20 are: (i) Strengthening management of public 
resources; (ii) improving returns to agriculture and building value chains; and (iii) building human capital and 

reducing vulnerability. The proposed project addresses the second and third themes of the CPF by supporting 

public productive investments and development along the agricultural value chain, enhancing sustainable 

livelihoods of local communities, strengthening social accountability mechanisms, and improving rural transport 

linkages. 

 Cameroon: The three focus areas for FY17-21 are: (i) Addressing multiple poverty traps in rural areas (with a 
focus on northern regions); (ii) fostering infrastructure and private sector development; and (iii) improving 

governance. The proposed project will address the first focus area by supporting public productive investments, 

improving access to livelihoods and rural transport linkages in the Far North Region of Cameroon. 

 Niger: The three focus areas for FY18-21 are: (i) Rural productivity and incomes; (ii) human capital and social 
protection; and (iii) governance for jobs and growth. The proposed project focuses mainly on the first focus area 

of the CPF ‘Rural Productivity and Incomes’ by directly improving rural livelihoods (in particular the agricultural 

value chain), rural connectivity and public productive investments. 

 

16. Relationship to Africa’s Regional Integration and Cooperation Assistance. The project’s objectives are aligned 
with the “Supporting Africa’s Transformation: Regional Integration and Cooperation Assistance Strategy (FY18-FY23)” 

and in particular its strategic priority 4 “promote collective action to address risks of regional economic contagion, fragility, 

epidemic and climate hot spots”. Sub-objective 4.2 refers to support to sustainable management and financing of

transboundary waters and 4.3 to provide support to communities affected by regional forced displacement and help countries 

to deal with underlying conflict prevention measures. 

 
 
C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  

 

17. The proposed project development objective for the Lake Chad Region Recovery and Development 
Project-SOP1 is the following: to contribute to the recovery of the Lake Chad Region through supporting regional 

coordination and crisis monitoring, connectivity and agricultural livelihoods in selected provinces of Cameroon, 

Chad and Niger. 

 

18. The proposed program development objective is the following: to contribute to the recovery of the Lake 
Chad Region through enhanced regional coordination and crisis monitoring, socio-economic development and 

the strengthening of local level institutions in the Lake Chad Region. 

  

19. Project beneficiaries will be vulnerable populations in selected intervention areas in the three countries. 
This includes, for instance, youth at risk and women. While not specifically targeted, project beneficiaries could 

also include displaced and ex-combatants. While the project intends to include activities which also support the 

R (“Reintegration”) of ex-Boko Haram combatants, this project does not specifically target ex-Boko Haram 

combatants so as to avoid any possible stigmatization that would exacerbate an already very difficult social 

cohesion effort between and within communities. 
 
Key Results (From PCN) 
 

20. The following PDO indicators will be considered and refined during project preparation: 
- Establishment of a functioning knowledge and monitoring platform endorsed by the participating 

countries. 

- Increased regional dialogue and coordination on conflict and climate and disaster risk management among 
the three countries (Cameroon, Chad and Niger).14 

- Number of direct project beneficiaries in the three countries (number), of which percent of female and 
youth. 

- Beneficiaries in the three countries that feel project investments reflected their needs (percentage), of 
which percent of female and youth. 

- Beneficiaries in the three countries that feel that project investments have positively contributed to the 
community’s social well-being and have helped to restore trust. 

- Beneficiaries of regional economic development activities that report an increase in income 
(disaggregated by type of service, gender and target group). 

- Improvement of Rural Access Index (RAI; number of index points improvement).

D. Concept Description 
 
                                 Figure 4: The Project’s Intervention Rationale 
21. To restore and enhance resilience in the 
Lake Chad Region, this project will work along the 

humanitarian-development-security nexus to (i) 

address some of the existing drivers of fragility in 

the Lake Chad Region, in particular poor regional 

crisis preparedness and management, poor 

connectivity around and on the Lake, poor local 

governance and unemployment (especially youth 

unemployment), and (ii) mitigate some 

consequences of the crisis, in particular destroyed 

public productive investments, poor livelihood 

opportunities and a weakened agriculture value 

chain. More concretely, this project will bridge the gap between humanitarian and development assistance and 

support its transition. Investments will be made complementary to humanitarian activities and collaboration and 

coordination with security actors will allow the project to operate in an insecure environment and support the 

recovery of provinces where security interventions have achieved to bring peace back to the communities. By 

showing an immediate positive development impact through quick-win interventions, peace and stability brought 

back by security actors can be sustained and can make a transition from a humanitarian to a development response 

possible. This project’s specific added value lies in (a) strengthening crisis and conflict preparedness, response 

and coordination at the regional level to better prevent and mitigate regional fragility, and (b) addressing a set of 

priority activities which are expected to have a high development impact; are in areas where security allows for 

an intervention; and are complementary with other programs (clusters). 

 

22. Following a contextual regional rationale as outlined in the context section above, the project will translate 
this into a technical regional rationale and thus prioritize activities which are trans-border in nature and will 



 
The World Bank  
Lake Chad Region Recovery and Development Project (P161706) 

 
 

  
Oct 12, 2018 Page 12 of 22  

     

therefore help to restore and strengthen the regional system which has been negatively impacted by the Boko 

Haram crisis. The regional activities will be the following: (i) restoration of rural mobility and cross-border 

connectivity through the rehabilitation of critical rural roads and infrastructure (on the Lake Chad and around the 

Lake, and other intervention areas which are of regional importance), which will help to connect communities of 

all the participating three countries, and (ii) agriculture value chain development with a regional aspect combined 

with public productive investments which will facilitate and reinforce cross-border trade.15 In addition, the project 

will support a coordination and monitoring platform to reinforce regional dialogue and institutional capacity. 

 

23. The proposed financing instrument for this project is an Investment Project Financing (IPF) with total 
proposed IDA funds of US$225 million to be disbursed as grant and credit16. Following a pre-identification 

mission and the readiness of all three participating countries, the IDA funds are likely to be allocated as follows: 

US$60 million for Cameroon; US$45 million for Chad; and US$60 million for Niger. The proposed project is 

being processed as a Series of Projects (SOP) given that the three proposed project countries all deal with the 

same negative impacts of the Boko Haram crisis, similar underlying drivers of fragility and regional 

underdevelopment. The SOP approach will also allow for the participation of the Republic of Nigeria to opt into 

the program at a later date and according to the country’s needs and specific requirements. This project is the first 

proposed project of the SOP, and will focus on regional coordination and monitoring, rural connectivity and a 

few agricultural livelihood restoration priority activities. In addition, this first SOP will pilot social community 

engagement activities to support the process of restoring trust between and within communities. The second 

project in this SOP Series would build upon first achievements, expand livelihoods support and community 

engagement activities and also provide direct support to the beneficiaries’ access to basic socio-economic services 

in the Lake Chad Region. 

 

24. The project will embed essential features of ensuring citizen participation in prioritizing developmental 
needs including livelihoods opportunities to improve self-reliance of communities and social cohesion and greater 

demand for social accountability. Citizen Engagement mechanisms will be built into the project through (i) setting 

up effective grievance redress and beneficiary feedback mechanism, (ii) ensuring an intensive program of 

engagement with project stakeholders, (iii) deploying effective strategic communications and public education, 

and (iv) monitoring social impacts through annual stakeholder surveys. In addition, the project will identify local 

conflict and help set up conflict resolution mechanisms with the aim to restore trust among the community 

members and promote inclusion. The project will also use a targeted geographical development approach which 

combines a spatial and social lens. Targeted social inclusion will be ensured by using specific community-led 

processes to identify and reach vulnerable and systematically excluded people17, including young women, women 

from poorer households (including widows), and women with disabilities; and youth in general, at risk youth and 

youth affected by radicalization, involved in criminal networks, etc. Innovative citizen engagement approaches 

already tested in the region, mobilizing third party monitoring, ICT and CSOs will be explored.18 In addition, the 

concept for the operationalization of gender mainstreaming, in particular multi-sectoral prevention and response 

                                            
15 The component description provides examples of activities with a regional rationale which will be supported under this project; a detailed list of 
activities under Component 2 and 3 that have a regional public goods nature will be defined during project preparation. 
16 See a detailed overview of the project’s financing in the table on p. 13. 
17 The reasons for systematic exclusion from programs and economic participation are for a range of reasons, including social norms, lack of 

information, and inability to meet costs of participation in community institutions, including cost for transport. 
18 In Cameroon, for example, a successful Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM) has been included in the context of the CEMAC Transport and Transit 

Facilitation Project. Important lessons learned from this project and other projects in the Region will be included in the design of this proposed Lake 

Chad Region Recovery and Development Project.

to gender-based violence (GBV) will, amongst others, be guided by a joint French Development Agency 

(AFD)/World Bank study which is currently being conducted.19 

 

25. Investments will be integrated and complemented by investments of the AFD’s Lake Chad Inclusive 
Economic and Social Recovery Program (RESILAC)20, initiatives on polder rehabilitation close to the Lake Chad, 

key WBG’s operations such as the CEMAC - Transport-Transit Facilitation Project in Cameroon, the Niger Rural 

Mobility and Connectivity Project, and the Refugees and Host Communities Support Projects in Chad and Niger, 

and interventions of humanitarian and development partners, and will be in alignment with the UN strategies for 

the Lake Chad Region21 and the Sahel Alliance. The following areas have been pre-identified as potential areas 

of intervention: (a) In Niger: Clusters of pepper productions along the main corridor of the national road from 

N’Guimi via Diffa to Zinder, two fishing communities and one cattle area in the North of the Lake Chad22; (b) in 

Cameroon: communes along the CEMAC corridor in Maroua and Septentrion and communes in the close vicinity 

to the Lake Chad (here, in particular fisheries), and (c) in Chad: a transport corridor connecting N’Djamena to the 

South of Cameroon and West via Bol and Baga Sol and polder areas in Tangal and Gueni. 

 

26. Security will be monitored closely and will inform project implementation. The project design will allow 
for flexibility in resource allocation across project components and geographic locations. Such flexibility is 

necessary to operate in a highly volatile environment with ongoing security concerns and people’s movements. 

A careful targeting of selected provinces and the use of a carefully chosen mix of activities combined with robust 

monitoring will help to reduce the risk that communities could become a target of violence as a consequence of 

investments made under this project.  
 

Component 1: Regional and national coordination platform and local capacity building 

 

27. This component will aim at reinforcing regional dialogue and institutional capacity by putting in place an 
analytical and monitoring platform of key vulnerability factors of the Region. It will also provide targeted capacity 

building of selected institutions at the regional, national and local levels to reinforce the regional cooperation and 

governance. This component will finance the following activities: 

 Sub-Component 1.1: Knowledge and Monitoring platform: An analytical and monitoring platform will be set 
up to foster knowledge exchange, collaboration and partnerships and to strengthen conflict and disaster early 

warning systems. This platform will be used for programmatic prioritization and coordination, policy 

harmonization23, regional dialogue at technical and strategic levels; as well as consolidate and strengthen 

already existing early warning systems (as e.g., the Continental Early Warning System (CEWS) established 

by the AU), provide capacity building to monitoring institutions and connect the systems across the three 

countries. Integrated and coordinated conflict and disaster early warning systems will allow stakeholders to 

anticipate disaster and conflict trends and better understand the rapidly changing dynamics of situations. Other 

topics that the platform could address and promote are citizen engagement, social inclusion and gender, 

                                            
19 The name of the study is Opportunity study: Strengthening the consideration of gender dynamics in the response to the Lake Chad crisis. 
20 This project aims at boosting the local economy by creating jobs for young people in rural areas and diversifying family-based production systems, 

strengthening social cohesion through psychosocial support for communities affected by Boko Haram's violence and providing institutional support 

for local authorities and civil society organizations. 
21 See above. 
22 Exact locations of these communities will be confirmed. 
23 One example of policy harmonization is a facilitation mechanism to support cross-border trade. 



 
The World Bank  
Lake Chad Region Recovery and Development Project (P161706) 

 
 

  
Oct 12, 2018 Page 14 of 22  

     

including strategies to prevent GBV. The platform will build on existing initiatives (in particular AFD and 

UN) and will engage researchers from the countries bordering Lake Chad and other key stakeholders, i.e. 

humanitarian workers, diplomats, international actors and national development programs. Data collected 

from monitoring will be confirmed based on the existing research data gaps24. The knowledge platform will 

have strong linkages with universities25 in each country bordering the Lake Chad. The platform will also 

conduct a review of the existing ICT services and the demand from users; and will use and test innovative 

technology, such as satellite images, geo-enabled data and other ICT tools to generate knowledge about the 

Lake Chad Region and its ecosystem, and to ensure monitoring in a challenging environment with many 

security constraints. Information and data gathered under this component will directly feed into the monitoring 

of the results of Component 2 and 3. 

 

 Sub-Component 1.2: Institutional capacity building to strengthen regional cooperation and local governance: 
The project will reinforce institutional capacity at regional, national and local levels and coordination of 

institutional stakeholders to strengthen regional dialogue on conflict prevention and local development in the 

Lake Chad Basin. This will be by supporting existing regional dialogue initiatives (such as the Lake Chad 

Basin Governors forum and other cross-border initiatives in the Lake Chad Region). Moreover, the project 

will support innovative citizen engagement mechanisms (access to information, participatory planning and 

budget, Grievance Redress Mechanisms) aimed at improving participatory planning and monitoring of 

investments around local plans and better institutional governance thus rebuilding trust between local 

populations and institutions. 

 

Component 2: Restoring Rural Mobility and Connectivity 

 

28. The component consists of civil works for rehabilitation of rural roads which are of regional importance, 
focusing on small-scale infrastructure provision to address immediate priority gaps in rural road connectivity in 

selected areas of the Lake Chad. The aim of this component is to improve access of communities to markets, 

especially regional markets, and to provide beneficiaries with an opportunity for short-term employment. 

Selection of the investments will be aligned with the activities of Component 3, in particular with regards to 

enhancing the logistics performance of the selected value chains on the infrastructure side and addressing the lack 

of mobility services or equipment, such as IMT (Intermediate Means of Transport). Road rehabilitation and 

maintenance sites will be assessed by considering the accessibility to basic services and a rapid mobility 

diagnostic based on (i) the calculation of RAI (rural access index), (ii) the accessibility by road to markets and 

health facilities such as centers offering emergency obstetrical services, and (iii) mobility needs and constraints 

of the population (through e.g. conducting some focus group discussions with selected communities). The civil 

works will be performed by using the Labor Intensive Public Works (LIPW) method for rural roads rehabilitation. 

This approach will contribute to promoting social cohesion while improving local governance and supporting 

economic recovery through wage jobs, community engagement (collective decision-making, collaborative 

behaviors, and community ownership, etc.) and improved regional road infrastructure. As part of the technical 

approach and to maximize cost efficiency and economic benefits, the use of a combination of regular full all 

weather standard rehabilitation/construction and environmental Oriented Spot Improvement Design to restore 

basic connectivity integrating duration of execution as a factor will be explored during project preparation. This 

component will consist of two sub-components: 

 

                                            
24 See the recent AFD and IRD study Crise et développement – La région du lac Tchad à l’épreuve de Boko Haram. 
25 Potential identified universities are: University of Diffa in Niger, University of N’Djamena, University of Maroua and University of Maiduguri.

 Sub-Component 2.1: Rural Roads Rehabilitation Preparatory and Technical Studies and Community 
Maintenance System: This sub-component will finance preparatory and other technical studies to be 

conducted during project preparation and implementation including preliminary conditions surveys, bills 

of quantities and cost calculations and support for environmental and social assessments. Gender specifics 

needs will be identified by the LDP and a mobility assessment (e.g., such needs could include dedicated 

sanitation facilities, street lighting, GBV, etc. at important logistical hubs or market areas). In addition, 

this component will support the development of a community maintenance system to promote the 

sustainability of investments, in terms of both jobs and roads. This could include the development of a 

small association or micro enterprise at community level for road maintenance. 

 

 Sub-Component 2.2: Rural Roads Rehabilitation Works: This sub-component will finance all civil works-
related expenses to beneficiaries for the preparation, execution, and supervision of works which aim at 

restoring rural mobility and connectivity on the Lake Chad and around the Lake. This component will 

complement productive investment activities under Sub-Component 3.1. This includes civil works to 

rehabilitate existing rural roads to obtain all-season road upgraded to respect defined technical standards, 

in particular targeted small rural roads to improve access of communities to regional markets.26 The 

financing of targeted dredging of navigation channels and construction/rehabilitation and maintenance of 

river docking piers infrastructure will also be explored.  

 

Component 3: Agriculture Investments and Value-Chain Development 

 

29. This component will promote public productive investments, value-chain development and citizen 
engagement and community participation activities in underserved communities in targeted areas. It has three 

sub-components: 

 

 Sub-Component 3.1: Public Productive Agriculture Investments: This sub-component will provide 
investment funds to communities through local planning processes to finance small investments for 

agriculture activities with a regional link. Activities that could be supported under this component are as 

follows: (i) Participatory local development needs assessments and local development plans, including the 

identification of areas of the agricultural value-chain that can be strengthened; and (ii) economic or 

productive investments, the construction/rehabilitation of rural markets, landing platforms for boats, small 

bridges and culverts, cleaning of channels, platforms (small commercial/logistics/processing platforms27), 

community storage facilities, the restoration of land quality through watershed management, irrigation 

perimeters, enclosures and waterpoints for agriculture and livestock use.28 

 Sub-Component 3.2: Livelihood Support and Value Chain Development: The project will provide targeted 
support for agriculture value chain development, including targeted support to agriculture production, pre- 

and post-harvest and marketing for selected products along the agriculture value chain (in particular red 

pepper, livestock and fish)29. The supported activities will have a cross-border potential, as for example 

                                            
26 The design of the civil works for rehabilitation of rural roads will take in mind potential risks due to extreme temperature, extreme precipitation, 

flooding and drought – risks to which the project locations are being exposed. 
27 This could, for example, include improved technologies for irrigation and fish processing. 
28 The design of the small-scale infrastructure work under this component will take in mind above identified climate and disaster risks to which the 

project locations are being exposed. 
29 Due to the importance of multiple livelihood strategies in the Region, the project will also focus on the interaction of livelihood with agricultural and 

fishery activities.

activities which support the production of trading goods will be prioritized, such as the red pepper road in 

Niger (which is then exported to Nigeria), livestock/fish support in Niger and Chad which would be traded 

to Cameroon and Nigeria, and products along the agriculture value chain that have a regional rational. 

Activities under this component could include: (i) strengthening areas of production and livelihood 

opportunities (irrigation, material, rehabilitation and development of selected polders and horticulture 

perimeters); (ii) provision of assets to enhance the production of sorghum, horticulture, rice, cattle, 

fisheries, etc. to increase the productivity of these sub-sectors;30 and (iii) targeted support aimed at 

facilitating and reinforcing selected trans-border trade for selected areas of value chain development (such 

as markets, storage facilities, etc.). Technical assistance on trans-border trade will also be explored. 

Innovative approaches for improving the agricultural value chain development will be identified during 

project preparation31. Activities of this component will particularly target women and female-headed 

households and youth and will thus serve both as a means of prevention (i.e. reducing women’s and 

youth’s vulnerability) and as a means of longer-term support for those affected by violence. Activities will 

also be chosen following a careful assessment of their level of positive impact on women and youth, and 

if these activities are accessible for women and youth. Furthermore, the negative impacts of post-harvest 

processing which address in particular women and children will also be reduced.32 Given the large youth 

population among the beneficiaries, targeted skills trainings to include life and entrepreneurship skills will 

also be explored based on needs. The approach for identifying, prioritizing, implementing and monitoring 
these activities will be participatory, therefore done in collaboration with local institutions and beneficiary 

communities to mitigate risks of conflicts between communities and contribute to reducing Gender Based 

Violence (GBV), including sexual violence.  

 

 Sub-component 3.3.: Citizen engagement and community participation activities: The project will provide 
targeted support to citizen engagement and community participation activities, such as psychosocial 

support and mentoring, flexible and adaptable community reintegration programs, sports and cultural 

community activities, and different campaigns, such as GBV prevention, de-stigmatization campaigns and 

the engagement of youth and women as conflict and climate and disaster risk management champions will 

also be supported during the planning and implementation processes. These activities will help to restore 

trust among the population and will reduce the risk of further stigmatization, exclusion, radicalization and 

violence, including GBV, etc. These activities would also be complementarity to UNDP’s support to the 

DDR process in the Lake Chad Region, and in particular to the activities of a DD facility which UNDP is 

currently assisting to establish. 
 

 

 

Component 4: Project Management 

 

30. This component will finance the planning, implementation, and technical oversight of program activities; 
and effective social and environmental safeguards management, financial management, and procurement. The 

arrangements for project coordination will be determined at preparation stage. Relevant government agencies at 

                                            
30 The activities will complement the activities under the sub-component 2.1. and especially with regards to the provision of small scale post-harvest 

infrastructure which strengthens the agriculture value chain. 
31 The project may also include support for diversification out of climate-sensitive livelihoods; this will be identified during project preparation. 
32 See Central Africa Coastal Fisheries report (P165882). Fish smoking is done with basic ovens that have negative impacts on the products themselves 

and on the health of the processors mainly women and their children. The FAO, for example, has recently developed a new type of smoking oven that 

reduces the exposure to toxic smoke and chemicals, while also reducing the amount of fuel needed for smoking.

the regional, national, sub-national and local levels will be involved in the implementation process with adequate 

capacity building support. The following activities will be included: Communication, Monitoring and Evaluation 

(M&E) arrangements, including the set-up of a Management Information System (MIS), outcome/impact 

evaluations at mid-term and end-of-project; and measures for enhanced transparency and accountability. 

Innovative implementation mechanisms (use of Third Party Monitoring, digital monitoring/supervision tools, 

such as satellite data) will be considered given the specific security challenges. Data produced with the help of 

the Knowledge and Monitoring platform as outlined in Sub-Component 1.1. will feed directly into project 

supervision and oversight. Project Management will be undertaken in close coordination and collaboration with 

security and justice forces and mechanisms for identifying risk of violence at various stage of project 

implementation will be established so as to allow the project to operate in such an insecure environment. 
 
  

Component 5: Contingent Emergency Response Component (CERC) 

 

31. The project will operate in a highly complex and volatile environment. This zero-funded component will 
allow the governments to quickly mobilize funds in the event of an emergency that will require immediate 

recovery and reconstruction response. The detailed design of this component will be developed during project 

preparation.

  SAFEGUARDS 

 
A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 

 
The project will be implemented in several areas that border Lake Chad, initially in Niger, Cameroon and Chad. The 

following areas have been pre-identified as potential areas of intervention: (a) In Niger: Clusters of pepper productions 
along the main corridor of the national road from N’Guimi via Diffa to Zinder, two fishing communities and one cattle 
area in the North of the Lake Chad ; (b) in Cameroon: communes along the CEMAC corridor in Maroua and Septentrion 
and communes in the close vicinity to the Lake Chad (here, in particular fisheries), and (c) in Chad: a transport corridor 
connecting N’Djamena to the South of Cameroon and West via Bol and Baga Sol and polder areas in Tangal and Gueni. 
These are low density areas in terms of population but represent important transport corridors for goods and produce for 
the region. 
 
B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 

 
Cameroon: The country has a comprehensive environmental and social legal framework, including the 1996 

Environmental Law and its implementation decrees including a decree on ESIA.  The Ministry of Environment, Protection 
of Nature and Sustainable Development (MINEPDED) is responsible for approval of ESIAs/ESMPs/RAPs and ESMPs/RAPs 
compliance monitoring. The Ministries has divisional entities that ensure local ESMPs monitoring compliance. The Order 
No 0010/MINEP of April 3, 2013 requires to set up in each Division of the country, a Committee for the technical and 
administrative supervision of ESMP. However, only one Divisional committee has not been set up in the Project. The 
decentralized entities remain weak and have limited human and logistic capacities.  The country has experience in 
monitoring environmental and social safeguards policies of World Bank financed projects. 
 
Chad: The country has an environmental and social legal framework that includes the legislative framework includes Law 

n ° 14/PR/98 of August 17, 1998 defining the general principles of environment protection. The Country published also on 
August 4, 2010 decree n °630 regulating the Environmental Impact Assessment and on November 29, 2012, the EIA 
preparation general guide. The Ministry in charge of Environment is responsible for approval of ESIAs/ESMPs through 
DEELCPN. This Department remains very poorly staffed and staffs that are there are poorly equipped. The country has 
experience in monitoring the implementation of World Bank financed projects.  The  capacity to deal with environmental 
and social safeguards remains very weak.  
 
Niger:  The country has a comprehensive environmental and social legal framework that includes the Law n ° 2018-28 of 

May 14, 2018 determining the fundamental principles on Environmental Assessments. The Bureau Environmental 
Assessments and Impact Studies (BEEEI), under the Ministry of the Environment and Sustainable Development 
responsible for approval of ESIAs/ESMPs and ESMPs compliance monitoring. In practice, BEEEI lacks decentralized 
entities. BEEEI has some skilled staffs but the number of staff remains limited with regards of the workload and 
responsibilities to be undertaken. BEEEI has very limited logistic  capacities. BEEEI has experience in monitoring World 
Bank safeguards. 
 
During the project preparation, an in-depth assessment of the three borrower's institutional capacities will be 

undertaken and relevant mitigation measures will be proposed.

D. Policies that might apply 

 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

The proposed project is categorized as category B 
project under this policy, because activities under 
Component 2 and 3 are expected to generate 
potential adverse social and environmental risks and 
impacts that will be limited in scale. Most of them will 
be site specific within the target area, few if any of 
them will be irreversible and in most cases, mitigation 
measures can be designed. As the identification of 
sites and works is not yet finalized, an ESMF will be 
prepared for each country, consulted upon, and 
disclosed both in-country and at the World Bank 
website prior to appraisal. In addition, a GBV risk 
assessment for each country will be undertaken in 
order to provide recommendations for how to 
mainstream mitigation measures appropriate for each 
context into the country components. 

Performance Standards for Private Sector 
Activities OP/BP 4.03 

No 
This policy is not triggered as the activities do not 
intend to use private sectors activities as described 
under this policy. 

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 Yes 

OP 4.04 is triggered as the Lake Chad has been 
recognized by the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of 
International Importance (i.e. the Lake Chad is a 
"Ramsar site"). While specific project sites are 
currently not known, it is likely that some project 
activities might take place in the vicinity of the Lake 
Chad. Provisions and further information on 
appropriate risk mitigation strategies and measures in 
relation to the site(s) will be included in each of the 
country specific ESMFs. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No 

This policy is not triggered as the project activities do 
not expect to affect negatively on the health and 
quality of forests and/or finance activities that would 
do so. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

Although procurement of pesticides is not envisaged 
under the project, it is possible that the activities with 
regards to the strengthening of agriculture production 
will lead to an increased use of pesticides. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 Yes 
The Physical Cultural Resources Policy (OP 4.11) is 
triggered because Cameroon, Chad and Niger are 
viewed as rich cultural heritage area. The Lake Chad is 



 
The World Bank  
Lake Chad Region Recovery and Development Project (P161706) 

 
 

  
Oct 12, 2018 Page 20 of 22  

     

also classified as a World Natural Heritage Site by 
UNESCO. Though it is unknown at this time which sites 
may contain such resources, due to the lack of 
specifics on the locations, size, scale of planned 
investments under the project, it was judged prudent 
to use caution when implementing the productive 
investments, especially the civil works. During the 
development of the country specific ESMFs, physical 
cultural resources will be taken into consideration and 
a baseline will be defined. The ESMFs will include clear 
procedures that will be required for identification, 
protection of cultural property from death and 
treatment of discovered artefacts, and which will be 
included in standards bidding documents. The ESMFs 
will also provide procedures for handling chance finds 
(during implementation of the project's activities). 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 TBD 

A social assessment to determine if there are 
Indigenous peoples in the project area or that will be 
impacted by project activities will be undertaken. If 
there are Indigenous peoples, an IPPF or IPP will be 
prepared for the specific country to provide guidance 
during implementation. The IPPFs or IPPs will be 
disclosed in country and on the World Bank website 
prior to appraisal. 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

OP 4.12 is triggered due to the potential impacts 
related to civil works under Components 2 & 3, which 
may lead to minor land acquisition, loss of assets 
and/or access to resources. A Resettlement Policy 
Framework for each country will be prepared or 
updated, consulted upon, approved and disclosed 
both in-country and at the World Bank website prior 
to appraisal. 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 No 
The policy is not triggered as the project activities will 
not involve the construction of a dam or being 
dependent upon an existing dam. 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

Yes 

The policy is triggered because some of the proposed 
investments under component 2.2. (e.g. targeted 
dredging/navigation channels/rehabilitation and 
construction of docking pier infrastructure) and 
possibly also 3.1. (e.g. landing platforms for boats, 
small bridges and culverts, cleaning of channels) will 
take place on an international waterway (Lake Chad), 
as per OP 7.50. As a consequence, other riparian 
countries will be notified of the proposed project and 
the Lake Chad Basin Commission will be involved as 
appropriate and as according to Bank procedures.

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No 
The policy is not triggered as the project does not 
anticipate any disputes in the targeted area. 

 
E. Safeguard Preparation Plan  
 
Tentative target date for preparing the Appraisal Stage PID/ISDS 
 
Apr 25, 2019 
 
Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed. The specific studies and 
their timing should be specified in the Appraisal Stage PID/ISDS 
 
RPFs will be simultaneously prepared (or updated in the case of PNDP in Cameroon) for each country prior to appraisal. 

The information obtained during the preparation will be used to prepare the Appraisal stage ISDS.

  Other Decision (as needed) 
 

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 

1. Pakistan, the world’s sixth most populous country, is a lower-middle-income country 
which has made significant progress towards macroeconomic and financial stability. Pakistan’s 
per capita income has almost doubled and the share of the population living in poverty has 
decreased by two-thirds over the last decade. Gross domestic product (GDP) growth reached 4.7 
percent in 2016 and is expected to reach 5 percent in 2017, supported by construction and 
manufacturing activities, increased private sector credit growth, increased reserves, low 
inflation, continuing strong remittances, and an upturn in foreign direct investment related to 
the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.  

2. Nevertheless, Pakistan faces serious development challenges, mostly in rural areas. 
GDP growth has been slower than needed to provide for the level of jobs required for a young 
and growing population. Inadequacy in the private sector environment, public sector 
management, and implementation capacity will continue to hamper service delivery 
performance. Thus, human development indicators continue to lag. In fact, Pakistan did not meet 
the targets of most of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015. Rural poverty remains 
about double the urban poverty (35 percent versus 18 percent in 2014) and decreases less 
rapidly, given low growth of the agriculture sector, inadequate rural infrastructure and 
connectivity to markets, weak governance and institutions, and limited access to finance. 

3. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) has faced a number of crises in the past decade. With 
geographical proximity and community-level ties to Afghanistan, KP has suffered from the fallout 
of the conflict in Afghanistan, which has given rise to a precarious security situation as well as 
prolonged political and social instability. Related hostilities and extremist violence have caused 
far-reaching disruption to economic activity and inflicted extensive damage on private property, 
livelihoods, and public infrastructure.

Khyber Pakhthunkhwa Irrigated Agriculture Improvement Project (P163474)

4. KP is also one of Pakistan’s less developed regions, with some economic and social 
development indicators lagging behind the national averages. The province of KP accounts for 
an estimated 10.5 percent of the country’s GDP and about 14.6 percent of the population 
(approximately 30.5 million). The per capita income in KP is estimated to be 33 percent below 
the national average, and despite a sharp and consistent decline in poverty, 27 percent of 
households are estimated to be living below the national poverty line. Another relevant indicator 
is the household size, which is strongly correlated with poverty in Pakistan. KP households 
comprise 7.2 members on average, well above the national average of 6.3 members. Most of 
KP’s population (85 percent) also lives in rural areas, where access to public services and income 
generation opportunities is lower than in urban centers. 

5. Climate change is expected to exacerbate extreme weather events in KP, thereby 
increasing the vulnerability of people and assets to climate induced disasters. Since 2010 
extreme events such as cloudburst over the catchment areas of Indus and its tributaries, have 
frequently occurred during the annual monsoon season. This often leads to flash floods and 
landslides, causing damages across several sectors, including agriculture, livelihoods, 
infrastructure, transport and communications, and housing. Since 2010, KP has been facing 
extreme precipitation events, in the Indus catchment areas, particularly during the annual 
monsoon season. This results in swelling of rivers, causing localized and major floods in low-lying 
areas. KP is also facing an increased number of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOF) due to 
increased temperatures and intense precipitation. Being an upper riparian province in Pakistan, 
KP receives the shortest lead times for early warnings on climate induced hydro-meteorological 
disasters. As a result of the 2010 floods, KP suffered US$ 1.1 billion in damages, which included 
damages and losses of US$ 96 million1 to the agriculture sector in the province. 

B. Sectoral and Institutional Context 

6. Agriculture is important for Pakistan and the Government has placed agriculture 
development and water efficiency at the forefront of its development agenda. Agriculture2 
remains the second largest economic sector in Pakistan, contributing about 21 percent to the 
national GDP and employing approximately 42 percent of the labor force. The sector is also the 
largest contributor to export revenues with about 75 percent share from exports of primary and 
processed (mostly cotton textile) goods. The Government acknowledges that sustaining an 
annual GDP growth rate of 6 percent or more will require greater focus on agriculture and 
improved water resources planning, governance, and resilience. The Government is pursuing 
multiple initiatives to boost efforts to increase agricultural and water productivity, promote 
efficient use of its scarce water and precious land resources, and incentivize private sector 
investment in these areas for economic growth and shared prosperity.  

7. The contribution of agriculture in the KP economy, however, is less prominent, although 
it employs a high percentage of its labor force. KP’s contribution to the country agriculture GDP

2 Includes crops, livestock, forestry, and fisheries. 



 
The World Bank  
Khyber Pakhthunkhwa Irrigated Agriculture Improvement Project (P163474)

is the smallest of all provinces at 7 percent, compared to its share in total GDP of 11 percent. Also 
within KP, agriculture accounts for only 14 percent of the provincial GDP, representing the 
smallest share of all provinces. The sector accounts for 37 percent of labor force employment3 
and 11 percent of the total household income. The total cultivated area of the province is 1.6 
million ha (7 percent of the country’s total), half of which is rain fed. It produces about 5 percent 
of the country’s total wheat, 2 percent of rice, 17 percent of maize, 8 percent of sugarcane, 16 
percent of barley, 4 percent of gram, 3 percent of rapeseed and mustard, and 75 percent of 
tobacco. Its share in the country’s total livestock population is about 6 percent in cattle, 2.5 
percent in buffalo, 2 percent in sheep, and 8 percent in goats. KP is currently facing a food deficit 
and depends heavily on imports from other provinces, especially from Punjab, for important 
commodities like wheat (64 percent), rice (74 percent), milk, meat, sugar (80 percent), and 
vegetables (90 percent) to complement its production. The answer to this conundrum of 
agriculture may lie in the under exploitation of its natural resources, as the sector grew at a 
decent rate of 3.1 percent to 7.3 percent in the 2010–2015 five-year period, especially after the 
active insurgency period ended. 

8. KP’s land and water resources are under exploited. Of the total culturable4 land of 2 m 
ha., 1/3rd is irrigated, 1/3rd is rainfed and 1/3rd is culturable waste. Water allocated to KP under 
the National Water Apportionment Accord (WAA) of 1991 is 8.78 million acre feet (MAF) but due 
to current carrying capacity of the aging infrastructure and lack of new infrastructure the 
province is only able to withdraw about 68 percent (5.97 MAF) of its share. Also, 14 percent in 
floodwater, under the accord, is not fully used. Additionally, all water resources freed up from 
the WAA’s ambit, for the province, are not yet fully used. These include waters from schemes not 
exceeding 5,000 acres above elevation of 1200 ft. (Survey of Pakistan Datum [SPD]) and waters 
from Kurum/Gomal/kohat basins located in the highly-underserved areas of Kohat, Hangu, Karak, 
Bannu, Lakki Marwat, and D.I. Khan Districts. Thus, one-third of KP’s arable land depends on 
rainfall in a climate that is semiarid to arid. Another one-third (1.08 million ha) of KP’s arable 
land, called culturable waste land, is out of cultivation due either to water logging, non-
availability of irrigation water, salinity, unlevel land, lack of manpower, funds shortages, and so 
on. Thus, more land and water resource development is desperately needed for KP’s food 
security, import substitution, and economic development especially of the lagging areas. That’s 
why feasibility studies are included in the project design to prepare future investments in water 
resources development. 

9. The irrigation infrastructure in KP suffers from deferred maintenance5. KP canals are 
aging. Some are older than 100 years. As an upper riparian province with hilly terrains and steep 
slopes, KP’s canals suffer from frequent bank breaches, bed erosion and scouring due to floods, 

 
3 28 percent of male and 77 percent of female (mostly rural); 44 percent of rural and 6 percent of urban labor force is engaged 
in agriculture. The labor force participation is 80 percent male and 20 percent female (21 percent in rural and 12 percent in 
urban areas). 
4 According to bureau of statistics-Pakistan, culturable land includes cultivated and culturable waste lands and 

cultivated area includes rainfed and irrigated lands. 
5 De-siltation; oiling & greasing; repairing leakages, damaged sections of canal prism, cross drainage structure and outlets 



 
The World Bank  
Khyber Pakhthunkhwa Irrigated Agriculture Improvement Project (P163474)

sliding and high velocities in addition to the normal wear and tear of a canal. Due to the poor 
condition of the canals, the system’s delivery performance is poor and the leakages/wastages 
(estimated at 25%) are causing water logging. Unlike Punjab, the reliance on ground water is 
minimal in irrigated areas, therefore water lost would be wasted and even would cause water 
logging and salinity. The silt deposition raises the level of the command area for which canal bed 
needs to be raised to continue providing the required volumes of water. 

Besides the canals, there are some 4,000-km long surface and subsurface drainage system in KP 
that was built to flush out the excess water to keep the fertile land in production in the central 
districts. However due to lack of funds, this infrastructure is also suffering and, the carrying 
capacity of the drainage system has diminished and large tracts of precious fertile lands are 
becoming water logged and saline again.  

To keep pace with the exceptional level of O & M needs of the KP irrigation and drainage system, 
larger amounts of funds are needed. However, according to the KP Irrigation Department, only 
1/3rd (PkR 500 m vs PkR. 12,00 m for the last 10 years) of the needs are provided. Water charges 
(Abiana) collections in the province has been low at 30% of the total assessed, mainly because of 
the limited paying capacity of the large number of small landholders and low flat rates - PKR 
300/year/acre. Besides, its own system, the department also must, at times, shoulder the 
rehabilitation of civil canals which are community owned and do not pay any water charges. 

This practice of ‘build neglect rebuild’ costs the exchequer dearly6 which are oftentimes met from 
the development budget. 

Removing this backlog of rehabilitation as well as modernization is important to improve the 
system service capability, reduce water wastages/leakages and water logging and safeguard the 
system sustainability.  

10. In KP, as reported by the Irrigation Department, 10-15 percent of the canal outlets are 
tampered and /or illegal. This creates in-equity among growers in the system and affects the 
productivity of the farmers mainly at the tail end. An understanding has been reached with the 
Department to resolve such in-equities during the rehabilitation of the system. 

11. Historically, the collaboration between Irrigation and Agriculture Departments, in KP, is 
weak. Irrigation Department is responsible for development of dams, canals and drains, its 
functionality and O&M; delivering water to farmers at the outlet/farmgate (in watercourses); and 
assessment and collections of water charges. The Agriculture Department is responsible for 
development and rehabilitation of watercourses, promoting water conservation technologies 
and training farmers in good agriculture practices. Due to poor coordination, the benefits of up 
and down stream investment do not consolidate at the farm level. The Baizai Irrigation scheme 
is a good example. The Irrigation Department constructed the upstream delivery system with 
capacity for 25,000 acres but since no provision was made in the scheme budget for the 

 
6 According to a global estimate, a dollar deferred maintenance costs US$7 in repair/rehabilitation

construction of watercourses, the agriculture department could not do so and after more than 2 
years the farmers are unable to utilize the water fully. This collaboration has started to improve 
in some very new schemes and this project will contribute to improving this collaboration further. 

12. In KP, as in the rest of the country, O & M of the watercourses, that brings water from 
canals to the farms, is a challenge on the daily basis. These are earthen structures owned and 
managed by farmers. The average length of a watercourse (including branches) is about 3 km, 
serving an average area of 150 acres with an average number of 75 shareholder farmers. Every 
farmer has a turn, once a week, to take his share in proportion to his landholding from the 
watercourse. Every time a farmer diverts his/her share, loose earth/mud and stone mixture are 
gathered from the surrounding fields to plug and unplug the farm gate and watercourse at the 
turnouts. Preventing leakage from these structure is a continuous battle for the farmer. Since 
this channel must pass near each farm, there are many turns and branches through which water 
passes. This is an important cause of spillage and leakage for water. Being earthen, many 
different weeds/shrubs/trees start growing on the banks of the watercourse. These often 
become a source of blockage due to its own biomass and capturing silt load causing the water to 
overflow and causing ponding near the watercourse-sometimes becoming mosquito breading 
points. Another source of damage are rodents and grazing animals. This necessitates recurrent 
seasonal cleaning by farmers. Since farmers are poor and cannot afford to hire labour, they do it 
mostly themselves. This O & M of the watercourse draws heavily on the farmers’ time and labour 
-and also cause wastage of his precious water estimated up to 40%. Being earthen, it is easier to 
cut and steal other farmer’s share that can become source of heavy rifts in relations. Therefore, 
it is important to support farmer with watercourse improvement i.e. lining of 507% length, 
installing all turnout structures, construction of crossing culverts, washing pads, and animal 
drinking wallows. It is estimated that this investment helps the farmer save 75% labour time, 15 
percentage point of water wastage, water travel time by 50%, in-equity, theft control which 
results in 15-20% crop yield increase, 30% cropping intensity and ultimately increased net 
incomes. In addition to these benefits it also helps in saving energy costs and precious ground 
water on tube-well water courses. 

13. Field application of water is highly in-efficient in KP as in other parts of the country. Due 
to the widespread practice of flood irrigation and insufficient knowledge of good irrigation 
agronomy practices, water losses are highest at the field level where application efficiency is as 
low as 65–70 percent. Resultantly, crop yields and cropping intensities are low. Investments to 
promote water conservation technologies such as high-efficiency irrigation systems (HEIS) and 
laser-based precision land leveling (PLL) on-farm are of paramount importance for saving losses 
on-farm. HEIS is estimated to increase field application efficiency by 25 percentage points to 95% 
and PLL helps save water by about 30% resulting in increased yields and incomes. 

14. In KP, farmers’ productivity is generally low. Most crop yields in KP are low compared to 
other provinces and progressive growers. This could be attributed to large number of (80%) small 

 
7 So far the department lined 30% but the new findings and demand from the farmers suggest to increase it to 50%

landholdings lacking scale and purchasing power; labour shortage due to out migration to cities 
and abroad and insufficient mechanization to off-set this shortage; shortage of skilled labour; 
insufficient private sector participation and services; lack of financial services; weak public sector 
research and extension services. 

15. KP has pockets with unique agro-climatic conditions, ideal for horticulture production. 
These include, among others, citrus, dates, pome fruits, potato, tomato, and onions. However, 
the current share of the subsector in the total cropped area is only 6 percent. With improved 
access roads to the main domestic markets and neighboring Afghanistan and air links to the Gulf 
and Central Asian countries, KP could potentially further capitalize on this comparative 
advantage.  

16. Postharvest losses are high. Lack of postharvest technology and management and 
modern cool chain infrastructure and inappropriate storage, packaging, and transportation 
facilities are major bottlenecks specially for perishable commodities in KP. Postharvest losses of 
35 percent to 40 percent for fruits and vegetables remain one of the most pressing problems, 
mostly given the lack of farmer’s awareness about scientific handling of farm produce. 
Inappropriate storage facilities, both in the public and private sector, register the highest losses 
during handling operations. Horticulture products are mostly stored in shallow pits covered with 
farm wastes without ventilation, without proper sanitation, and without preventive measures for 
insect and disease control. The concept of a cool chain network is in its infancy and integrated 
cool chain networks are mostly lacking. The existing cold storage facilities are unevenly 
distributed across the country with Punjab dominating with 512 units, while KP only had 16 units 
in 2009 (Planning Commission 2009). The cold storage facilities are based on old technology that 
do not differentiate for unique temperature requirements of crop species. Moreover, most of 
the existing packing facilities do not measure up to international standards. The types of 
containers used for transporting and storing products vary from place to place, but a common 
practice is to use whatever container is available. This causes the produce to be pressed hard in 
the crates or carried in oversized containers, causing huge loss.  

17. In addition, the agricultural marketing infrastructure and system is inadequate and 
lacks market responsiveness. Many wholesale markets (mandis) were built years ago, and are 
unable to cope efficiently with increased transactions. Serious traffic congestion, insufficient 
space for efficient movement of products in and out, inadequate storage, and improper 
management are some of the major factors for increased marketing costs and physical losses of 
farm products. Hygiene conditions, particularly in the case of fruits, vegetables, and livestock, are 
quite dismal. Excessive domination of commission agents, lack of physical and allied facilities, 
non-involvement of growers and consumers in market committees, and an ineffective market 
information system are some of the inherent problems of these markets and are putting farmers 
at a disadvantageous situation while selling their produce. In addition, the lack of planning and 
communication between demand and supply result in gluts at one time and shortages at other 
times, causing severe price fluctuations and loss of farmer incomes.

18. The level of processing and value addition of agricultural products is very low in 
Pakistan. Only 3 percent of the total production of fruits and vegetable and less than 10 percent 
of milk are processed in the country (Planning Commission 2009). There exists enormous 
potential of adding value to various fruits and vegetable, such as freezing, drying, dehydrating, 
or crushing into powder, juice, pulp, oil, paste, sauce, chips, pickles, chutney, and jam. The culture 
of value addition through processing and diversification is still at infant stages in Pakistan. This 
small amount of processing leaves large opportunities and could also absorb some of the 
seasonal glut and extend the life of the raw material. 

19. The new government has increased the budget allocation to the sector and shifted its 
policy from higher productivity to higher profitability for smallholder farmers. The KP 
Government increased the budget for its annual development plans to US$62 million for 
agriculture and US$71 million for irrigation in FY17, which is still well below the needs. Key 
priority areas of the new government, as highlighted in the KP Integrated Development Strategy 
of 2014–18 and the KP Agriculture Policy and Strategy—a ten-year perspective (2014–24), are 
improving, among others, production, processing, and marketing, thus improving extension 
services; diversification into high-value agriculture (horticulture, livestock, dairy, and 
aquaculture); adaptation to climate change; on-farm water management (OFWM); development 
of new water resources; rehabilitation/modernization of the existing irrigation and drainage 
infrastructure; and governance. 

20. The World Bank’s last engagement with KP in the sector was for about six years from 
2001 to 2007 for a total of US$21 million made mainly in restoration/rehabilitation of the 
irrigation network from the secondary to the tertiary level. Major efforts were also made, in 
support of the national drainage program (NDP), in devolving the management to farmers, with 
powers to collect water charges and keep 40 percent for managing the operation and 
maintenance of the system from the secondary level downward. However, this outcome could 
not be sustained for long and has been rolled back by the Government.

D. Concept Description 

23. The project will contribute to the development of the agriculture sector by working on (a) 
water as an important input and limiting factor to productivity and overall production (b) training 
and technology for improving productivity, post-harvest management and value addition. More 
specifically, it will support six key priority areas of the government strategy for the sector, that 
is, improving performance/functionality of the delivery system and reducing water wastages; 
making water allocation/distribution equitable; increasing financial sustainability of the irrigation 
system management; increasing climate resilience; increasing productivity and promoting high 
value agriculture (production, processing and marketing); and strengthening the department for 
improved service delivery and governance.  

24. To consolidate the benefits of the project, priority will be given to schemes where all the 
three components’ interventions can happen together. In this way, the two departments of 
agriculture and irrigation will work in close collaboration, hitherto weak.  

25. The project will provide climate change co-benefits derived from: (a) adaptation, by changing 
irrigation management systems and practices to reduce vulnerability to climate change, by 
reducing water wastages and its negative externalities during delivery and by reducing losses 
during field application and crop growth stages; and by promoting innovative resource 
management practices to increase resilience, expanding the use of crops and crop 
mixes/rotations less vulnerable to climate variability, and expanding the use of protected 
agriculture and drought/heat resistant varieties; and (b) mitigation, by promoting sustainable 
water management practices that promote water use efficiency and by promoting agricultural 
intensification using higher yielding varieties, carbon sequestration species and cropping 
patterns, and replacing traditional sources of energy. 

26. Woman will be particularly encouraged and targeted to derive maximum benefits of the 
project and play role in the implementation of the project. The project will also ensure to 
safeguard the interest and needs of woman and marginalized groups e.g. providing for protected 
washing pads and animal drinking willows, and avoiding technologies and practices that increases 
drudgery for woman. Further, contractors, consulting firms and implementing partners of the 
project will be sensitized on gender issues and encouraged to achieve gender balance in their 
teams. The operational manual will spell out gender aspects and protocols for mainstreaming 
gender within project interventions.  

27. The project will be open to the entire province and will be completed in six years. The 
project will have the following components: 

Component A: Irrigation System Management (IDA $52 m US) 

This component will have the following three sub-components.

Khyber Pakhthunkhwa Irrigated Agriculture Improvement Project (P163474) 

 
 

  
Jul 31, 2017 Page 11 of 21  

     

28. Sub-compoenent-A1: Rehabilitation and reduction in in-equities: This sub-component 
would support the Irrigation Department to overcome the backlog of rehabilitation to fully 
restore the functionality/performance of the irrigation system; reduce the excessive and wasteful 
losses estimated at 25% by 7 percentage points; and increase economic/service life by at least 
10-15 years. This will include support to both the government and civil (community owned) 
canals systems. The government has prepared a prioritized list of 22 schemes, costing about 
USD140 million, for rehabilitation. The project, during the preparation, will conduct a diagnosis 
of the KP irrigation system, including the list provided by the government to, identify the schemes 
to be support by the project. The criteria for selection would include: vulnerability to climate 
change impacts; acreage and number of beneficiaries; potential for high value agriculture; 
poverty levels in the area served; and cost effectiveness (cost per unit area served). A Project 
Preparation Facility (PPF) has been discussed with the client for preparing detail designs and 
bidding documents for the selected schemes. The rehabilitation works would, usually, include 
flood eroded beds and banks; sunken earth filled sections; and damaged hydraulic structures like 
100ft up and down stream of the fall structures, off-taking points of minors and sub-minors, 
footings of overhead bridges; passages through settlements and deep cut areas; and catchwater 
drains for flushing flood water. Before rehabilitation work begins, any outlets tampered and/or 
illegally installed will be removed. 

29. Sub-component-A2: Institutional strengthening & Reform: To avoid buildup of further 
backlog, an understanding with the GoKP will be developed to increase allocation of recurrent 
budget for the O&M of the system by lifting the current cap that is in place for the last 10 years. 
This could be informed by conducting a study on the cost of neglecting (under funding) the O&M 
of the system. However, to make it sustainable in the long run, support will be provided to the 
department to improve its revenue generation capacity by improving collection of the water 
charges. The investments of component C, should help increase the farmers’ capacity to pay 
water charges by improving their crop productivity and switching to high value crops.  

Further support will be provided for training of staff; developing asset management plan; and 
developing water budgets and water balances estimates for the six-major government canal 
systems.  

The KP government has planned to develop the Provincial Integrated Water Resources 
Management Policy with support from the Bank managed MDTF funded Governance and Policy 
Support project. Support under this sub-component will be re-aligned with the directives of this 
policy.  

30. Sub-compoenent-A3: Future investments preparation: To increase availability of water for 
irrigation, households and livestock; support ground water recharge; reduce intensity of floods, 
siltation downstream by tapping hill torrents and splash floods in the rainfed areas, the project 
will finance preparation of feasibilities, detailed designs, and bidding documents for selected 
dams and irrigation schemes. The scheme selection will be based on criteria of number of farmers 
and acreage benefiting and cost effectiveness and poverty levels in the area served.

Component B: On-farm Water Management (IDA $51 m US) 
This component will enable the Agriculture Department to support farmers including woman, to 
rehabilitate/improve existing and construct new watercourses; adopt water conservation 
technologies on their farms; and in training its staff. The component design benefits from lessons 
drawn from Sindh and Punjab Irrigated Agriculture Improvement projects. These include a) 
developing good database of watercourses with information for length, no. of shareholders, legal 
status; inclusion of tube-well watercourse; lining 50% length and all turnouts; seasonal work 
windows; monitoring dashboards; estimation of average costs; openness to the entire province 
b) empowerment of the farmers to select and negotiate price of the HEIS and PLL equipements 
with suppliers; training of farmers in crop agronomy; fixing maximum cap on project support per 
unit, c) ensuring geographical spread for laser land leveling promotion etc. The component will 
also finance the extended presence of consultants/firm for engineering supervision of activities 
to be implemented by the field teams of the Department. This component will have the four sub-
components, as follows; 
31. Sub-component-B1: Rehabilitation of existing watercourses: The rehabilitation/improvement 
works will be done on existing watercourses on government and civil canals; springs and tube-
well irrigated areas. This work will include lining of 50% length from the offtake point including 
selected critical sections; alignment; desilting; re-sectioning; installing all turn out structures; 
crossing culverts, washing pads and animal drinking willows. Farmers will contribute 20% of the 
total cost in the shape of skilled and unskilled labour and form themselves into water users’ 
associations with at least 70% farmers’ representation.  

32. Sub-component-B2: Construction of watercourses network: Construction of new 
watercourses network will be done in some new schemes areas where the Irrigation Department 
has already completed the upstream irrigation infrastructure but not the watercourses due to 
which farmers are unable to utilize water. The project support will include farmer’s mobilization 
and their formation of WUAs; engineering design, BOQ & cost estimates for construction of the 
full length of earthen watercourse; lining of 50% length preferably from the off-taking point and 
other critical sections; construction of all turn out structures, crossing culverts, washing pads and 
animal drinking points. Here again farmers will contribute 20% of the total cost in the shape of 
skilled and unskilled labour and form themselves into a water users’ association where at least 
70% farmers become members. 

33. Sub-component-B3: Promote water conservation technologies: To promote on-farm 
water conservation, technologies like HEIS and precision laser land leveling (PLL) will be 
supported on a cost sharing basis. These technologies will particularly suit at the tail end and 
tube-well irrigated areas. Farmers will be trained in growing high value crops under HEIS to make 
the use of technology economically viable. 

34. Sub-component-B4: Capacity building & institutional strengthening: The project will 
finance training of staff in new improved methods of on-farm water management and data and 
studies on the watercourses network.

Component C: Agriculture Productivity Enhancement and Value-Addition (IDA 
$50 m US)  
The objective of this component is to improve the productivity, diversification, harvest and post- 
harvest management and processing & value addition in agriculture (crops, horticulture, fisheries 
and livestock sub-sectors). This objective will be achieved by i) strengthening public sector 
institutions (e.g., research and extension institutions) to solidify the foundation for sustained 
sectoral growth; i) investing in capacity building and iii) introducing modern technologies to 
farmers; and iv) support agribusinesses/ag-entrepreneurs for higher value addition through agro-
processing and commercialization services. This component addresses the climate change 
vulnerabilities to the agriculture sector, as set out in the project’s vulnerability context. All the 
activities under the Component will adequately reflect important CSA areas of productivity, 
adaptation and mitigation as highlighted in Pakistan CSA profile important for agriculture in 
Northern Pakistan. Considering that more than 70% of Pakistan’s female workforce is employed 
in agriculture, there is a special need to ensure all services provided by the Component will be 
more gender sensitive. The lessons drawn from similar projects, for example, the Sindh 
Agriculture Growth Project, have been incorporated to the Component design. The component 
will also finance the extended presence of technical consultants/firm to assist with planning and 
management of the Component. 

35. Subcomponent C.1: Modernizing public extension service and agricultural research (US$14 m). 
The sub-component will finance modernizing and rehabilitating extension and research facilities 
which have been identified as critical for the KP agriculture sector, such as the agricultural 
research centers, training centers and laboratory facilities etc. The subcomponent will also 
finance information and communication (ICT)-based technologies and services for delivery of 
agricultural extension and marketing for farmers and value chains, such as developing mobile 
phone APPs and other ICT tools (e.g., 24/7 call center, interactive websites, mobile training and 
demonstration centers etc.). The subcomponent will also support studies and data on the sector 
and training of staff. 

36. Subcomponent C.2: Capacity building of farmers (US$6 million).  The project will finance 
training and capacity building for famers, which will be based on training needs assessment 
carried out by the departments and their technical assistance providers. Training topics will 
include, but not limited to, good agricultural practices (including those specifically related to 
CSA), agribusiness management, negotiating in the market, basic accounting, and business plan 
development skills, etc. This will be done through demonstration plots, public information 
campaign, face-to-face training (farmers field school), domestic study tours and exposure visits 
etc.  Special attention will be given to climate smart agriculture related knowledge.    

37. Subcomponent C.3: Introducing modern technologies to farmers (US$20 million).  The project 
will finance investments to increase productivity, climate resilience and on-farm pre-and post-
harvest management of crops, horticulture, fisheries and livestock sub-sectors through 
technology (e.g., farm machinery, equipements, seeds, breeds, and infrastructure etc.).  This

support will be provided on a cost sharing basis with 70% paid by the Project and 30% by 
beneficiaries on a first come first serve basis, with ensuring regional equity. 

38. Subcomponent C.4: Support agribusinesses (US$10 million). This sub-component will support 
agribusinesses (SMEs)/agro-entrepreneurs for improved services, commercialization and 
processing & value addition. This will include businesses like seed companies, nursery growers, 
fish hatcheries, animal semen producers, farm machinery & equipements providers; reefer 
transporters, chillers, ventilated & cold storages, pack-houses including graders, sorter; slaughter 
houses, pulpers, oil extractors, de-hydrators, tanners; trading centers like rehabilitation of fruit, 
vegetable, livestock and grain wholesale markets; introducing digital trading platforms and 
contract growing etc. The project will provide a competitive grant program with a transparent 
and efficient review and selection process. The grant size will be up to US$100,000, with 30% 
matching fund from applicants. The grant will be released in three tranches based on verified 
progress of proposal implementation. 

39. The component will provide climate change co-benefits derived from: (a) adaptation, by 
promoting innovative resource management practices to increase resilience, expanding the use 
of crops and crop mixes/rotations less vulnerable to climate variability, and expanding the use of 
protected agriculture and drought/heat resistant varieties; and (b) mitigation, by promoting 
agricultural intensification using higher yielding varieties, carbon sequestration species and 
cropping patterns, and replacing traditional sources of energy.. 

Component D: Project Management and Implementation Support (IDA US$12 
million) 

40. This component will support the establishment of the project management structure. This 
will include project administration, human resources including woman staff, procurement, and 
financial management; monitoring and evaluation (M&E); communications management; social 
and environmental safeguards management; and grievance redress and community feedback 
mechanisms particularly channeling the voices of woman beneficiaries.  

41. Citizen Engagement (CE): The populations targeted in the citizen engagement mechanism 
of the proposed project will be farmers and agribusiness owners receiving support to increase 
their yield/productivity and the commercialization of their products. The CE mechanism will 
assist the extension service and government officials in making more informed decisions about 
resource allocations, training and technology needs of farmers and agribusiness owners. Overall, 
the CE mechanism will enhance the successful implementation of the project, and guide the 
government in preparing better programs for farmers. A detailed citizen engagement mechanism 
and grievance redressal mechanism will be elaborated during the preparation phase of the 
project, and will be included in the project implementation manual. 

42. Gender. The project design and approach will reflect the need for taking account of the 
gender dimension and risks associated with knowledge and technology transfer. Project will be 
designed to ensure that it provides equal opportunities for women to participate in project

activities. Climate-resilient agricultural technologies will be screened to ensure that they are 
gender-neutral. A comprehensive social assessment has been initiated as part of project 
preparation and is expected to result, among others, in a Gender Action Plan. 

   

  SAFEGUARDS 

 
A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 

 
The project will be implemented in various districts of KP. The land cover of KP changes from north to south. The 

Province sits primarily on the Iranian plateau and comprises the junction where the slopes of the Hindu Kush mountains 
on the Eurasian plate give way to the Indus-watered hills approaching South Asia. Geographically, the province could be 
divided into four agro-ecological zones on the basis climatic conditions covering temperature, rainfall, altitude and 
topography as developed by Environmental Protection Agency of KP:  
(a) Zone A – Northern Mountains covering districts of Buner, Shangla, Upper and Lower Dir, Swat and Chitral.  
(b) Zone B – Sub Humid Mountain covering districts of Haripur, Batagram, Mansehra, Abbottabad, Kohistan and 

Torghar.    
(c) Zone C – Central Valley Plains covering districts of Peshawar, Mardan, Charshada and Nowshera. 
(d) Zone D – Piedmont Plains (including Suleiman) covering districts of Bannu, karak, Lakki Marwat, Tank and DI Khan.  
The snowcapped mountains of Chitral and Swat have low vegetative cover above 4,000 meters. Mountains having 

altitude less than 4,000 meters have alpine forests (up to 3,300 meters). Altitudes between 3,000 meters to 1,500 meters 
have conifer and between 1,500 up to 900 meters have sub-tropical forests. These forests and plains provide habitat to 
98 species of mammals and birds including endangered species of snow leopard, brown bear, ibex, etc. The protected 
areas notified in KP includes 6 national parks, three wildlife sanctuaries, 38 game reserves, 90 community game reserves, 
16 private game reserves, 2 wildlife refuges and 8 wildlife parks. The combined area of all protected areas is 666,340 ha. 
The project activities are located in parts of Zone C valley plains and Zone D piedmont plains, which are are mostly used 

for agriculture and livestock grazing. Indus River and its tributaries are the main source of water for agriculture in the 
Province. Other major rivers that crisscross the province are  Kabul, Swat, Kunar, Siran, Panjkora, Bara, Kurram, Dor, Haro, 
Gomal and Zhob. 
 
B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 

 
The KP Government will be the implementing agency. The last time these two departments, Agriculture Department and 

Irrigation Department  implemented a World Bank project was in 2001-2007, and there the Irrigation Department had a 
secondary role. This leaves much desire for familiarity with and improvement in the understanding of the Bank safeguard 
policies. Therefore, safeguards capacity support, handholding and training will be provided throughout the project 
implementation to ensure that they have adequate capacity to respond to project safeguard issues. 
 
A Project Coordination & Management Unit (PCMU)—led by the Agriculture Department, will be established to manage 

implementation and coordination. Project Implementation Units one each in Agriculture (or two in its sub departments) 
and Irrigation Departments will be established to supervise technical implementation in the field. The PCMU will have a 
senior Safeguards Specialist as part of the PCMU Team. PIUs  at the two departments level will be supported by individual 
environment & social safeguards consultants. These consultants will work closely with the engineering supervision 
consultants, and will provide input into the project design as per safeguards instruments (such as ESMF, RPF, RAP, etc.). 
The senior Safeguards Specialist at the PCMU level will be responsible for the overall implementation and performance of 
the safeguards documents, while the day-to-day screening, monitoring and implementation will be the responsibility of 



 
The World Bank  
Khyber Pakhthunkhwa Irrigated Agriculture Improvement Project (P163474) 

 
 

  
Jul 31, 2017 Page 16 of 21  

     

the safeguard specialists at the PIU levels. The project will have a Project Implementation Committee (PIC) co-chaired by 
Secretary Agriculture and Secretary Irrigation and membered by heads of the PIUs, Chiefs of Water, Agriculture & 
Livestock from P & D, to review the progress of project components. The senior Safeguards Specialist at the PCMU level 
will be a part of the PIC. All project implementation and supervision consultant firms will be required to have adequate 
social and environmental safeguards specialists. The contractors for civil works will implement Contractor ESMP, including 
all necessary guidelines on labor health, safety and environment.  
 
Project launch workshop will be organized by the task team once the project becomes effective and will include a 

detailed session on safeguard implementation arrangements.

D. Policies that might apply 

 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

The project activities involve irrigation infrastructure 
improvement, on farm water management schemes 
and production and post-production support to 
farmers and market actors. These activities are 
expected to cause some adverse environmental and 
social impacts. Overall, most of the impacts are 
expected to be during the construction phase and are 
likely to be temporary and reversible. Consequently, 
the policy has been triggered. Since project will also 
finance feasibility studies for dams, the scale and 
capacity of which is currently unknown. Based on 
existing information, the project has been categorized 
as Category A.   
 
The irrigation infrastructure improvement will overall 
improve irrigation efficiencies and help in ensuring 
availability of designed water flows at the tail-end of 
watercourses. However, improved infrastructure will 
not change the designed water allocations.Typical 
negative impacts associated with civil works financed 
by the project include land acquisition and 
resettlement; noise, air, soil and water pollution due 
to dust and exhaust emission and other wastes; 
vegetation clearance; damage to the existing 
infrastructures such as rural road, temporary water 
stoppages for irrigation, community and worker health 
and safety risks, etc. During operation, some potential

Khyber Pakhthunkhwa Irrigated Agriculture Improvement Project (P163474) 

 
 

  
Jul 31, 2017 Page 17 of 21  

     

adverse impacts are forecasted such as water 
pollution and spreading diseases by human and animal 
wastes, pesticides use potentially causing water and 
soil pollution, excessive application of irrigation water 
causing leaching of soil nutrients and changes in soil 
characteristics, etc.  
Since the exact location of subprojects are not known 
at present and will be identified during project 
preparation and implementation, framework 
approach has been adopted.  Environmental and 
Social Management Framework (ESMF) along with 
Environmental and Social Management Plans (ESMPs) 
for the known priority projects will be developed by 
project appraisal. The ESMF will also include 
assessment of regional impacts on water quality, 
analysis of any possible changes in groundwater and 
downstream surface water availability. The ESMF will 
also include Terms of Reference for environmental 
and social impact assessment (ESIA) for the feasibility 
studies of small dams and environmental and social 
screening checklists/procedures for competitive grant 
program (project component C). 

Performance Standards for Private Sector 
Activities OP/BP 4.03 

No  

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 No 

Most of physical infrastructure investments financed 
by the project are rehabilitation and improvement of 
the existing infrastructures. Some new construction 
activities such as construction of watercourses in new 
command areas and small-water storage tanks will 
take place on the existing agricultural lands. These 
activities are not expected to convert or degrade 
natural habitat. Therefore, the policy is not triggered.   
It is important to mention here that the project is 
supporting preparation of feasibility studies for 5 small 
dams or irrigation schemes. The studies will include 
EIAs. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No 
The project is not expected to impact forests and 
associated ecosystems as envisaged in the policy. 
Therefore, the policy is not triggered. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

The project will not support purchase of pesticides. 
However, the policy is triggered because the project 
interventions may lead to substantially increased use 
of pesticides and subsequent environmental 
problems. Thus, to mitigate this impact the project will 
apply an IPM approach with an IPMP prepared.

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 TBD 

At this stage, it is not possible to identify potential 
impacts on physical cultural resources (PCRs). 
However, final determination would be made by QER.  
Chance find procedures will be included in ESMF. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 Yes 

The project area extends across KP, including Chitral 
district which is home to the Kalash who are 
recognized as Indigenous People (IP); hence, OP 4.10 is 
triggered. An Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework 
(IPPF) for interventions in Chitral district will be 
prepared, consulted upon, and disclosed publicly on 
the client’s website (in-country) and by the Bank prior 
to appraisal. Indigenous Peoples Plans (IPPs), if 
required, will be prepared for specific project 
locations. 
Given the cultural sensitivity and tribal nature of the 
area, the social assessment will carefully assess 
potential project impacts on IPs and mitigation 
measures including grievance redress mechanism will 
be developed through free prior and informed 
consultation as required under OP4.10. 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

Small parcels of land will be required for project 
interventions. In most cases land needs will be met 
through Community or Voluntary Land Donations 
(VLD), the procedures for which will be laid out in the 
ESMF. In few cases small parcels may need to be 
acquired e.g. watercourses construction in new 
command areas (e.g. Bazai etc.). Certain interventions 
e.g. rehabilitation of existing water courses, may 
involve minor temporary impacts on livelihoods (due 
to restricted access; temporary dislocation) which 
could require small scale compensation. However, the 
impacts are not expected to be large scale. Hence OP 
4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement has been triggered. 
A Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF), and 
Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) for actual sites that 
may have been identified, will be prepared, consulted 
upon, and disclosed publicly on the client’s website 
(in-country) and by the Bank prior to appraisal. 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 Yes 

The project will not directly finance rehabilitation of 
existing dams or construction of new dams. The 
project activities especially investments for 
improvements in irrigation infrastructure may rely on 
performance of the existing dams such as Warsak Dam 
on Kabul River or Munda dam on Swat River. However, 
the exact location of schemes are not known at 
present. The project will also finance feasibility studies

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 
 
1. India has sustained economic growth during last decade: India’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for 2016-17 is 
estimated at 7.6 percent, higher than the 7.2 percent for the preceding year, but lower than the projected 8.1-8.5 
percent for this year

1
. Sustained economic growth during the last decade, however, has contributed to annual decline in 

poverty by 1.5 percent, but income inequality has continued to persist. Emerging as one of the fastest growing 
economies, there has been significant upturn in key development indicators. Life expectancy at birth increased to 68

years in 2014 from a low of 54 in 1980. India's per capita gross national income increased by about 338 percent between 
1980 and 2014, from $1,255 in 1980 to $5,497 in 2014. As a result, India has climbed five notches to 130th rank in 
Human Development Index among 188 countries in 2014

2
.  

2. Reducing poverty and creating jobs can fuel economy: Sustained economic growth notwithstanding, India 
remains home to 263 million poor people (80% of whom reside in rural areas) living on less than US$1.90/day. Expansion 
of the economy in recent decades has largely resulted in jobless growth. For addressing these issues, Govt. of A.P has set 
an ambitious goal of achieving an annual growth rate of 8.2 percent, reducing poverty by 10 percent (poverty in the 
State is on a decline and currently stands at 9.2%, as per Socio-Economic Survey 2016-17), and creating 50 million new 
jobs.. It has been argued that adequate attention to agriculture could fuel growth, create  jobs and reduce poverty. In 
the wake of consecutive low monsoon rainfall and consequent decline in farm productivity, agriculture has served a 
wake-up call, demanding attention from policy makers. 

3. Agriculture sector continues to lag behind: The issues of inclusive growth and gainful employment are major 
challenges in rural areas where two-thirds of the workforce resides. About 66 percent of the labor force is employed in 
agriculture sector which accounts for 14 percent of GDP, and is saddled with problems of uncertain growth. Per capita 
land and water availability is decreasing while high intensity rainfall events and dry spells are increasing. Land and labor 
productivity continues to be low. 

4. Agriculture growth is essential in achieving India’s development goals: During the last 25 years, agriculture 
sector has not achieved the envisaged growth targets. In 1990s and 2000s, the annual agriculture growth rate was 
around 3-3.5 percent and declined to less than 1 percent in the last two years (2014-16) due to technology fatigue, 
degradation of land and water resources, growing water scarcity, exacerbated by two consecutive droughts, floods, 
cyclones, heat waves, and declining international commodity prices. The growth in agriculture sector in 2015-16 has 
continued to be lower than the average of the last decade, mainly due to a second successive year of lower-than-normal 
monsoon. Report from the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare for 2015-16 indicates that the 
production of food-grains and oil-seeds is likely to decrease by 0.5 and 4.1 percent respectively, while that of fruits and 
vegetables is likely to witness a marginal increase. 

5. To fuel the agrarian economy, strategic shifts in agriculture would  be aimed  (based on the Socio-economic 
Survey 2016-17 projections) at: (i) towards high value vegetables, fruits, livestock and fish products; (ii) towards value 
addition in post-harvest segments; (iii) towards diversification and resilience of farming systems to address climate 
change effects; (iv) towards nutrition sensitive agriculture; and (v) finally a shift towards improved water use efficiency. 

6. Many new schemes have been launched to effect the proposed shifts in agriculture: Pradhan Mantri Krishi 
Sinchai Yojana will fast track irrigation coverage and improve water use efficiency in rural areas; Parmparagat Krishi 
Vikas Yojana aims to reduce input costs by promoting organic farming; Pashudhan Sanjivani, Nakul Swasthya Patra, and 
E-Pashudhan Haat have been proposed to improve livestock productivity. There is an enormous potential for harvesting 
gains from transformation of irrigated agriculture as production, consumption and agribusiness shift from traditional 
cereal crops to horticulture, livestock and fish production. India has a comparative advantage in having a very large and 
largely untapped domestic market, which reduces reliance on exports as the principal driver and consumer of agriculture 
growth.

Sectoral and Institutional Context 
 
7. Andhra Pradesh is a leading reforming economy: Bifurcated on June 2, 2014, the present state of Andhra 
Pradesh (AP) is a middle income state with an average per capita annual income of INR 107,532 which is 15 percent 
higher than the national average. The state accounts for 4.95 percent of India’s land mass, 4.09 percent of its population 
and 4.44 percent of its GDP. AP is predominantly a rural state with 70.4 percent population living in villages and 
dependent on agriculture as the main source of livelihood. Despite severe challenges following the division of AP into 
two states in 2014 (AP and Telangana), the state has recorded appreciable progress in terms of the objective of 
achieving inclusive growth with noteworthy performance in both development and welfare sectors. In 2015-16, the 
Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) grew at the rate of 10.99 percent, compared to corresponding growth rate of 7.2 
percent for the country. 

8. The sector-wise growth rate is equally impressive. At 2011-12 constant prices, agriculture grew by 8.4 percent, 
compared to industry by 11.13 percent and services sector by 11.39 percent. The per capita income of AP at current 
prices registered a growth of 12.38 percent over 2014-15. This has led to decline in the incidence of poverty from 45 
percent in 1993-94 to 9.2 percent in 2015-16

3
. AP is recognized as one of India’s leading reforming states and in the last 

two decades has achieved significant development outcomes through sustained policy and institutional reform 
programs in which the World Bank has been an important development partner. Rich in natural and human resources, 
the state is keen to leverage its strengths through specific growth strategies tailored to achieve double digit growth. 

9. Agriculture sector has performed below capacity: The performance of the state agriculture sector, which 
accounts for 27.6 percent of the state GDP and employs 62 percent of the work force, has been a cause of concern. 
Between 1999-00 and 2013-14 agriculture grew at around 2.1 percent per annum with most of this growth coming from 
livestock, horticulture and fisheries sub-sectors. In 2015-16 these sub-sectors respectively contributed 26, 25 and 15 
percent to the Agriculture State Domestic Product (AgSDP). Land use pattern is critical for agriculture growth, only 38.31 
percent of the state’s geographical area is net sown (6.23 million hectares). Majority of the farmers are small and 
marginal with average landholdings of 1.06 hectare (ha). The main crops are rice, groundnut, sugarcane, cotton, maize 
and Bengal gram. Due to seasonality and scarcity of water supply, cultivation is mostly limited to only one crop per plot 
per year, with a cropping intensity of 126 percent.  

10. The productivity of major crops has remained largely stagnant: The reason for low productivity is because AP is 
one of the severely water stressed states of India with an average annual rainfall of 966 millimeters, and a coastline of 
974 kilometers that is vulnerable to cyclones. Agriculture in AP is highly exposed to extreme weather events like 
droughts, untimely and high intensity rains, floods, cyclones and hailstorms. Increasing erratic weather aberrations and 
climate change are likely to exacerbate vulnerability of agricultural sector. Of the net sown area of 6.23 million ha in the 
state, 3.15 million ha is presently irrigated through a combination of canals, wells, tanks, ponds and other sources. 
Although 40,817 tanks cover a command area of 2.56 million ha, the actual area irrigated by tanks has declined 
significantly from about 1 million ha in 1990 (24% of irrigated area at that time) to 0.26 million ha in 2015 (8.4% of 
irrigated area).  

11. Irrigation is the key to revival of the agriculture sector: Due to deficient maintenance and management of the 
tank systems, as a result of which most tanks are performing well below the capacity, the actual area irrigated to 
potential created varies between 35-55 percent depending on rainfall. Some 35,376 tanks having a command area of 
0.32 million ha have been transferred from Panchayat Raj Department to Minor Irrigation Department. The rapid spread 
of groundwater irrigation has been an additional contributing factor to the decline in tank irrigation, and has also led to 
a serious depletion of groundwater resources across large parts of the state. Since most of the tanks are in rainfed areas

with limited possibilities of providing other systems of surface irrigation, their decline poses a serious threat to the 
fragile agricultural economy of these areas.  

12. Poorer farmers, often found at the tail-end of dilapidated tank/pond systems (Small Scale Community Based 
Irrigation Systems- SSCBI Systems) and lacking resources to access groundwater irrigation amidst low and falling water 
tables, are particularly affected. In response to the difficulties being faced by the agriculture sector, the State 
Government has substantially expanded capital investments for modernizing irrigation infrastructure since 2006-07.  The 
Government has also taken steps to strengthen participatory irrigation management and AP was the first state in the 
country to adopt participatory irrigation management (PIM) following enactment of the Andhra Pradesh Farmers 
Management of Irrigation Systems (APFMIS) Act in 1997.  About 6,400 Water User Associations (WUAs) were formed 
which collect water taxes for meeting operation and maintenance (O&M) costs of tanks.  

13. Institutional development through capacity building has contributed to the success of PIM, a process that has 
been significantly supported by externally funded projects. The Bank-supported AP Community Based Tank 
Management Project (APCBTMP), which concluded in July 2016, has made significant development impacts in the state 
by rehabilitating 2,157 tanks, which resulted in 32 percent increase in tank command area and contributed to increase in 
paddy, maize and groundnut productivity by 36, 72 and 97 percent, respectively. In addition, tank rehabilitation resulted 
in 388 percent increase in fish productivity. 

14. Agriculture sector is in need of a paradigm shift: The negative consequences of low agriculture yields extend 
from precarious incomes of farmers to large tracts of land locked in low value agriculture, despite growing demands for 
high value products such as fruits, vegetables, and livestock products. According to NSS data4, the average annual 
income of the median farmer net of production costs (of 1 hectare) from cultivation is less than INR 20,000 in 17 states, 
including Andhra Pradesh. Add high cost of cultivation, growing indebtedness, climate uncertainty, ineffective 
procurement, insufficient storage space and market linkages, and it makes agriculture an increasingly uneconomical 
activity.5 The crisis in agriculture sector is evidenced by the ‘Crop holiday’ (farmers abstained from farming) observed by 
farmers of East Godavari district in an area of 85,050 acres in Kharif 2011, which is further reflected in continuing 
suicides by farmers in the state. During 2015, 516 suicides by farmers were recorded in AP

6
. 

15. Primary Sector Mission seeks institutional convergence for maximizing profitability: To pull agriculture from its 
current abysmal condition, AP requires a new paradigm with the following components: increasing productivity by 
getting “more from less” especially in relation to water; prioritizing the cultivation of less water-intensive crops, 
especially pulses and oil-seeds, supported by a favorable price regime that incorporates the full social benefits of 
producing such crops, and backed by a market-linked value chain. To effect a paradigm shift, GoAP has proposed the 
Primary Sector Mission to converge independently operating sub-sectors viz., agriculture, horticulture, fishery, and 
agribusiness into an integrated farming system for maximizing profitability of small and marginal farmers from a unit of 
arable land. The proposed project will showcase an alternate approach for leveraging capacities of relevant departments 
to improve farm incomes, and make agriculture resilient to climate change.  For a clear understanding at the highest 
level of authority in the state to prevent further deterioration of the socio-economic fabric in rural areas (exodus, farmer 
suicides), a more comprehensive, longer term approach based around adaptive management in agriculture is required – 
particularly given the climate projections and their impact on the agriculture and water sectors in AP. The GoAP has 
evaluated the results of different initiatives taken during the previous years to develop a comprehensive long term 
strategy aimed at making agriculture in the state productive, profitable, sustainable and climate resilient. The state has

also realized that a mono-cropping production system based on capital intensive irrigation infrastructure and 
technologies has its limitations under the present circumstances with climate variables.    

16. To unlock the full potential of agriculture sector growth, AP has stressed a strong need for policies and programs 
to focus on: (i) improvement of water use efficiency; (ii) intensification of cropping systems and diversification to high 
value crops and commodities; (iii) enhancement of post-harvest management and value addition; and (iv) improvement 
of the resilience of agriculture system in order to deal with increasing threats of climate change. By reorganizing PIM 
with regular administrative systems, AP envisions realizing the full potential of its water sector reforms by achieving a 20 
percent increase in water use efficiency over the next five years. 

Relationship to CPF 
 
17. The proposed project is fully consistent with the India Country Partnership Strategy (CPS): The proposed 
project is fully consistent with the India Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY 2013–17 to support poverty reduction 
and shared prosperity in India. The proposed project is aligned with two key pillars of CPS – ‘transformation’ and 
‘inclusion’. In line with ‘transformation’, the project aims to promote inclusive rural growth, development and 
dissemination of new agricultural and water management technologies, climate-resilient agriculture, enhanced market 
linkages for small and marginal farmers, and improved water and natural resource management (CPS Outcome 2.4). The 
proposed project will have positive impact in terms of environmental protection, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions 
by disseminating high efficiency irrigation systems, and promoting diversification to pulses and high value crops, which 
significantly reduce water and carbon footprint of agriculture (CPS Outcomes 2.5/2.6). 

18. The project is aligned with the Bank’s transformative and inclusive criteria:  With respect to ‘inclusion’, the 
project aims to enhance the livelihoods of small and marginal farmers through crop diversification, enhanced market 
access (CPS Outcome 3.6), and also by improving disaster management abilities of GoAP and local communities through 
enhanced design and restoration of smallholder irrigation infrastructure with better drought proofing and flood 
protection features (CPS Outcome 3.8).  

19. The proposed project will directly contribute to the achievement of 5 out of 17 United Nations’ Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDG), namely:  

Goal 2 – End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and ote sustainable agriculture, by enhancing 
income, food security, and nutrition of large number of rural population, where majority of AP’s poor reside. 

Goal 6 – Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all by investing in irrigation 
infrastructure, promoting a whole range of water saving technologies for irrigated agriculture, which uses 
about 75 percent of all water in the state. 

Goal 8 – Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent 
work for all by promoting a broad-based agriculture growth and employment in rural areas, where more than 
two-third of country’s population are employed. 

Goal 9 – Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation by 
rehabilitating and modernizing irrigation infrastructure (supply canals, water tanks) with enhanced resilience 
features of flood protection in about 1,211 tanks. 

Goal 13 – Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts and reduce GHG effects of agriculture production 
by promoting a wide range of water saving technologies and agricultural practices (SRI, micro-irrigation), 
expanding areas under pulses and high value crops, which consume less water, and also by enhancing 
awareness-raising, human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, and impact 
reduction.

Key Results (From PCN) 
 

22.  The following 5 Key Performance Indicators (KPI) are proposed to measure key outcomes of the project: 

(i) KP#1: Number of Farmers / farmer groups adopting resilient technologies and practices –(such as  Agriculture Technology,  

water  productivity/efficiency)  (Corporate Result Indicator) 

(ii) KP#2: Percentage increase in irrigation supply in the project area / selected tank command area  

(iii) KP#3: Percentage increase in productivity (for selected crops, vegetables and fisheries), and  percentage increase in 

returns from two selected agriculture commodities over the baseline value through development of supply chain 

(iv) KP#4: Number of farmers benefitted through increased access to agricultural assets and services – disaggregated by 

gender   

(v) KP#5: GHG: Change in incremental value to various Carbon stock assessments in selected plots (Corporate Result 

Indicator) 

D. Concept Description 
 

. Description 
 
23. Project Rationale: The proposed project is seized of GoAP initiatives in ameliorating the current distress in the 
state farm sector. The biggest challenge for the state is to pull farmers out of the current crises. To achieve food and 
nutritional security, the issues related to growing water scarcity, degrading land resources, high cost of cultivation, 
stagnant farm productivity, and the impacts of climate change need to be systematically addressed. AP with 13 districts 
and 6 agro-climate zones has great potential for growth and profitability in agriculture and allied sectors (fisheries & 
horticulture). This is what the project seeks to realize by providing transformative direction to the agriculture sector by 
packaging and up-scaling relevant technologies and appropriate practices, and by supporting reforms (Primary Sector 
Mission) that could support more effective policies and management practices to improve the productivity of 
agriculture, animal husbandry, and fisheries to increase net benefits, and improve equity and livelihoods 

24. Alternative considered:  

25. In line with the Government of India’s policy imperative on getting ‘more from less’, especially in relation to 
water, the project proposes to improve SSCBI for realizing underutilized potential of decentralised irrigation system for 
benefitting small and marginal farmers for producing less water-intensive crops, especially pulses and oil-seeds, and 
creating a favorable procurement ecosystem towards improved profitability under emerging specter of climate change.

26. Innovative design: The project design is consequently built on the key lessons learnt from the APCBTMP 
and from similar projects in other States (Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra), clubbed with the emerging need of 
integrating with climate variables, and value addition to the SSCBI Systems for reducing farm-level water footprints, 
and for enhancing carbon stock in farmers’ fields in providing a strategic direction to develop climate-resilient 
sustainable production systems. The innovative aspects will include improved designs of smallholder irrigation 
infrastructure for efficient capture, storage and delivery of rain water, strong focus on improving water-use 
efficiency, recent advances in intensification and diversification of agriculture, agri-entrepreneurship, and 
movement toward climate resilient agriculture with relevant agriculture-water related investments and substantial 
improvements of participatory irrigation management practices.  
 
27. Improved resilience of agriculture production systems is expected to be achieved under the project 
through improving soil organic carbon, higher water use efficiency, reducing crop water footprints through 
diversification, and increased adoption of technologies and practices for optimizing and sustaining productivity. 
Project activities will be complimented by the use of innovative information and communication technology (ICT) for 
enhanced efficiencies and faster turnaround time for delivering services to project beneficiaries, and new media 
technologies for real time reporting and data sharing among project teams working at different levels. 
 
28. The total project cost is expected to be around US$ 238 million, of which the World Bank will finance US$ 
170 million (70 percent of total project cost) and the GoAP will finance US$ 68 million (30 percent of total project 
cost). The project activities will cover the entire state of Andhra Pradesh (its individual components will cover 
different geographic areas) and will be implemented over a six-year period. The project activities would be grouped 
into four main components: (i) Improving Irrigated Agriculture Efficiency at Farm Level; (ii) Promoting Adaptive 
Sustainable Agriculture Practices; (iii) Post-harvest Management, Market and Agribusiness Promotion; and (iv) 
Project Management and Capacity Building. The individual components have been detailed below.  

 
Component A: Improving Irrigated Agriculture Efficiency at Farm level  (approx. US$ 110 million) 

 
29. This component would improve SSCBI systems to strengthen the integrated farming system (in which 
growing crops, agro-forestry and rearing of livestock co-exist) with reduced water footprints. It will consist of four 
inter-related sub-components: (i) institutional strengthening and capacity building (ii) improving Small Scale 
Community Based Irrigation System (SSCBI System) performance and resilience; (iii) improving water productivity 
and efficiency; and (iv) building synergy with the Primary Sector Mission (on agriculture, fishery, horticulture, 
livestock and irrigation). 

 
Sub-component A.1: Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building 

 
30. The sub-component would focus on engaging communities through water users’ associations (WUAs) in 
social engineering of project interventions. The Participatory Irrigation Management (PIM) will follow a distinct 
approach where better operation and maintenance (O&M) of rehabilitated smallholder tank systems will be 
dovetailed with irrigation outreach based on reduced water footprints through adaptive agriculture practices 
(Component B) at the farm level.This sub-component will also sensitize water users and ensure that a desired level 
of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission is managed at the tank level. Water use efficiency will be the leitmotif for 
creating a culture for ‘more crops, per drop’ through community based institutions for assuming greater 
responsibility towards making water-conserving crop choices for water conservation and management. The sub-
component will support in strengthening the existing WUAs and establish new WUAs for effectively developing all 
aspects related to efficient in situ water conservation and management practices. The component would enhance

WUA capacity in grounding the concept at the farm level. 
 
31. In addition, the sub-component would relate to mobilizing water users for collective action through the 
vehicle of WUAs for ensuring local level participation in planning, implementing and managing the SSCBI facilities as 
well as establishing backward and forward farm-linkages with the external government, private sector and non-
government agencies. The proposed project would expand the scope of ‘SSCBI” beyond the ‘crop irrigation’ into 
others - fisheries, animal husbandry and domestic users. The spheres of intervention would include: (i) Policy and 
Governance - educating and enabling enactment of the existing legislative provisions and  exploring new vistas for 
establishing relation between different sets of water users; (ii) Physical and Engineering- creation of assets, 
including capacity building support for designing and implementing construction, as well as managing procurement, 
finance and quality control; (iii) Operation and Maintenance (O&M) involving physical sustainability and improved 
irrigation performance leading to enhanced production/productivity, incomes and food security; (iv) Social 
mobilisation - local level organizational development including leadership building and problem solving approaches, 
empowerment of poor and vulnerable sections such as women, Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes etc., and 
provision of capacity support and capacity building including observation and study tours; and (v) Economic - fixing 
and collection of water tariff and building of a corpus to enable further modernization and diversification, market 
penetration to enable establishing backward and forward linkages; and the related book keeping.  

 
Sub-component A.2: Improving  Small Scale Community Based Irrigation (SSCBI) System Performance and 
Resilience 

 
32. This sub-component will modernize irrigation infrastructure, including SSCBI systems and irrigation canals 
within a defined catchment and also use a cascading management approach. The modernization of irrigation 
infrastructure will focus on improving the bulk water delivery to irrigation systems through rehabilitation and 
modernization of approximately 1,211 smallholder irrigation structures. The expected works will include 
modernization of control structures (diversion weirs), supply channels, cross-masonry structures, de-silting

8
 of 

feeder and supply channels, construction of recharge well structures and strengthening and up-gradation of tank 
bunds, installation of flow measurement devices, up-gradation of distribution systems, improvements of irrigation 
and drainage canals, and introduction of modern quality testing devices to determine soil compaction parameters, 
as well as modern quality testing devices for meticulously maintaining specified cover to reinforcement steel in the 
construction of reinforced concrete structures for long term durability.In addition, relevant catchment treatment 
approaches will be considered for reduced siltation, reliable and dependable flow to cascade SSCBI systems. 

 
Sub-component A.3: Improving Water Productivity and Efficiency 
 
33. The objective of this sub-component will be to promote water saving technologies such as drip and 
sprinkler systems, and for implementing Participatory Groundwater Management (PGM) at assessment unit level. 
The investments will include catchment and command area treatment of SSCBI systems, including construction of 
group based mini-irrigation schemes (dug wells, shallow tube wells, water harvesting and groundwater recharging 
systems).For drought proofing and capturing flood waters, cascades will be linked. Robust automation systems will 
be demonstrated, which will enable spatial homogeneity in water delivery in these systems.  
34. Conjunctive use of surface and groundwater will be coordinated with crop planning and water budgeting. 

                                            
8
Considering economic and environmental perspectives, desilting of the tank will be limited only to remove silt from the tank bed to 

use for raising and strengthening tank bund during the rehabilitation of tank bund in such a way that sufficient area upstream of 

sluices is de-silted on priority to ensure free flow of water towards the sluices.

Water sharing by groundwater users (with surplus water) with those without irrigation source will be promoted; and 
pipelines provided for efficient water distribution (as implemented in APCBTMP). Consolidation and linking of 
groundwater sources piloted in Anantapur district under the World Bank supported AP Drought Adaptation 
Initiative will be encouraged. All development and improvement activities will be included in an Integrated Water 
Resource Conservation and Management Plan (IWRCMP). A basin level ridge to valley treatment for water 
conservation and management in convergence with the activities of all the primary stakeholders and implementing 
departments will be undertaken. 

 
Sub-component A.4: Building Synergy with Primary Sector Mission 

 
35. For effective service delivery to farmers, various departments and entities involved in water, agriculture 
and related sub-sectors need to collaborate. For achieving this GoAP is working towards forming a consortium of 
knowledge stakeholders, including relevant state line departments, knowledge institutions, civil society 
organizations and other relevant national and international organizations to support planning, implementation and 
monitoring the activities of the Primary Sector Mission. The project will provide support to policy and institutional 
reforms for enhancing institutional capacities of relevant departments. The sub-component will provide incentives 
for capital investments, including through unlocking opportunities for crowding-in private sector investments. 
Support will also be provided for guiding, designing and implementing holistic strategy for the Primary Sector 
Mission.  
 

36. As an innovative design feature, the project will use information and communication technology (ICT) 
tools, sensors and remote sensing in two ways – (i) leveraging Internet of Things (IoT) technologies combined with 
sensors to remotely capture data and information on various aspects pertaining to minor irrigation systems such as 
water flows, water quality and (ii) use ICT and remote sensing products for monitoring and evaluation (M&E). 
 
Component B: Promoting Adaptive Sustainable Agriculture Practices (approx. US$ 79 million) 
 
37. This component aims to improve productivity of the tank systems and enhance resilience of agriculture 
production systems for increasing production and managing risks associated with climate variables. This would be 
achieved by diversification of farm production, introduction of climate resilient solutions, improving value 
realization at the farm level through improved post-harvest management, and strengthening farmer-market 
linkages. The component will provide incentives for capital investments by unlocking opportunities for crowding-in 
private sector investments. This component will have three sub-components: (i) Promoting climate smart 
diversified agriculture production systems; (ii) Innovation and technology transfer for fishery production; and (iii) 
Post-harvest management, marketing and agribusiness promotion.  
 
Subcomponent B.1: Climate Smart Diversified Agriculture Production Systems  
 
38. Sustainable intensification and diversification of crop and horticulture production systems will be achieved 
by awareness creation, on-farm demonstrations on new seeds and promising technologies, capacity building and 
training activities; and by leveraging private sector investments in water management and farm mechanization. 
Climate risk resilience will be built in agriculture production systems by promoting crop diversification from rice to 
low water requiring pulses, maize, oilseeds, millets, vegetables and fruits; cultivation of high yielding, short 
duration, drought-, pest- and disease-tolerant crop varieties/hybrids; complementary agronomic practices; and 
building ability to withstand biotic and abiotic stress through a large scale program of demonstrations, and training 
activities as well as investments in farm implements and resource saving technologies like micro irrigation systems

to enhance water use efficiency and land productivity.  Component interventions will focus on irrigated command 
areas of the project, and   will also cover the rain fed areas in the project villages and cascades. The project will 
support operationalization of web-based integrated weather forecasting and water management system to 
provide real time crop advisories, including water, pest and disease stress, and implementation of mitigation 
measures and contingency plans. A baseline of Green House Gas (GHG) emissions from agriculture production 
systems will be established and would be regularly monitored for changes during the project period.  
 
39. The project will focus on increasing farm productivity by reducing ‘input’ costs and enhancing ‘output’ 
from farming systems on a sustainable basis. This will be achieved by (a) adopting diversified cropping system on 
‘navdanya’

9
 pattern to buffer weather anomalies; (b) promoting comprehensive, crop specific sustainable 

agricultural package of practices; (c) installation of integrated weather forecasting systems to provide weather-
based crop advisories in selected smallholder irrigation cluster areas; and (d) developing a mechanism to quantify 
crop resilience to climate variability, and creating a baseline for quantifying soil organic carbon and GHG emission 
from crop production systems. 
  
Subcomponent B.2: Innovation and Technology Transfer for Fishery Production 
 
40. Fish production has registered an average annual growth rate of 9.92 per cent in AP. Building on this, the 
component aims at improving fish productivity and profitability in the project tanks and ponds which offer high 
economic opportunities and benefits. The GoAP accords top priority to fisheries development in the state, and has 
released the Fisheries Policy and Plan for 2015-2020. Under this policy, the government has approved the fiscal 
benefits covering several sections of the industry, including production, processing, marketing and disease 
management for stimulating development of the fishery sector. 
 
41. The subcomponent will focus on strengthening research-extension linkages in order to improve farmers’ 
access to technology, and support participation of fish farmers in value chains. Project aims to promote innovative, 
climate resilient, and modern technology packages in production, post-harvest management and marketing. The 
project will (i) support multiplication of improved germplasm for quality seed production, (ii) introduce suitably 
formulated fish feed using locally available ingredients; (iii) demonstrate semi-intensive and intensive production 
models at appropriate locations in ponds; (iv) promote improved fish production techniques in irrigation tanks 
including innovative technologies such as cage culture in an environmentally sustainable manner; and build 
institutional capacity of the fishery sector. The project will facilitate suitable linkages for better access to markets, 
and support measures for maintaining hygienic conditions throughout the fish value chain. 
 
Component C: Post-harvest Management, Market and Agribusiness Promotion (approx. US$ 32 million) 
 
42. This subcomponent will enhance farmers’ linkages to markets by providing alternate marketing channels 
and promoting farm level aggregation, post-harvest management and value addition. The project will support 
organizing producers into farmer producer organizations (FPOs) and companies (FPCs); develop their capacity and 
skills for accessing wider input and output markets; and investment support to the FPOs for establishing common 
service centers for aggregating grains and horticulture produce. The expected benefits to the FPO members are 
higher prices through a combination of larger critical mass of saleable produce, thereby providing economies of 
scale, savings in transaction costs, and strengthened negotiation positions, coupled with the added value achieved

through primary grading and packing. The project will support integration of producer organizations in commercial 
value chains of agricultural commodities, and facilitate public-private partnerships to enable direct buying 
arrangements.  Key strategy will be market oriented agricultural production through collective marketing by 
farmer producer organizations. 
 
43. For mitigating price risks the project will support operationalization of Negotiable Warehouse Receipts in 
AP. For promoting agri-business ecosystem in the state, an Agri-Business Promotion Facility (ABPF) will be 
established. The ABPF activities will include conducting market and value chain studies on the identified 
commodities; establishing and operating mentorship programs; scouting new technologies (including climate 
resilient technologies); assisting small and medium private entrepreneurs to prepare business and financial 
proposals; and providing business planning and incubation services to emerging agri-entrepreneurs.  
 
44. The value chain for selected commodities will help to increase the share of farmers in wholesale and retail 
prices of the commodity. Some of the measures to achieve this include farmers’ participation in commodity 
exchanges, establishing storage infrastructure starting from primary, intermediate and transit warehouses for 
value addition. For high value crops, emphasis would be laid on demand based production, post-harvest 
processing, and creating forward linkages for direct marketing. Such a production and marketing system would be 
aimed at encouraging farmers to diversify into high value crops for additional income. 
 

Component D: Project Management and Capacity Building (approx. US$ 16 million) 
 
45. The objective of this component is to ensure smooth implementation of project activities, as well as 
monitoring of, and learning from project processes and outputs. Activities to be financed include: (i) setting up, 
supporting and capacity building of project management unit (PMU) to align with the project components at the 
state and district level; (ii) project monitoring, evaluation and promotion of learning culture at the PMU level; (iii) 
documentation of project processes and experience on a rolling basis, and its dissemination to the wider 
development community for cross-learning and sharing; (iv) hiring services of an external M&E agency as 
consultants for the duration of the project for creating a feed-back loop for improving project thrust and 
implementation; and (v) providing support for emerging needs and innovations during implementation; and 
networking with partner organizations, external professional agencies and the World Bank. 
 

  SAFEGUARDS 

 
A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)     

 
Andhra Pradesh is located on the east coast in peninsular India facing the Bay of Bengal. The State has three 
physiographic zones, the hilly region (having Nallamalai, Erramalai hills and the Eastern Ghats having an altitude of 500 
to 1400 m); the plateau (having an altitude of 100 m to 1000 m) and the deltas of rivers (between the Eastern Ghats 
and the Sea Coast).  It has a coast line of 974 km and its major rivers are   Krishna, Godavari, Tungabhadra. It has about 
21% of the geographical area under forest cover with 6 National Parks and 21 Wildlife Sanctuaries. It has an ancient 
religious/cultural heritage and Tirupati is one of the most popular temples in the country. 
 
The state is drained by three major perennial rivers viz. Godavari, Krishna and Pennar, several other medium and small 
rivers. In total 40 rivers drain into the sea. Rainfall varies from 560 mm in the Rayalaseema region to about 1200 mm in 
the northeastern coastal part of the state. The State receives about 66% of rainfall from south-west monsoon (June-

September) and about 25% from north-east monsoon (October-December). The stage of ground water development is 
around 70%. Six Agro-Climatic Zones are recognized – Scarce Rainfall Zone, Southern Zone, North Coastal Zone, 
Godavari Zone, Krishna Zone and High Altitude Zone. The state experiences frequent storms, floods particularly in 
coastal areas and drought in the Rayalseema region 
 
The project activities will involve investing on repair and rehabilitation of about   1200 tanks spread across the  state.  
The interventions will include: improving water assets, modernizing irrigation infrastructure, improving water 
productivity, promoting adaptive sustainable agricultural practices, enhancing fisheries production and climate friendly 
agri business promotion.  Andhra Pradesh (erstwhile undivided) is known to be a leading consumer of agrochemicals in 
the country with 24% share and 21% share in pesticides alone. 

 
B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies     

 
Safeguard issues revolve around augmenting and/ or re-engineering the existing minor irrigation tanks along with 
water conveyance system and other associated activities related to enhancing production, productivity and incomes in 
the spheres of agriculture and fisheries.  The key intervention relates ensuring bridging of the gaps between designed 
and actual irrigable area with participation by the local water using communities.  Major challenge thus lies in 
mobilizing the local tank based community towards group action and establishing linkages with other public and 
private sector institutions. This has been addressed successfully under the first project (Andhra Pradesh Community 
Managed Tank Project) with the help of an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF). The proposed 
project would build on the same, but taking into account the latest legislative developments and expanded scope of 
the interventions, into agriculture and fisheries. Environment Management Plans (EMP) will be prepared for tanks that 
are known to be rehabilitated by appraisal. In addition, the project will develop a Pest Management Plan (PMP). All this 
points to adequate capacity for safeguards management with the borrower.  
 
The previous project has put in place a robust systems   in place and capacities are developed for managing the social 
and environmental impacts. Adequate number of experienced professionals too have been deployed for managing the 
ESMF.  However, as the follow on project’s scope is enhanced both in terms of the number of tanks and the 
interventions, GOAP has already initiated efforts towards re-visiting the ESMF. The learnings drawn the 
implementation experiences of the first project will be fed into this revision.

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

The physical investments under the project would be 
largely on rehabilitation of existing water assets 
where improper construction could result in adverse 
impacts. The investments under productivity 
enhancement through sustainable agriculture 
practices could result in positive impacts with 
effective planning an implementation.

An Environmental and Social Assessment will be 
undertaken and a Social and Environmental 
Management Framework will be developed for 
managing risks and maximizing the environmental 
and social opportunities. These will take into account 
experiences and learnings from the previous phase.  
 

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 TBD 
The rehabilitation of tanks may impact natural 
habitats such wetlands, which will be determined 
during EA. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No 
The project interventions are not expected to impact 
the forest areas. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

The project will not directly finance pesticides but the 
improved irrigation and crop diversification may 
result in increased use of pesticides. The project will 
work in synergy with the state primary sector mission 
and focus on climate smart agriculture production 
system which will promote the non-chemical package 
of practices. A Pest Management Plan (PMP) will be 
prepared for the project. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 No 

No significant adverse impacts on cultural property 
expected, but this issue will be examined during the 
ESA and appropriate measures will be put in place to 
deal with any chance findings. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 Yes 

AP state has a tribal population of 2.7 million 
amounting to 5.5% of the total population. A few 
pockets in three districts are predominantly inhabited 
by tribals and are covered under the Fifth Schedule of 
the Indian Constitution. So, project areas is likely to 
have tribal population. However,   investment plans 
are currently not known. Hence, to address such 
situations wherein the project is likely to be taken up 
in tribal areas, a Tribal Peoples Planning Framework 
(TPPF) will be prepared. 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

The project will not and need not resort to 
involuntary acquisition of lands as the existing 
irrigation tanks will focus of repair and rehabilitation. 
However, cases of encroachers on /within the Tanks 
cannot be ruled out. To address this, a Resettlement 
Policy Framework will be prepared. 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 Yes 

Some of the tanks could be large with high 
embankments above 10 m. The heights of the 
embankments will be known by appraisal for 
ensuring that appropriate mitigation measures are 
put in place for addressing any potential adverse 
environmental impact. This policy was also triggered

during the previous phase and arrangements were 
put in place.  Already, a robust mechanism exist in 
the state, which will be further strengthened. Three 
region-wise Dam Safety Panels (DSPs) were 
constituted by the Government to function with 
technical guidance from the Chief Engineer, Central 
Designs Organization. 
The project will seek better coordination with the 
Dam Safety Panel and processes. The project will also 
support safety enhancement of tank systems as part 
of tank rehabilitation.

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 
 

1. The political reforms of 2011-2015 in Myanmar and economic liberalization coincided with strong economic 
growth and macroeconomic stability, followed by a slowing of economic activity since 2015.  After reaching 8.5% annual 
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth in 2014/2015, economic activity began to slow down with growth reaching 7% and 
5.9% in 2015/2016 and 2016/2017, respectively, due to (i) a challenging macroeconomic environment characterized by 
high inflation, and a reduction in government spending; (ii) a decline in commodity exports (gas and agriculture); (iii) 
constrained private and public investments; (iv) contraction of the agriculture sector due to the extreme weather shocks 
of the 2015/2016 El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event; and (v) a decline in industrial output.  Expectations of strong 
exports, industry and services activities contributed to a positive growth forecast for 2017/2018 at 6.4%, counterweighing 
a slow agricultural recovery1. The agriculture sector continues to be vulnerable to supply shocks and demand fluctuations 
from major trading partners (e.g., China and India) affecting the sector’s potential to significantly and sustainably 
contribute to growth and poverty reduction of Myanmar. 
 
2. Despite a decline in poverty in Myanmar over the last decade, poverty remains high and inequality is increasing.  
Nearly 70% of Myanmar’s population lives in rural areas where poverty is prevalent.  The poverty incidence fell from 48.2% 
in 2004/2005 to 42.4% in 2009/2010 to 32% in 2015, making it today one of the poorest countries in Southeast Asia 2.  The 
decline in poverty was rapid in urban than rural areas with the urban-rural gap being substantial in 2015, i.e., 38.8% of the 
rural population are found to be poor relative to 14.5% of the urban population.  In addition, one in ten households fail to 
meet their basic food needs.  In addition to the 32% of the population identified as poor, 14% are categorized as near-
poor making them vulnerable to shocks from crop failures, natural disasters, and health setbacks.  A sizable proportion of 
Myanmar’s poor rely on agricultural activities as smallholder farmers or casual employment with low income 
diversification and high reliance on paddy production.  Female headed households are not identified as being poorer than 
male headed households irrespective of level of profit making, the poor have limited dietary diversity, and have weaker 
productive and financial asset base.  Although living standards of the poorest in Myanmar improved, greater 
improvements were noted among richer households contributing to inequality increase.  There were no significant 
changes in the welfare of the poorest 10% of the population relative to the obvious welfare changes of the average 
household.

3. There are variations in poverty incidence across the agro-ecological zones (AEZ)3 of Myanmar.  The poverty 
headcount rate in the Hills & Mountains AEZ is 40%, in the Dry AEZ the rate is 32.1%, in the Delta AEZ, the rate is 26.2%, 
and in the Coastal AEZ, the poverty headcount rate is 43.9%.  The Hills and Mountains and the Coastal AEZs have a lower 
share of the population living in them, yet they comprise 47% of the food poor, and 38% are in the bottom quintile of the 
expenditure distribution.  These two AEZs combined have 40% poverty rate and one in six will struggle to meet their basic 
food needs.  Nearly 65% of the poor reside in the densely populated Dry AEZ and Delta AEZ.  Even though the Delta AEZ 
has the lowest poverty head count rate, the number of poor in this area is significant due to its high population density 
(5.5 million poor which also includes Yangon) relative to the 2 million poor in the Coastal AEZ4. 

 
4. Myanmar’s human development faces numerous challenges.  While net primary education enrollment is high 
(93%), there is substantial student drop-out in enrollment at the secondary level resulting in net total enrollment of 55% 
in 2015.  Gender enrollment gaps have been narrowing over time.  On health outcomes, 41% of children under the age of 
five are stunted, 30% are underweight, and 11% are wasted.  In addition, 40% of the population between ages 5 and above 
are overweight or obese, and close to 1 in 7 infants are born with a low birth weight.  It was estimated that on an annual 
basis, Myanmar loses nearly US$400 million in GDP to Vitamin and mineral deficiencies.5  Overall, Myanmar’s Human 
Development Index (HDI) is 0.556, well below the average for East Asia and Pacific (0.720), ranking it 145 out of 188 
countries.  As a result, Myanmar is on a slow path towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) health 
outcomes. 
 

Sectoral and Institutional Context 
 
5. Despite Myanmar experiencing rapid structural change over the last decade, it is still an “agri-based” economy.  
Agriculture’s share of GDP declined from 52% to 32% during 2000-2015, while manufacturing share increased from 11% 
to 28%.  Nevertheless, the sector shares of employment remained constant over the last decade.  Agriculture continues 
to be the largest employer with agriculture’s share of jobs registering nearly 52%.  More than one-third of workers (nearly 
8.5 million jobs) identified farming as their primary source of employment through work in own family farms, and 16% 
(equivalent to 2.6 million people) are agricultural laborers.  The employment share in services and industry were 36% and 
12%, respectively.  The formal modern sector in Myanmar contributes to only 11% of the jobs.  
 
6. Agricultural growth relative to other sectors is low and volatile in Myanmar.  In 2011/12, agriculture growth was 
-0.7%, 1.7% in 2012/13, 3.6% in 2013/14, 2.8% in 2014/15, 3.4% in 2015/2016, and 4.3% in 2016/17 respectively.  The 
average sector growth during the period 2011/2012-2016/2017 was 15%, which is substantially lower than the 55% and 
59% growth seen in the industry and services sectors, respectively6.  Hence, contribution of the agriculture sector to the 
growth of Myanmar’s economy over time has been small.   

 
7. Low agricultural growth in Myanmar is attributed to low productivity7 with varying degrees across the agro-
ecological zones.  Paddy land and labor productivities in Myanmar are among the lowest in Asia.  In 2013/2014, the 
average land productivity for paddy was 2.7 tons/ha in Myanmar, 3.9 tons/ha in the Philippines, 2.8 tons/ha in Thailand, 
6.7 tons/ha in China, and 5.8 tons/ha in Vietnam.  Within Myanmar, paddy productivity and profitability are the lowest in 
Ayeyarwady and Sagaing States, and highest in Shan State.  Average paddy yield was 2.7 tons/ha (dry paddy equivalent) 

                                            
3 There are four agro-ecological AEZs in Myanmar: (i) Hills and Mountainous AEZ (covers Chin, Kachin, Kayah, Kayin, and Shan States); (ii) Coastal AEZ 
(covering Rakhine and Taninthayi); (iii) Delta AEZ (covering Ayeyarwady, Bago, Mon, and Yangon); and (iv) Dry AEZ (covering Mandalay, Magwe, Nay 
Pyi Taw, and Sagaing).

or 3.5 tons/ha (wet paddy equivalent).  This puts Myanmar on the lower end of rice production relative to rice producing 
Asian countries.  Labor productivity for paddy is also low.  For example, in monsoon season, the labor return from one 
day’s work yields 23Kgs of paddy, relative to 62Kgs in Cambodia, 429Kgs in Vietnam, and 547Kgs in Thailand.  Although 
Myanmar’s labor productivity is higher during the dry season, it is still considered very low in comparison with other 
countries.  Paddy production in Myanmar is still labor intensive (farmers in Ayeyarwady spend more than 100 days/ha of 
monsoon paddy relative to 52 says in Cambodia, 22 days in Vietnam, and 11 days in Vietnam).  
 
8. Productivity of non-paddy crops are also low but generally higher than paddy productivity also with varying 
degrees across the agro-ecological areas.  Myanmar’s farming systems are diversified and produce a range of non-paddy 
crops with higher productivity than paddy.  The labor productivity (value of crop per day of labor) of black gram, green 
gram, chickpeas, groundnuts, sesame, and sunflower seeds ranged from $9.29/day to $15.92/day, while for both monsoon 
and dry season paddy labor productivity was $4.75/day and $9.20/day, respectively.  The productivity of non-rice crops 
also varied across the agro-ecological zones depending on the production potential of each area.  For example, the 
productivity of green gram in Ayeyarwady (Delta AEZ) was $13.39/day while in Sagaing (Dry AEZ) productivity was at 
$17.69/day.  
 
9. Low earnings for both paddy and non-paddy production, although earnings from the latter are higher, reflects 
on the low agricultural competitiveness of Myanmar relative to its regional neighbors.  In 2013/2014, the net margin 
($/ha) from producing monsoon paddy averaged $114/ha (ranging from $88/ha in Ayeyarwady to $337/ha in Shan State 
due to proximity to China, resulting in higher farm-gate prices and lower input prices relative to other areas in Myanmar).  
Although the profitability of the dry season paddy was higher at $246/ha, this is still considered low relative to the earning 
of farmers in neighboring Asian countries.  In addition, male-headed households accrue higher profits than female headed 
households for many crops (for few crops the gender differentials in earning is insignificant).  On the other hand, the 
profitability of non-paddy crops (black gram, green gram, chickpeas, groundnuts, sesame, and sunflower seeds) is higher 
and ranged from $141/ha to $581/ha.  The earning differentials between paddy and non-paddy is due to the higher 
production cost of the former crop.  The low earnings raise alarming concerns about the potential of agriculture at its 
current state and a primary focus on paddy alone to achieve agricultural growth and uplift rural households from poverty.   
 
10. The inferior performance of Myanmar’s agriculture sector is first a legacy of past agricultural policies and 
investments centered on rice to attain primarily food security.  This was conducted through input intensification mainly 
for rice.  Public agricultural investments neglected undertaking “Resilient”, “Inclusive”, Competitive”, and 
“Environmentally” (RICE) sustainable investments that takes advantage of Myanmar’s diverse farming systems.   
 
11. The undersupply of quality agricultural public goods plays a significant role in Myanmar’s low agricultural 
productivity and weak support for diversification.  According to the 2017 World Bank Agricultural Public Expenditure 
Review8, the most underfunded function in the sector is agricultural research while there is compelling evidence of high 
returns to investments in core public goods related to technology generation and diffusion, market linkages and 
infrastructure, especially when augmented by policy and institutional reforms.  Undersupply of public goods: first, 
agricultural extension services are limited in number and have weak capacity to provide outreach to farmers.  The ratio of 
extension staff and farm family is very low (nearly 1 to 585)9.  Given the 3,819,1925 acres covering major crops, this means 
on average 1 extension worker covers 5,081 acres.  In addition, extension outreach was geared mostly towards paddy; 
second, farm management is poor.  Farmers have weak knowledge about the appropriate application of production 
technologies such as fertilizers, seed varieties, and pesticides; and third, agricultural research is underfunded, fragmented, 
and suffers from weak human resource capacity.

12. Private sector engagement in agricultural value chains is low. In addition to the constraints mentioned above, 
several other factors are adversely affecting the private sector’s full participation in agricultural value chain development.  
Infrastructure challenges such as post-harvest storage and cold chain facilities, and testing laboratories restricts them 
from contributing to the downstream side of the value chain.  Poor accreditation of services geared towards the regional 
and global export markets is also a constraint. 
 
13. Climate variability and extreme weather events have also significantly impacted performance of the agricultural 
sector.  In 2012, Myanmar was ranked the country most at-risk to climate shocks within Asia-Pacific, due to the wide range 
of hazards including, floods, cyclones, earthquakes, landslides, and tsunamis.  In addition, it ranks 2 out of 187 countries 
in the Global Climate Risk Index.  However, there are regions and states that are more vulnerable than others.  In 2015-
2016 ENSO event and the accompanying drought in the Central Dry Area decreased production and export of traditional 
crops such as sesame, beans and pulses.  Overall the drought from El Niño affected more than 15 million people in the 
Delta and Dry areas affecting livelihood, food access, decreased productivity and farmer income. 
 
14. Improving nutritional status of Myanmar’s population remains a significant challenge.  Rice continues to be the 
key staple crop consumed in Myanmar.  However, rice lacks nutritional value in terms of the minerals and vitamins typically 
found in a meal with dietary diversity.  A 195-gram serving of long grain cooked brown rice provides 11% of the 
recommended daily calorie value and provides no vitamin A, C or D intake, has only 5% of recommended daily iron value, 
2% of daily calcium and no vitamin B12 value10.  In addition, sufficient knowledge on dietary intake is lacking, especially 
among the rural population.  One way to tackle this challenge is to promote agricultural diversification and increase the 
knowledge of rural households about dietary diversity and importance for improved health outcomes, and productivity. 
 
15. Despite the significant sector challenges, Myanmar’s agriculture has ample potential for growth and rural 
poverty reduction.  Myanmar has abundant natural resources, youthful workforce, and diverse faming systems.  Myanmar 
is the world’s second largest exporter of beans and pulses (after Canada) and the largest exporter in the ASEAN region.  
For example, in 2014, the export earnings from beans and pulses was $835 million (exported to India, Thailand, 
Bangladesh, China, and UAE) which is higher than the export value of rice valued at $630 million during the same year.  In 
addition, urbanization and income growth amongst segments of the population are translating into changing dietary 
preferences and food spending patterns.  All these developments are expected to accelerate and expose enormous 
opportunities for farmers, and private sector across all segments of the value chain, and overall sectoral growth. 
 
16. Leveraging agriculture for sector growth and rural poverty reduction is a top government priority, and this is 
recognized in the 2017 Agriculture Development Strategy (ADS).  The ADS accept limitations of past approaches to ensure 
food security for promoting agricultural transformation and rural poverty reduction.  The strategy identified three priority 
areas requiring support: (i) Governance; (ii) Productivity; and (iii) Market Linkages and Competitiveness.   
 
17. The 2018 Myanmar Sustainable Development Plan (MSDP) recognized the agriculture sector challenges and 
proposed action plans.  The MSDP recognizes the high dependence of Myanmar’s economy on agriculture and its 
significance for poverty reduction, as noted under “Pillar 2: Prosperity & Partnership”. Under this Pillar, “Strategy 3.1: 
Creating a diverse and productive economy with rural development and agriculture as the foundation” stresses on 
addressing Myanmar’s low productivity to support value chain development, increase private sector participation and 
eventually boost agricultural competitiveness.

Relationship to CPF 
 
18. The proposed project is aligned to the 2015-2017 World Bank Country Partnership Framework (CPF) and the 
two years extended partnership framework. Rural poverty reduction is outlined as a focus area with several objectives, 
including increased productivity in farming and agribusiness, and addressing critical infrastructure and service gaps for the 
rural poor.  The extended CPF continues its support for rural poverty reduction through rural growth. 
 
19. Furthermore, the proposed project is aligned with the identified pathways for poverty reduction as outlined in 
the Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD).  The SCD identified improvements in agricultural productivity as necessary for 
poverty reduction and as an opportunity for short term gains.  The SCD recognizes the immense potential for 
improvement in Myanmar by addressing yield gaps, diversification, and value-addition. 

 
20. The proposed project is also aligned with the World Bank’s Twin Goals.  The proposed project activities are 
intended to increase the income of the rural poor and generate shared prosperity by building the capacity and knowledge 
of farmers to undertake enhanced farming practices that increases the resilience of their diversified farming systems as 
well as increase their agricultural competitiveness.   

 
21. This proposed project concept has benefited substantially from ongoing and completed analytical and 
investment activities.  The experience from the ongoing Agriculture Development Support Project (ADSP) in project 
management and implementation (fiduciary aspects), and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) arrangements will be used 
extensively for the proposed NAFSP.  Successful instruments of the ADSP such as Project Working committees (PWCs) 
that meets bi-monthly to improve collaboration and monitoring across participating departments and divisions and 
implementation through existing MOALI decentralized bodies such as Agricultural Consultative Committees (ACCs) at 
district and village track levels will be applied to this project.   

 
22. Insights on the status of Myanmar’s agriculture sector performance were drawn from two recent completely 

analytical activities.  The first study is “Myanmar: Analysis of Farm Production Economics”. This was funded by LIFT 

(Livelihood and Food Security Trust Fund) to address existing agriculture data constraints using a 2013/2014 Myanmar 

Agricultural Survey of 1,728 farm households in four regions/states across three Agro-ecological Zones (AEZs) in 

Myanmar: (i) Ayeyarwady and Bago (Delta AEZ), Sagaing (Dry AEZ), and Shan (Hills and Mountains AEZ).  The study did 

not cover the Coastal AEZ.  The survey covers crops produced during two main seasons i.e., monsoon and dry seasons. A 

follow-up survey is currently ongoing to assess changes in farming practices since the 2013/2014 survey.  The second 

study this concept note benefited from is the “Myanmar Agriculture Public Expenditure Review”.  Several insights on the 

status of Myanmar’s food system were highlighted during the recent “Workshop on Modern Food Systems in Myanmar” 

(February 2018).  The workshop discussions noted the ongoing challenges and opportunities for the development of 

Myanmar’s food systems, and these were captured in this concept note.   

 
C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  

 
 
23. The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to, “increase productivity of select high value commodities, enhance 
agricultural diversification and competitiveness, and diet diversity in selected agro-ecological zones of Myanmar”.  This 
will be achieved through the provision of key public goods and services that will facilitate and further enhance the 
engagement of (and with) the private sector.

vi. Increase in dietary composition of targeted households (percentage, disaggregated by gender) 
 

 
25. The key project beneficiaries are: (i) smallholders in four agro-ecological zones (Dry, Delta, Hills and Mountains, 

and Coastal); (ii) extension workers; (iii) agricultural researchers; (iv) buyers for value chain development; (v) MOALI 

departments and units participating in the project. 

 
 
D. Concept Description 

 
1. Once the priority agro-ecological zones and high value / potential commodities and value chains are determined, 
the proposed project will adopt the “Theory of Change” and “Maximizing Finance for Development (MFD) for Agricultural 
Value-Chains” frameworks for the identification and selection of project activities within each component and 
subcomponents.   
 
2. The proposed project areas and interventions will be made with close consideration provided to the following: (i) 
promotion of improved nutritional outcomes; (ii) inclusiveness of minorities and other marginalized groups; and iii) 
implementation in conflict and non-conflict areas.   

 
3. The proposed project is envisaged to have the following three components (with interventions tailored to the 
specific context of the selected commodities / value chains): 

 
4. Component 1: Development of Value Chains (US$ 20 million) – The objective of this component will be to support 
mechanisms by which public sector services are improved in collaboration with the private sector where opportunities 
exist to promote the development of selected agricultural commodity value chains, innovative modalities to better link 
farmers to markets, and improvements in the enabling environment for agro-enterprise.  This component will explore 
opportunities (including pilots) for private sector engagement on capacity strengthening to add value for key commodities, 
provision of equipment and infrastructure using out-grower schemes, and matching funds for farmer organizations and 
commodity specific associations.  This component will also include improvements in the enabling regulatory / legal 
environment for agro-enterprise (support to farm inputs and products) including food quality and food safety.  The 
infrastructure investment needs based on business plans and cost sharing mechanisms may include, (i) product collection 
centers, (ii) drying facilities, (iii) post-harvest storage structures, (iv) micro irrigation; (v) improved information technology 
service facilities, (vi) cold chain facilities, and (vii) facilitating a conducive policy environment, among others. 

 
5. Component 2: On-farm Agricultural Investment Support (US$74 million) – This component has two sub-
components: (i) On-farm Infrastructure Investments (US$54 million) and (ii) Agricultural Support Services (US$20 million).  



 
The World Bank  
Myanmar National Food and Agriculture Systems Project (P164448)

The objective of the first sub-component is to improve the production volume of selected commodities and crop 
diversification by providing support for infrastructure investments in priority farming systems.  The activities may include 
upgrading/constructing of critical infrastructure for increased productivity, crop diversification and/or competitiveness 
such as in existing and new research/ experimental stations, seed multiplication farms, laboratory buildings and 
equipment, border post quarantine and testing service centers; irrigation systems on-farm/ downstream; and 
decentralized training centers / information centers.  Capacity building related to optimizing infrastructure investments 
and operation and maintenance will also be included.  This sub-component will prioritize infrastructure investments in 
high-value commodities and areas where the level of engagement of the private sector is low or nonexistent.  The 
objective of the second sub-component is to ensure and enhance the provision of key public agricultural services such as 
agricultural research and innovation, extension services, institutional development and farmer training.  This component 
will provide capacity building and policy support to the national agriculture research and extension system with the aim 
to improve service delivery in the agriculture sector.  This component will also focus on services related to on-farm 
management practices which will include the adoption of climate smart production practices, crop diversification, and 
integration of nutritional and gender-sensitive activities. 
 
6. Component 3: Project Management (US$ 6 million) - The objective of this component is to ensure effective 
project management.  This component will support carrying out of the day-to-day project management activities, including 
project administration and implementation, procurement, financial management and audit, social and environmental 
safeguards (including peace and inclusion filters, marginalized/vulnerable population groups, gender etc.), and monitoring 
and evaluation (M&E). 
 
    

  SAFEGUARDS 

 
A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 

 
At concept stage, location for project interventions have not been determined.  
 
Myanmar is characterized by its central lowlands along the Ayeyarwady river, which flows from north to south through 

the Central Burma Basin and ends in a wide delta. These areas are its well-established agricultural production areas, 
which the current Agricultural Development Support Project (ADSP) (P147626) supports. The Central Valley Region is 
bordered by steep, rugged highlands in the north, the Arakan Mountains in the west and the Shan Hills, Karen Hills and 
Tenasserim Hills to the east. As a result, physical characteristics vary significantly across the country, as well as ethnic, 
social and cultural characteristics. 
 
Once project locations are identified, further information will be provided. 

 
B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 

 
Under the current ADSP project, the project management has hired one environmental and one social safeguards 

consultant, who have the skills and experience to manage the environmental and social risks of the project. The project 
management unit overall has been gaining knowledge and experience on World Bank safeguards policies and their 
implementation. However, without the consultants, the project management unit does not have dedicated staff who has 
backgrounds and experience in environmental and social risk management. As a part of the project’s environmental and 
social management framework (ESMF) preparation, a capacity need assessment will be conducted to identify areas for 
improvement and measures to increased capacities.

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

The proposed project will focus on activities that (i) 
improve farm management and value chain 
development which include upgrading testing 
laboratories and upgrading/building post-harvest 
storage and cold chain facilities; (ii) strengthening 
capacities of agricultural extension officers and 
researchers; (iii) improve farm management which 
includes support of seed multiplication and 
procurement and distribution of seeds and seedlings 
as well as supply of biological control; and (iv) ensure 
effective project management. 
 
Under Component 1, the proposed project will fund 
specific investments on infrastructure for improved 
farm management such as (i) research, ((ii) seed farms, 
(iii) national service laboratories, (iv) off-site and on-
site service and testing laboratories and centers, (v) 
border post quarantine and testing centers, and (vi) 
training centers and other high priority infrastructure 
to support improved farm management in selected 
agro-ecological zones.  
 
The project will also fund infrastructure for value chain 
development such as (i) product collection centers, (ii) 
drying facilities, (iii) post-harvest storage structures, 
(iv) improved information technology service facilities 
and (v) cold chain facilities intended to support 
downstream agricultural value chain development. 
 
Main potential environmental impacts are related to 
construction activities, maintenance and operation of 
the post-harvest storage and cold chain facilities (e.g. 
hygiene, reliable and adequate water and power 
supply). In regards to seed farms, waste management 
on the use of polythene plant bags for 
seedlings/nursery will be the main issue.

Main potential social risks are related to land 
acquisition, contested land ownership and land 
conflict, and potential exclusion of ethnic minorities, 
landless farmers, women-headed households or other 
vulnerable groups. Any social assessment conducted 
during preparation or implementation will cover these 
social risks.  
 
Project target provinces and states are yet to be 
determined; therefore an Environmental and Social 
Management Framework (ESMF) will be prepared. The 
Framework will include the following: 
 
1. Guidance for screening of subprojects, 
ensuring that relevant safeguard policies (natural 
habitats, forests, and projects in disputed areas) are 
adequately addressed.  
 
2. Assessment of environmental and social 
impacts of various activities related to Component 1 
and Component 3. Component 2 of the proposed

supply of biological control as part of the integrated 
pest and disease management (Component 3). 
 
Overall, the proposed project is expected to deliver a 
number of environmental benefits, such as improved 
soil and water management practices considering the 
agro-ecological context of the project intervention 
area. The project will also contribute to an integrated 
pest and disease management through the adoption 
of sustainable practices by supplying biological 
controls; the use of natural enemies to manage 
population of pest organisms.  
 
Considering the type of investments and activities, 
scale of the proposed project, as well as the nature 
and magnitude of its potential impacts, an 
environmental Category B operation is proposed. 
 

Performance Standards for Private Sector 
Activities OP/BP 4.03 

No  

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 Yes 

The policy is triggered to ensure that any affected 
natural habitats are adequately protected, because 
some of the project sites may take place near parks or 
protected areas. The proposed project’s ESMF will 
screen out and exclude any subprojects that would 
involve clearing of new land for agriculture. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No 
The proposed project’s ESMF will screen out and 
exclude any clearing or effects on forest lands. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

The policy is triggered as a precaution, because 
pesticide use is a necessity in agricultural activities in 
the region. The ESMF will promote Integrated Pest 
Management as standard practice. A screening 
mechanism will be included in the ESMF to determine 
if there are any sub-projects or activities with 
significant pest management issues; if so, then a 
separate Pest Management Plan will be required to 
ensure that these materials are well managed for 
those subprojects and/or activities. 
 
Under Component 3, the proposed project will fund an 
integrated pest and disease management which will 
support the adoption of sustainable pest and disease 
management practices by supplying biological 
controls; the use of natural enemies to manage 
population of pest organisms. The ESMF will provide

more detailed information on the application of this 
method. 
 
 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 Yes 

This policy is triggered to ensure that any “chance 
finds” or other physical cultural resources during 
excavation or other earth-moving activities are 
adequately protected. Project’s ESMF will consist of a 
chance find procedure which requires that should any 
areas of potential cultural importance or artefacts be 
identified, works should stop and the government 
related agencies (to be identified at appraisal stage) 
should be contacted. No work should continue until 
approval has been sought from these agencies. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 Yes 

Myanmar is one of the most ethnically diverse 
countries in Asia, and the project will likely fund sub-
projects where ethnic minorities are present. Both 
under Component 1 (rehabilitation and construction 
of infrastructure) and Component 2 (formation of 
farmer groups), there may be risks that ethnic 
minorities do not have equal and culturally 
appropriate access to benefits, and may not be 
adequately consulted in decision making. 
 
Since project sites are not known at this time, MoA 
will prepare an IPPF as part of the ESMF in order to 
ensure that in sub-projects are screened for ethnic 
minorities, and sub-project areas where ethnic 
minorities are present, MoE will conduct a social 
assessment and ensure that free, prior and informed 
consultations are held to reach broad community 
support. If target project locations are identified 
during preparation, a social assessment will be 
prepared by appraisal, and free, prior and informed 
consultations will be held. If locations and location-
specific activities are not identified during preparation 
and this is left to project implementation, the social 
assessments under the current ADSP project will be 
combined and updated as an assessment of social risks 
in the agriculture sector, specific to the new project 
activities. 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

Rehabilitation and construction of test laboratories, 
post-harvest storage units and cold chain facilities are 
not expected to result in significant land acquisition 
impacts, especially since siting should be flexible for 



 
The World Bank  
Myanmar National Food and Agriculture Systems Project (P164448) 

 
 

  
June 20, 2018 Page 14 of 16  

 

construction of new facilities. The impacts should be 
moderate and manageable. 
 
Since siting of sub-projects is not known at this time, 
MoA will prepare a RPF in order to ensure that sub-
projects are screened for land acquisition, and 
appropriate plans are prepared in cases where land 
acquisition is necessary. The RPF will also include 
protocols for voluntary land donation. 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 TBD 

The project will not finance construction of new dams, 
however, it is yet to be determined during project 
preparation whether it will include repairs / 
maintenance / rehabilitation  of existing dams in which 
case the dam safety measures would be applied. 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

TBD 

Project target provinces and states are yet to be 
determined. ESMF will cover the provision of OP/BP 
7.50 should project preparation discussions determine 
that the locations or activities subject to the policy are 
within the international waterway. 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No 
The proposed project’s ESMF will screen out and 
exclude any projects in disputed areas. 

 
E. Safeguard Preparation Plan  
 
Tentative target date for preparing the Appraisal Stage PID/ISDS 
 
Oct 10, 2018 
 
Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed. The specific studies and 
their timing should be specified in the Appraisal Stage PID/ISDS 
 
MoALI- Department of Agriculture will prepare an ESMF, including a pest management plan, IPPF and RPF, before 

appraisal. If target project locations are identified during preparation, a social assessment will be prepared by appraisal, 
and free, prior and informed consultations will be held. If locations and location-specific activities are not identified 
during preparation and this is left to project implementation, the social assessments under the current ADSP project will 
be combined and updated as an assessment of social risks in the agriculture sector, specific to the new project activities. 
These will be disclosed and consulted on after being cleared by the Bank. These instruments will be informed by the 
documentation and implementation experience of the on-going Agriculture Development Support Project (ADSP).

B. Introduction and Context 

 
Regional Context  

The Niger Basin, located in West and Central Africa, is one of the major transboundary basins in Africa. Its 
1.5 million km2 active hydrographic basin spans over the territory of nine countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, 
Cameroon, Chad, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, and Nigeria. Its population of 130 million inhabitants is 
growing rapidly, expected to reach 180 million people by 2025. Except for Nigeria, most of the population in 
the basin is rural and depends on agriculture, animal husbandry or fishing for its livelihood. 
 
The value of the Niger River System resides in its contribution to water, food, energy, and job security, to 
transport and to biodiversity. For thousands of years, the river, its tributaries and connected lakes and 
wetlands have supported local populations with diverse water-dependent livelihoods such as flood-recession 
agriculture, cattle grazing and drinking, fishing and hunting. In the Niger Basin Countries, agriculture (including 
farming, livestock husbandry and fisheries) contributes 20 to 50 per cent of GDP and roughly two-third of the 
population depends on it for its livelihood. Moreover, those mostly family fishing and agro-pastoral systems 
are labor intensive and generate significant indirect employments (processing, trade and crafts). In a region 
with a structural deficit in food production and increasing temperature and rainfall variability and uncertainty, 
the river, its tributaries and connected groundwater resources are key to increase agricultural productivity and 
resilience to climate change. In addition, the river system is important for the energy security of the region, 
with an installed, partially integrated, hydro-power capacity of 2,000MW1. Finally, the Niger hydro-system 
sustains some of the most significant biodiversity areas in the World, notably the Inner2 and Maritime Deltas 
in Mali and Nigeria respectively, both Ramsar sites. 
 
Yet the Niger hydro-system and the population, economies and biodiversity relying on it are vulnerable to 
several climate and water-related shocks and stresses, many of them transboundary in nature. Managing 
competing water demands, notably between upstream and downstream users and between different sectoral 
will be one of the basin’s main development challenges in the coming decades as intensifying water use, while 
necessary, will not be without impacts. Notably, it will be important to strike a balance between the regulation 
of river flows (i.e. reservoirs) and increased water withdrawals for irrigation, hydropower and navigation, as is 
the case of the Upper Niger, Medium Niger and the Benue (i.e. Chad, Cameroon and Nigeria) and the 
preservation of the Maritime Delta ecosystem (i.e. biodiversity and ecological services: fishing) in Nigeria.

and Sector Work. Washington, DC: World Bank. Nigeria is exporting electricity to Niger and Benin in the Niger Basin. 
2 During the rainy season, the Inner Delta forms a large flood plain of 20,000 to 30,000 km2, facilitating the cultivation of rive, cotton 
and wheat as well as cattle herding and fishing. The size of the flooded area is subject to strong annual variations, depending on the 
discharge in the Upper Basin.

Priority should therefore be given to increasing the performance of existing infrastructure; 
reducing/postponing the need to build new dams; as well as strengthening the Niger Basin authority (NBA)’s 
capacity in its water allocation, planning and coordination of transboundary projects function.  
 
In this context, the Government of Cameroon has made a request to the Niger Basin Authority to incorporate 
the Lagdo dam into the Niger Basin Master Plan. The WB is currently supporting the master plan through a 
Niger Basin regional program using the Series of Project (SOP) instrument. Phase 1 (Building Climate Resilience 
in the Niger Basin, P161262) objective is to strengthen the Niger Basin Authority’s capacity for integrated, 
transboundary water resources management, while subsequent phases/projects, including the proposed 
operation, would be for country-level investments. Within the master plan integration, the development of 
irrigation from the Lagdo dam is indicated for Cameroun.

The proposed project is therefore proposed as the second of a Series of Projects under the Regional 
Program. Through in country investments it will contribute to the implementation of targeted, interventions 
for transboundary, integrated water resource management. 
Country Context 

 

A lower middle income country of about 24 million people, Cameroon is strategically located on the gulf of 
Guinea. It is naturally well placed to play the role of a regional hub. With its 600 kilometer coastline, Cameroon 
borders with six Central Africa countries3 which, with the exception of Nigeria, are members of the Economic 
and Monetary Community of Central Africa (CEMAC by its French acronym). Its regional port of Douala serves 
as an entry point to two strategic road corridors to Bangui and Ndjamena. Cameroon’s Far North region shares 
with Chad, Niger and Nigeria access to Lake Chad, a basin traditionally important for livelihood in the region, 
but also an area of competition for scarce resources including between farmers and pastoralists. Cameroon is 
endowed with ample arable land, water, energy, and oil and mineral resources.  
 
With a per capita Gross Domestic Product of US$1,374 (current prices) in 2017, the economy is largely driven 
by its primary sector, agriculture and mineral resources, and benefits from its location in the Congo Basin, the 
world’s second largest tropical forest zone, which provides an exceptional ecological diversity. The country’s 
mineral wealth includes deposits of oil, natural gas, gold, iron, manganese and uranium. Crude petroleum is an 
important resource accounting for 10 percent of GDP and being the main export product by value. Timber is the 
second largest export product. Imports are dominated by manufactured goods and come mainly from Europe. 
 
Despite having one of the most diversified economies in the CEMAC region, Cameroon’s economic activity 
slowed in 2016. Growth has dipped to 3.7 percent by the end of 2017, compared to 4.4 percent in 2016. This 
outcome is due to slower growth in oil production (+3 percent in 2016 against 37 percent in 2015) resulting from 
the maturity of the main oil fields, and to the avian flu epidemic that has damaged the local poultry industry, 
particularly in the West, which accounts for 80 percent of production. However, continued implementation of 
the Government’s ambitious infrastructure plan and interventions to boost the agriculture and forestry sectors 
have significantly contributed to sustained strong growth in public works and construction and services. Inflation 
rose to 1.6 percent at the end of June 2016, largely based on the increased tax rate on alcohol (7.4 percent) and 
tobacco in the 2015 budget law, and the 4.9 percent increase in prices for services, restaurants, and hotels. 
 
Cameroon’s ruling party, the Cameroon People’s Democratic Movement (CPDM), has long dominated the 
country’s political landscape and currently occupies 148 of the 180 seats in the National Assembly and 81 of 
the 100 seats in the Senate, which was created in 2013.  Presidential elections are scheduled for 2018.  While 
Cameroon has enjoyed peace for many decades in spite of its highly diverse population, it now faces an 
increasingly challenging situation in its northern regions, where Boko Haram is waging a low intensity war.  This 
has resulted in high levels of insecurity and violence, involving 2,276 fatalities in 2014-2015 alone, loss of 
livestock, and risks associated with normal economic activities such as farming. Cameroon’s northern regions 
are facing a humanitarian and economic challenge: The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs 
(OCHA) estimated the number of food insecure people in the northern regions to have increased from one 

                                            
3 Nigeria, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, Republic of Congo, and landlocked Chad and Central African Republic (CAR).

million in 2014 to 2.4 million in August 2016, including 253,000 children suffering from severe or moderate acute 
malnutrition. The year 2017 has also been marked by high tensions in the northwest and southwest Anglophone 
regions, which feel marginalized by the rest of the country. 
 
The Government of Cameroon (GoC) long-term vision, Cameroon Vision 2035, is of an emerging, democratic 
and united country in diversity. To operationalize this Vision, the Government adopted a Growth and 
Employment Strategy (DSCE –Document de Stratégie pour la Croissance et l’Emploi) in 2009 and defined specific 
objectives to be achieved by 2020, like to reduce poverty by less than 29 percent and by 10 percent in 2035. 
The GoC has further adopted the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It also endorsed 
the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and published 
Cameroon’s Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) setting out its contribution to climate change mitigation 
and priorities for adaptation.  
 
The DSCE identifies inadequate infrastructure and an unfavorable business environment as the main factors 
impeding economic growth and employment creation. The agriculture sector, which currently employs about 
70 percent of the active population in Cameroon (primarily in the informal sector), is regarded as the engine for 
economic growth and job creation if it can be transformed from traditional farming to diversified and 
commercially viable farming (see below). The DSCE recognizes the need for agricultural diversification, increased 
productivity, and large-scale public investment projects in the sector. In fact, notwithstanding Cameroon’s 
abundance of natural assets and tremendous climatic and land potential, the primary sector’s contribution to 
growth is very limited, about one percentage point of GDP p.a., and is dominated by food crops grown by 
smallholder farmers.  
 
As population growth outpaces poverty reduction, the number of poor increased between 2007 and 2014 by 
12 percent to 8.1 million people, with important regional disparities. The northern regions exhibit by far the 
highest poverty rates in Cameroon, with an estimated 56 percent of the poor living in the North and Far North 
regions alone. In these two northern regions poverty and inequality levels have steadily increased over time 
relative to the rest of the country where poverty and inequality have declined. They are subject to multiple 
poverty traps, which are documented extensively in the World Bank Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD, Report 
103098-CM)4, including low agriculture productivity, increasing vulnerability to climate change, poor 
infrastructure, and limited access to health and education services.  
 
Poverty incidence is correlated with agro-ecological zones. The northern regions of Cameroon, i.e., the four 
poorest regions (the Far-North, the North, the North-West and the Adamawa), belong to three agro-ecological 
zones – the Sudano-Sahelian, the Western Highlands, and the Guinea Savannah zones which together account 
for 80 percent of all poor (see figure below). In the largely arid Sudano-Sahelian zone, comprising the Far North 
and North regions, agricultural output (millet, maize, peanuts, and cotton) depends heavily on rainfall. Animal 
production is also vulnerable to drought. In this zone 72 percent of the population or 56 percent of all poor live 
below the poverty threshold. In the Western Highlands, comprising the North-West and West regions, there is 
a cattle and coffee based system with corn, (coco) yams, potatoes, and peanuts as the main food crops. Thirty-
nine percent of the population in this agro-ecological zone (but as much as 55 percent in the North-West region)

live below the poverty threshold representing 18 percent of all poor. Twenty percent of the poor live in the 
remaining two agro-ecological zones. 
 
 
Figure 1: Cameroon: incidence of poverty by agro-ecological zone  

Social and economic gaps between 
regions are likely to worsen as a result of 
climate change. The Sudano-Sahelian area 
(North and Extreme North) is the most 
environmentally fragile zone in Cameroon. 
It is particularly exposed to drought and 
increased temperatures with serious 
implications for the majority of inhabitants 
who depend on agriculture and livestock 
for their livelihoods. Regional climate 
change projections suggest that an overall 
decrease in the quantity of the water 
available could exacerbate water 
shortages in many rural areas of northern 
Cameroon. The quality of water will also be 
affected. An increase in temperatures and 
greater dryness are likely to result in net 

capillary movement and the salinization of both water and soils. Rice, one of Cameroon's main food imports, 
grown in the north by both traditional and modern methods, will particularly be affected, but also other food 
crops such as millet, sorghum and maize.  
 
 

Sectoral and Institutional Context 
 

Agriculture remains the backbone of Cameroon's economy, employing 70 percent of its workforce, while 
providing 42 percent of its GDP and 30 percent of its export revenue. Blessed with fertile land and regularly 
abundant rainfall in most regions, Cameroon produces a variety of agricultural commodities both for export and 
for domestic consumption. Coffee and cocoa are grown in central and southern regions, bananas in 
southwestern areas, and cotton in several northern provinces. In addition to export commodities, Cameroonian 
farmers produce numerous subsistence crops for family consumption. Principal food crops include millet, 
sorghum, peanuts, plantains, sweet potatoes, and manioc. Animal husbandry is practiced throughout the 
country and is particularly important in northern provinces. The great majority of Cameroonian farmers are 
small-holders, generally obtaining low yields from small plots of land using traditional methods: handheld hoes 
and animals for draught power. Cash crop production is also done by small holders. Food crops contribute 64 
percent to agricultural GDP, followed by livestock (13 percent), forestry (9 percent), industrial and export crops 
(8 percent), and fisheries (6 percent). About 54 percent of all households have at least one member who owns 
a crop field of about 2.4 hectares (ha) as documented in the DSCE.

Yet, a series of constraints have led Cameroon’s agriculture sector to be characterized by low productivity 
and low-production subsistence farming. Declining soil fertility, limited use of fertilizer, low adoption of high 
yielding varieties and improved farming techniques are among the core reasons for constrained yields. 
Techniques and approaches to address these constraints exist, and Cameroon is blessed with a multitude of 
high quality agricultural research institutions. Nevertheless, the adoption of improved practices remains limited, 
as no functional extension system is in place, as evidenced by the size of the yield gaps. The main constraints 
are: (i) Limited access to inputs (less than 7 kg/ha of fertilizers are used; the use of improved seeds is lower than 
30 percent); (ii) Very limited mechanization: Cameroon has a ratio of 0.1 tractor/1,000 ha and a mechanization 
ratio of only 0.1; (iii) Weak institutional capacity of Producer Organizatons (POs) associated with limited 
storage/processing capacity and marketing infrastructure; (iv) Lack of storage and marketing infrastructure, 
aggravated by the isolation of agricultural production areas because of the poor quality of rural roads, which 
comprise 80 percent of the national network (only 5.2 percent or 4,200 out of 81,000 km are in good condition); 
(vi) Limited access to credit/rural finance: POs and SMAEs have limited access to credit/ rural finance because 
of their inability to present viable projects for financing, the (perceived) high cost of financing, and the absence 
of specific financial services/instruments for their segment; and (vii) The size of traditional family farm 
enterprises, of which 63 percent are too small (less than 2 ha) to profit from non intensive agriculture.  
 
Meanwhile costly and poorly targeted subsidies do not benefit the poorest, distort the market and increase 
food dependency. In an effort to mitigate the negative effects of the 2008 rise in food and fuel prices, the 
Government launched a universal subsidy program (food and fuel), which by 2011 was costing the Government 
around 2.7 percent of GDP. In 2013 more than US$100 million was spent to subsidize fish, wheat and rice alone. 
These subsidies benefit the urban middle and upper class and only very small amounts (between 2 percent and 
27 percent depending on the food item) benefit the poorest 40 percent. These persistent subsidies and the 
attempts to stabilize the market through interventions act as a disincentive for local food production and not 
only aggravate rural poverty, they also sustain the country’s dependency on food imports. In addition, as 
Cameroon is well placed to serve a sub-region that has high purchasing power and is structurally deficient in 
food, distortionary policies impact negatively on trade competitiveness. 
 
Agriculture, livestock management and agro-forestry are not only sectors in which the majority of the poor 
are engaged, they are also sectors of competitive advantage. This is based on three observations. The first is 
that Cameroon has factor endowments rich in unskilled and semi-skilled labor and natural resources. Cameroon 
has a unique bio-diversity and is the custodian of global public goods such as the rainforest in the Congo Basin. 
Only 29 percent of arable land is cultivated, and below 3 percent of irrigable land is irrigated. It thus has a 
comparative advantage in primary products, agriculture, environment and mining. The second is that high 
indirect costs on doing business are less limiting on agriculture, pastoralism and agro-industry than they are on 
more sophisticated manufacturing or high-tech, tradeable services. The third is that Cameroon does not meet 
the internal nor regional demand for cereals, meat and animal products and the agricultural trade balance is 
negative. 
 
Improving the functioning of value chains for staple food crops is particularly important for poverty reduction. 
Poor households spend a larger share of their budget on food than non-poor households do. Moreover 
households in the two poorest wealth quintiles ‘specialize’ in the cultivation of food crops like maize, millet,

sorghum, yams, banana, cassava, and beans. These crops are also the staple foods for the poorest households, 
implying that improvements in production and commercialization for these crops would have the double benefit 
of increasing farm incomes and reducing food prices for the urban poor who rely on food purchases. Many rural 
poor will benefit from lower food prices as many are net food purchasers. Good results are already being 
achieved by linking farmer cooperatives producing millet and sorghum with large industrial enterprises like 
Guiness. The value chain for milk similarly offers great opportunities, as does the value chain for poultry, meat, 
eggs or chickenfeed. 
 
The presence of significant yield gaps for the most popular crops suggests scope for productivity increases. 
Assessing actual crop yields against maximum attainable levels offers important insights into the performance 
of agriculture and the potential for yield growth and expected productivity gains from agricultural investments 
and policies, including land and water resources management. The yield gap for Cameroon is substantial. The 
largest differences are for sweet potato, rice and cassava, with yield gaps of 78, 75 and 73 percent. Sorghum, 
maize and potatoes also have sizeable yield gaps of respectively 63, 67 and 64 percent.5 
 
In a context of improved yields, there is significant potential for the (domestic and regional) markets to absorb 
increased food production. Already the demand for food in Cameroon exceeds supply as evidenced by the large 
amount of food that is imported. Also the high levels of chronic malnutrition –particularly in the north of the 
country, point in the direction of an unmet demand for food. Moreover, there is a large demand for food in the 
region. Nigeria is a huge market and rice, maize and onions already find their way to markets in Nigeria, but also 
in Gabon and the Democratic Republic of Congo. But even domestically the demand for food will rise rapidly 
due to an annual population growth rate of 2.8 percent and increased urbanization. However, the formation of 
a middle class will be accompanied by the demand for food products with a high income elasticity such as rice, 
milk and milk products, eggs and meat. 
 

On land issues, a main principle is lands belong to the State. The Government of Cameroon (GoC) has initiated 
a land reform process over 10 years ago and a draft land law is currently being reviewed at the presidency 
level. While the proposed law is not yet being shared outside the Government, preliminary analyses suggest 
that it does not contain any major innovations likely to address the dysfunctions of the land sector. It does not 
seem to be based on the definition of a fundamental land policy addressing issues across the various sectors 
(agricultural, pastoral, forestry, environmental, industrial, urban). Moreover, the proposed law barely seems to 
address the issue of recognition of customary land rights but rather there seems to be a desire to strengthen 
the role of the State in land ownership and the constitution of public land reserves. It is, however, questionable 
when the new land law would be adopted given the political sensitivity of land issues in a context of upcoming 
presidential elections in 2018 and increasing tensions and fragile situations in several regions of the country. 
 
Despite the many challenges it faces, the GoC is committed to increase investment in the agriculture sector 
for poverty reduction and economic growth. A growth strategy that focuses on products cultivated by the 
poorest has a greater likelihood of successful poverty reduction, and as the majority of the poor can be found 
in the rural areas of northern Cameroon, a poverty reducing growth strategy would focus on the value chain 
development of coarse grains (rice, maize, millet, and sorghum) but also livestock, beans and cotton, which is

the main cash crop grown in the Northern regions. In this context, the GOC’s agriculture strategy is expressed 
in three key national strategy and planning documents: (i) «Vision 2035» envisages agricultural growth beyond 
5 percent by 20209; the DSCE foresees significant productivity increases in agriculture and livestock farming; (ii) 
the 2005 - 2009 Rural Development Strategy and its 2013 update (“Document de Stratégie de Développement 
du Secteur Rural,” - DSDSR) commit to a modernization of rural infrastructure and agricultural production and 
sustainable management of natural resources; and (iii) Cameroon has engaged in the African Union’s 
Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program (CAADP), and with CAADP support, Cameroon is 
currently finalizing its 2014-2020 National Agriculture Investment Program (“Plan National d’Investissement 
Agricole,” - PNIA11).  
 

Cameroon aims to articulate and implement a more robust public expenditure program to improve sector 
performance. This would necessitate an examination of the national budget level benefiting the sector, which 
currently remains below 5 percent of the total budget (compared with the CAADP target of 10 percent), as well 
as a review of the quality of expenditure planning, allocation, and implementation. To this effect, the agriculture 
sector ministries (MINADER and the Ministry of Livestock, Fisheries, and Animal Production) with support from 
the Bank are currently finalizing an agriculture sector public expenditure review to identify bottlenecks, 
inefficiencies, and deviations from the policy goals. The review, which is expected to be completed by the 
effectiveness of the proposed project, will analyze growth of agriculture on a macroeconomic scale within the 
framework of a computable general equilibrium model. This model will analyze the role of relative prices, public 
expenditure, and exchange rates on the growth in the sector. This tool will also development partners to help 
decide how to increase the financial resources dedicated to agricultural development. 
 
Within this framework, the Government of Cameroon asked support from the World Bank to improve 
irrigation services and sustain climate resilient agricultural productivity in the Benue River Valley, in the North 
of Cameroon. One of the poorest regions in the country, highly populated, and with a history of immigration 
pressure from the extreme North, the North region is within the Sudano-Sahelian Savanah agroecological zone. 
Of the five agroecological zones of Cameroon, the Sudano-Sahelian (North and Extreme North) is the one with 
the shortest rain-fed season (March to September, Figure 2 below).  
 

 Figure 2: Rainfall patterns in different Agro-ecological Zones. The Sudano-Sahelian zone (in the yellow frame) is the one with the shortest season, 
and with the least amount of precipitation.

In this zone, the potential Evapotranspiration (ETP) is never fully satisfied by the amount of monthly rainfall, 
inducing a permanent deficit (figure 3 below). This translates into water stress and reduced photosynthesis and 
therefore yields. In this zone improved water storage, water harvesting, and irrigation are critical to improving 
farm production. Improved water management also enhances the ability to withstand climatic shocks and is 
commensurate with a strategy whereby the production of staples is promoted in rain-fed systems and 
production of high value cereals (e.g.  rice), horticultural cops, and industrial crops in irrigated systems. With an 
enormous untapped potential for irrigation (a 5,900 million m3 Lagdo reservoir) the Benué Valley if correctly 
developed will have a significant impact in improving the life of hundreds of thousands of people through 
economic growth, poverty reduction, social stabilization, and reduced vulnerability.

Different groups of poor people can be expected to benefit from increases in agricultural productivity in the 
Benué Valley. Poor farmers will benefit from higher incomes brought about by productivity gains while non-
farmers in rural areas benefit from spill-over gains. When increased agricultural productivity leads to increases 
in food production, lower food prices will benefit the urban poor and net food buyers in rural areas, often the 
poorest. This is not inconsequential. High transportation costs make food an imperfectly tradeable commodity. 
An important transmission mechanism from agricultural productivity to aggregate growth is through the price 
of food, as it allows sustaining lower labor costs in the rest of the economy. 
 
The proposed project may qualify for a high adaptation and mitigation co-benefits in the form of adoption of 
Climate Smart practices, reduction in irrigation energy use, reducing emissions from deforestation and forest 
degradation and agricultural management activities that improve carbon pools. Project activities proposed 
under components 1, 2 and 3 are included on the “List of activities eligible for classification as climate mitigation 
finance” in the 2016 Joint Report on Multilateral Development Banks’ Climate Finance under category 4, sub-

category 4.1 and 4.2. In compliance to the corporate mandate included in the Environment Strategy endorsed 
by the board in 2012, a preliminary GHG assessment using conservative boundary values has been performed 
for this project using the Ex-Ante Carbon Balance Tool (EX-ACT).  Preliminary results show that the project 
creates a total net carbon sequestration of 337,558 tCO2-eq. Watershed management provided the largest 
potential for mitigation co-benefits. An updated GHG assessment will be performed during the appraisal stage. 
 
 

Relationship to CPF 
 

The project objective is fully consistent with the Cameroon Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for 2017-2021 
to support poverty reduction and shared prosperity in Cameroon. The FY17-FY21 CPF succeeded the Cameroon 
Country Partnership Strategy (FY10-FY13, report number - 52997), which was extended until FY14 by the 
Progress and Learning Report considered by the Executive Directors in October 2012. The CPF draws on a 
comprehensive Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD, report 103098-CM), completed during FY16, which 
identified constraints to achieving the World Bank’s Twin Goals of eliminating poverty and fostering shared 
prosperity in a socially and environmentally sustainable way. Despite more than a decade of economic growth, 
national poverty incidence has remained almost unchanged.  Poverty decreased slowly as a percentage of 
population, from 40.2 percent in 2001 to 37.5 percent in 2014, and its incidence declined in urban areas from 
17.9 percent to an estimated 8.9 percent during the same period.  In rural areas, on the other hand, the 
percentage of poor increased from 52.1 percent to 56.8 percent.  Even though urban poverty declined 
significantly in relative terms, the absolute number of urban poor declined only slightly, by 300,000, because 
the urban population increased by approximately 4.1 million since 2001. In rural areas, higher poverty incidence 
resulted in 1.1 million additional poor people. Overall, the absolute number of poor in Cameroon increased by 
approximately 800,000 since 2001. 

 
The CPF has concluded that in the short-term, the largest opportunity for increasing shared prosperity and 
reducing acute poverty in Cameroon is an improvement in rural livelihoods, largely based on agriculture.  Eighty-
five percent of all poor people live in the countryside. Of these a majority live in the Sudano-Sahelian areas of 
the North and the Far North regions. Cameroon has a strong potential to increase agriculture productivity. It 
has a comparative advantage in primary products based on a relative abundance of natural resources and 
unskilled and semi-skilled labor. There is also significant unmet internal demand for cereals, meat and animal 
products. The development of labor-intensive agro-industry could offer a path towards more diversified, 
complex and higher value forms of manufacturing. Key issues include low agricultural yields, limited 
infrastructure for transportation, delivery, and storage, as well as the need for improved irrigation and water 
harvesting to improve farm production in some areas.  
 
The proposed project addresses the key issues identified in the CPF and promotes natural resources and water 
management, irrigation, and agriculture under a participatory landscapes approach, with a specific focus on 
land tenure rights security.  Irrigation (as major investment component) will be expanded from reservoirs 
already developed on the Benue River which would provide safeguard against climate change impacts and 
increased occurrence of droughts. The supporting project components are aligned to development and 
dissemination of new agricultural technologies, climate-resilient rainfed agriculture, enhanced market linkages 
for small and marginal farmers, and improved natural resource management in the upper catchment areas of

the Benue River. Further the project will have positive impact in terms of environmental protection, and reduced 
greenhouse emissions by disseminating high efficiency irrigation systems, particularly for high value crops, 
which significantly reduce water consumption. The proposed project would also improve the sustainability and 
reliability of rainfed agriculture and small-scale irrigated agriculture in the Benue River Valley downstream of 
the Lagdo dam with better flood protection features. Thus the proposed project will be closely aligned to the 
findings and recommendations contained in the CPF. 
 
Link with other existing projects. The proposed Project builds on previous work and results of the Flood 
Emergency Project (PULCI - P143940) for component 2 and 4, and will closely coordinate with the Agriculture 
Investment and Market Development Project (PIDMA - P143417) for component 3. PULCI, following previous 
work from PACA (P112635), is working to improve irrigation and flood protection in a sustainable manner for 
the riverine population of the Far-North. Furthermore, the Bank is currently undertaking a AAA for increasing 
climate smart agriculture in Northern Cameroon. In addition, the project will collaborate with the regional 
initiative Building Climate Resilience in the Niger Basin (P161262) whose objective is to strengthen the Niger 
Basin Authority’s capacity for integrated, transboundary water resources management, being the Benue valley 
part of the Niger basin.” 
 
 
C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  

 
I. The Overall Series of Project Program  

  

The Program Development Objective is to strengthen NBA’s capacity for integrated, transboundary water 
resources management and support the implementation of the Regional Climate Resilience Investment Plan 
(CRIP).   
  
The program activities focus on two broad areas:   
  
Strengthening of ABN’s capacity for transboundary, integrated water resource management (WRM) investing 
in Planning and feasibility studies, Environmental Information System and associated decision making tools, 
Operationalization of the Water Charter, and Strengthening NBA’s operational capacity, dissemination of good 
practices and project implementation support; and  
  
Support of the implementation of the CRIP focusing on transboundary activities. Among the numerous activities 
planned in the CRIP two types of activities have been selected: activities aimed at improving the performance 
and safety of large, existing transboundary infrastructure (mostly for hydropower and irrigation) in order to 
postpone the need to develop further large dams and their potential damages on riparian countries and 
measures to manage transboundary contributions to flood and sedimentation.   
Among the potential activities are the following: (i) Improving the performance and safety of key existing 
hydropower dams, such as, for example, the Kainji and Jebba dams in Nigeria, the Sotuba and Selinge dam in 
Mali, and the Lagdo hydropower dam in Cameroon, with its interconnection to Chad; (ii) Improving water-use 
efficiency of the “Office du Niger” in Mali; and (iii) Addressing Niger River sedimentation and recurrent flooding 
in the “Moyen Niger” and “Benoué tributary” through water conservation measures in Burkina Faso, Cameroun

and Benin among others.  
 
 

 
II.  Proposed Development Objective(s)  

  

The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to improve irrigation services and sustain climate resilient 
agricultural productivity in the Benue River Valley located within the administrative region of North, in 
Cameroon.   
  
This would be achieved through sustainable management of the water resources generated in the Benué River 
catchment area and flowing to the reservoir impounded behind the Lagdo dam, as well as of the regulated river 
flows downstream of the dam for irrigated agriculture. In addition, flood mitigation and protection measures 
on the Benue River system downstream of the Lagdo dam will enable sustainable rain-fed agriculture in the river 
valley. Support to livelihoods in the Lagdo reservoir and improved feed availability for livestock due to increased 
production of crops would improve off farm rural incomes resulting in shared prosperity.   
  
 
Key Results (From PCN) 

 

The Key Project Indicators (KPI) will be:  

a) Area provided with new/improved irrigation and drainage services (in Has, Core Indicator); 
b) Increase in irrigated  area (hectares) under vegetables as well as cereal crops; 
c) Increase in climate resilient agricultural productivity (yield/ha) of various crops grown in the project 

areas; 
d) Number of farmers reached with agricultural assets or services.   

 
 
 
D. Concept Description 

 

1. Description 
 
Introduction/Background: The project area covers the Benue river valley located in North Cameroon 
Administrative Region, one of the poorest regions of the country. The Lagdo multipurpose dam was 
constructed on the Benue River over the years 1978-1982. At completion, the storage volume in the reservoir 
impounded behind the dam was about 7,700 million cubic meters. A hydropower plant was established with 
72 MW installed capacity and allowance was made for provision of water for irrigation of about 11,000 ha 
(about 6,000 ha along the right bank of the river and about 5,000 ha along the left bank of the river). The 
hydropower station has been operating since 1982 but the irrigation development did not take place as 
originally envisaged. About 800 ha were developed on the right bank in 1992. The reservoir storage volume 
has been impacted over the last 30 years by sedimentation and currently the storage volume available is

estimated to be about 5900 million cubic meters based on bathymetric surveys completed in 2005. The project 
would support the sustainable management of the Benue watershed, the development of irrigated agriculture 
on both banks of the river immediately downstream of the river as well as in the river valley below, and the 
improvement of agriculture practices in the valley, including land tenure right management. In accordance with 
World Bank OP 4.37, project financing would include aspects related to safe operation of the dam and 
appurtenances. The total project cost is expected to be about US$ 200 million for a duration of seven years. 
The project will have the following components. 
 

Component 1: Watershed Management (US$ 5M IDA, US$ 10M regional IDA, US$ 15M Total) 
 

The primary goal of this component is to reverse the process of degradation of the natural resource base and 
improve the productive potential of natural resources and incomes of the rural households in the watershed 
sustaining the Lagdo reservoir while improving the operation and safety of the dam. The secondary goal is to 
maintain the quality and quantity of water of the reservoir through sustainable operation and maintenance. It 
will finance watershed interventions, consulting services, technical assistance and equipment along the 
following.  
 

Watershed management: Prior to the construction of the dam and impoundment of the reservoir at Lagdo, the 
population farmed the reservoir area after the recession of flood flows each year. After the impoundment some 
of these farmers have moved to the periphery of the reservoir and have been cultivating there. Tillage of lands 
and cultivation induces soil erosion in these areas resulting in sediment deposition in the reservoir. In addition, 
the reservoir is an important source for fisheries development. Cutting of firewood to smoke the fish, a common 
practice in Cameroon, resulted in deforestation further contributing to erosion and sedimentation in the 
reservoir. This subcomponent will introduce sustainable practices to manage the watershed. It will mobilize 
community participation in watershed development and management aimed at integrating land-water use to 
reduce soil erosion, retain moisture and produce biomass, while enhancing incomes and livelihood options. 
Non-arable land development: interventions will be aimed at (i) ecological rehabilitation of the catchment by 
carrying out soil and water conservation measures through site specific treatment plans, and (ii) narrowing the 
gap between biomass production and consumption in degraded areas. Arable land development: This 
subcomponent will improve cropping systems through promoting adoption of new agronomic practices, and 
fisheries, crop diversification, water harvesting technologies and optimal use of natural sources. Effort for 
improving land tenure security as an incentive to use these new agronomic practices and technology will be 
included in this subcomponent. Funds would be provided to secure appropriate expertise in this regard and to 
implement the measures described above as appropriate. Funds would be provided to secure appropriate 
expertise in this regard and to implement the measures described above as appropriate. This subcomponent 
can be assigned Mitigation co-benefits as financed activities will lead to net reduction in GHG emissions. 
 
Component 2: Water Infrastructure rehabilitation, development and maintenance (US$ 45M IDA, US$ 90M 
regional IDA, US$ 135M Total) 
 
The goal of this component is to rehabilitate and develop water infrastructure that will ensure dam operation 
and safety downstream of Lagdo and allow irrigated agriculture in 11,000 ha, a potentially game changer for the 
rural economy of the North of Cameroon. It will finance studies, consulting services, works and equipment along

North Cameroon Agriculture and Water Smart Landscapes Project (P166072) 

 
 

  
Jan 28, 2018 Page 16 of 25  

     

the following three subcomponents. This component may qualify for both climate change adaptation and 
mitigation co-benefits . 
 
Subcomponent 2a:  Sustainable operation and maintenance of Lagdo Dam and Reservoir Complex: The Lagdo 
Reservoir impounded behind the Lagdo Dam provides water for power generation and irrigation of lands located 
immediately below the dam on both banks of the river, and is designed to provide flood modulation as well. The 
lake is also a resource for fisheries. Funds would be provided to improve the water inflow forecasts through 
provision of updated electronic meteorological equipment in the catchment and to improve the modeling 
capabilities of Eneo, the operator of the dam. (Eneo, the Energy Company of Cameroon, is responsible for power 
generation and distribution in the country but has also been given the overall responsibility of Lagdo dam 
operation – power generation, irrigation releases, flood releases, and safety of the dam).  The dam is owned by 
the Government of Cameroon (MEADEN) with Eneo operating under an umbrella contract for energy generation 
and distribution throughout the country with other assets as well.  Currently the dam is being inspected 
periodically by a national expert panel. Funds would be provided to set up an independent dam safety panel 
with specific Terms of Reference in accordance with Dam Safety Guidelines of the World Bank. The Dam was 
built in early eighties. The international standards for design floods and flood evacuating mechanisms have 
changed substantially during the last four decades. The Hydrologic computations for the dam/reservoir complex 
would be revisited and if required the design floods would be revised on the basis of today’s standards. Hydraulic 
computations would also be revised to ensure flood handling mechanisms are adequate to meet current 
standards. Funds would be provided to carry out the required studies and analysis using reputed firms. Funds 
would be provided to make any structural modifications required to the dam and spillway arising out of these 
studies. Improved emergency preparedness plans would be prepared using up to date maps and technology for 
a flooding early warning system. This sub-component may qualify for climate change adaptation co-benefits. 
 
Subcomponent 2b: Irrigation infrastructure to utilize direct water releases available from the Reservoir 
(11,000ha) – Provision was made in the original design of the Lagdo Dam Complex to provide irrigation water 
to irrigate lands situated on both banks of the river immediately downstream of the river. Original designs 
allowed for gravity irrigation of about 6,000 ha on the right bank and about 5,000 ha on the left bank. However, 
only limited irrigation infrastructure was built along the right bank covering about 1,000 ha and no infrastructure 
including release offtake was built on the left bank. In order to utilize the water resource asset already provided 
for in the reservoir for agriculture development, funds would be provided to update the feasibility studies 
carried out earlier covering the irrigation areas on both banks and to prepare detailed designs, cost estimates 
and bid documents for the left bank infrastructure in its entirety. Notional cropping patterns will be developed 
during project preparation on the basis of soil suitability, climate factors and irrigability. Funds would be 
provided for the construction of all requisite infrastructure for the development of the 5,000 ha on the left bank 
including the offtake at the dam.  
 
On the right bank, infrastructure developed for the 1,000 ha requires rehabilitation and modernization.  Funds 
would be provided to update the feasibility studies carried out earlier for the right bank as well as detailed 
designs and cost estimates covering the total gravity command of 6,000 ha. Funds would be provided for 
rehabilitation/modernization of irrigation infrastructure covering 1,000 ha. On the left bank the GoC intends to 
have private-sector led commercial investors. Options of IFC supporting this investment are being considered

and will be further developed at preparation. The project will propose some legal mechanism to improve land 
tenure right security for all the stakeholders involved in the irrigation schemes. Funds would be provided for 
the construction of primary irrigation infrastructure covering the remaining 5,000 ha on the right bank.  
 
Subcomponent 2c: Technical Assistance for Irrigation Management. This Subcomponent will address the 
daunting challenge of ensuring the long-term viability of the irrigation and drainage services delivered on the 
irrigation schemes.  The approach will be to implement a progressive management transfer to users’ regulated 
bodies in the form of WUAs and to autonomous professional operators, either public or private.  The approach 
will be first piloted in the right bank, which is the ‘first mover’, starting with the areas to be rehabilitated.  The 
investments under this Subcomponent would support the development of a detailed training strategy with 
associated learning materials to re-align existing WUAs and establish new ones to achieve a transformed 
institutional structure for effective water management.  
 
Component 3: Agriculture Production (US$ 40M, IDA) 
 
The fundamental needs of Cameroon to increase production and enhance productivity in the North (especially 
with irrigation and particularly of smallholders), reduce vulnerability, boost rural employment, and provide 
environmental services come in a context where agriculture is challenged by extreme weather, increased 
market risk, too-slow progress in raising rural incomes in some regions, and too-slow progress in improving 
nutrition, especially for women and infants. Agriculture is the main activity of the households (88%) of the area. 
Globally it is extensive agriculture with low production dominated by cereals (maize and sorgho), groundnut 
and cowpea as food-crops and cotton as cash-crop. Within the riverbanks, small plots of onions, tomatoes and 
other vegetables can be found. Social studies show an abundance of labor force. The markets are in Lagdo and 
Ngong, being also intermediaries that re-sell the primary products in Garoua and Ngaoundere. This component 
will focus on production, linking farmers to markets, and support services. It will finance grants, training, works, 
equipment, workshops and studies along the following sub-components. 
 
Subcomponent 3a: Climate Smart Agriculture – Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) is an approach for reorienting 
agricultural systems under the new realities of climate change: (i) sustainably increasing agricultural productivity 
to support equitable increases in incomes, food security and development; (ii) adapting and building resilience 
to climate change; and (iii) developing opportunities to reduce GHG emissions from agriculture compared with 
past trends. Activities will focus essentially on enhancing climate proofing while improving water and agriculture 
productivity. Examples of these activities are the dissemination of Systems of Rice Intensification (SRI) 
techniques, water saving technologies such as low pressure irrigation, mechanization services, improved soil 
management, urea-deep placement, drought-resistant and hybrid seed varieties, Integrated Nutrient 
Management (INM), Integrated Pest Management (IPM), organic farming techniques, and diversification into 
high value crops such as pulses and millets, vegetables and other horticulture crops. The project will provide 
farmers with training and technical assistance. A grant facility will finance small equipment, inputs, services 
and/or activities to: (i) promote the adoption of priority technologies, (ii) strengthen producer-based 
organizations, transfer knowledge and technologies; (iii) improve food safety and quality standards, and (iv) 
improve handling, packaging and post-harvest management at the farm level. This sub-component may qualify 
for climate change adaptation co-benefits.

Subcomponent 3b: Agribusiness and linking farmers to market – This subcomponent will focus on value 
addition and forward linking farmers to markets under a productive alliance approach. Productive alliances are 
collaborative arrangement between groups or producer organizations (POs) and an agribusiness within 
particular value-chains for provision in a specified quantity, quality and time.  Four elements define the nature 
of a Productive Alliance (PA), namely: a group of organized producers, a buyer, an investment in production and 
marketing, and technical assistance. The project will finance outreach and promotional activities to identify POs, 
commercial partners and private financing entities to form alliances, and formulate business proposals and 
business plans. In order to become eligible for financing under the project, a business plan will have to be 
financially feasible, and support one or more productive alliances. Grants would be that portion of the alliance’s 
business plan that would be: (i) financed with proceeds from the proposed project; (ii) implemented by POs; (iii) 
governed by agreements signed between the PO and the project; and (iv) include fixed capital (e.g., plant and 
equipment, minor infrastructure), working capital and technical assistance expenditures. Examples of business 
plans to be financed could be the following: the establishment of PO managed collection, dehusking and 
processing center for rice or cereals, a sorting, grading and packaging facility for fresh vegetables, a grading and 
processing center for cashew nuts. 
 
Subcomponent 3c: Farm Service Centers – The project will finance a TA to promote a local network of private, 
retail supply and farm service businesses Farm Service Centers (FSCs) throughout the project area. An 
enterprise-based delivery of farm supplies and services, FSCs will be one-stop-shops that provide smallholder 
farmers with agricultural and veterinary inputs, services and technologies that will help production and linkages 
to markets. This highly adaptable model, has already been proven successful in several countries worldwide and 
in the region, notably in Senegal and Ethiopia. Grants will be provided and applications reviewed and ranked on 
a competitive basis to evaluate technical capacity, proposed business plan, and potential impacts.  FSCs can be 
privately owned or owned by cooperatives or other types of producers associations. In addition, this 
subcomponent will promote mechanization providing on-demand tractor services for smallholder farmers who 
are relying on expensive and often unavailable manual labor through low-cost “Smart Tractor owners” that pairs 
better off local tractors owners with labor-constrained farmers willing to pay for tractor services (tractor 
“Uberization”). A booking system will allow farmers to request, schedule and prepay for tractor services, from 
nearby Smart Tractor owners, through SMS messaging and mobile money. The subcomponent will provide 
grants, studies and consultant services. Technical inputs and knowledge sharing for this component will be 
provided (tentatively) by the Syngenta Foundation.  
 
Component 4. Implementation (US$ 10M IDA) 
 
Subcomponent 4a: Institutional Strengthening – The primary institution responsible for water resources 
development and management in the North of Cameroon is MEADEN reporting to MINEPAT. The Government 
has constituted a multi-disciplinary team to formulate this project. In order to formulate this project well and 
implement it, MEADEN staff structure has to be modified and modernized. The current organogram of MEADEN 
is being studied in detail to identify gaps and areas for strengthening in order to develop over the coming years 
a modern up to international standards MEADEN, similar to the SAED (Société Nationale d’Aménagement et 
d’Exploitation des Terres) approach in Senegal. MEADEN presently is a state-owned entreprise in charge of

irrigation service delivery as well as land allocation to farmers and land preparation  TORs are being prepared 
and positions will be filled based on Job Descriptions acceptable to the Bank after the approval of the PCN. 
Funds would be provided to support the training required to strengthen the skills of MEADEN staff both in the 
country, and abroad.  
The operation and maintenance of the new and rehabilitated/modernized irrigation systems would be carried 
out jointly by MEADEN and the Water Users Associations to be set up under the project. MEADEN would be 
responsible for the operation and maintenance of the primary canals and drains while the WUAs would be 
responsible for the secondary and tertiary systems. For irrigation services to be effectively delivered, WUAs will 
have to rely on a participatory design and the cooperation of all member farms, which entails paying irrigation 
and WUA membership fees, signing water contracts with WUAs and attending WUA planning meetings.  
 As several farms are headed by women, a study will be carried out during preparation to find the social 
implications for female irrigators to honor their farm’s financial obligations to WUAs, attend WUA planning 
meetings, and sign an annual contract for water delivery with the WUAs. The study will provide analyses and 
recommendations to improve land tenure rights as well for both female and male irrigators. In addition, the 
concept of WUAs is new to Cameroon. Funds would be provided to train the WUAs as well as to develop 
appropriate legislation for the creation of the WUAs (this is already on-going with the PULCI project).  
Government of Cameroon authorities undertook a study visit in January 2018 to visit the SAED  operations in 
the Senegal river’s delta, where such WUAs are operating efficiently. Following the same model, funds would 
be provided to develop similar arrangements between MEADEN and the WUAs. Irrigation infrastructure would 
be provided with required instrumentation to enable MEADEN to monitor the performance of the WUAs on a 
regular basis to ensure irrigation water is supplied to the farmers on a timely basis and agreed quantities are 
delivered. 
Subcomponent 4b: Project Implementation and M&E support – This subcomponent will set up a Project 

Management Unit (PMU) to assist MEADEN in the day-to-day implementation of the project. Proposed structure 

of the PMU with job descriptions will be developed and agreed with MEADEN before appraisal.  The core PMU 

will be set up in MEADEN soon after the PCN approval. Funds would be provided to meet salaries and allowances 

of PMU staff and to cover operation expenses. The GoC expressed interest in requesting a Project Advance. 

These funds will be used among other things to make progress in setting up and strengthen the PMU 

accordingly. In addition, baseline information will be collected before the start of the management of the 

watershed and before the starting of the production activities in the area to allow an impact evaluation at the 

end of the project life. 

 
 
    

  SAFEGUARDS 

 
A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 

 
The project is located in the Sudano-sahelian zone of Cameroon, it is presumably the driest zone of the country. Rainfall 

in this zone is highly variable with its onset very erratic and last for about 5 months (May-September). This zone is mostly 
affected by land degradation. Land disputes and agropastoral conflicts are of a major concern because there are no

defined routes for cattle migration, and thus animals. Land degradation is due to pressures such as deforestation due to 
expanding agriculture, fuel wood harvesting, bush fires, semi-intensive and extensive cattle rearing and farming. National 
Park belongs to this zone and it is home to elephants, black rhinos, cheetahs, hyenas, population of hippos and other 
wildlife. Porous borders and poor park protection make Faro extremely vulnerable to poachers, livestock, and habitat 
destruction. 
 
B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 

 
Cameroon has a comprehensive Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) law and regulations as well as 

occupational safety regulations. The framework law No 96/12 of 5 August 1996 on environmental management highlights 
in its article 17 the principle of environmental impact assessment. Two forms of public participation-stakeholder 
engagement are required for ESIA by law: public consultations during the assessment stage and public hearings during the 
review stage. Legal and administrative appeals are possible at all stages and for all decisions relating to ESIA. A relatively 
mature central (Ministry of environment, interministerial Committee on the Environment, CIE decentralized 
(municipalities, Divisional Committees for technical and administrative supervision of ESMP and ministry of environment 
decentralized units) ESIA authorities are in place but they are understaffed. The CIE gives an opinion on the quality of 
reports prior to their approval by the Minister. The decentralized units don’t have adequate financial provision. They lack 
adequate equipment for fieldwork, and Senior staff lack personal vehicles. In 2017, the ESIA sub-directorate and 
Environmental & Social Management Plan (ESMP) sub-directorate in the Ministry of Environment consist of six full-time 
staff and 2-4-part time staff, of whom many are knowledgeable about the national ESIA system and the World Bank 
Safeguards for which they received a substantial training. MAEDEN is not familiar with the World Bank operational 
policies as this is its first Bank financed projects. It has an institutionalized GIS unit but does not have the necessary 
technical knowledge and expertise in environmental and social issues in the region and as such has the technical capacity 
to identify and flag any safeguards related concerns to the implementation of the safeguards instruments for national-
level investments, should any arise during project implementation. To bridge this gap, the project will set up a Project 
Management Unit (PMU) to assist MEADEN in the day-to-day implementation of the project. At the early stage of 
preparation, two safeguards specialists (Social and Environmental) will be hired for the PMU. They will oversee the 
preparation of the safeguard documents, liaise with local consultants, and coordinate the organization of the necessary 
consultations with key concerned stakeholders and the in-country disclosure of the safeguards instruments.

D. Policies that might apply 

 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

The Project is proposed to be classified as Category 
OP/BP 4.01 “A” due to potential downstream impacts 
and negative potential environmental and social 
impacts associated with development and/or 
rehabilitation of irrigation infrastructure. A basin level 
ESIA report that will include Cumulative Impact 
Assessment (CIA) will be prepared during 
implementation. However, a specific ESIA for the 



 
The World Bank  
North Cameroon Agriculture and Water Smart Landscapes Project (P166072) 

 
 

  
Jan 28, 2018 Page 21 of 25  

     

known irrigation scheme (11,000 ha) will  be prepared 
and disclosed before the decision meeting. The 
specific ESIA will include a Gender Based Violence 
assessment and occupational safety. These ESIAs will 
inform the notification to Nigeria Government by the 
GoC; ToRs of these studies are consulted upon in-
country and cleared by the Bank. For the subprojects 
to be implemented under the small grants of 
component 3, which are not identified before 
appraisal, an ESMF will be prepared and it shall 
describe the roadmap for preparing sites specific. 
Finally, a GRM will be prepared, consulted upon and 
disclosed before project effectiveness.  
  

Performance Standards for Private Sector 
Activities OP/BP 4.03 

No  

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 Yes 

Although the project is not expected to intervene in 
any critically important natural habitats, downstream 
impacts, development of irrigation infrastructure may 
affect areas requiring specific management 
considerations such wildlife migration corridors. In 
addition, this policy is triggered due to the presence of 
three cynegetic zones (Campement des éléphants, 97 
920 ha; ZIC 8 : Mayo Boulel, 35 040 ha ; ZIC 8 bis: 
Louga, 8 320 ha) in the project area of influence. 
Specific guidance will be provided to avoid significant 
conversion or degradation of rivers and the EA will 
identify and delineate areas of critical habitat and 
ensured application of the mitigation hierarchy in 
accordance with this policy for all project works. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 Yes 

The project does not support commercial forest 
exploitation. However, the Massif Forest of Ouro-
Doukoudje may be affected due to the presence in the 
project area of influence. Mitigation measures are 
thus proposed as part of the ESMP. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

Major interventions are planned to enhance 
agricultural productivity and this may lead to an 
increased use of pesticides and other agrochemicals. 
An Integrated Pest Management Plan (IPMP) will be 
prepared, consulted upon and disclosed before 
appraisal. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 Yes 

Previous studies in the Region revealed local 
significant heritage places such as graveyards. 
Mitigation measures will be incorporated into the 
disclosed ESMP including provisions for a detailed 
Cultural Heritage Management Plan. A comprehensive

Jan 28, 2018 Page 22 of 25  

     

chance find procedure will be prepared as part of the 
ESIA reports, embedded in the overall ESMPs, to that 
end. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 No 

There are no Indigenous Peoples in the project areas, 
as defined by OP/BP 4.10. 
 
  

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

The client will prepare a Resettlement Policy 
Framework (RPF) for all the entire project. The project 
through its component 2 is likely to involve land 
acquisition / involuntary resettlement and/or possible 
restrictions of access to resources and livelihoods.  
There are 3 clear distinct irrigation areas: (i) right bank 
rehabilitation (1,000 ha), (ii) right bank new area 
(5,000 ha) and (iii) left bank new area (5,000 ha). 
Therefore:  
(i)           a RAP will be prepared for the rehabilitation 
area prior to appraisal.  
(ii)          for the rest eventual new irrigation areas, the 
resettlement process is at an advanced stage. The list 
of people affected by the project (PAPs) already exists, 
PAPs have received pecuniary compensation, a PAP 
resettlement site is being developed and a Declaration 
of Public Utility (DUP) exists for the eventual new 
perimeters. The Government of Cameroon elaborated 
the list of PAPs in 2010, a total of 1442 household 
affected were recorded for 3093 properties (fields and 
boxes) as provided in the decree n°2010/3445/PM of 
December 15, 2010 relating to the compensation of 
the victims by incorporating to the private domain of 
the state lands downstream from the Lagdo 
perimeters. All this documentation is being reviewed 
and updated by a social audit that the client will 
present to the World Bank team for review and 
clearance prior to appraisal. In case, there will be new 
households settled after 2010 (after the DUP), PAPs 
will be compensated for those new assets (except 
land) prior to resettlement. In case there will be new 
constructions (houses, community infrastructures, 
etc.) different from those already compensated in 
2010 in the DUP area, PAPs will also be compensated 
for these assets prior to resettlement. It is highly 
expected social audit’s recommendations will propose 
specific measures related to assistance for 
resettlement (transportation costs coverage and 
livelihoods assistance) to all PAPs to be resettled.

Upon approval, the final RAPs of these two new zones 
(right bank new area (5,000 ha) and (iii) left bank new 
area (5,000 ha)) in Lagdo will be prepared during 
project implementation and cleared by the WB prior 
to any works commence. 
In addition, a GRM document for the project will be 
prepared and disclosed before project effectiveness. 
Finally, all subprojects under component 3 will be 
submitted to an environmental and social screening 
during the implementation stage and based on results 
this would lead to Environmental and Social Impacts 
assessments (ESIAs) or Environmental and Social 
Impacts Notice (ESIN). 
  

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 Yes 

 
This policy is triggered because funds would be 
provided to make any structural modifications 
required to the dam and spillway arising out of these 
studies. In addition, the project infrastructure 
investments, including irrigation, will rely on the 
performance of this existing dam. An independent 
Panel of Experts with Dam Safety and Environmental 
and Social expertise will be hired by MEADEN in 
accordance with Dam Safety Guidelines of the World 
Bank. The panel will comprise five specialists 
(geotechnical, Hydrological, hydro-electro-mechanics, 
environmental and social). Improved Emergency 
Response Preparedness plans (ERP) would be 
prepared using up to date maps and technology.  (i) 
The draft TORs for the ERP will be ready before 
appraisal; (ii) GoC will notify Nigeria and (iii) the Bank 
will review existing dam auscultation reports, and any 
other dam safety documents including the accessible 
sections of the OM before the decision meeting. ENEO 
established in 2010 a structured CSR including 
Hygiene, safety and Environment Central Unit. It aslo 
has an environmental and social policy (ESP #42 Rev 2 
09/14) and has developed Safety and Environmental 
and social performances for its operations. However, 
the ERP and ESIA processes will assess the technical 
capacity of ENEO at Lagdo Dam and Regional levels to 
identify, flag and manage any safety, environmental 
and social related concerns to the Lagdo dam 
operation – power generation, irrigation releases, 
flood releases, and safety of the dam.

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

Yes 

This policy is triggered because the Benue river  flows 
over the Nigeria–Cameroon border, and the 
Government of Cameroon (GoC) will notify Nigeria 
before negotiations. There is a memorandum of 
understanding on the need to maintain water in the 
Benue Basin was signed between Cameroon and 
Nigeria in 2016. 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No There are no disputed areas in the project areas. 

 
E. Safeguard Preparation Plan  
 
Tentative target date for preparing the Appraisal Stage PID/ISDS 
 
Mar 28, 2018 
 
Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed. The specific studies and 
their timing should be specified in the Appraisal Stage PID/ISDS 
 
In the previous stages PID/ISDS, the documents to be presented will be: 1) Resettlement Policy Framework for the whole 

project and 2) Resettlement Action Plan and list of PAPs of the area  to be rehabilitated(1000ha). The other RAPs will be 
prepared under project implementation.   
GRM document for the project need to be prepared and disclosed before project approval.  
 Consultants in charge of safeguard should be on board prior project appraisal, for insuring consultation and validation of 

safeguards instruments.

A. Introduction and Context 
 
1. Burkina Faso (274,000 km2) is a landlocked, low-income country with high demographic growth and poverty 
levels. With a Gross National Income (GNI) per capita of US$610 in 2017, Burkina Faso is amongst the 20 poorest 
countries in the world. The population of about 19.6 million (2017) is young (46 percent under 15), with high growth 
rate (3 percent) and the majority (70 percent) lives in rural areas. Poverty continues to be overwhelmingly concentrated 
in rural areas, which are home to 90 percent of the poor. The country was ranked 185 out of 188 countries on the 2015 
overall UN Human Development Index (HDI). Non-income indicators of poverty and welfare, particularly in the areas of 
education and health, are among the lowest in the world, and most of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 
appear out of reach.   
 
2. Economic performance has been relatively strong in the past decade; but growth has levelled off recently. 
Over the past fifteen years, economic growth has averaged about 5.5 percent per year (IMF, 2018). Burkina Faso’s 
economy is still heavily reliant on agriculture (especially cotton) and mining (especially gold), which contribute the bulk 
of its export revenues. The recent fluctuation in gold and cotton prices, combined with drops in grain production and 
political instability, have contributed to the slowdown in economic growth. The country has made progress in 
implementing structural reforms, sound economic policies, increased cotton and mining production, steady 
investments, and a stable macroeconomic environment. Monetary and exchange rate policy has been well-managed, 
and inflation has been kept at a low level (less than 3 percent over the past decade and 0.4 percent in 2017).  Burkina 
Faso has a relatively healthy banking sector. The country is also working toward an integrated and open regional 
economic space through the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU), the Economic Community of West 
African States (ECOWAS), and other African cooperation initiatives notably the Africa Food Security Leadership Dialogue 
on Adapting African Agriculture to Climate Change in support of the Comprehensive African Agriculture Development 
Program (CAADP) Food Security Commitment.  In 2017, the country was ranked 74 in the world, one of the best rankings 
in Sub-Saharan Africa, according to the Corruption Perception Index. 
 
3. The country faces many socio-political and security challenges which have impeded a full economic recovery; 
the harsh climate and environment degradation are making these challenges even more acute. Burkina Faso has 
recently experienced internal unrest fueled by the unequal distribution of resources and a perceived lack of 
accountability in the management of public resources. This situation has been exacerbated by insecurity in neighboring 
Mali, and the Sahel region in general. Burkina Faso hosts more than 25,000 Malian refugees. The security situation has 
worsened significantly since June 2018 due to an upsurge in violent attacks by terrorists and criminal groups in the 
Eastern and Northern regions. If not addressed adequately, security challenges are expected to continue to impact the 
country's socioeconomic prospects in the years to come.  The harsh climatic conditions which hinder efforts to reduce 
vulnerability and extreme poverty are compounding the security challenges. 
 
4. To confront these challenges, the Government is implementing the National Program for Economic and Social 
Development (Plan National de Développement Economique et Social – PNDES). The PNDES lays out the Government’s 
vision and action plan for the period 2016-2020. It emphasizes the structural transformation of the economy with 
agriculture playing the key role as a driver of growth. Its priority interventions are to increase productivity, improve the 
management of water resources for agriculture, develop market infrastructure and support institutional 
transformation. It also highlights the challenges related to climate change and the degradation of soils, with the 
objective to support a transition towards a green economy and the sustainable management of natural resources.

B. Sectoral and Institutional Context 
 
5. Burkina Faso’s agriculture sector is still one of the main pillars of the national economy, although its 
contribution to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has decreased recently. Farming and livestock activities still occupy 
about 86 percent of Burkina Faso’s workforce and constitute the main source of income for the poorest populations. 
The sector’s contribution to GDP, however, has declined from 35 percent in 1999 to 32.6 percent in 2013 (FAOSTAT, 
2014), due to the diversification of the economy into areas such as mining. Most crops including cereals (millet, 
sorghum, maize and other cereals including coarse/feed grains), and commercial crops (mainly cotton), as well as 
legumes (cowpeas, groundnuts) are produced under rainfed conditions with low yields, with high vulnerability to 
climate change. As part of the traditional Sahelian parkland landscape, those crops often are produced in systems that 
also include useful trees, such as shea, baobab, locust-bean trees and others. Other crops, including rice, onions, 
tomatoes, and other horticultural crops, are cultivated under full irrigated (full water control) or semi-irrigated 
(bottomland) conditions. The yields of irrigated crops are also still below potential. An extended household may farm 
around 9.6 hectares (24 acres) in total, but plot sizes are small, with each plot averaging only 0.4 hectares, producing 
mostly for household consumption with little marketable surplus1. The production of food/ feed grains, of which by-
products are used for animal feeding (e.g., shredded millet/corn stalks), is common and remains the customary crop-
livestock mixed production model.  
 
6. Agriculture faces difficult agro-ecological conditions which are getting harsher due to climate change and 
increasing human pressure, leading to a situation where vulnerability and food insecurity remain key issues.  Along 
the Southern edge of the Sahelian band, the country faces the arid to semi-arid climate typical of the region. The rainfall 
is low overall (400 mm per year average in the Sahelian zone and 800-1000 mm in the Sudano-Sahelian zone), irregular 
and poorly distributed; and it is experiencing a downward trend. Some estimates indicate that more than 3.5 million 
people, roughly 20 percent of the population, are food insecure and/or suffer from inadequate nutrition. Like in much 
of the Sahel region, the increase of the population is both an asset and a challenge for agriculture, as demand for food 
increases and the needs for proper nutrition and food security must be addressed. The country’s rural areas are 
experiencing changes in land occupation patterns, with many former pastoralists becoming sedentary farmers and 
growing crops but also retaining roaming livestock herds. Therefore, pressure on land has increased, and there are 
increasing conflicts between pastoralists and farmers.  As a result, improved land management practices are 
increasingly required to secure land tenure, to optimize crop yields and to conserve land as a viable resource for the 
long run, including maintaining the carbon sequestered in the soil and landscape. 
 
7. The transport sector in Burkina Faso suffers from numerous constraints which hinder economic development, 
reducing the competitiveness of the tradable sectors of the economy including agriculture production. The state of 
transport infrastructure is poor, and the provision of transport services, hampered by road blocks and poor 
management, remains inefficient. The rural roads network is not sufficiently dense to permit access to all potential 
agriculture production areas. Key production areas remain enclaved, especially since many roads are not passable by 
regular vehicles during the rainy season. This is a major constraint to both providing the required production inputs at 
farm-gate and accessing market outlets to dispose of marketable production.   
 
8. Burkina Faso has substantial assets to develop its agriculture, both on the supply and demand side: 

i. On the supply side: (i) substantial land and agro-ecological potential, yet unexploited, offers opportunities to develop 
diversified agriculture systems; the country is endowed with 9 million ha of farmland, of which less than one-half (46 
percent) is currently under cultivation; (ii) traditional know-how and good experience of producers in certain 
production systems (flood recession cultivation, livestock fattening, poultry production, collection of agroforestry

products) and existence of many technological packages ready to be disseminated and applied; and (iii) substantial 
potential for irrigated farming using ponds and rivers, as well as underground water; and 

ii. On the demand side, agriculture development is spurred by: (i) a sizable and increasing domestic demand for food, 
particularly processed food, in tune with the nutrition needs of a rapidly increasing population overall, and with 
changing consumer preferences shifting towards greater diversification of diets and more value being attributed to 
convenience and quality; and (ii) the increasing demand for key export commodities (horticultural crops, shea nuts, 
cattle/meat) on regional and international markets. 

9. To transform its agriculture, Burkina Faso needs to address key constraints: 
a. Regulatory and institutional constraints: the legal texts governing the sector’s regulatory 

framework are not always adequate, and those existing are often insufficiently used or 
enforced2, and the means and capacity of intervention of the State services are limited, 
including planning and programming, statistical services, monitoring and evaluation, and 
information systems; 

b. Weakness of extension services: there are limited agriculture extension and outreach 
services to disseminate innovations, with consequent low expertise of producers and other 
operators in the value chains;  

c. Limited access to irrigation water resources and improved inputs: There is insufficient access 
to irrigation water resources (both through gravity and pumping) and improved inputs 
(fertilizers, phytosanitary inputs, mechanized implements, feed supplies, certified seeds, 
etc.); 

d. Poor management of natural resources: both climate change and anthropic pressure are 
leading to widespread land degradation. About 170,000 hectares per year of natural 
vegetation are lost because of land degradation and deforestation. At the current pace, 
Burkina Faso will lose approximately 15 percent of its agricultural land within 10 years; 

e. Limited competitiveness and weak connection to markets: poor public infrastructure, and 
insufficient private investment for production, processing, storage, transport and 
marketing, as well as the low valorization of by-products, insufficient market information 
and capacity to adhere to commercial norms and standards, and the low degree of 
organization of sector actors, all contribute to marketing inefficiencies; and 

f. Limited access to financing: commercial banks and micro-finance institutions, are reluctant 
to lend to agriculture given the high level of risk involved in the sector. 

 
 

10. Despite a large potential, irrigation remains underdeveloped and underexploited; tapping irrigation water 
resources is crucial to improve agricultural performance. Despite low and erratic rainfall, Burkina Faso enjoys relatively 
abundant water resources, with current agricultural withdrawals for irrigation representing a fraction of total renewable 
water resources and annual recharge. Irrigation development, in the context of erratic weather conditions currently 
amplified by climate change, has the potential to increase the resilience and productivity of the agriculture sector. 
Moving from rainfed crops to irrigated crops, as possibly feasible, is the strategy emphasized by PNDES for the 
agriculture sector. The irrigation sector in Burkina Faso, like in most Sahelian countries has experienced different stages 
of development. Following the limited success of the large-scale public irrigation schemes in the 1980s, institutional 
reforms refocused the role of public irrigation companies on irrigation development, with partial management transfer 
to water users’ associations. This has required that the management (operation and maintenance) of the irrigation 

                                                           
1 https://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/economies/Africa/Burkina-Faso-AGRICULTURE.html 
2 This is the case of the recently enacted Agriculture Investment Code (2018).

systems be carried out by institutions equipped with the necessary technical/ managerial capacity, with enough 
autonomy and flexibility, and with accountability to both the Government and users. In this respect, the project will 
provide support to Water User Associations (WUAs) so that they play an effective role in water management. 
 
11. There is large untapped potential for the development of Burkina Faso´s agro-industrial sector; but currently 
the country’s agro-processing base is weak. Only about 12 percent of agriculture commodities are processed before 
being sold on the market3. Many bottlenecks in the various value chains limit value addition, such as lack of conditioning 
or processing units. Linkages between farmers and downstream industrial and market operators are weak. Despite 
these constraints, agri-food systems are quickly changing in Burkina Faso like many other Sub-Saharan Africa countries, 
in response to changing demographic patterns coupled with economic growth. Fast-increasing population, urbanization 
trends and income growth are changing food demand in unprecedented ways, with large increases in total quantities 
demanded, growing preference for convenience, diversification of diets towards more fresh products, and an increased 
demand for product quality4. Food demand is growing particularly for items that are more processed, increasingly 
purchased on the market (instead of grown for self-consumption) and perishable (i.e., meat, dairy and fresh produce). 
A small but growing middle class already spends a significant fraction of its income on processed food. Demand for 
processed foods is thus expected to grow in Burkina Faso and neighboring countries, leading to sizable market 
opportunities for increased value addition through agro-processing. 
 
12. The weak enabling environment and limited access to commercial credit are major constraints for agriculture 
and agribusiness development. The 2017 World Bank Group Enabling the Business of Agriculture (EBA) report shows 
that Burkina Faso’s regulatory framework is impeding private investment in agriculture and agribusiness, all along the 
value chain. Significant weaknesses have been identified in regulations related to seed, fertilizer, agricultural machinery, 
water and market access. Public services, as well as professional organizations, need to be strengthened to address 
these weaknesses. Regarding credit, the agriculture sector receives only eight percent of commercial bank lending (of 
which 4.2 percent is for financing cotton) and fifteen percent of lending by Micro-Finance Institutions (MFIs). Access to 
finance by smallholder farmers is constrained by the following factors: low degree of organization of the value chains 
(except cotton), lack of bankable projects, limited exposure to financial entities, and lack of acceptable collateral. In 
addition, there are very few financial products whose terms and conditions would be adapted to the seasonal 
production cycles. Credit is mainly earmarked for production and trading of agricultural products, but very limited for 
agro-processing activities. The fact that agriculture is exposed to significant weather shocks increases the volatility of 
revenues and the risk due to drought, and hence the attendant risk faced by banks. The development of irrigation under 
the project, with provision of irrigation water year-round, will lessen this risk. This is important in the context of Burkina 
Faso where the use of suitable risk management instruments is lacking. 
 
13. Agriculture institutions exhibit major weaknesses. The primary institution in charge of crop production and 
irrigation development in Burkina Faso is the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Hydraulics (MAAH). MAAH carries out its 
operations through five core directorates dedicated to irrigation (Direction Générale des Aménagements of Hydo-
Agricoles et du Development de l ’Irrigation - DGAHDI), agricultural extension (DGPV), rural economy and sanitary & 
phyto-sanitary control (DGPER), land tenure and producer organizations (DGFOMR), and Monitoring & Evaluation and 
statistics (DGESS).  MAAH field operations are implemented through a network of decentralized branches including 
regional and provincial directorates, and regional technical support units. MAAH’s other decentralized institutions of 

                                                           
3 The PNDES target for processing of agricultural products is 25 percent.  An example of a product which is insufficiently processed is shea 
nut: 70 percent of the shea fruits are exported unprocessed. The loss of added value is estimated at US$100 million per year.

MAAH include seed production units, rural promotion centers, and regional laboratories for seed quality control. The 
following other ministries share responsibilities for agriculture in different areas: (i) the Ministry of Infrastructure (MI) 
for rural roads and tracks, (ii) the Ministry of Environment, Green Economy and Climate Change (MEEVCC) for 
environmental matters, including management of non-timber forest products and productive parklands such as shea 
parks, and (iii) the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Handicrafts for the promotion of Small and Medium Enterprises 
(SMEs), agro-processing and trade. There are other specialized semi-autonomous structures attached to MAAH with 
responsibility for specific interventions, as well as several private, consular or non-profit institutions active in agriculture 
such as the network of chambers of agriculture (Reseau des Chambres Agricoles - RECA) which provides general support 
to its private membership, the Maison de l’Entreprise which supports SMEs. The above institutions represent a fairly 
comprehensive set-up with good potential as framework to support agriculture development. However, as a general 
rule, most of these institutions display major weaknesses which prevent them from being fully effective, including 
insufficiently skilled staff and weak managerial and technical capabilities. This situation is compounded by limited 
operating budgets and/ or insufficient financial support from stakeholders and membership, lack of office and technical 
equipment, poor working conditions including office buildings which need renovation or upgrade. 
 
14. Gender gaps persist in Burkina Faso, particularly in farming activities. In the 2016 Human Development Report, 
the country ranked 146th out of 149 countries in gender inequality owing to gender disparities in a number of socio-
economic aspects. Female-headed households have 14 percent lower per capita food consumption and are more food 
insecure than male-headed households.5 Women's access to agricultural extension services, credit and productive 
resources such as agricultural inputs and equipment remains limited. Agriculture plots managed by women produce 
less per hectare than plots managed by men. The primary factors that contribute to the gender productivity gap in 
agriculture in Burkina Faso are essentially three fold: (i) women face constraints because of their duties in two economic 
spheres: the productive and the reproductive tasks in the household; (ii) women have limited access to farm labor, 
particularly male farm labor; and (iii) their productivity is limited by weak access to credit for agricultural inputs, 
improved farming equipment and labor.  

 
15. Youth unemployment is acute; it undermines the political and economic stability of the country. Rural youth 
(18 to 35 years) face challenges similar to those faced by women producers. They are mostly un-educated and lack 
professional qualifications. Their low social status and the difficulties they encounter to access economic resources limit 
their participation in productive activities.  In Burkina Faso, 68 percent of the population is under 24 years of age6. The 
problem of youth unemployment is severe: in 2014, 25.2 percent of youth were unemployed7. Given the lack of job 
opportunities, particularly in rural areas, youth unemployment threatens to undermine the country’s political stability, 
particularly within the present context of the influence of religious and other forms of extremism8. Hence, to avoid the 
instability and violence currently experienced by Burkina Faso, the focus should be on providing economic opportunities 
for young people. The focus on youth requires a gender perspective to develop effective and well targeted programs. 
Unless young women receive adequate training and have prospects of steady employment, the possibility of higher 
birth rates will undermine the country’s economic gains. Similarly, technical training and the creation of viable jobs for 
young men, in the agriculture sector particularly, is a precondition for sustainable development and peace. Ensuring 
that Burkina Faso’s youth are directly empowered with income earning activities, have access to education and training 
opportunities, and a voice in local decision-making is critical for the country’s stability and sustainable development.

a)  

 
D. Project Description  

 
19. The proposed project with a total cost of US$259.6 million will be structured as an Investment 
Project Financing (IPF) implemented over a period of six years. It will be funded by (i) two IDA credits for 
a total amount of US$200 million - a regular IDA credit of US$50 million and a Scale Up Facility (SUF) of 
US$150 million, (ii) a GoBF contribution of US$13.0 million, (iii) beneficiary contributions for US$29.4 
million, and (iv) Partner Financial Institutions (PFIs) credit of US$17.2 million. The project has three 
technical components structured around three core activity clusters: raising productivity in irrigated 
production systems; improving competitiveness and linking farmers to markets; and promoting private 
sector-led agribusiness development. A fourth component will cover project coordination activities 
capacity strengthening as well as establishment of a Contingent Emergency Response Component (CERC).  

COMPONENT 1 – ENHANCING AGRICULTURE PRODUCTIVITY (US$108.9 million of which US$97.2 million 

IDA and US$11.7 million GoBF) 

20. Component 1 aims to remove constraints to farm productivity, mainly in irrigated production 
systems. It will have three sub-components: (i) irrigation development, including attendant land-tenure 
arrangements and support to the input supply chain; (ii) agriculture advisory services; and (iii) support to 
producer groups. The project will mainstream gender and youth dimensions in all its activities, giving them 
preferential treatment particularly in project-provided agriculture training and services, as well as funding 

                                                           
9 Agribusiness entrepreneurs are defined as economic operators intervening both at production level as well as downstream of 
production, i.e. post-harvest, storage, processing and marketing including input suppliers and service providers.

of investment initiatives. This will be achieved by targeting economic activities in which women and youth 
predominate.  

21. Sub-Component 1.1: Irrigation infrastructure and land tenure (US$86.7 million of which US$75.0 
million IDA and US$11.7 million GoBF). Sub-Component 1.1 aims at supporting productive land 
development by increasing the provision of irrigation water and securing land tenure on project sites. 
Irrigation infrastructure will focus on both rehabilitation and development of irrigated perimeters. 
Emphasis will be placed on climate-proof design and construction to ensure efficiency and climate 
resilience. Sub Component (SC)1.1 will be implemented in close liaison with the Bank-financed PARIIS 
project (FY17). 

22. Irrigation development and rehabilitation. This activity will consist in rehabilitating and 
developing the irrigation and drainage infrastructure on five selected sites the project area (see annex 2, 
appendix 1), and supporting the attendant collective institutional and organization arrangements. 
Irrigation infrastructure works will cover a total of 4,497 ha over five collective irrigation schemes to be 
either fully developed (2,947 ha) or upgraded/ rehabilitated (1,550 ha), for both smallholders and 
agriculture entrepreneurs10. The project will not finance activities related to construction and/or 
rehabilitation of dams.   

23. Land tenure. The project will support arrangements to ensure proper rights to cultivate for 
farmers benefiting from irrigated land allocation, and due compensation (to be funded by the GoBF) for 
those who will lose their lands or income losses in the process of land reallocation. It will support MAAH’s 
dedicated land tenure services (DGFOMR) at the central level and in the seven communes adjacent to the 
project irrigated perimeters. Secure land tenure will also incentivize the adoption of new technology to 
increase productivity and climate-smart practices to provide adaptation and mitigation co-benefits.  

24. Sub-Component (SC) 1.2: Agriculture advisory services (US$4.1 million IDA). Sub-Component 1.2 
aims to improve the delivery of advisory and outreach services, with a focus on extension activities 
regarding more productive and sustainable agricultural practices under irrigation conditions. This will be 
achieved by providing catalytic support towards strengthening the capacity of MAAH’s services 
(Directorate General for Agricultural Extension, DGPV) and other relevant institutions dedicated to 
delivering demand-driven agri-food-oriented extension and outreach services. In doing so, the project will 
scale up results achieved by the WAAPP project to enable a wider adoption of Good Agriculture Practices 
(GAPs). This Sub-Component will provide funding for the following activities inter alia: (i) preparation of 
specialized extension guides and provision of training regarding different Good Agriculture Practices GAP), 
e.g., the use of the Farmer Field School (FFS) approach, Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) techniques 
(including bio-compost), Integrated Pest Management (IPM), System of Rice Intensification (SRI) and/or 
gender-oriented practices; (ii) capacity building and dissemination of the related knowledge regarding 
production and certification of improved seeds and planting material; (iii) development of an e-extension 
platform, using digital solutions and applications to modernize and increase the outreach of advisory 
services; (iv) training for DGPV staff through participation in specialized forums, provision of scholarships 
for diploma courses in selected fields, organization of exchange trips, etc. SC1.2 will also finance 
investments to support extension services such as office rehabilitation and equipment (including 
computer equipment), technical equipment and vehicles for DGPV and its communal offices in the project 

                                                           
10 Smallholders will be allocated plots of 0.5 or 1.0 ha each for a total of 3,497 ha, and agricultural entrepreneurs tracks of land of at 
least 10 to a maximum of 50 ha each for a total of 1000 ha.  NB. The project will also develop, in the form of individual investment sub-
projects under Component 3 private sites intended for arboriculture, for a total of 1,000 ha under small irrigation systems (pumping, 
Californian, drip, and solar powered irrigation systems that reduce energy use, etc.)

areas. 

25. Sub-Component (SC) 1.3: Support to producer organizations and input supply (US$18.1 million 
IDA). Sub-Component 1.3 has a two-pronged objective: (i) to strengthen and/or facilitate the creation of 
Agricultural Producer Organizations (OPAs), including economic interest groups, and cooperative societies 
of different types, and (ii) to facilitate the supply of inputs required for targeted crops. Objective (i) will 
be achieved through MAAH’s dedicated services (DGFOMR)11, as well as the assistance of specialized non-
government organizations (NGOs) or service providers. SC1.3 will place special emphasis on developing 
Water Users Associations (WUAs) to strengthen water management. Strengthened institutional and 
organizational arrangements will allow farmers to have greater participation in decisions, leading to more 
sustainable water use and more equitable sharing of the benefits. This will also contribute to enhance 
resilience through promoting a stronger sense of ownership, and greater efficiency and accountability, in 
water use and land development. Under objective (ii), input supply to farmers will include the provision 
of the required means of production to develop cropping systems on irrigated land. This will follow the 
technical guidance of extension services received under Sub-Component 1.2. The project will make 
available to smallholder farmers the package of inputs, improved seeds and small implements through 
the current national programs for a period of two years under the same subsidy conditions as those 
granted under these programs.   

COMPONENT 2 – IMPROVING COMPETITIVENESS AND FOSTERING MARKET ACCESS (US$34.6 million of 

which US$33.7 million IDA and US$0.9 million GoBF) 

26. Component 2 aims to improve competitiveness and foster access to markets through three sub-
components aimed at (i) capacity building of MAAH central directorates regarding sanitary and phyto-
sanitary control, development of quality norms and standards, and support to market knowledge; (ii) the 
provision of marketing facilities; and (iii) construction/ rehabilitation of rural road infrastructure. 

27. Sub-Component (SC) 2.1: Sanitary and phyto-sanitary control, development of quality norms 
and standards, and support to market knowledge (US$5.2 million IDA). Sub Component 2.1 will focus, 
firstly, with regard to sanitary and phyto-sanitary control, on the regulatory framework to ensure that 
appropriate food safety regulations and means are in place to enable the country to serve the needs of 
the agriculture domestic and export markets. To that end, it will provide support to MAAH’s dedicated 
services (DGPV), including its decentralized phyto-sanitary control posts in the project area. Capacity 
building will focus on specialized areas such as food safety analysis and control. The project will also 
provide funding for logistical support and equipment of the Laboratory for Agri-food Analysis (LAPA) (e.g. 
for control of aflatoxin in maize, pesticide content in agricultural products, herbicide control, etc.) and for 
the rehabilitation of the two regional laboratories for seed control in the project area. Concerning the 
shea sector, the project will support the Institute for Research in Applied Science and Technology (IRSAT) 
for the definition of semi-industrial technological packages to reduce energy (fuelwood) consumption. 
Secondly, with regard to the promotion of the quality of agricultural products, the project will focus on 
the technical norms and trading labels so that they conform to international standards (HACCP, ISO and 
others).  To this end, it will provide training and technical assistance to MAAH’s dedicated services 
(DGPER). For the shea butter value chain, the support will aim at developing a national standard of 
production to ensure quality consistency along the chain. Thirdly, in terms of market knowledge, the 

                                                           
11 Regarding the shea nut value chain and other carbon-related activities, support to producer organizations (TFK) and biodigester 
compost suppliers will be done through the dedicated services of the Ministry of Environment, Green Economy and Climate Change 
(DGEVCC)

project will finance the collection of market information regarding the project-supported commodities. It 
will support the strengthening of MAAH’s Agricultural Market Information System (SIMA), including data 
collection on specific targeted markets. Information and awareness workshops on SIMA will be organized 
throughout the project area, including radio broadcasts, so that potential users are aware of SIMA 
existence and know how to access it. MAAH’s dedicated services (DGPER), as well as the Network of 
Chambers of Agriculture (RECA) will be supported so that they can contribute to SIMA data collection and 
diffusion efforts.  

28. Sub-Component (SC)2.2: Marketing infrastructure (US$7.2 million IDA). SC2.2 aims to strengthen 
the link between producers, off-takers and processors to ease access to market outlets. The project will 
support marketing and storage infrastructure, essentially the construction/ rehabilitation of sixteen 
purchasing counters (PCs), as well as 117 small storage facilities in strategic areas in the four regions 
covered by the project.  PCs are marketing platforms, the purpose of which is to avoid direct field 
purchases from farmers and reduce asymmetric information that expose producers to buyer pressures. 
PCs will meet the required criteria of relevance, viability, cost-effectiveness, as well as job creation, 
especially for women and youth. Attention will be paid to the management and maintenance of these 
counters in collaboration with the end-users and local authorities (see Annex 2, Appendix 3). 

29. Sub-Component (SC)2.3: Rural tracks and roads (US$22.2 million of which US$21.3 million IDA 
and US$0.9 million GoBF). SC2.3 aims to reinforce the connection of producing areas targeted by the 
project with the supply sources for productive inputs and market outlets for commodities produced. It 
will include the construction and rehabilitation of rural roads and tracks to ensure all-weather access 
throughout the year to all the project-targeted irrigated areas. A total length of about 344 km of tracks 
and road sections have been selected in concert between MAAH and the Ministry of Infrastructure (MI). 
SC2.3 will finance the technical, socio-economic and environmental studies, road works, as well as 
maintenance over a period of two years. The implementation of SC2.3 will be carried out under MI’s 
supervision through its Directorate General of Rural Tracks (DGPR). The execution of road works will be 
entrusted to private civil engineering companies, and/ or projects as part of their interventions in the 
producing areas targeted. Attention will be paid to the planning and maintenance of tracks and roads 
using national norms.  SC2.3 will provide technical assistance and training to DGPR, its decentralized 
structures and local communities involved in the project area as required to oversee the construction and 
maintenance of the project rural roads and tracks. 

COMPONENT 3: PROMOTING PRIVATE SECTOR-LED AGRIBUSINESS DEVELOPMENT (US$89.5 million of 

which US$42.9 million IDA, US$29.4 million beneficiaries and US$17.2 million PFIs) 

30. Private sector development is the major thrust of the project strategy for developing value chain 
activities. Accordingly, Component 3’s objective is to enable the country’s private agriculture and agro-
processing sector to become more competitive on domestic and external markets, by helping producers, 
processors and off-takers/ traders develop and finance their investment initiatives. Component 3’s 
activities will have a two-pronged focus on: (i) the development of business plans; and (ii) the provision 
of investment financing under the project’s Cost-Sharing Facility (CSF) for project-supported crop 
production, value addition and commercialization.  

31. Sub-Component (SC)3.1: Development of business plans (US$4.5 million IDA). The objective of 
this sub-component is to support eligible beneficiaries in developing business plans which can be eligible 
for funding under the project Cost Sharing Facility (CSF). It will assist eligible value chain operators to (i) 
identify potential investment activities aligned with the project’s objectives, (ii) select potential partners

Burkina Faso Agriculture Resilience and Competitiveness Project (P167945) 

 

 

  
 Page 13 of 27  

 

with whom they can establish partnerships; and (iii) develop viable business plans to secure access to 
project funding; these business plans will include the required specifications to conform to the eligibility 
criteria for the CSF, including the fiduciary and safeguards aspects. The above support will be provided 
through technical assistance (TA). The TA providers terms of reference will include organization of 
sensitization campaigns to inform potentially interested operators, support for the development of 
investment sub-projects eligible for CSF funding, training as needed and assistance for the beneficiaries’ 
selection process and subsequent implementation of the selected sub-projects. 

32. Sub-Component (SC)3.2: Private investment financing (US$85.0 million of which US$38.4 million 
IDA, US$29.4 million beneficiaries and US$17.2 million PFIs). This sub-component will address the 
financing constraints of the agribusiness sector by improving access to finance. It will fund a Cost Sharing 
Facility (CSF) to provide partial support to agriculture and agri-business operators in the form of Matching 
Grants (MGs) to finance their investment Sub-Projects (SPs). The MG mechanism will target (i) individual 
smallholder producers, Agriculture Producer Organizations (OPAs), cooperatives, and Small and Medium 
Enterprises (SMEs) that need financing to create, upgrade and/ or modernize their production, storage 
and processing facilities, as well as (ii) all other private sector players and entrepreneurs involved in the 
targeted agriculture value chain (e.g. traders, transporters, equipment manufacturers, service providers, 
compost providers) with similar needs. MGs will be provided under two windows, for micro and medium/ 
large sub-projects respectively, under different terms and conditions with the MG representing between 
30 to 80 percent of eligible costs. PFIs will provide a minimum of 15 to 35 percent of sub-project funding, 
except for micro sub-projects which will not require supplementary PFI funding.  In partnership with the 
DGEVCC, all MG proposals will be assessed through an ex-ante calculation on the carbon impact and the 
most effective projects may be supported to access carbon finance12. Women and youth (18 to 35 years)13, 
will receive special treatment, especially as regard their very small and/ or start-up enterprises; their 
personal contribution requirement to the funding of sub-projects will be lower than for their male and 
adult counterparts. The initial permanent working capital requirements will be eligible for MG funding. 
The funds will be disbursed directly on behalf of the beneficiary from the project account to a dedicated 
account for SP implementation opened with the PFI. The beneficiary will have the fiduciary responsibility 
regarding the use of the funds. The eligibility and selection criteria of the beneficiaries, as well as 
procedures to be followed all along the investment cycle, will be detailed in the specific project 
implementation manual (PIM) of the CSF. Goods to be funded under sub grants will be procured in 
accordance with the provisions of Financing Agreement, the PIM, the Procurement Guidelines and the 
Anti-Corruption Guidelines, and should not include any expenditures on the negative list set forth in the 
ESMF or the IPMP. 

COMPONENT 4: PROJECT COORDINATION, INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY STRENGTHENING AND 

CONTINGENT EMERGENCY RESPONSE COMPONENT (CERC) (US$26.6 million of which US26.2 million IDA 

and US$0.4 million, GoBF) 

33. Component 4 will (i) support project coordination and institutional strengthening of MAAH; and 
(ii) include a CERC.  

34. Sub-Component (SC)4.1: Project coordination and institutional capacity strengthening (US$26.6 

                                                           
12 DGEVCC in currently working on carbon projects regarding (i) soil carbon increase through the use of agroforestry technics and bio-
compost (from biodigesters) and (ii) the decarbonization of the shea butter production chain. This is part of the collaboration with the 
REDD+ Program (P149827) and Biodigester carbon project (P156413). 
13 The MG target for women and youth is 30 percent.

million of which US26.2 million IDA and US$0.4 million GoBF). The Project will be managed by a Project 
Management Unit (PMU), housed within the Coordinating Unit of the Budget Program for Hydro-
Agriculture and Irrigation Development which is one of the six MAAH budget programs. Hence, the PMU 
will be integrated into the MAAH administrative structure as part of the sector-wide approach recently 
adopted by the Government under the budget programs. SC4.1 will fund (i) the establishment and 
operation of the PMU through provision of appropriate staffing and operating resources to take charge 
of project management including resources for fiduciary management, safeguard compliance, Monitoring 
and Evaluation (M&E), knowledge management and communications, and (ii) institutional capacity 
strengthening (training, equipment, office rehabilitation, etc.) for the key MAAH directorates and services, 
including their decentralized services, and the National Council for Food Security (NCFS); this will also 
include construction of an office building to host all projects under the Budget Program for Hydro-
Agriculture and Irrigation Development. To promote consultations at the grassroots, the sub-component 
will also fund a full set of Citizen Engagement activities. The general intervention principle under SC4.1 
will be to harmonize and/or pool resources with other similar externally-funded projects. In this respect, 
the PMU may share staff and operating resources with other units whenever possible to economize 
resources and take advantage of economies of scale14. 

35. Sub-Component (SC)4.2: Contingent Emergency Response Component (CERC) (US$0.0 million). 
Component 4 includes the creation of a project CERC under the oversight of the NCFS at MAAH. The CERC 
will be a mechanism to provide funding for emergencies. It will have a zero initial funding allocation. In 
the event of a crisis, the Government will be able to request the World Bank to reallocate project funds 
to the CERC to cover the costs of the emergency response and recovery. Detailed operational guidelines 
acceptable to the World Bank for implementing the project CERC activities will be prepared during the 
first six months of project implementation. All expenditures under the project’s specific CERC will be in 
accordance with World Bank OP 10 (Investment Project Financing). They will be appraised and reviewed 
in order to be acceptable to the World Bank before any disbursement is made. Disbursements will be 
made against an approved list of goods, works and services, required to support crisis mitigation, 
response, recovery and re-construction. 
 
Project Beneficiaries 
 

36. The project is expected to benefit directly and indirectly all economic agents in the project areas 
operating along the targeted value chains from production to market, including at the processing, storage, 
transport and trading stages. The total number of project beneficiaries is estimated in the order of 150,000 
individuals (see Annex 2, Appendix 4). 

37. Direct project beneficiaries are first and foremost all the smallholder crop farmers, processors, 
traders and marketers who will be involved in project-supported activities at farm-gate level and 
downstream of production. These include prominently the smallholders and entrepreneurs who will 
benefit from irrigation development, extension and subsidy for the new technology packages, and the 
project matching grants as part of project financing windows. Other direct beneficiaries will include: (i) 
the staff of MAAH agricultural extension support services and other services directly targeted by project 
activities who will receive technical support and training, and (ii) the off-takers and transporters who will 

                                                           
14 A collaboration with DGEVCC is expected for the screening of the carbon impact of the matching grants as well as the valorization of 
the project activities on the carbon market whenever they fit under one of the existing or future carbon projects developed in the 
country.

use the purchasing counters, and tracks and roads. The project will mainstream gender and youth 
dimensions in all its activities, giving them preferential treatment particularly in project-provided 
agriculture training and services, as well as funding of investment initiatives. This will be achieved by 
targeting economic activities in which women and youth predominate. These include small-scale agro-
processing activities such as mango drying, and activities in value chains dominated by women such as 
shea nut collection and processing. Youth will be targeted for any project activities focused on training to 
upgrade their skills, and activities generating jobs such as high labor intensity methods.  

38. Indirect project beneficiaries include all stakeholders who will benefit from project spillover 
effects both at national and local level, i.e., (i) at farmgate level regarding production: other crop farmers 
neither directly involved in project-supported irrigation perimeters, nor targeted by the project extension 
activities being outside the production basins; they will benefit particularly from project spillover effects 
regarding improved crop management, higher quality crop inputs and services, better defined market 
norms and standards and improved financing conditions as a result of the project; (ii) at post-harvest and 
market level: buyers and processors, value chain service providers, including private inputs providers 
(seeds, fertilizers, feed, equipment suppliers) who will benefit from overall increased supply of 
commodities produced and traded due to better roads and tracks; and (iii) on the consumption side: 
domestic consumers in Burkina Faso who will benefit from increased quantity of food and attendant 
nutritional benefits at household level. 
 

E. Implementation 
 

Institutional and Implementation Arrangements  
. 

39. The MAAH will have overall responsibility for project implementation, including management of 
environmental and social risks; it will liaise closely with the MI for implementation of rural tracks and roads 
activities, MEEVCC for the shea nut value chain development and with the Ministry in charge of Commerce, 
Industry and Handicraft (MCIA) for private sector development and agro-processing. The project’s governance 
structure will be modeled after the PARIIS project arrangements, including a Review Committee15 (RC) and a 
Project Management Unit (PMU) at the central level as well as three regional units based at MAAH’s regional 
offices and one regional unit hosted by AMVS. The RC will meet at regular intervals, at least once a year. It will be 
chaired by MAAH’s Secretary General and serve as guidance body. It will approve the Annual Work Plans and 
Budgets and progress reports. The PMU, based in Ouagadougou, will be fully mainstreamed into MAAH’s structure 
as advocated by authorities alongside other national project implementation units. It will come under MAAH’s 
Budget Program for Hydro-Agriculture and Irrigation Development which is one of the six MAAH budget programs.  

40. Details regarding PReCA’s organizational arrangements are presented in Annex 1. The PMU will sign 
partnerships or technical agreements with MAAH’s and other ministries’ directorates to carry out project activities 
within their respective mandates. The National Coordinator of the project will be de facto the head of Budget 
Program for Hydro-Agriculture and Irrigation Development as per the new decree organizing the budget 
programs16.. The National Coordinator will delegate the management function of the project to a Project Manager 

                                                           
15 The RC will include representatives of the MAAH (General Secretary-SG, Cabinet, General Directorate of Studies and Sector Statistics-
DGESS, DGPV, DGFOMR, DGPER); the Ministry of Economy and Finance (DGCOOP, DGEP, DGB); National Agriculture Chamber; Coordinators 
of projects and programs in the agriculture sector; representatives of financing partners, DCMEF/MAAH, DAF/MAAH, DGEVCC/MEEVCC  
and DMP/MAAH will also be invited to participate as observers.

who might be competitively recruited or appointed following the World Bank non-objection. His/her signature 
will be required to commit project financing. S/he will be assisted by a team of high caliber who might be 
competitively recruited or appointed, covering technical, fiduciary, social and environmental safeguard functions 
deemed critical for proper project implementation and management. As needed, some staff may be shared with 
other projects under the budget program. 

41. MAAH has been responsible over the past decade, and is still responsible currently, for implementing 
several important World Bank-funded projects. It has acquired capacity to support the different PMUs from 
technical, financial management, safeguards and M&E viewpoints. Similarly, the other ministries which will be 
involved have enough capacity to implement project activities. This is the case of MI which has managed several 
externally-funded projects related to road infrastructure. Detailed implementation arrangements will be worked 
out as part of the PIM to ensure that MAAH and other ministries maintain enough implementation capacity, 
promote complementarity and avoid overlap between the different projects under their watch. The PIM will 
compile all procedures for PReCA’s operational implementation, encompassing the administrative, fiduciary, 
M&E, procurement and social and environmental safeguards procedures. It will include detailed TORs for all PMU 
staff. Drawing on the experience of other World Bank-financed projects, specific sections of the PIM will be 
prepared for (i) the Cost Sharing Facility (CSF) and (ii) the Contingent Emergency Response Component (CERC). 

 
    
F. Project location and Salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 
 

Four administrative regions have been selected for project implementation in the Western part of the 
country: Douna in Léraba province, Banzon in Kénédougou Province), Dourou in Passoré province and Bissan 
and Dangoumana Mouhoun in Mouhoun province.

SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY 

 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

The operation will finance the rehabilitation and 
development of irrigated perimeters. It is also 
expected the construction or rehabilitation of all-
weather rural roads to fully opening up throughout 
the year all the project-targeted producing basins. In 
addition, the project will fund the construction of 



 

The World Bank  
Burkina Faso Agriculture Resilience and Competitiveness Project (P167945) 

 

 

  
 Page 17 of 27  

 

market facilities of public interest at national and/ or 
regional level. Furthermore, the Banzon's irrigation 
scheme will be rehabilitated. Consequently, an 
Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) 
was developed for that irrigated perimeter and an 
Environmental and Social Management 
Framework(ESMF) was produced for investments 
that detailed studies are not available and locations 
unknown to date. Thereafter, both instruments were 
reviewed, consulted upon and disclosed publicly. 
The ESIA was disclosed in Burkina Faso on April 4 
and at the World bank website on April 5, 2019 
while the ESMF was disclosed in Burkina on March 7 
and at the bank's website on March 27, 2019. 

Performance Standards for Private Sector 
Activities OP/BP 4.03 

No This policy is not triggered by the project. 

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 Yes 

Irrigation schemes are potentially known for hosting 
natural habitats, more specifically aquatic species 
habitats. However, it is not anticipated that planned 
investments will impact negatively natural 
habitats.This policy is  triggered to draw the 
attention of the Project Management Unit (PMU) 
when civil works are going to be undertaken in 
irrigation schemes areas. The ESMF prepared in line 
with the OP4.01  includes a section for a proper 
management of Natural habitats that might be 
located irrigation schemes areas. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No 

This policy is not triggered since the Project will not 
affect forests nor forest-dependent communities, 
and the Project will also not involve or support 
changes in the management of forests. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

The project intends to support agricultural 
intensification. That may lead the producers to the 
use of chemical products such as pesticides. To 
anticipate and prevent any wrong use of pesticides 
with their adverse impacts on environment and 
communities, an Integrated Pest Management Plan 
(IPMP) was developed as a separate instrument. Like 
the ESMF, this safeguard tool once prepared, was 
reviewed, consulted upon and disclosed in Burkina 
Faso on March 7 and at the World bank website on 
March 27, 2019. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 Yes 
In order to anticipate and to be sure that all the 
precautions have been taken to protect and 
safeguard physical cultural resources, a section 



 

The World Bank  
Burkina Faso Agriculture Resilience and Competitiveness Project (P167945) 

 

 

  
 Page 18 of 27  

 

addressing these concerns has been included in the 
ESMF. This section will show how to handle chance 
finds of cultural assets within the project area. This, 
because activities related to the construction and 
rehabilitation of irrigated perimeters, feeder roads, 
markets facilities and other infrastructure works will 
induce excavations with potential discoveries of 
physical cultural resources. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 No 
There are no Indigenous People as defined by the 
policy in Burkina 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

The project will finance activities that could induce 
potential adverse social impacts that may lead to 
land acquisition and/or restrictions on access to 
resources and sources of income or livelihoods: 
rehabilitation and development of irrigated 
perimeters, construction or rehabilitation of all-
weather rural roads to fully opening up throughout 
the year all the project-targeted producing basins, 
construction of market facilities of public interest at 
national and/ or regional level. Furthermore, the 
Banzon's irrigation scheme will be rehabilitated. 
Consequently, a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) was 
developed for that irrigated perimeter and 
Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) was produced 
for investments whose detailed studies are not 
available and locations unknown to date. Thereafter, 
both instruments were reviewed, consulted upon 
and disclosed publicly. The RPF was disclosed in 
Burkina on March 22 and at the Bank's website on 
March 27, 2019. As for the RAP, it was disclosed in-
country and at the bank's website on April 5, 2019.  

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 Yes 

The policy is triggered because the project will 
intervene in irrigation schemes that rely on existing 
dams. The project will not have direct intervention 
on dams. The situation of existing dams is described 
as follows: 
 
Dourou dam: This dam is located upstream of 
Dourou irrigation scheme and has a capacity of 83 
Hm3 and a 10.5 m height. A review of Dourou dam 
safety conditions was commissioned by the Ministry 
of Agriculture and financed by the WBG project 
PARIIS in 2017. The report was approved by the 
Ministry and the World Bank in February 2017.  The 
remedial works related to the structural stability of 



 

The World Bank  
Burkina Faso Agriculture Resilience and Competitiveness Project (P167945) 

 

 

  
 Page 19 of 27  

 

the dam identified in this study were carried out in 
2018 under the State budget as evidenced during a 
WBG mission in November 2018. Further studies 
shall be carried out to assess the suitable  option for 
increasing the discharge capacities of the spillways. 
The hydrological risk has been identified as one of 
the most critical dam safety risks by the independent 
dam safety assessment in 2017. 
 
Mouhoun / Léry dam: Regarding the Sourou Valley 
where the project will finance the construction of 
Dangoumana and Bissan schemes, the 
Mouhoun/Léry dam (580 Hm3 / 8 m) was 
rehabilitated in 2014 through the project “Projet de 
Développement de l ’Agriculture (PDA)” financed by 
the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) with 
complementary works financed by the Government 
in 2017 and 2019. The MCA project also financed, in 
2014, a review of the Operation and Maintenance of 
the Mouhoun /Léry dam and recommended 
procedures for the O&M during the different 
seasons and in case of extreme events (floods); 
these recommendations are currently followed by 
the entity in charge of the dam operation, the 
Mouhoun Water Agency (Agence de l’Eau du 
Mouhoun). The O&M Plan should be updated along 
with a comprehensive dam safety assessment  taking 
into account the reservoir operation of the recently 
constructed  Samendéni dam in the upstream of the 
river 
 
Samendéni dam: Two hundred kilometers upstream 
Mouhoun/Léry dam, on the Mouhoun river, the 
Government of Burkina Faso has built in 2017 
another large dam, with a capacity of 1,050 Hm3 and 
a height of 23.9 m. The reservoir has been filled for 
the first time in 2018. The overall impacts of this 
dam on the WBG investments in Bissan and 
Dangoumana would be positive: (i) the dam will 
contribute to better control flood during the rainy 
season which will reduce the risks downstream and; 
(ii) the Samendéni dam will increase the flow on the 
dry season, which will increase the water availability 
for irrigation in the Sourou Valley. The independent 
dam safety assessment and preparation of dam 
safety plans; i.e.  O&M Plan covering  



 

The World Bank  
Burkina Faso Agriculture Resilience and Competitiveness Project (P167945) 

 

 

  
 Page 20 of 27  

 

Instrumentation Plan, and Emergency Preparedness 
Plans, shall be undertaken in an expeditious manner.  
 
During project implementation, dam safety risk 
assessments and dam safety plans (including O&M 
plans, Instrumentation plans and Emergency 
Preparedness Plans) will be carried out as well as 
periodic dam’s safety inspections for the Dourou 
dam, the Mouhoun/Léry dam and the Samendéni 
dam and have been included in the Financing 
Agreement as Disbursement Conditions before the 
start of irrigation schemes’s construction. If some 
additional remedial works are identified for the 
dams, the Government will finance such 
complementary remedial works or safety-related 
measures. 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

Yes 

The proposed project finances the rehabilitation and 
development of irrigation schemes that will draw on 
an international waterway and its tributaries. In 
accordance with the policy, riparian countries and 
the Volta Basin Authority were notified in April 2019. 
The Volta Basin authorities and riparian countries 
expressed their no-objection to the project. 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No 
The project coverage is not located in a Disputed 
Area. 

 
 

KEY SAFEGUARD POLICY ISSUES AND THEIR MANAGEMENT 

 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential 
large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
The operation will finance the rehabilitation and development of irrigation schemes. It is also expected the 
construction or rehabilitation of all-weather rural roads to fully opening up throughout the year all the project-
targeted producing basins. In addition, the project will fund the construction of market facilities of public interest at 
national and/ or regional level. Some of these infrastructures may have major environmental and social impacts. 
Irrigation investments may have adverse but limited environmental impacts on water resources, for the most part, 
and will require the resettlement of some local communities. The main environmental safeguards issues for the 
project relate to water pollution, construction waste management, water abstraction and changes to water outflows 
from the rivers and associated impacts on downstream human needs and aquatic habitats, and biodiversity. 
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area: 
Irrigation investments in the project area may have a medium to long term impact on water cumulative off-takes from 
the waterways. The long-term social impact is also of importance, as agricultural development may lead to intense 



 

The World Bank  
Burkina Faso Agriculture Resilience and Competitiveness Project (P167945) 

 

 

  
 Page 21 of 27  

 

migration within the Project intervention area. Among the more beneficial potential indirect long-term impacts are 
the use of more water-saving irrigation systems and technologies. This will be further supported by sustained dialogue 
on water management in the project area and the proposed measures aimed at reducing water consumption for 
irrigation. This will include different measures and incentives to facilitate the adoption of water saving techniques, as 
well as a more transparent planning of public and private investments in the coming years. Lastly, in compliance with 
the triggering of OP7.50, a notification letter was sent to each of the other five riparian countries and the Volta Basin 
Authority (VBA).  The countries and the VBA expressed their no-objection to the project 
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts. 
The rehabilitation of the irrigated perimeters and of the access roads are crucial to the achievement of the project 
objectives and they will be done with minimal effect to the environment and all precautionary measures will be taken 
to avoid causing any irreversible damage to the environment. 
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower 
capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The project is rated as Environmental Assessment Category “A”, requiring a full environmental assessment. The 
following environmental safeguard policies are triggered: Environmental Assessment (OP/ BP 4.01); Natural habitats 
(OP/ BP.04); Dam Safety (OP/ BP 4.37); Pest Management (OP 4.09); Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12); Physical 
Cultural Resources (OP/ BP4.11) and Projects on International Waterways (OP/ BP 7.50). 
 
The project has adopted a framework approach to deal with environmental matters. This is justified since exact 
locations for a substantial number of program activities, particularly those of the sub-projects, which may have 
environmental potential adverse impact, have not yet been determined with certainty. Therefore, an Environmental 
and Social Management Framework (ESMF) has been prepared in line with OP/BP4.01. This ESMF includes specific 
chapters on Natural Habitats and Physical Cultural Resources in compliance with OP4.04, OP4.37 and OP/BP4.11 
respectively. With respect to Pest Management in line with the OP4.09 triggering, a Pest Management Plan has been 
developed as a stand-alone document. In addition to the above-mentioned documents, the Borrower has prepared an 
Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) for developing and expanding the Banzon irrigation scheme as 
part of project investments. Lastly, with the aim of being in full compliance with the triggering of OP7.50, a notification 
letter was sent to each of the five other members countries of Volta Authority Basin that replied positively, granting 
their agreement for the project approval. 
 
The ESMF lays out procedures for screening and mitigating impacts from construction and operation of the irrigation 
schemes, and includes the following: (a) checklists of potential environmental and social impacts and their sources; (b) 
procedures for participatory screening of proposed sites and activities and the environmental and social 
considerations; (c) procedures for assessing potential environmental and social impacts of the planned project 
activities; (d) institutional arrangements for mitigating, preventing, and managing the identified impacts; (e) typical 
environmental management planning process for addressing negative externalities in the course of project 
implementation; (f) a system for monitoring the implementation of mitigation measures; and (g) recommended 
capacity building measures for environmental planning and monitoring of project activities.  
 
The PMP encourages the use of organic fertilizers and biological technics to fight against agriculture predators. In 
addition to that, it sets up guidance and guidelines with the aim to protect population health and environment 
integrity in promoting best practices in the case of use of chemical products. 
 
The RPF document outlines the principles and procedures for resettlement and or compensation of subproject-



 

The World Bank  
Burkina Faso Agriculture Resilience and Competitiveness Project (P167945) 

 

 

  
 Page 22 of 27  

 

affected people, and establishes standards for identifying, assessing and mitigating negative impacts of program 
supported activities. In addition, the RPF will guide the preparation and implementation of RAPs for each individual 
sub project that triggers the involuntary resettlement policy. Specific ESIAs and RAPs will be prepared for relevant 
activities before project implementation along with Environmental and Social Management Plans (ESMPs). The ESIAs 
will provide mitigation measures for all the potential impacts as a result of the triggering of the above-mentioned 
safeguard policies. 
 
In addition to these above mentioned 03 documents, the borrower has also prepared 01 ESIA and 01 RAP for Banzon’s 
irrigation scheme that was clearly identified as being part of futures investments. 
 
All of these 05 safeguard instruments have been reviewed by the banks’ specialists, consulted upon and disclosed in 
Burkina Faso and at the Bank’s website as follows. 
 
-ESMF, disclosed in Burkina Faso on March 7 and at the World bank website, on March 27, 2019.   
-PMP disclosed in Burkina Faso, on March 7 and at the World bank website on March 27, 2019.  
-RPF disclosed in Burkina Faso, on March 22 and at the World bank website on March 27, 2019.    
-ESIA disclosed in Burkina Faso on April 4, and at the World bank website, on April 5, 2019.   
-RAP disclosed in Burkina Faso and at the World bank website on April 5, 2019.   
 
The Project Management Unit (PMU) carry out the screening for all investments will determine the actions necessary 
to comply with environmental and social safeguard policies and national legislation. It will determine whether an ESIA 
and/or RAP, or both, will be required and will prepare appropriate safeguards instruments for each of the sub-
projects.  The PMU will commission the preparation of detailed ESIAs and RAPs to be carried out by independent 
consultants, based on terms of reference (TORs) to be reviewed by BUNEE and the Bank. The PMU will be responsible 
not only for the overall implementation of the PMP, ESMF, RPF and specific safeguard instruments required for 
specific Project activities (i.e. ESIAs and/or RAPs), but also for the internal monitoring of proposed mitigation 
measures. All site-specific safeguard instruments will be submitted to BUNEE for decision before submission to the 
Bank for review, clearance and disclosure in-country and on the Bank’s website. 
 
Responsibility and oversight of the Project’s overall compliance with national and Bank safeguard policies will be 
devolved to the environmental Safeguards Specialist and social Safeguards specialists within the PMU, as the main 
persons in charge of project implementation and monitoring of safeguard aspects. They will be working in close 
collaboration with BUNEE. BUNEE will not only conduct periodic monitoring of project’s compliance with proposed 
mitigation of changes, but also changes in environmental resources (i.e., water and soil quality, flora and fauna, vector 
ecology, soil erosion etc.) from the baseline. 
 
Further, all civil works, for developing or expanding irrigation schemes; construction and rehabilitation activities of 
other types of infrastructure, will be contingent on broad-based and sustained consultation with local communities in 
project’s intervention area. Mitigation measures for identified environmental and social impacts, including avoiding or 
sparing cultural and historical resources and other environmental clauses, will be properly implemented by 
contractors and sub-contractors, as specified in the safeguard instruments and bidding documents. Selected 
contractors and their Resident Engineering Teams will be required, each, to hire an environmental and social experts 
with strong skills in Occupational Health and Safety issues for the environmental specialist and Labor influx and 
Gender Based Violence (GBV) for the social specialist, whose roles are to ensure specific Environmental, Safety, Health 
and Social clauses are fully and adequately implemented and reported on. 
 



 

The World Bank  
Burkina Faso Agriculture Resilience and Competitiveness Project (P167945) 

 

 

  
 Page 23 of 27  

 

The BUNEE will be responsible for ensuring the Project activities are implemented in accordance with national laws 
while the World Bank’s specialists will make sure that all investments that may have potential adverse impacts are in 
full compliance with environmental and social safeguard policies triggered by the project. 
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, 
with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
The preparation of the safeguard documents (i.e. ESMF, PMP, RPF, ESIA and RAP) followed a broad-based and in-
depth consultation approach with and interviews of relevant stakeholder groups in the public and private sectors and 
civil society. These consultations include Producer Organizations, particularly those within or in the vicinity of the 
Project intervention area, key Ministries and Government agencies, in particular Ministries of Agriculture, Water 
resources, Environment, Health, the Plant Protection Agency, pesticides wholesalers and retailers; BUNEE, the 
national agency in charge of review and enforcement of environmental legislation and regulations; health care 
personnel and NGOs.  
 
While local populations were enthusiastic about and confirmed their interest in the proposed investments, they 
nonetheless raised a few issues that prevail in current exploitation and management practices in the project area. 
Producers and local Government representatives have requested to be fully involved in the design and 
implementation of land allocation process; fostering marketing and commercialization of agricultural produce 
domestically, as well as in the sub-region; Fostering a dynamic framework for dialogue and consensus building 
between crop producers and livestock producers, strengthened by binding laws and regulations designed to 
avoid/minimize conflicts between them; concerted efforts and synergy among sectoral agencies for environmental 
sustainability in the project intervention area. In particular, participants wished close involvement of the forestry and 
nature conservation departments in the project implementation, in order to minimize deforestation, river banks 
degradation; proliferation of water borne diseases; existence of prohibited pesticides, inadequate storage and misuse 
of pesticides; lack of opportunities of women in productive agriculture. These concerns have all been reflected in the 
safeguards documents and appropriate recommendations have been formulated.

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 

 
1. India continues to be one of the world’s fastest-growing large economies and has experienced a substantial 
decline in poverty. The Indian economy’s annual growth rate grew from 5.5 per cent in 2012-13 to 8 per cent in 2015-
16, supported by robust private consumption, a resilient services sector, and some revival in industrial activity. In recent 
times, temporary disruptions from demonetization and uncertainty surrounding GST slowed India’s economic 
momentum; real GDP growth declined to 7.1 per cent in 2016-17 and further to 6.5 per cent in 2017-18. Private 
investments have remained subdued. Economic activity is expected to stabilise in 2018-19 and growth will resume 
gradual acceleration in the near term. Since the 2000s, India has made remarkable progress in reducing absolute poverty, 
declining sharply from 38.9 to 21.6 per cent at the international poverty line (US$1.90 PPP/day) between 2004 and 2011. 
With over a 100 million people escaping poverty, the pace of poverty reduction in India exceeded that of the developing 
world as well as that of Middle-Income Countries (MICs) in this period. High economic growth, a rapid rise in rural wages, 
greater rural-urban integration and increase in non-farm activity, especially construction, were the key drivers of poverty 
reduction. Since 2011, robust economic growth may have aided further reduction in poverty. However, trends in the 
construction sector and rural wages suggest that the pace of poverty reduction may have moderated.  

 
2. Agriculture plays a vital role in India’s economy and is central to policies aimed at alleviating poverty. 
Increasingly, the potential role of the sector to expand growth, create jobs and support the ongoing rural-urban 
transformation is becoming evident. More than 54 per cent of the population is engaged in agriculture and allied 
activities (census 2011), and the sector contributed 17.1 per cent to the country’s Gross Value Added (GVA) for the year 
2017-18 (at current prices). As expected in a fast-growing economy, there has been a continuous decline in the share of 
agriculture and allied Sectors in the GVA from 18.6 per cent in 2013-14 to 17.4 per cent in 2016-17. The annual agriculture 
growth rate was around 3-3.5 per cent in the 1990s and 2000s and dropped 3below 2 per cent per annum during 2013-
15, due to low productivity, growing water and land scarcity, rising labour costs, and declining commodity prices. This

has led to an agrarian crisis with a growing emphasis on improving the ecological sustainability of the resource base and 
the socio-economic potential of the sector to increase farmer welfare and rural growth opportunities1. 

 
3. Rapid urbanisation in India is driving change in the agriculture value chain, deepening linkages between urban 
food systems and producers. This urbanisation leads to (i) an increased uptake of agricultural produce from rural to 
urban areas; (ii) changes in the farm production to reflect the food marketed and consumed; and (iii) larger and changing 
role of food supply chains in meeting urban food needs2. However, the current urban food system is in disarray with 
limited or no focus on food safety, food security to urban poor and multiplicity of authorities handling food related issues. 
 
4. Over the years India has developed export competitiveness in certain specialised products, making it the 
world’s 10th largest agriculture exporter.  Leading exports consisted of basmati rice, the meat of bovine animals, marine 
products, cotton, and sugar. However, India’s agriculture export basket accounts for only about 2 per cent of world trade. 
and the share of India’s high value and value-added agriculture produce in its agriculture export basket is less than 15 
per cent compared to 25 per cent in the US and 49 per cent in China.  This low share and low value are contributed mainly 
by (i) inconsistent policies in the areas of farm production, support prices and R&D (all focused on food security); (ii) poor 
inland transportation, exit point infrastructure; and (iii) export restrictions which results in uncertainty among the 
stakeholders. 

 
Sectoral and Institutional Context 

 
5. Maharashtra has a high agricultural growth rate, agricultural transformation toward higher value crops is 
underway, and the state is relatively integrated into global commodity markets.Agriculture has grown at an annual 
average of 6.4 per cent from 2004-05 to 2011-12, and the area under cultivation for cereals has declined since 2000, 
reflecting a shift from food grains towards cash crops. Food grains (rice, wheat, and millets, excluding maize) account for 
about 25 per cent of the gross cropped area, contributing only 7. 7 per cent of agricultural GDP3.  Since 2000, with the 
upsurge in the production of high-value crops, the state has emerged as one of the country’s largest producers and 
exporter of fruits, vegetables, pulses, cotton, and soybean. Many of these changes in the sector have led to positive 
developments because production is labour intensive (e.g., horticulture and floriculture), climate resilient (pulse-based 
cropping systems increase resilience, e.g. pigeon pea intercropping leads to higher soil carbon sequestration than 
monocrop system), and responds to market needs, both domestically and globally.  The food processing industry is 
dynamic in the state with increasing value addition, and it employs approximately 240,000 workers, about 15 per cent of 
the total formal sector employment. However, agriculture growth and structural transformation are not spread evenly 
across the state with some areas, notably the north and east, lagging behind.  Likewise, around 57 per cent of all industries 
are concentrated in only three districts4.  
 
6.  Small and marginal farmers5 dominate Maharashtra's agriculture and commodity downturns significantly 
impact them as the state’s agriculture is diversified and relatively integrated with the global value chains. Commodities 
like soybean, cotton, and sugar (covering 44 per cent of the cropped area in Maharashtra) are strongly influenced by 
global price movements. Commodities with little footprint outside India are mainly influenced by trade policies. For 
example, over the past few years, the price of pulses (where pulses cover about 20 percent of the total cropped area in

Maharashtra), while influenced by domestic consumption, were largely affected by the inconsistent trade policies of 
India. This is reflected in periodic farm distress in sectors linked to domestic and global markets, with broad shifts in the 
global prices of commodities such as pulses, soybean, sugar and milk leading to farmers not even being able to cover the 
cost of production in many cases. 
 
7. In response to these emerging production and market-related challenges, the Government of India (GOI) and 
Government of Maharashtra (GOM) have launched a number of programs, policies, and reform initiatives under the 
overarching vision of “Doubling Farmer’s Income by 2022”. New initiatives to address the production risks include a 
crop insurance scheme with enhanced coverage and use of technology; and a dedicated long-term irrigation fund with 
an initial tranche of US$3 billion. Additionally, to liberalise the regulated agriculture market, the GOI launched, and GOM 
adopted, second-generation marketing reforms, including the move towards integrating the country into a unified 
national market; and 100 per cent Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is allowed to enhance investments in agribusiness/food 
processing sectors. A new agricultural export policy is in the final stages of approval and proposes doing away with 
arbitrary export quotas, and price restrictions.  Through this policy, India is targeting a doubling of agriculture exports to 
4.00 per cent (US$ 60 billion) by 2022.  
 
8. Women face a number of additional barriers to the transition to high value agriculture (HVA) and agribusiness. 
While India’s farmers are increasingly likely to be women, they are less able to transition to HVA than men, and their 
ownership of agricultural assets has stagnated. Unlike men who, in addition to production, also serve as the actors in the 
upper levels of the value chains, including intermediaries or village-level traders and processors, wholesalers, retailers, 
or exporters, women are generally concentrated at the lower levels of the value chains. This division of labour is mostly 
a reflection of social and cultural norms, which discourage women to travel by themselves or own land. These factors 
curtail women’s access to resources and services, including credit, training, extension, inputs, and trading and marketing 
networks. Women do not have collateral to apply for loan or opportunities to participate in extension training because 
selection for these opportunities is often based on land ownership titles or other formal records. More than 2 million 
poor women have been mobilised into Self Help Groups (SHGs) and federated organisations in the state.    These SHGs 
and federated organisations can serve as an important pillar to substantially enhance inclusion of rural poor women into 
agribusiness transformation and related entrepreneurship opportunities.   
 
9. The state also faces significant adverse risks from climate change:   As part of the National Action Plan on Climate 
Change (NAPCC), the Government of Maharashtra has formulated the Maharashtra State Adaptation Action Plan on 
Climate Change (MSAAPCC) by commissioning a comprehensive vulnerability assessment study. The MSAAPCC climate 
modelling results for 2030, 2050 and 2070, show that temperature and rainfall are projected to increase across the state, 
with important regional variations resulting in potentially significant adverse impacts on agriculture performance. 
Impacts will be further aggravated by the projected increase in the frequency of extreme climate events (droughts, 
hailstorms, floods, delays in the onset of monsoons, higher rainfall intensity) already experienced in the state over recent 
past, as illustrated by the three severe droughts that hit the state over the past five years. Given these uncertain shifts in 
weather and climatic events, the small and marginal farmers are disproportionately exposed to risk and farm distress. 
 
10. With the support of the World Bank, Maharashtra has recently rolled out four programs, to enhance the climate 
resiliency of the state’s agriculture: the Maharashtra Project on Climate Resilient Agriculture, and three national level 
programs that have significant presence in the state: the National Dairy Support Project (P107648), the National 
Groundwater Management Improvement Program (P158119) and the proposed Agriculture Risk Resilience Insurance 
Access Project (P165923). Their focus is on enhancing climate resilience of farmers through promoting adoption of 
climate-resilient agricultural technologies, irrigation and production risk management. The proposed project will seek to 
complement and leverage these Bank financed projects/programs and other thematically related on-going/pipeline

projects and initiatives both nationally and in the state viz., National Rural Economic Transformation Project (P104164), 
the proposed Food Processing and Value Addition Pilot Program (P167559). 
 
Relationship to CPF 

 
11. The project advances two focus areas of the India CPF of promoting more resource efficient growth and enhancing 
competitiveness and creating jobs. Specifically, the project will support the following CPF goals: 

 
12. Objective 1.1: Promote more resource-efficient, inclusive, and diversified growth in the rural sector. The project 
closely aligns to the CPF sectoral goal of supporting Government of India (GOI) priorities of agricultural transformation 
and doubling farmer incomes by 2022. The project seeks to undertake a range of interventions to enhance market access, 
competitiveness and resilience to market shocks of farmers and value chain actors in the state of Maharashtra. The 
project will seek to generate jobs in agribusiness related areas including input supply, provision of technical services and 
food processing. The project will also explicitly target and develop mechanisms for inclusion of women at all level of 
agricultural transformation, from diversification to higher value crops, to access to higher level technical services, and 
access to a broader range of markets. This will promote inclusivity and diversification of the rural growth. With its strategy 
to align with complimentary investments under other projects and schemes, the project will also advance resource 
efficient growth and build climate resilience of farmers. 

 
13. Objective 2.1: Improve the business environment and select firm capabilities. The project will support the GOM’s 
efforts to develop a more favourable regulatory environment for private investment in agribusiness related areas, 
promote private sector investments and enhance the competitiveness of the agricultural sector. This will include support 
for the improved implementation of reforms already undertaken; setting up of institutional structures for consultative 
planning and capacity building of identified value chains and growth clusters, and provision of technical services to 
agribusiness enterprises.  .  

 
C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  

 
14. The project development objective is to support the development of inclusive and competitive agriculture value 
chains6, focusing on small holder farmers and agri-entrepreneurs in Maharashtra.     
 
B. Key Results 

a) Increased access to new and organised markets (gender disaggregated, with a target for increased access for 
women producers/value chain participants); (measured by increase in the value of marketed output at the 
beneficiary level); 

b) Beneficiaries of job-focused interventions (CRI) (gender disaggregated); (measured by the number of beneficiaries 
reached by training, employment in processing, entrepreneurial development and other interventions that 
contribute to the jobs agenda); and 

c) Farmers reached with agricultural assets or services (CRI) (gender disaggregated). 
 
15. Project beneficiaries include producers, community-based organisations (viz., SHG federations, Farmer Producer 
Organisations, and Primary Agriculture Credit Cooperative Societies), agri enterprises and other value chain participants, 
including individuals where relevant. 
 
D. Concept Description 

                                            
6 Competitive value chains are defined as those providing project beneficiaries with access to services, markets, and jobs.

16. The proposed project will strengthen and speed up ongoing agricultural systems transformation in the state of 
Maharashtra. The project will support the state in strengthening the continuing market-driven transition, with an 
expanded private sector role in the production, processing, and value addition, commercialisation of crops, and livestock 
products. With a substantial urban population – the highest in the country; relatively high per capita incomes – third 
highest in the country; and the highest industrialisation level amongst states, Maharashtra is well placed for such 
agricultural sector transformation. The proposed project will support the following pillars of agriculture and rural 
transformation in the state:  

 
(a) Build state capacity for evidence-based agribusiness reforms. The state has undertaken many agriculture market 

reforms and plans to do more to address market-distorting interventions and bottlenecks for private sector activity.   
The project will seek to build capacity of the state to inform on how reform issues are debated, decided, implemented 
and evaluated; and develop institutional mechanisms for coordination with the private sector.  

(b) Expand market access. Constraints to producers and entrepreneurs accessing emerging domestic and export markets 
include lack of access to technical services relating to food safety and quality; weak information on market 
opportunities and requirements; and inability to invest in market development activities.  The project will seek to 
improve access of producers and entrepreneurs to a range of technical and business development services to 
enhance competitiveness through food safety and quality; new technologies; and skills training. International 
experience shows that accessing new markets requires longer-term strategic actions including identifying 
opportunity based on local competitive advantages and supply-demand projections; and support for firms and 
entrepreneurs to undertake market development. The project will support a range of such activities including: 
identifying opportunity commodities and value chains for interventions; scaling up production and processing of 
identified commodities; enhancing access to timely market information and intelligence; and supporting producer 
and enterprise associations to undertake market access activities.  

(c) Strengthen risk mitigation measures. The project will support strengthening risk mitigation measures including 
building the capacity of the state to respond to commodity-price fluctuations and agriculture sector crises; 
developing access to timely information on markets and productions trends; and enhancing access of producers to 
financing and hedging instruments. Additionally, for building the climate resiliency and resource growth, the project 
will align with complimentary investments under other projects and schemes. 

 
17. In addressing these constraints, the project will support  a number of actions for leveraging additional resources 
by (i) improving the policy and regulatory environment for private sector investments in the agricultural sector; (ii) using 
public financing to enhance private sector incentives and to reduce transaction costs and risks  ; (iii) forging innovative 
partnerships for leveraging funding, including Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funding through the Village Social 
Transformation Foundation (VSTF), a foundation promoted by the GOM, with private sector participation and financing, 
to catalyze rural transformation. 

 
    

  SAFEGUARDS 

 
A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 

 
Maharashtra is one of India’s most prosperous states, with a population of 114 million. Yet, it has some of India’s poorest 

people, four of its 36 districts are among India’s 106 most backward. Agriculture and industry form the mainstay of the 
state's economy. Most of the cultivable land is still rain-fed, relying heavily on the southwest monsoon rains. The net 
irrigated area is only 30.77 million Ha or about 16% of cultivable land. Maharashtra has typical monsoon climate, with

hot, rainy and cold weather seasons. The state has been affected by the recurrent monsoon failures in recent years 
resulting in droughts which have disproportionately impacted the state’s semi-arid agro climatic zones. Sahyadri and 
Satpura are two important hill ranges and Godavari, Bhima and Krishna are the two major rivers of the state. The state 
also has a long coastline. About 17% area of the state is forest, majority of which are in the eastern and Sahyadri regions 
of the state. Since the central parts of the state receives low rainfall, most of the rivers in the region have multiple dams. 
Maharashtra has around 1800 notable large dams. Maharashtra is generally rich in biodiversity Southern Tropical Thorn 
with five major forest types (Southern Tropical Semi-Evergreen, Southern Tropical Moist Deciduous, Southern Tropical 
Dry Deciduous, Southern Tropical Thorn and Littoral and Swamp Forests). The Western Ghats areas of Maharashtra are 
included in the 34 global Biodiversity Hotspots. The proposed project will be implemented throughout the state. 
 
B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 

 
The Borrower is familiar with the World Bank's safeguard policies having implemented several Bank funded projects. 

More recently, in the agriculture sector, Maharashtra Agricultural Competitiveness Project (MACP) and Project on Climate 
Resilient Agriculture (PoCRA) are being implemented. Both have sound environmental and social management 
frameworks. MACP has been rated Satisfactory on safeguards performance consistently. There is now adequate capacity 
in the state to manage potential safeguard risks of projects. However, some capacity building efforts are needed to deal 
with the new set of challenges arising as a result of climate change impacts. In general, Maharashtra has good institutions 
that can prove technical support to deal with safeguards related impacts, risks and challenges and build on positive 
outcomes of resource efficiency and sustainability.

D. Policies that might apply 

 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

This policy is triggered. The project involves a series of 
interventions on agriculture value chain development, 
facilitating market access, supporting improvement of 
livestock productivity, food processing and, in general, 
enhancing resilience.  It is anticipated that 
investments to be made under the project will not 
lead to any major irreversible impacts. the project by 
design promotes market-led better natural resource 
and environmental management within the selected 
sectors and sub-sectors. The potential environmental 
issues that could arise if project financed investments 
are not implemented appropriately, include food 
safety, supply chain sustainability, waste generation 
and management, poor energy efficiency and 
associated emissions, soil degradation etc. Activities 
for post-harvest management and value chain creation 
for product aggregation, handling, and marketing

could have impacts associated with general civil works 
construction, if supported under the project. This 
includes appropriate site selection for creating new 
infrastructure and reducing impacts of construction 
related activities like debris disposal, dust and solid 
wastes. 

Performance Standards for Private Sector 
Activities OP/BP 4.03 

TBD 

This policy may/may not be triggered. At this stage it is 
not clear if investments in enhancing the access of 
intended project beneficiaries to private markets will 
trigger this policy. The project investments may result 
in increased role of private markets and attract private 
investments in food processing etc. The proposed EA 
will ascertain whether this policy will be triggered. 

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 TBD 

This policy may/may not be triggered. Project 
investments are not likely to adversely impact natural 
habitats but certain elements may have some bearing 
on agro-biodiversity. The EA will ascertain whether 
this policy will be triggered. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No 
The project will not lead to any impact on forests or 
their management practices. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

Even through the project is not going to invest on the 
crop production side of agriculture, this policy is 
triggered as opportunities created through better 
market access could lead to overuse of pesticides and 
other agro-chemicals for boosting production. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 No 
The project is unlikely to have any impact on physical 
cultural resources. Proposed investments are largely in 
existing markets and/or rural household level. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 Yes 

Project activities will be implemented state-wide. 
Given that Maharashtra has a large tribal population 
spread across the state with 54% of those living below 
poverty line, OP 4.10 has been triggered. As specific 
locations for the project are unknown, an Indigenous 
People's Planning Framework (IPPF) will be prepared 
after free, prior and informed consultation with 
affected Scheduled Tribes as per OP 4.10 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 TBD 
Project activities currently envisaged are not likely to 
cause any involuntary resettlement. This will be 
updated during preparation. 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 No 
The project will not invest on constructing any new 
dam and/or support rehabilitation/improvement of 
any existing dam. 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

No 
The project does not involve any international 
waterways. 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No The project does not include any disputed areas.

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 
 
Ethiopia, with a current estimated population of 102.4 million1 (2016), has seen rapid economic growth over the past 
decade and is one of the fastest growing economies in the World. The IMF predicted the growth rate of Ethiopia to be 
8.5 percent in 20182.  The rapid economic growth over the past decade3 has not been able to generate adequate 
employment opportunities and Ethiopia needs to generate 1.7 million jobs4 every year to provide gainful employment 
to youth who are entering workforce. The arid and semi-arid low-lands, accounting for 60 percent of land area with 12 
to 14 percent of population, comprising of pastoral and agro-pastoral (PAP) communities lag behind in most of the 
social and economic indicators and their livelihoods are highly vulnerable to a multitude of shocks, primarily droughts, 
which is being exacerbated by climate change.  

 
 
Sectoral and Institutional Context 
 
The pastoral and agro-pastoral system are complex systems that need to balance the dynamic interplay between

people, livestock and environment resource base. The complexity of these livelihood system is getting exacerbated, 
driven by multiple factors droughts, degradation of rangelands, active conflict and insecurity, constrained livestock 
mobility and access to key resources etc. All these changes are resulting in significant changes in PAP production and 
livelihood systems. The commercialization pull is resulting into a category of commercially oriented large-scale herd 
owners who are successfully managing the transition. The stress-push has resulted into a category of population who 
has moved-out of pastoralism either being forced out by successive droughts or opting out since the pastoral livelihood 
is no longer viable or being pulled-in towards other market opportunities. Despite the complexity and high stress 
environment, there are significant economic opportunities in the pastoral and agro-pastoral areas and a significant 
proportion of population is still engaged in pastoral and agro-pastoral systems while others are pursing alternate 
livelihood opportunities.  

 
 
Relationship to CPF 
 
The operation features in the Bank’s CPF for FY 17-21 under the Building Resilience and Inclusiveness Pillar. In addition, 
it strongly contributes to “Promoting Structural and Economic Transformation through Increased Productivity’ pillar.  
The project will contribute to CPF result framework targets of enhance resilience, increase in agricultural yield, job 
creation, natural resource management, climate co-benefits, improved service delivery, as well as Ethiopia’s targets of 
National Adaptation Plan and Second Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP-2).  

 
C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  

 
 
To Enhance Livelihood Resilience and Commercialization of the Production Systems among PAP Communities in 
Ethiopia.  
 

 
Key Results (From PCN) 

 
The key PDO level Indicators includes:  

1. Number of direct project beneficiary (disaggregated by gender)  
2. People provided with access to improved Economic and Social services (disaggregated by service type and 

gender)  
3. Proportion (volume and value) of production sold by targeted beneficiaries for selected products  
4. Range and agricultural land area (in HA) under improved natural resource management practices 
5. Percentage increase in yield of selected crop and livestock commodities  
6. Jobs created (disaggregated by gender) 

 
 
D. Concept Description 

 
A comprehensive and integrated approach, rather than discrete interventions, that addresses multiple dimensions of 
livelihood is needed to address the binding constraints described above. By understanding the needs of different 
beneficiary groups, pastoralists, agro-pastoralists, and households pursing or intending to pursue alternate livelihoods, 
and designing intervention packages to meet their specific needs, this project aims to support livelihood resilience and 
commercialization through the following project components. The project would invest in improving the overall

enabling environment of rangeland management, pastoral risk management, and institutional development and 
capacity building which will contribute to increased resilience of the PAP communities and production systems.  To 
improve livelihoods, the project would support improving productivity and commercialization of pastoral and agro-
pastoral production system, small scale irrigation in lowland areas, and promoting livelihood diversification. To project 
would support improving access and utilization of basic social and economic services among the target communities 
through a decentralized Community Driven Development approach, which will be complimented by a strategic inter-
community, and inter woreda investments with the purpose of improving prevention and preparedness against 
disasters.  

 
    

  SAFEGUARDS 

 
A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 

 
The project will be implemented in the Pastoral and agro-pastoral areas of Ethiopia. The geographical coverage of the 

project would include regions of Afar, Ethio-Somali, Oromia and SNNPP. 
 
B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 

 
The borrower has implemented a number of Bank projects and have moderate institutional capacity for implementing 

safeguard policies.The project implementation arrangements will largely follow the existing mechanisms for the ongoing 
PCDP III with slight modifications to capture recent developments. 
While implementing various World Bank Financed infrastructure projects (PCDP I-PCDP III), the Borrower has gained 

experiences in preparing safeguards instruments (ESMF, RPF, ESS and ESMP documents) to identify and address potential 
environmental and social risks. The Ministry of Federal and Pastoral Development Affairs (MoFPDA) has implemented 
three successive phases of Pastoral Community Development Project (PCDP) under an Adaptable Programme Lending 
(APL) spanning 15 years, which has been jointly supported by the World Bank and IFAD. It is, therefore, proposed that this 
new LRCP will utilize the existing experience that has been built up with the ongoing PCDP III safeguard implementation 
arrangements. MoFPDA has the responsibility for overall coordination, monitoring and evaluation of the LRCP. Currently, 
there are safeguards specialists dedicated for PCDP III at federal and the four regional bureau levels. However, if 
Gambella and Benishagul regions will be benefited from the proposed project they are required to deploy safeguards 
experts before commencement of the project. 
Experiences revealed that proper implementation and documentation of safeguards related matters still remains a 

challenge that needs to be further strengthened, through ensuring adequate personnel and capacity at the ministerial 
and local levels, to ensure environmental and social safeguards compliance.

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

The Livelihoods Resilience and Commercialization 
Project (LRCP) is expected to finance the following 
activities: pasture development, supporting area 
enclosures, Prosopis and other invasive species 
control, water resource development along cattle 
corridors, soil and water conservation measures, 
afforestation activities, small dams, flood control, rain 
water harvesting, breed improvement, feed/forage 
improvement and management, animal health 
services, rain-fed agriculture, build demand-driven 
social and economic infrastructure; which may include 
schools, health posts, veterinary posts, small water 
supply and irrigation, small feeder roads, catchment 
management improvements. Given that most of the 
aforementioned activities result in environmental and 
social risks, an environmental and social assessment is 
necessary; ergo OP/BP 4.01 will be triggered. The 
assessment will be outlined in an Environmental and 
Social Framework to be updated prior to appraisal and 
key resullts and measures will be integrated into the 
project documents (PAD, PIM, ESMF, etc.). Further, 
site specific ESIA, ESMP and PMP will also be prepared, 
as required, during project prepation.  

Performance Standards for Private Sector 
Activities OP/BP 4.03 

No 

The Project is being implemented by the Ministry of 
Agriculture. In case of any linkages to private sector 
via the commercialization component of the Project, 
these will be handled via OP 4.01. 

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 Yes 

Pastoral areas cover some natural habitats which are 
protected by law, such as the Awash and Yangudi Rasa 
National Parks (Afar), Yabello Sanctuary (Borena) and 
the Babile Wildlife Sanctuary (Somali). However, LRCP 
is not expected to be operated within such areas or 
other areas that qualify as critical natural habitats 
under OP. 4.04 or include any sub-projects that have a 
bearing on protected areas. However, it will affect 
rangelands and pastures, for which OP/BP 4.04 will 
apply to protect even those non-critical natural 
habitats from any adverse impacts. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 Yes 

OP/BP 4.36 is triggered to avoid any anticipated 
potential impacts that may affect the natural forests 
found in Gambella and Benishangul Gumuze regions. 
Besides, LRCP is expected to finance afforestation and 
other natural resources management (range land 
management, area enclosure, …) related activities for

LIVELIHOODS RESILIENCE AND COMMERCIALIZATION PROJECT (LRCP) IN PASTORAL AND AGRO-PASTORAL AREAS 
(P164336) 

 

 

  
Jun 07, 2018 Page 7 of 10  

     

which OP/BP 4.36 would apply. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

Promotion of rain fed and/or irrigated farming where 
feasible and profitable is part of promoting sustainable 
livelihoods and may indirectly involve use of 
agrochemicals including fertilizers and pesticides for 
both crop and livestock improvements. The ESMF will 
include guidelines and procedures for the preparation 
of specific PMPs, when is required, during the project 
implementation. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 Yes 

There are few areas in the Ethiopian lowlands that 
may constitute physical cultural resources in the sense 
described in BP/OP. 4.11. Although the nature and 
scope of the LRCP sub-projects is not known now, they 
are unlikely to involve any major excavation work or 
inundation of areas with water, and are thus not likely 
to affect any physical cultural resources. Furthermore, 
subprojects will be carried out only in areas selected, 
through a broader consultative process that includes 
prior informed consent, by local citizens who would 
normally give great importance to safeguarding their 
cultural resources. Nonetheless, the policy is triggered, 
predicated on the assumption that there could be 
“chance find”. No sub-project that might have 
negative impacts on cultural property will be funded 
without acceptable mitigation measures prepared 
prior to execution of any such sub-project. There are 
national procedures and guidelines for reporting 
chance finds to be followed, and a national entity for 
coordinating and facilitating the archiving, safekeeping 
and documentation of physical cultural resources. The 
Project would work closely with the national authority, 
should any chance find issues arise. The requirements 
and standard measures of a chance-find procedure 
will also be included in the ESMF.  

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 Yes 

The Project triggers OP 4.10 as the vast majority of 
people in the project area meet the criteria for OP 
4.10, with the project explicitly targeting lowlands in 
emerging regions. While the Project therefore will 
benefit specifically these areas, assessing culturally 
appropriate interventions as well as ensuring equal 
access to project benefits, a related Social Assessment 
shall be conducted and respective results integrated 
into the Project design. The SA will contain an explicit 
Social Development Plan and the Project will integrate 
the required measures into the PAD as well as

allocating ressources to ensure its implementation. 
Consequently it will also be addressed in the PIM and 
the ESMG. 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

LRCP interventions may involve acquisition of land and 
/or restriction of access to communal natural 
resources. Therefore, an RPF has to be prepared to 
ensure that appropriate measures are in place to 
address any issues which might arise from potential 
land acquisition and or restriction of access to 
communal natural resources under the Project. This 
RPF shall include appropriate tools to address 
potential impacts by a large number of sub-projects. 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 Yes 

LRCP is not expected to finance any investments 
aimed at rehabilitating or constructing large dams. 
Although there could possibly be construction of small 
dams under LRCP, particularly for small scale 
irrigation, they may not be large (more than 4.5 
meters high) and therefore may not require special 
procedures that are normally applied for large dams to 
follow. This notwithstanding, the Project will trigger 
OP 4.37 (Safety of Dams). In cases of small dams 
construction (less than 4.5 meters), the Project will 
use the FAO ‘Manual on Small Earth Dams, A Guide to 
Siting, Design and Construction’. In addition, the 
guideline for small dam construction prepared by the 
MoA will be used to ensure safety of small dams. 
Generic dam safety measures designed by qualified 
engineers will be included in the design and 
implementation/rehabilitation of small dams; with 
respective requirements outlined in the ESMF. 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

Yes 

LRCP could extract very small amounts of water from 
any of the shared rivers or drainage systems. This 
notwithstanding, the Project will, in accordance with 
the requirements of the policy, send renewal 
notification of intended water use to the relevant 
riparian countries. 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No 
The project is not expected to be implemented in any 
disputed areas.

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 

1 Uzbekistan is currently undergoing a paradigm shift away from its state-managed economy. In 2017 and 2018, the 
Government of Uzbekistan (GoU) launched a wide range of reforms that represent a shift from a state-led economic 
system to a market economy. As noted in the 2018 Performance & Learning Review of the World Bank (WB), these entail 
four fundamental economic and social shifts: (i) from the state to the private sector; (ii) from inward-looking to outward-
looking growth and jobs drivers; (iii) from general government subsidies to targeted social programs; and (iv) from central 
government to regional and local authorities, in particular as regards responsibility and accountability for the 
implementation of the reform agenda on the ground.  

2 Important progress has been made in the reform agenda. In an especially significant move, in September 2017, 
the GoU allowed a 50 percent devaluation of the Uzbek Som and abolished many foreign exchange controls. This almost 
immediately eliminated a thriving parallel foreign exchange market and eliminated about 30 percent of the cotton 
taxation, which was depressing agricultural incentives for decades1. The GoU further boosted market incentives by 
liberalizing many import tariffs and committing to WTO accession, lifting price controls for certain raw materials and 
production inputs, and extending the use of commodity market exchanges. It eliminated the monopoly on exports of fruits 
and vegetables and has taken steps to improve safety nets for vulnerable groups, which is critical for further agricultural 
and broader economic reforms. 

3 Significant progress has also been made in reducing the use of forced labor, which has been hampering sustainable 
development of agriculture and damaging Uzbekistan’s image on the global arena. Systematic use of child labor in cotton 
harvesting has been eradicated, while overall use of forced labor has been declining over time. The use of forced labor in 
2018 was estimated by the International Labor Organization (ILO) to drop to 7 percent compared to 15 percent in 2017. 
There is the highest level political commitment in Uzbekistan to fully eradicate the use of forced labor in all sectors, and 
an increased level of transparency and dialogue on the issue, encompassing all groups of civil society, including critical 
voices. The WB’s partnership with ILO has been instrumental to this achievement. Yet, the issue remains, requiring 
continued serious attention to it in future policy dialogue and investment operations.                    

4 While the above reforms are significant, they need to be deepened to facilitate the transition from a state-led to 
a market-oriented economic system as noted in the WB’s Reform Roadmap 2.02. This requires a fundamental reevaluation 
of the state’s role in the economy, from direct involvement in production and marketing to delivery of core public goods

and correction of market failures. In other words, the government needs to decide what to “do less” and what to “do 
more” going forward. Yet, the definition of a new role of the state and economic transition itself has only just begun.   

Sectoral and Institutional Context 

5 In the overall reform context, agriculture is a sector of the economy where ambition and investment can be 
rewarded. Reforms in the sector present an opportunity to deliver quick economic and social wins, given the large share 
of employment and other economic gains this sector generates3, on the one hand, and its heavy overregulation and a lack 
of high-quality public services on the other. Recent reforms on cotton pricing, import tariffs for inputs and liberalization 
of horticulture exports need to be complemented by a broader shift in the government’s approach to agricultural 
development. This requires putting competitiveness, farm incomes, jobs, and sustainability at the center of the reform 
agenda.  

6 During the preparation of the Concept/Strategy for Agricultural Development in Uzbekistan by 2030 during 
September-December 2018, the completion date of which was moved to October 2019 by the President’s Decree4, it was 
largely agreed that modernizing agriculture requires delivery of a wide range of quality agricultural public services, with 
many of them have been either underfinanced or even not existed in the past. This should help restore the agricultural 
growth, which dropped sharply in recent years (Figure 1)5. Public services include applied agricultural research and 
development, extension/advisory services, education, soil fertility improvement, food safety, animal disease 
control/veterinary services, phytosanitary services, support for smallholder market inclusion (associations, cooperatives, 
clusters, productive partnerships), market and statistical information, market infrastructure and logistics, and 
environment protection and climate change adaptation, among others. The global experience shows that these public 
services are key to correct some large market failures and eventually accelerate agricultural transformation.   

7 Supporting the above-mentioned agricultural public services would constitute a significant departure from current 
practice, under which only few programs receive adequate attention and funding. In 2017 about 80 percent of the 
agricultural budget was spent on irrigation (for its operation and management, pumping water, building new canals, and 
improving drainage). The largest share of the remaining 20 percent was spent on subsidizing 130,000 cotton and wheat 
farmers, who cultivate about 3 million ha or 70 percent of the irrigated area. The public spending on agricultural research 
and development was just 0.01 percent of agriculture sector’s value added, compared to the average 1.5 percent in 
middle-income countries with successful agricultural transformation and of above 2 percent in the developed countries. 
Agricultural extension services do not even exist from the market-economy’s perspectives. Food safety and sanitary and 
phytosanitary (SPS) standards are outdated, preventing Uzbek agri-food products from entering many foreign markets. As 
a result, most farmers do not receive any information and technical assistance (TA) on new technologies and farming 
practices, which leads to the large market failures. 

8 The most underserved are dehkan smallholders. There are 4.7 million of them, who cultivate 481,000 ha or 13 
percent of irrigated land arears. Even though they generate more than 75 percent of agricultural output, including more 
than 90 percent of horticulture and livestock outputs, they do not receive public services from the Ministry of Agriculture 
and other ministries. As dehkan farms are too small and often unskilled, private sector also do not provide any services to 
them either, except buying surpluses they produce. This leads to the market failure. The government has recently 
recognized the need to support this group of farmers through extension, TA, and investments6. Yet, more focus has been 

                                            
3 In 2017, the primary agriculture generated 19 percent of GDP, 20 percent of export, and 27 percent of employment. It provided inputs for 
development of food and textile industries, which accounted for 5 percent of GDP and 2 percent of employment. 
4 Decree of the President No. 5614 “On Additional Measures to Ensure Further Development of Economy and Increase Efficiency of Economic 
Policy” dated January 8, 2019.   
5 The recent decline in the growth of agricultural value added was a result of the decline in production of wheat and cotton caused by adverse 
weather and the more accurate statistical reporting in recent years.     
6 The President’s Decree No. PP-3680 “On Additional Measures to Improve Functioning of Farmers, Dehkans, and Household Plots” dated April 26, 
2018 assigned the Council of Farmers, Dehkans and Household Plots to lead engagement and delivery of services to small farms.

so far given to their investment/credit support and less to their capacity building, voluntary cooperation, and their 
integration into modern value chains. This hampers the development of inclusive agri-food value chains as experienced 
under the ongoing WB and other donors-financed projects for horticulture and livestock development where the efforts 
to link dehkan farms to large farms and agribusinesses, who receive loans for their business development, largely fail. 

9 While the horticulture sector gets some boost from the government’s desire to increase and diversify exports, the 
livestock sector, which is oriented to domestic market, suffers from a lack of strategic approach to its development. The 
sustainability of its growth is affected by the limited fodder base,7 neglected pastural development, and the lack of 
veterinary, animal nutrition, and other TA services. The government’s attention in recent years has been more to bringing 
highly-productive cattle and upgrade dairy processing and less to addressing the above constraints. 

10 Uzbekistan’s agriculture is significantly exposed to the climate hazards. It is the most vulnerable to the decreased 
and more variable precipitation, higher temperatures, reduced river runoff, and increased frequency and severity of 
extreme events. The adaptation capacity of Uzbekistan’s agriculture is assessed to be weak8. The proposed options for 
increasing adaptation include: (i) generation of drought-and pest-resilient seeds; (ii) increasing access of farmers to 
technology and information through extension services, both generally and for adapting to climate change; (iii) optimizing 
the use of agronomic inputs, especially fertilizers, and adopting good agricultural and animal husbandry practices; (iv) 
investing in water saving technologies; and (v) encouraging farmers to efficiently adapt to climate change.      

11 Generating and delivering agricultural services in a coordinated manner is challenging due to the fragmentation 
of public institutions responsible for delivery of agricultural services. In 2018, the Ministry of Agriculture and Water 
Resources were split into the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Water Resources. Moreover, during this split the 
State Plant Quarantine Inspection and the State Veterinary Inspection were both moved to the Cabinet of Ministers. Food 
safety’s responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture is shared with the Ministry of Health. And finally, the newly created 
Ministry of Innovations is responsible for agricultural research, especially seed development. The proposed project will 
engage selectively and strategically with these institutions during the project preparation and implementation. 

Relationship to CPF 

12 The proposed operation is aligned with the Country Performance Framework (CPF) for FY19-21, which has been 
adapted to meet Uzbekistan’s growing social and economic transformation. It largely falls under the Focus Area 1 
“Sustainable transformation towards market economy,” supporting a more strategic engagement in agriculture outlined 
in the CPF. The proposed project would leverage: (i) the WB Livestock Sector Development Project (US$150 million 
approved in June 2017) and additional financing to the WB Horticulture Development Project (US$500 million approved 
in January 2018), which stimulate private investments in production, processing, storing and marketing; (ii) the WB 
Fergana Region Entrepreneurship Project (US$200 million to be approved in March 2019), which will stimulate job creation 
and regional development; (iii) Climate Adaptation for Aral Sea Project (US$14 million), which provides financing for 
climate-smart adaptation practices; (iv) additional grants from the European Union for technical assistance to the WB 
operations to support value chain organization, institutional capacity building strengthening, regulatory framework 
improvement, and small farmers’ access to higher value markets through value chain inclusion in livestock and horticulture 
subsectors; (v) the IFC’s agribusiness and agrifinance programs; and (vi) projects of other development partners such as 
the Asian Development Bank’s horticulture and livestock projects, the European Union’s agricultural budget support, the 
French Development Agency’s livestock project, and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization’s capacity building for 
agricultural institutions.     

13 The proposed project aims to add value by addressing needs that are currently unmet in the WB and other donors’ 
portfolio. The current WB projects are mainly focused on improving access to finance for larger farmers and agribusinesses

and just marginally on strengthening selected public institutions to deliver better services for horticulture and livestock 
subsectors. The situation is similar with the projects financed by other major agricultural donors. The ongoing agricultural 
projects amount US$2.5 billion, while the pipeline for the next two years is US$0.8 billion. There are limited investments 
in strengthening public institutions to deliver services to agriculture in a coherent and integrated manner, especially for 
small farms, to increase the rates of economic return of many credit line’s projects and reduce risks for agricultural credit 
borrowers. The proposed project would work with the ongoing agricultural projects to identify investment gaps and design 
activities to leverage operations of the various donors and ultimately improve the agricultural sector outcomes. 

C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  

14 The proposed PDO is to strengthen generation and delivery of selected agricultural public services in Uzbekistan. 

15 Selected services would include generation of new agricultural technologies and innovations, their dissemination 
through extension services, support for smallholder market inclusion, and improvement of sanitary and phytosanitary and 
food safety systems. 

Key Results (From PCN) 

16 The proposed project would help: (i) generate more and better innovative farm and agribusiness technologies, 
information, and other public services through applied agricultural research; (ii) make them readily available to farmers 
and agribusiness through extension and advisory services; (iii) integrate smallholders in modern food value chains; and 
(iv) reduce costs of pest invasions and animal diseases and expand export opportunities through SPS and food safety 
services. 

D. Concept Description 

17 The proposed project will be a departure from the standard Uzbekistan’s donor-financed agricultural projects of 
the recent years. The standard project consists of a credit line component, typically accounting for 80-90 percent of the 
project costs, and a component for complementary TA to farmers and public institutions, either associated or not 
associated with the credit line. The latter is usually financed by grants. In two ongoing WB projects, for example, the 
capacity building TA activities are financed by the EU grants.     

18 The proposed project will be centered around strengthening public institutions to deliver more and better services 
to farmers and agribusinesses. The efforts will be made to modernize the public institutions through capacity building and 
investment support, encourage their more strategic engagement with private sector, and pilot delivery models of public 
services through public-private-partnerships (PPPs) and using digital technologies. The geography of the project activities 
will be nationwide.    

19 The key guiding principles for designing the proposed project would be the following: 

a. Supporting agricultural reforms: The proposed project will support reforms in agriculture, helping: (i) pilot 
new approaches for public programs, including through PPP; and (ii) define a new role of the government 
in market-oriented agriculture, including improvement in sustainability of land and water use, boosting 
shared prosperity, and elimination of unsustainable labor practices in the entire agri-food industry. It will 
be aligned with the WB Development Policy Operation(s), and, where relevant, with the EU’s agricultural 
budget support program (under preparation), to complement an improved agricultural policy 
environment by investments and capacity building.  

b. Financing public goods: Agricultural programs such as agricultural R&D, extension, cooperation and 
production partnerships, good agricultural practices (including climate-smart agricultural technologies), 
integrated pest management, and food safety and SPS are globally recognized as critical to induce 
agricultural modernization by correcting market failures and providing public goods. These public

functions have been chronically underfinanced in Uzbekistan; to make impact, these programs require 
both investment and TA to increase quantity of services and, more importantly, improve their quality and 
outreach.   

c. Selection of public goods: Priority will be given to public programs critical to increase competitiveness of 
agricultural production and trade, both domestically and internationally. Competitiveness can be 
increased through higher productivity (or lower costs), adaptivity to climate change, better quality, higher 
(food) safety, and lower transaction costs.        

d. Maximizing Finance for Development (MFD): The proposed project will seek to crowd in private 
investments by strengthening the quality of public programs, reducing transaction costs for farmers and 
agribusinesses, piloting PPP in service delivery, and encouraging private investments in entire food 
system, including from the IFC. It should seek mobilize expertise and resources of the World Bank Group 
to deliver the best services to clients.       

e. Complementary investments that do not duplicate ongoing and planned programs: Several investments 
and capacity building projects financed by the WB and other development partners already support the 
above-mentioned areas of agricultural development and several more are in the pipeline. The proposed 
project will be complementary, focusing on filling gaps and connect various activities.   

20 The following activities and components will be considered during the project preparation. This list is intentionally 
long to provide the task team with flexibility during preparation and give the authorities more options to select from it 
when defining (and narrowing down) the scope of the proposed project.  

Component 1: Generating new agricultural technologies and innovations       

21 This component would support: (i) investments in constructing and upgrading buildings, equipment, laboratories, 
machinery and irrigation/drainage for agricultural research stations; (ii) competitive research grants; (iii) capacity building 
of researchers and other stakeholders associated with operation and management of their fixed assets, knowledge and 
skills for conducting modern agricultural research; and (iv) institution strengthening. Thematically, the support will focus 
on crop and fodder seeds and good agricultural practices (GAP). Preparation of this component will be carried out in 
collaboration with the Ministry of Innovations and the Ministry of Agriculture.      

22 Seeds: Generating drought and pest-resistant seed varieties, multiplying, and making them available to farmers 
are critical to increase competitiveness of agricultural production, given the limited land and water availability in 
Uzbekistan. Yields are low even for crops, on which local agricultural research has focused in the recent decade. Thus, 
improvements are needed for a wide range of crops, from cotton and wheat to fruits and vegetables, and from seed 
genetics to seed multiplication. Seeds will need to be adjusted for different agro-ecological zones of the country. In 
addition, Uzbekistan can produce seeds for exports, which would require, among other things, to have seed laboratories 
accredited by the International Seed Quality Control Agency (ISTA). Furthermore, the proposed project can support PPPs 
in seed production, encouraged by the recent legislation9, by cofinancing the public aspects of the projects. 

23 Fodder crops and pasture management: Applied research on fodder crops and integrated pasture management 
could be supported to help increase the supply of feed to the growing livestock sector, which faces the rapidly rising feed 
cost. Feed account for 60-70 percent of meat and milk prices, so identifying suitable feed varieties and pasture 
management technologies (due to the limited irrigated areas to produce fodder) through agricultural research and 
extending this knowledge to farmers through extension services will be valuable investments. The current ratio of fodder 
area per unit of cattle in Uzbekistan is at least ten time lower than the international norms10; thus, efforts are needed to 

                                            
9 President’s Resolution No. PP-4020 “On Measures to Create Additional Incentives for Greenhouse’s Development” dated November 20, 2018. 
10 The ratio of fodder land per cattle unit in Uzbekistan is 0.03 ha, while international norms require it to be 0.5 ha for irrigated land and 1.5 ha for

identify and promote high-productivity fodder crops suitable for production on both irrigated and dry lands to inform 
decision of farmers on selecting appropriate varieties and techniques suitable for various agro-ecological zones.     

24 Good agricultural practices: Uzbekistan does not have a code of Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) for crop and 
livestock production, which is common in other countries to promote climate-smart agricultural practices. In many 
countries the adoption of GAP is a precondition for farming or for receiving subsidies. It is also used as a precondition for 
adopting stricter Global GAPs and other standards such as organic and halal. There are many locally-tested best farming 
practices in Uzbekistan, but they are not put together in one coherent place and they are not widely disseminated and 
adopted. The project could support the preparation of the GAP code and guidelines using the best practice local and global 
knowledge; introduce pilot training courses and adjust draft code and guidelines based on experience/feedback; and 
publish final version of the code and guidelines and promote it widely through training programs for extension staff and 
farmers.  

25 The project could also support investments to update soil fertility maps, which is needed for GAP adoption. Such 
investments include upgrading soil testing laboratory infrastructure, digitalize map information with open-date access, 
developing best practice guidelines on soil monitoring and fertilizer use adjusted to different soil types and agro-ecological 
zones, making this information available to farmers through field-based advisers and extension services, and procuring 
portable field-based soil testing equipment to allow extension services and other advisers to provide immediate feedback 
to farmers on soil quality and proposed adjustments needed to enhance soil fertility.   

26 Institutional strengthening: Engagement will be required with the Ministry of Innovations, Ministry of Agriculture, 
other agencies/institutes and private sector (farmers and agribusinesses) to develop mechanisms to bring research and 
private sector together for better defining applied research priorities that would address constraints faced by farmers and 
agribusinesses in a timely and coordinated manner. The experience of the Netherlands and other countries will be used 
to foster a closer collaboration between researchers, farmers, and agribusiness companies. The proposed project could 
foster this kind of collaboration and generate knowledge and lessons to inform a roadmap for other reforms in the 
agricultural research system in Uzbekistan.                 

Component 2: Disseminating agricultural technologies and innovations and creating markets    

27 This component would support: (i) investments in infrastructure for extension/advisory activities, including 
mobility, learning campuses/facilities, demo plots close to farm fields, and creation of digital platforms for reaching out 
many farmers at low cost; (ii) capacity building of extension/advisory officers and preparation of extension materials for 
farmers and agribusinesses; and (iii) operation costs for delivering services to farmers and other clients. Preparation of 
this component will be carried out in collaboration with the Ministry of Innovations, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Council 
of Farmers, Dehkans and Household Plots (Farmers Council), and other stakeholders such as cotton-textile clusters. 

28 Currently, the work of the public agricultural extension services is limited to delivery of production-oriented advice 
to farmers producing wheat and cotton under the government production quota and to make sure that farmers have 
inputs to meet their quotas. The proposed project would help transform them into market-oriented extension and 
advisory services differentiated to the needs of dehkan smallholders, larger farms, and agribusinesses, building on the 
recent legislation11 and the strategy for agricultural extension being drafted by the Ministry of Innovations. The reformed 
extension service would extend knowledge on new technologies and farming practices generated by research locally and 
globally to farmers; promote GAP adoption; offer diversified agribusiness support services; and use digital platforms to 
design services, deliver training and information, improve responsiveness, and increase farmer outreach.  

29 For dehkan farms, extension services could be delivered as a part of establishing productive partnerships, which 
are proved globally as a potent mechanism to promote farm collective actions and reduce transaction costs for 

                                            
dry land.

agribusinesses to include these farm groups in their value chains.  Productive partnerships as a part of the proposed 
project would help include smallholders in modern value chains and reduce transaction costs for agribusinesses to interact 
with smallholders, through: (i) TA for dehkan smallholders; (ii) promotion of their voluntary cooperation and development 
of joint investment plans; (iii) co-financing of investment plans through grants; and (iv) linking farm groups with 
agribusiness and lead firms. The latter could be selected from the ongoing WB-financed horticulture and livestock projects. 
Preparation of this component will be carried out in collaboration with the Farmers Council and the Ministry of Agriculture.     

30 For larger farms, for example, the PPP arrangements with cotton-textile clusters could be developed to deliver 
advisory services on cotton and wheat production and develop technology and information database using digital 
platforms on GAP, crop protection, integrated pest management, decent work, water usage, soil fertility, as well as good 
manufacturing practices in textile factories, to strengthen technical capacity of clusters’ technical staff to increase 
productivity, profitability, and sustainability of agricultural production. For agribusiness, the project could support 
preparation and delivery of targeted courses on agri-food enterprise business diagnostics, business planning and 
preparation of investment applications, and pilot agro-business schools and start-ups for small and medium scale farmers 
and agri-businesses. This part will be prepared in collaboration with IFC and ILO. 

Component 3: Improving SPS and food safety standards  

31 This component would support: (i) investments in constructing and upgrading buildings, equipment, laboratories, 
and other fixed assets of selected SPS and food safety-relevant public institutions; (ii) capacity building of staff associated 
with operation and management of their fixed assets and knowledge and skills for delivering public services; and (iii) 
institution strengthening. These investments will finance and co-finance public programs and be complementary to those 
already carried out or planned under the donor-financed projects. Preparation of this component will be carried out in 
collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Health, the State Plant Quarantine Inspection, and the State 
Veterinary Committee.     

32 Veterinary services: Efficient and trustworthy veterinary services are critical to reduce risk for farmers to invest 
in livestock, reduce economic losses in case of animal diseases, and protect human health. Currently, the delivery of 
veterinary services and their outreach are unsatisfactory to deal with the growing number of animals in the country. The 
World Animal Health Organization (OIE) has recently completed the assessment of the performance of veterinary services 
and investment gap, with the support of the WB-financed livestock project and the State Veterinary Service, with the 
purpose of identifying, detailing, and costing priority activities. The Gap Analysis identified priority areas of support and 
the associated investment needs (funding requirements) in all areas of veterinary services, including trade, veterinary 
public health, animal health, veterinary laboratories, and veterinary management services for the next five years. The 
identified gaps include investments needs in fixed assets, human capital, and operational resources, which will be used to 
define the activities for the proposed project. Veterinary laboratories alone include the large network of laboratories and 
veterinarians, which could be supported by the project.12 Investments will be based on thorough assessments of the needs 
and the role of specific units in delivering public services vis-à-vis the role of private sector.     

33 Phytosanitary/quarantine services: Uzbekistan incurs significant economic losses from pest invasions and from 
difficulty to meet the SPS requirements of importers. Uzbekistan, for example, is on top of the rejection of its fresh 
horticulture exports by the EU, mainly caused by the high level of mycotoxins in dried fruits, which is very far in excess of 
the EU standards. The proposed project could support the State Plant Quarantine Inspection to improve surveillance 
capacity to prevent pest invasions, promote adoption of integrated pest management as a part of GAP adoption, and 
facilitate trade, both export and import. Among several things, the project could help the Inspection to accelerate signing 

                                            
12 The network of veterinary laboratories in Uzbekistan comprises of the State Center for Animal Diseases and Food Safety, which also manages the 
State Research Center on Quality Control of VMPs and Feed Additives; 13 Regional Veterinary Laboratories; 130 Local Veterinary Laboratories; 
1,411 Field Veterinary Stations; 265 laboratories at food markets; and 27 Border Inspection Posts and Transport Stations. Together these veterinary 
laboratories employ 2,600 veterinarians and veterinary para-professionals.

the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) and develop a Pest Risk Analysis capability that is credible to IPPC 
members; establish minimum residual level standards and protocols per international norms and support an awareness-
raising program for existing and potential agri-food exporters; and establish a system of accreditation of SPS laboratories 
and where needed, reference laboratories connected to a network of public and private laboratories. 

34 Food safety standards: The WB’s CPSD analysis found that the food safety standards called GOST require 
modernization to meet the requirements of importers outside of the former Soviet Union and even to expand on 
traditional markets such as Kazakhstan and Russia, who adjust their food safety standards to internationally accepted 
norms and practices. This is especially urgent for horticulture products, for which foreign buyers are sensitive to meeting 
strict food safety requirements, as the above figure shows. The proposed project could support the process of bringing 
domestic food safety standards to the requirements of the major importing countries and provide TA to agribusinesses 
and exporters to adopt the upgraded food safety standards. 

Component 4: Project management and coordination  

35 This component will finance project management and coordination activities, as well as monitoring and 
evaluation. The scope of work under this component will be further defined as institutional and implementation 
arrangements are refined during preparation.

Summary of Screening of Environmental and Social Risks and Impacts 

Although this project intends to provide institutional strengthening, capacity building, and improved service 
delivery, the project will be working with farmers. The GoU has a history of Child and Forced Labor (CFL) 
which was inherited from Soviet times. The GoU has made tremendous strides towards eliminating the use of 
CFL for harvesting of cotton. Third party monitoring by the ILO has reported that child labor seems to have 
been eliminated, however recent reports state cases of forced labor, although at much lower scale than 
previously, still exists. The project will be working with all farmers, which may include farmers who include 
cotton in their crop rotation. Therefore, the concern of forced labor raises project risk to a moderate level. All 
project initiatives, where relevant, will include addressing CFL, as well as ensuring women and the rural poor 
are included in project initiatives.

I. PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND RESULTS MONITORING 

A. Background, problem addressed, and rationale 

1.1 Agriculture is a key sector of the Paraguayan economy. In the period 2004-2016, it 
generated an annual average of 25% of GDP, and 30% of jobs. The sector has also 
grown at an average annual rate of 5.7% over that same period. Alongside this 
growth, agricultural exports have risen significantly over the last decade, 
representing 60% of the total value of exports in 2016.1  

1.2 This solid sector performance has occurred in the context of a dual productive 
structure. On the one hand, rapid growth can be observed in some areas, especially 

soybeans, which contributed 57% of agricultural GDP growth between 2004 and 
2016. Based on Paraguay’s last National Agricultural Census in 2008 (CAN 2008), 
the production of soybeans and livestock is concentrated on lands larger than 500 
hectares. By contrast, survey data show that the average annual farm income of 
family farms (under 50 hectares, accounting for 96% of at farms, according to 
CAN 2008) devoted to sesame, cassava, sugarcane, corn, and other crops, fell from 
US$3,121 in 1991 to just US$981 in 2013. (Willi, P., 1991; A-Fines and GIZ, 2014).2 
Recent studies indicate that, to maintain this solid aggregate sector performance 
and improve farming income for rural families living Paraguay, productivity needs to 
improve through actions to promote the use of better technologies among small-
scale farmers, greater diversification of production, and the introduction of 
production systems that help to better manage climate and other risks (Nin-Pratt, A. 
et al., 2016). 

1.3 These recommendations are the result of an analysis of existing official statistics. 
However, decision-makers need robust, up-to-date information that allows them to 
work more precisely when designing and/or implementing instruments for public 
policy and/or private investment. Furthermore, the impact of different interventions 
can only be measured and assessed effectively if appropriate statistics are available. 
For that reason, statistics are needed on land use, agricultural production factors, 
the predominant economic and social conditions faced by farmers, and other areas. 
Additionally, much of the income inequality seen in Latin America and the Caribbean 
can be attributed to factors such as race, place of birth, education level of parents, 
gender, and sexual orientation. Some case studies suggest that the benefits of 
having information are much greater than the costs of generating it. For example, 
Bruce Gardner reviewed the literature that quantifies the value of information on the 
agricultural market for private decision-makers, as well as for decision-makers in the 
public sector working on policy reforms relating to trade and investment in research 
and development in the U.S. (Gardner, 2004). The study confirms that the availability 
of this information has net benefits for decision-makers. 

1.4 Data requirements for the agricultural sector are extensive and include information 
on the structure and management of agricultural holdings, agricultural production 
and inputs, food consumption, household income and expenditure, gender equality, 
the work force, and agricultural prices. There is also a growing demand for basic 
agroenvironmental data on greenhouse gas and ammonia emissions, to improve 
national greenhouse gas inventories. All these data could come from agricultural

censuses and sample surveys, population censuses and surveys, administrative 
records, and other sources.  

1.5 An agricultural census is a statistical operation focused on collecting, processing, 
and disseminating data on the structure of the agricultural sector of an entire country, 
or a significant part of one. The basic objectives of agricultural censuses according 
to the World Programme for the Census of Agriculture (WCA 2020) (FAO 2015) are: 
(i) to provide data on the structure of agriculture, especially for small administrative 
units, and to enable detailed cross-tabulations; (ii) to provide data to use as 
benchmarks for, and reconciliation of, current agricultural statistics; and (iii) to 
provide frames for agricultural sample surveys. 

1.6 In an integrated agricultural statistics system, an agricultural census provides: (i) an 
integrated set of data on food and agriculture, necessary for decision-making related 
to food, agriculture, and rural development; and (ii) sampling frames for the surveys, 
which are conducted more frequently to collect more detailed and timely data. It 
should also be based on the necessary quality standards and include the 
dissemination of the information, so as to meet the information demand of the public 
and private sectors. 

1.7 The “Global Strategy to Improve Agricultural and Rural Statistics” (World Bank, 
UNSD, FAO 2010) published after a consultation process that included national 
statistical institutes, agriculture ministries, recommendations from the United 
Nations Security Council, experts and academics, and online forums. In its 
recommendations, the strategy identifies and highlights limitations in the production 
of statistical data for the agricultural sector and suggests that the conceptual 
framework for agricultural and rural statistics needs be expanded, and that the scope 
and coverage of such statistics should be broadened to include, for example, 
aspects of rural populations and households, fisheries, forestry, and other 
dimensions. 

1.8 Some countries of the region, including Paraguay, therefore implemented technical 
cooperation operation ATN/OC-14750-RG, to develop a consensus-based shared 
conceptual and methodological framework for the IDB’s Regional Public Goods 
Initiative based on technical and practical criteria, to promote the production of 
agricultural and rural statistics sustainably over time. This regional public good, 
named “Development of Methodology for the Implementation of Agricultural 
Statistics Systems in Latin America and the Caribbean,” began with a diagnostic 
assessment3 of the capacity to produce and disseminate agricultural and rural 
statistics, looking at the legal framework, coordination within the national statistical 
system, financial and human resources, available infrastructure and equipment, and 
the type and quality of data. It also identified national needs, along with procedures 
for generating and/or compiling data and dissemination methods.  

                                                
3  This assessment was based on responses to a self-administered standard questionnaire sent to the 

countries. The questionnaire had 233 items grouped into 23 categories under four dimensions, which 
were used to prepare a baseline country profile.

1.9 The findings of the regional public good assessment put Paraguay4 in Group 2 out 

of four groups, with Group 1 being the “weakest countries,” and Group 4 being the 
“strongest countries.” Group 2, “intermediate to weak countries,” also includes 
El Salvador, Belize, the Dominican Republic, and St. Lucia. According to this 
diagnostic assessment, the main limiting factors for agricultural statistics in 
Paraguay are institutional weakness due to a scarcity of resources, both human 
(core training) and material (physical infrastructure), and weak methods and 
practices. Added to these are poor coordination within the national statistical system 
and unawareness of data quality5 (see details in Table 1).

1.10 Paraguay’s current regulatory framework puts responsibility for producing 
agricultural statistics on the Ministry of Agriculture,6 as is the case in other countries 
inside and outside the region such as France, Uruguay, India, and the U.S. The legal 
foundation for statistical activities is based on two main laws: Executive Order 11126 
of 1942, which reorganizes the Bureau of Statistics, Surveys, and Censuses 
(DGEEC) and gives it the authority for “technical direction of all statistical work;” and 
Law 81 of 1992, which designates the Office of Agricultural Censuses and Statistics 
(DCEA) as the executing agency responsible for preparing agricultural statistics and 
keeping them up to date by regularly conducting the CAN. Paraguay has also 
developed the National Strategy for Statistical Development, based on the principles 

                                                
4  On a scale of 0 to 100, Paraguay received 28 points, ahead of only Argentina (21) and Venezuela (14) in 

a group of 13 Latin American and Caribbean countries that averaged 45. The best score was obtained 
by Mexico (82), followed by Brazil (71). Among the items with the lowest score were: (i) coordination 
within the statistical system, strategic vision and planning, and trained human resources, with a score of 
0; (ii) data collection technologies, with 9; and (iii) awareness of quality, with 23.

of the PARIS 21 initiative.7 Nevertheless, the statistical sector is not coordinated as 
a whole, nor is there one institution with the legal mandate to lead and coordinate 
the process of preparing statistics across sectors and institutions. 

1.11 Paraguay’s most recent agricultural census was performed in 2008 and was the fifth 
in the country’s history since 1944. A decade has passed since that census 
(CAN 2008), and the information from it no longer reflects the current conditions in 
the country. It lacks the data to assess quality (omission and nonresponse rates), 
nor is there data on information requests classified by type of user or how that 
information is used. Some users have questioned the reliability of the data, because 
of the way the field work was done, and the data processed. The data are also not 
broken down by thematic area: gender and indigenous peoples. Paraguay does not 
have a system of regular, reliable surveys to monitor and follow up on trends 
occurring after the previous intercensal period (1981-2008). Data need to be 
quantified on the expansion of the land area devoted to annual crops, deforestation, 
new operators and the development of technology-based business production 
models, news ways of organizing production, and other developments. 

1.12 The Office of Agricultural Censuses and Statistics (DCEA) is the unit of the Ministry 
of Agriculture and Livestock (MAG) responsible for “preparing and updating 
agricultural statistics, for which it regularly conducts the National Agricultural 
Census.”8 A preliminary assessment of the current organizational and financial 
structure of the DCEA reveals weaknesses in: (i) technical human resources, in 
terms of both number and knowledge that is sufficiently up to date to work using 
advanced technologies and statistical methods (out of 39 DCEA employees, only 
15 have university degrees, and 50% of those have low levels of training or outdated 
knowledge of census procedures); (ii) equipment and materials (100% of computer 
hardware is obsolete, and the vehicle fleet has been reduced by 80% over the last 
five years); and (iii) strategic planning for data collection based on statistical 
methods. Annual DCEA estimates of agricultural output are derived from data 
provided by authorized data reporters, which is an imprecise and unreliable type of 
information. Consequently, strengthening the DCEA both technically and 
administratively would benefit the decision-making and policy formulation process of 
the MAG, and particularly its Bureau of Planning (DGP)9 responsible for planning, 
monitoring, coordination, and assessment, as well as other public and private 
entities.  

1.13 The assessments mentioned above clearly underscore the need to strengthen 
country systems for agricultural statistics. This means not only having more 
information available, but improving the timeliness and quality of that information in 
a cost-effective manner. Adopting modern information technologies is a key factor 
in meeting these objectives, as their benefits in quality and economic efficiency have 
been proven in other countries. An example is the use of personal digital assistants 
(PDAs) to conduct surveys and censuses, known as computer-assisted personal 
interviewing (CAPI), instead of pen-and-paper interviewing (PAPI). Reliability, 
accuracy, timeliness, accessibility, and consistency are all quality indicators for

censuses that show improvements with the use of these new technologies (Baker 
et al, 1995; Caeyers et al., 2011; Seligson and Moreno Morales, 2015; Benstead et 
al., 2017). 

1.14 The Bank’s experience. Since 2007, the Bank has approved a series of investment 
loans to help support censuses and strengthen statistical systems. These include: 
the Program to Support the Economic Census (loan 1918/BL-PR); Program to 
Develop the National Statistical System through the 2012 Population and Housing 
Census (loan 2542/BL-PR); Project to Improve the Agricultural Statistical 
Information System and the Agricultural Information Service for Rural Development 
in Peru (loan 3272/OC-PE); and the Sustainable Agricultural Development Program 
(loan 3798/BL-GY). Public good ATN/OC-14750-RG, Development of a 
Methodology for the Implementation of Agricultural Statistics Systems in Latin 
America and the Caribbean, is also now in execution.  

1.15 Based on these operations, as well as the recommendations of the FAO’s World 
Programme for the Census of Agriculture (WCA 2020) and IDB technical note 
“Experiencias en el diseño estadístico y realización de censos nacionales del sector 
agropecuario y rural” [Experiences in the statistical design and implementation of 
national censuses of the agricultural and rural sector] (document IDB-TN-366), 
Table 2 presents the main lessons learned and the how these have been 
incorporated into the design of the proposed operation. 

 
Table 2. Lesson Learned 

Recommendations Incorporation into program design 

1. The National Agricultural Census (CAN) 
must be considered part of an integrated 

national statistical system. 

The program includes the generation of integrated 
information (census and surveys) of the national 
agricultural statistics system, as input for the 
national statistical system. 

2. Pilot testing is necessary to prepare a 
high quality census questionnaire. 

The program calls for a pilot to review and adjust 
critical parameters, such as the duration of surveys 
and the data collection and analysis method. 

3. As a project activity, it is important to 
make respondents, producers, and users 
aware of the value of accurate statistical 
information and utilizing that information to 
improve the quality of public policy and 
decision-making. 

The program will finance a communication and 
dissemination plan to raise awareness in the target 
population prior to collecting information, along with 
widespread dissemination of findings through 

various sources. 

4. The extensive involvement of public 
and private sector users in designing the 
census questionnaire ensures that useful 

information is collected. 

To design the census questionnaire, the program 
calls for workshops with the participation of public 
and private sector users. 

5. Political commitment to the census at 
the highest level is important. 

The program includes joint activities with 
Agricultural Advisory Council (CAA) to ensure that 
it is a political priority. 

6. Include the gender perspective in the 
design of the questionnaires. 

The program supports the incorporation of 
questions that will generate information on gender 
and diversity in census and survey forms, following 
the guidelines of the FAO’s WCA 2020.

Recommendations Incorporation into program design 

7. Work with advanced technologies for 
data collection. 

The program incorporates the use of PDAs for 
personal interviews and a Web-based data 
transmission system to enhance data quality and 
reduce the time required for collection and 
analysis. It also includes the use of satellite 
imagery to make land-use and production 
estimates. The use of PDAs will also facilitate the 
implementation and quality control of the census. 

8. Institution-strengthening must be 
prioritized to ensure census continuity and 
the ongoing quality and dissemination of 
statistical information. 

The program includes investments to help 
strengthen the DCEA, so that data collection, 
analysis, and dissemination actions are 
sustainable. A cooperation agreement with the 
DGEEC is also planned. 

9. Synchronized administrative 
management is necessary when 
executing a mass data collection 
operation. 

The program calls for a company or international 
agency with experience in human resource 
management to be engaged for the selection and 
hiring of census takers. 

 

1.16 The country’s sector strategy. The project is linked primarily to the principal points 
and objectives of the National Development Plan 2030, as well as the MAG’s 
Agricultural Strategic Framework 2014-2018 and Institutional Strategic Plan 
2014-2018. In terms of the National Development Plan 2030 and its major areas of 
strategic focus—poverty reduction and social development, inclusive economic 
growth, and positioning Paraguay as a global player—the project will provide 
essential input to identify evidence-based actions to support farming families and 
rural populations. The program will also contribute to the MAG’s Agricultural 
Strategic Framework 2014-2018 by supporting public policy design and the adoption 
of sector development measures, as one of the objectives is to make information 
available for such purposes. The program also fits into the MAG’s Institutional 
Strategic Plan 2014-2018 by supporting the establishment of an agricultural 
information system that integrates information on climate, economics, and 
technology, as well as statistical synthesis and studies of current economic 
conditions and sector performance, to provide the different users with data for 
decision-making. 

1.17 The Bank’s country strategy. This operation is aligned with the Bank’s country 
strategy with Paraguay 2014-2018 (document GN-2769), since it contributes to the 
strategic objective to “Increase the supply of agricultural public goods and services.” 

1.18 Strategic alignment. The program is consistent with the Update to the Institutional 
Strategy 2010-2020 (document AB-3008), specifically the crosscutting themes of: 
(i) institutional capacity and rule of law, as it seeks to strengthening the institutions 
that generate agricultural statistics; (ii) gender equality and diversity, as it generates 
differentiated information by thematic area: gender and indigenous peoples; and 
(iii) climate change and environmental sustainability, as it provides reliable 
information for building a national emissions inventory. The program is also aligned 
the Corporate Results Framework 2016-2019 (document GN-2727-6) under the 
indicator, “Government agencies benefited by projects that strengthen technological 
and managerial tools to improve public service delivery,” through the outcome 
indicator “Improvement in institutional capacity to collect and process agricultural 
statistics” in the program’s Results Matrix. It is consistent with the Dimension of 



 - 7 - 
 
 

 
Success 1 of the Agriculture and Natural Resources Management Sector 
Framework Document (document GN-2709-5), which advocates that agriculture in 
the region achieve high levels of productivity and proposes the modernization of 
statistics systems as an activity under its second line of action. Lastly, it is consistent 
with the Sector Strategy on Institutions for Growth and Social Welfare (document 
GN-2587-2) through support for public sector management through integrated 
information systems. 

1.19 Approximately 6% of the resources of this operation will be invested in climate 
change adaptation activities, based on the joint methodology of the multilateral 
development banks for estimating climate finance. These resources contribute to 
the IDB Group’s goal to increase the financing of climate change-related projects to 
30% of total approvals by the end of 2020. 

B. Objectives, components, and cost 

1.20 The general objective of this project is to contribute to improving the availability and 
quality of agricultural information in the country, to support decision-making by public 
and private stakeholders. The program has the following components: 

1.21 Component 1: Design and implementation of the agricultural census 
(US$10.32 million). This component will finance the implementation of the 
agricultural census with emphasis on guaranteeing quality, proper thematic 
coverage, and the timely and wide dissemination of the information generated. As 
an innovation, this census will adopt the use of an electronic questionnaire and data 
capture using mobile devices in the field. The census will have a crosscutting gender 
approach, to get women more involved and increase their visibility in their role as 
both producers and workers. All relevant information will also be disaggregated by 
indigenous community and will address issues of environmental conservation. The 
agricultural census process to be financed will have the following stages: 
(i) pre-census: cartographic updates and georeferencing of farms, pre-census 
survey, and development of the data capture system; (ii) census: data collection pilot 
test and field operation; and (iii) post-census: data quality analysis, post-census 
survey, and dissemination of results. To promote the quality of data collection, this 
component also envisages: (i) validations and controls in the electronic form that 
assist census takers in their work; (ii) a pilot test in the field to validate the electronic 
forms; and (iii) dissemination actions to inform and motivate the respondent 
population. An information processing and analysis system will be developed that 
encompasses everything from database consolidation and quality control to the 
generation of the primary tabulations and making the information (including 
microdata) available to users online, in as much detail as permitted by laws and 
regulations on the confidentiality of the information. As an additional layer of quality 
control for the information generated, a post-census survey is planned to validate 
the accuracy of the census itself.  

1.22 Component 2: Institutional strengthening of the entities in the agricultural 
statistics system (US$3.67 million). This component will strengthen the capacity 
of the Office of Agricultural Censuses and Statistics (DCEA) to generate reliable and 
up-to-date agricultural statistics. The strengthening process includes: (i) developing 
IT tools to support the adoption of best practices for agricultural censuses; 
(ii) updating knowledge of census processes in the region by sending DCEA 
technical staff abroad and hiring experts to bring DCEA technical staff up to date on 

https://publications.iadb.org/handle/11319/7807
https://publications.iadb.org/handle/11319/7807

practices used; (iii) renovating buildings; (iv) purchasing computer hardware; 
(v) purchasing vehicles to ensure that the DCEA can operate throughout rural areas; 
(vi) developing a model for the use of satellite imagery to produce agricultural 
statistics that can be validated with census information; (vii) conducting thematic 
studies with the census information; and (viii) conducting two surveys built on the 
census sampling frame to update relevant information on the sector. The topics of 
these surveys will depend on the studies and policy priorities, but may include 
agriculture, livestock, production costs, and family farming. Agricultural statistics are 
also expected to be incorporated into the national statistical system under an 
agreement with the DGEEC. 

C. Key results indicators 

1.23 The program Results Matrix has been agreed upon with the borrower (Annex II) and 
contains impact, outcome, and output indicators for the program, as well as its 
baselines and targets. In keeping with the program objective, the impact indicators 
also seek to capture the two dimensions of availability and quality of agricultural 
information. As a substitute for availability, the number of census information 
requests is used as an indicator. The indicator to evaluate the expected changes in 
the quality of information will be user ratings. At the outcome level, indicators are 
included for three different dimensions: (i) the quality of the census will be assessed 
by comparing the census results to the results of the post-census survey, omission 
rate, and nonresponse rate; (ii) the improvement in the timeliness and availability of 
agricultural information will be verified through a shorter time lag between the 
conclusion of field work and publication of the final results, as well as through a 
shorter time devoted to data collection in the field; and (iii) the improvement in 
agricultural statistical capacity will be assessed through the rating of installed 
capacities for the production and dissemination of agricultural and rural statistics.  

1.24 As an added benefit, strengthening the agricultural census makes the source of 
information used to build Paraguay’s national emissions inventory more reliable, 
enabling Paraguay to comply with current requirements under the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and transparency guidelines 
under the Paris Agreement.10 It also generates information on land use (pastures, 
forests, crops), livestock, etc., that can be used to assess resilience, design public 
policies on adaptation, and makes it possible to pose specific questions on mitigation 
and/or adaptation. The program will also benefit Paraguayan farmers and ranchers 
(currently estimated at 300,000), public and private institutions, and other links in the 
agrifood chain. 

1.25 The use of mobile devices for data capture and satellite imagery are technological 
innovations that will benefit the country’s statistical capacity in the context of the 
agreement signed with the DGEEC. The program will also receive advisory support 
from the National Secretariat for Information and Communication Technologies 
(SENATICs) on the technical specifications of computer hardware and connectivity. 
These interagency agreements, along with efforts to strengthen the MAG/DCEA, 
aim to make the generation of agricultural statistics sustainable. 

                                                
10  The Paris Agreement (2015) is part of the UNFCCC, which establishes measures to reduce greenhouse 

gas emissions through mitigation, adaptation, and resilience of ecosystems to the effects of global 
warming.

1.26 Economic viability. The economic analysis of the program was based on the 

economic viability of the 2018 National Agricultural Census (CAN 2018), the costs 
of which represent nearly 80% of total program resources. The analysis of the 
economic viability of the census employed the least-cost methodology (a specific 
instance of cost-effectiveness analysis). This methodology is commonly used in 
interventions of this nature, when it is recognized that the benefits (statistical 
information, in this case) have a very high value, but one that is difficult to quantify. 

1.27 The anticipated costs of the agricultural census indicate that it will be cost-effective 
(See optional electronic link 1). The estimated total cost of CAN 2018 is 
US$11,627,262,11 including all aspects of the preparation, survey, processing, and 
dissemination phases. The estimated number of productive units to be enumerated 
will be around 300,000, yielding a cost per productive unit of US$39.12 This figure is 
higher than was budgeted for the agricultural censuses in Nicaragua (2011, US$23) 
and Honduras (2008, US$27), but lower than was budgeted in Brazil (2018, US$47) 
or the actual figure in Uruguay (2011, US$73). Factoring in the land area (which 
affects the cost of field work), the cost per square kilometer of CAN 2018 in 
Paraguay will be US$29, which is higher than in Uruguay (2011, US$18.5) and 
similar to Brazil (2018, US$29), but lower than in Nicaragua (2011, US$49) and 
Honduras (2008, US$71). The cost of the agricultural census will therefore be within 
the range of costs of other recent agricultural censuses performed in countries of the 
region. 

1.28 Another relevant comparison is the costs budgeted for the census using 
computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) (US$11,627,262) versus the costs 
that would be expected using pen-and-paper interviewing (PAPI) (US$12,330,855). 
The use of PDAs instead of paper questionnaires will save approximately 
US$700,000. This figure does not reflect the fact that CAPI offers better quality 
control than PAPI, so the financial gains of adopting CAPI are even greater. 

II. FINANCING STRUCTURE AND MAIN RISKS 

A. Financing instruments 

2.1 This project is designed as a specific investment loan under the Flexible Financing 
Facility (document FN-655-1) and the specific investment modality. Its total cost is 
US$15 million, to be financed totally by the Bank from the Ordinary Capital 
resources. 

                                                
11  This figure includes the amount of Component 1, plus an amount corresponding to equipment and 

management and evaluation costs for the project. 
12  All figures presented in the economic viability analysis are expressed in 2016 U.S. dollars. The sources 

of this data are the FAO, Uruguay’s Office of Agricultural Statistics (DIEA), and the DCEA (Paraguay).

B. Environmental and social safeguard risks 

2.3 In accordance with the Environment and Safeguards Compliance Policy 
(Operational Policy OP-703), the Bank has analyzed the potential environmental and 
social risks of this operation and classified it as category “B,” with a moderate level 
of risk. No significant environmental or social risks have been identified in the 
sociocultural analysis prepared for this project. The identified environmental and 
social risks relate primarily to interactions between census takers and the indigenous 
population, risks faced by census takers when travelling to socially complex areas, 
and the risk that the census questionnaire may not be sensitive enough to the 
sociocultural complexity of indigenous peoples and gender issues in agriculture. The 
sociocultural analysis includes recommendations on these issues to promote the 
inclusion of vulnerable population groups like indigenous peoples and small family 
farmers, with a gender approach. 

2.4 In accordance with Operational Policy OP-703, Directive B.6, this project requires at 
least one public consultation. This requirement was met with two consultations 
conducted with key stakeholders: (i) one with public and private sector data users, 
and (ii) another with the National Organization of Indigenous Peoples (ONPI). 
Additional consultations with other social actors are also planned as part of the 
census preparation process, especially, once a draft census form is ready. More 
information on this matter is included in the annex, Environmental and social 
management report (ESMR). 

C. Fiduciary risks 

2.5 The fiduciary risk is low, so no special mitigation actions are planned. 

D. Other project risks 

2.6 The following was identified as high risk: a government changeover would affect 
priority or execution time. The planned mitigation measure is to rely on political 
consensus and the sectoral private sector, as well as the mandate contained in

Article 8 of Law 81 of 1992, and international commitments (the 2030 Agenda for 
Sustainable Development). The following were identified as medium risks: (i) public 
administration fails to keep pace with census operation needs; (ii) no decree issued 
to conduct the census; (iii) refusal to provide information to census takers; 
(iv) political decisions not to disseminate census results; and (v) loan contract fails 
to enter into effect in 2018. The following mitigation activities were identified and 
agreed upon, supported particularly by the Agricultural Advisory Council (CAA) for 
the census, made up of prominent individuals from the public and private sector, to 
back up policy-level actions at the key entities identified: (i) the CAA will take steps 
to comply with administrative time frames; (ii) work will be done directly with the 
Office of the President; (iii) an efficient communication campaign will be launched 
(local authorities and civil society); (iv) the CAA will take steps to raise awareness 
among public sector stakeholders, with IDB support; and (v) the MAG, CAA, and 
project team will work with Congress for it to take up this law for consideration. 

III. IMPLEMENTATION AND MANAGEMENT PLAN 

A. Summary of implementation arrangements 

3.1 The borrower will be the Republic of Paraguay, and the executing agency will be the 
borrower, acting through the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (MAG), which will 
be fully responsible for administration and supervision of the program. 

3.2 The program will be implemented under the direct supervision of the MAG, acting 
through the Office of Agricultural Censuses and Statistics (DCEA) and the National 
Office of Project Coordination and Administration (DINCAP). The DCEA, supported 
by a program execution unit (PEU) reporting directly to the DCEA director, will 
provide general coordination of program execution, programming, and monitoring, 
ensuring that the conditions and targets set in the loan contract are met, and serving 
as principal liaison between the IDB and the borrower during execution. DINCAP will 
perform administration and finance activities, as well as procurement and 
contracting, in coordination with the PEU. 

3.3 The key positions identified for the PEU for program execution are: (i) general 
coordinator; (ii) Component 1 coordinator; (iii) Component 2 coordinator; 
(iv) financial and administrative specialist; (v) procurement specialist; and 
(vi) planning and monitoring specialist. 

3.4 Special contractual conditions precedent to the first disbursement of the loan 
proceeds: (i) the program execution unit has been established on the terms 
agreed upon with the Bank; and (ii) the borrower has provided evidence, to 
the Bank’s satisfaction, that the program Operating Regulations have entered 
into force. These conditions must be satisfied for implementation to begin. The 
program Operating Regulations establish the basic rules for the execution of the loan 
(e.g., field work, supervision, and regional coordination, information processing and 
analysis, and fiduciary considerations), as well as the responsibilities of PEU 
members.  

3.5 Procurement of works, goods, and nonconsulting services. Procurements 
financed in whole or part with IDB funds will be conducted pursuant to the Policies 
for the Procurement of Works and Goods Financed by the Inter-American 
Development Bank (document GN-2349-9) and the Policies for the Selection and 



 - 12 - 
 
 

 
Contracting of Consultants Financed by the Inter-American Development Bank 
(document GN-2350-9). The procurement plan contains detailed information on the 
procurements to be implemented during execution, as well as the procedures 
followed by the Bank for their review. Numerous low- and medium-skilled operational 
staff will be hired (approximately 5,300 people) to collect CAN information in the 
field. To do so, an international competitive bidding process will be held to engage 
a firm with experience in human resources management, or an international agency 
with such experience will be contracted. No selection processes involving single-
source selection are planned, with the exception of fuel purchases, since this product 
can be obtained from only one source13 under the fuel provision agreement between 
Petróleos Paraguayos (PETROPAR) and the executing agency,14 and other cases 
where it is justified under policy documents GN-2349-9 and GN-2350-9. 

3.6 The Fiduciary Agreements and Requirements (Annex III) establish the framework 
applicable to program execution for financial management and planning, as well as 
procurement supervision and execution. An intervention of this nature entails 
significant travel expenditures and an additional time commitment from employees 
of the MAG or other government agencies called upon to prepare and implement of 
the census, as well as process and disseminate the information generated. The 
estimated expenditure for these tasks is approximately US$1.3 million, broken down 
as follows: per diems (per MAG regulations) (33%), gas (21%), and additional 
compensation (45%). This last item must be justified by the Budget Act and in line 
with expense items 123, 125, and 137, depending on the different cases of 
employees that take on additional work.15 

3.7 Disbursements. The disbursement modality will be as established in the Financial 
Management Guidelines for IDB-financed Projects (document OP-273-6). 
Advances will be made preferably on a six-monthly basis, once justification has been 
provided for at least 80% of the advanced amount. Accountability forms and the 
financial planning spreadsheet must be submitted as documentation.  

3.8 Audits. The PEU will deliver the audited financial statements for the program on an 
annual basis during execution on the terms required by the Bank. The project will 
require the selection of a Plus-level independent auditing firm. The audited financial 
statements will be delivered within 120 days after the close of each fiscal year, and 
the closing final statement will be delivered within 120 days following the scheduled 
date for the last disbursement. 

B. Summary of arrangements for monitoring results 

3.9 The project has a detailed monitoring and evaluation plan agreed upon with the 
MAG. The DCEA, acting through the PEU, will be responsible for generating and 
sharing the necessary information with the Bank to track the Results Matrix 
indicators. 

3.10 Monitoring. Throughout project execution, the PEU will prepare and deliver status 
reports to the Bank within 60 days after the end of each six-month period. These

14  Based on Article 316 of Decree 176 implementing Articles 128 and 129 of Law 5554/2016. 

15  The program does not call for counterpart support to be factored into the calculation.

reports will provide a detailed account of physical and financial execution of the 
project, as well as progress on all Results Matrix indicators. The reports will also 
provide a detailed account of issues encountered during project execution, and 
corrective measures taken, as well as explain any deviation from the project 
management instruments (multiyear execution plan, annual work plan (AWP), and 
procurement plan). No later than the last quarter of each year of project execution, 
the PEU will deliver the AWP for the following year, to the Bank’s satisfaction, as 
well as the maintenance plan for equipment purchased with the loan proceeds and 
the plan for meeting the environmental and social requirements established in the 
environmental and social management plan (ESMP). Bank staff will conduct regular 
inspection missions and meet with PEU personnel to discuss the progress of 
activities identified in the AWP, compliance with the Results Matrix indicators, the 
AWP for the following year, and the procurement plan for the next 12 months. 

3.11 In addition to overall monitoring of execution, the project will incorporate several 
different measures to oversee data gathering and ensure the quality of information 
in CAN 2018 and the agricultural surveys in the two subsequent years. Firstly, a 
cartographic update will be done, to minimize the likelihood of omissions or 
duplications during data collection. Secondly, the PDAs used to collect information 
will have a built-in, automatic verification program. This way, any inconsistency in 
responses, whether contradictions or mistakes on the part of the respondent or 
errors on the part of the census taker when entering the information into the PDA, 
will be detected and corrected immediately. Thirdly, CAN 2018 will have a Web-
based data transmission system for the immediate and simultaneous application of 
controls on progress and coverage in the field, and the data registered by census 
takers. 

3.12 As established in the monitoring and evaluation plan, the project will have a midterm 
and a final evaluation. The midterm evaluation will be conducted 90 days after the 
date on which 50% of the loan proceeds have been committed, or 50% of the 
execution period has elapsed, whichever occurs first. The objective of the midterm 
evaluation will be to review the progress of all activities, examine the causes of any 
potential deviation from the planned progress, and propose corrective measures. 
The final evaluation will be conducted 90 days after the date on which 95% of the 
loan proceeds have been disbursed. These reports will include: (i) financial 
execution by subcomponent and the source of financing; (ii) progress on outputs, 
outcomes, and impacts included in the Results Matrix; (iii) compliance with the 
ESMP; (iv) summary of financial statements, procurements, disbursements, and 
internal control; (v) review of implementation; and (vi) lessons learned. Both the 
midterm and final evaluation will be conducted by external consultants independent 
of the PEU. 

3.13 Impact assessment. The project will have a “before and after” evaluation of the 
impact indicators included in the Results Matrix, conducted as part of the final 
evaluation described above and the project completion report (PCR). 

3.14 Additionally, CAN 2018 will include a post-census survey to measure omission and 
nonresponse rates, as well as the accuracy of certain key variables included in the 
census. This will make it possible to get an exact final value for the outcome 
indicators included in the Results Matrix. Significantly, there is no known experience 
with post-census surveys in the case of agricultural censuses, so this will be the only

census in the region to conduct such a survey. For that reason, CAN 2018 will not 
only yield benefits for Paraguay, but serve as an international benchmark.

The objective of the project is to contribute to improving the availability and quality of agricultural information in the country to support the decision-making of public and private agents. To 

achieve this objective, the project will implement two components: 1) Design and implementation of the Agricultural Census; and 2) Institutional strengthening of the entities in charge of 

the agricultural statistics system.

The documentation is well structured, with a good diagnosis of the problems and main weaknesses faced by the national agricultural statistics system, including institutional weaknesses, 

inadequate methods and statistical practices used, and lack of coordination in the national statistical system. Likewise, aspects of the previous agricultural census are identified that can 

be improved upon in terms of data quality, and the dissemination and use of these data.

The proposed solution is in line with the problems identified. The results matrix (RM) reflects the objectives of the program and shows a clear vertical logic. Higher-level indicators reflect 

benchmarks established in other censuses to measure data quality. The lower level indicators reflect the design of each component. The RM includes SMART indicators at the levels of 

impacts, results and outputs with their respective baseline values, targets, and means to collect information. Empirical evidence is provided on the utility and effectiveness of implementing 

surveys using the Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) method; however, the external validity of this evidence is not alluded to.

The economic analysis is based on a cost-effectiveness analysis. The cost per survey, and per square kilometer, is compared between this and other censuses in the region. The census 

cost is identified using the CAPI method and it is compared to the cost of the counterfactual if the PAPI (Pen-And-Paper Interviewing) method was used. The results indicate that the 

CAPI method will provide a census of better quality and at a lower cost. A sensitivity analysis is performed based on the main costs. The results indicate that the CAPI method will allow 

the country to save a significant amount of resources, which is in contrast if the census was done using the PAPI method.

The monitoring and evaluation plan proposes an evaluation using two methods: 1) reflexive evaluation; and 2) ex post cost-effectiveness assessment. The reflexive evaluation will use the 

results of the census and a post-census survey to measure the quality of the data in terms of omission and non-response rates. These results will provide important information, since 

there is no evidence from another agricultural census carried out in the region that undertakes a post-census survey to verify the quality of the data

The risks identified in the risk matrix seem reasonable. Risks include mitigation actions and compliance indicators.

FIDUCIARY AGREEMENTS AND REQUIREMENT 

Country: Republic of Paraguay 

Project name: Project to Implement the Census and Agricultural Surveys 
System 

Project number: PR-L1147 

Executing agency Republic of Paraguay, acting through the Ministry of 
Agriculture and Livestock (MAG) 

Prepared by: Fernando Glasman, Bruno Candia, and Jorge Luis Gonzalez 
(Fiduciary Specialists) 

 

I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

1.1 The institutional evaluation for the project’s fiduciary management was based on: 
(i) the fiduciary context of the country; (ii) the findings of the fiduciary risk 
assessment and project risk management workshop; and (iii) the September 2017 
report on findings using the Institutional Capacity Assessment System (ICAS) on the 
National Office of Project Coordination and Administration (DINCAP). The fiduciary 
agreements applicable in project execution have been prepared as a result of this 
evaluation. 

II. FIDUCIARY CONTEXT OF THE COUNTRY 

2.1 In general terms, the country systems for financial management have a medium 
level of development; nevertheless, these systems need to be supplemented for the 
execution of Bank-financed projects. Specific financial reports are prepared through 
auxiliary accounting systems. Financial control tools such as the Integrated Financial 
Administration System (SIAF), the Integrated Accounting Subsystem (SICO), and 
other subsystems allow the executing agency to manage payment transfers to 
vendors under acceptable conditions through the Central Bank of Paraguay. The 
integration of these tools will allow audited financial statements for a program or 
project to be prepared in the SIAF in the future; in the meantime, parallel systems 
are used. External control is currently performed through private audit firms. 

2.2 In terms of the country’s Public Sector Procurement System (SCSP), the Bank 
makes full use of the Public Procurement Information System (SICP), as well as the 
country subsystems electronic for reverse auction and competitive bidding, for the 
amounts and categories established in the agreement for the use of these 
subsystems signed between Paraguay and the Bank on 17 June 2014.  



Annex III 
Page 2 of 6 
 
 

III. FIDUCIARY CONTEXT OF THE EXECUTING AGENCY 

3.1 The executing agency will be the Republic of Paraguay, acting through the Ministry 
of Agriculture and Livestock (MAG), with the support of the Office of Agricultural 
Censuses and Statistics (DCEA) and DINCAP. The DCEA, supported by a program 
execution unit (PEU) reporting directly to the DCEA director, will provide general 
coordination of program execution, programming, and monitoring, ensuring that the 
conditions and targets set in the loan contract are met, and serving as principal 
liaison between the IDB and the borrower during execution. DINCAP will perform 
administration and finance activities, as well as procurement and contracting, in 
coordination with the PEU.  

3.2 Considering the MAG’s satisfactory fiduciary performance in the execution of prior 
operations (loans 1255/OC-PR and 1800/OC-PR), acting through DINCAP, no 
fiduciary risks are anticipated that could affect meeting the program objectives. 
Nonetheless, the institutional capacity assessment of the MAG was updated during 
the preparation phase of the operation in the following areas: planning and 
organization, capacity to execute the activities programmed and organized 
(administration of personnel, goods, and services, and financial management), and 
control. The consolidated result for the MEG capabilities evaluated using the ICAS 
exhibits a medium level of development, which is associated with medium risk. 

IV. FIDUCIARY RISK EVALUATION AND MITIGATION ACTIONS 

4.1 Based on the evaluations of the MAG and our experience to date, the opportunities 
for improvement are concentrated in the strengthening of accounting and internal 
control. 

4.2 Procurement management. The fiduciary risk is low, so no special mitigation 
actions are envisaged.  

4.3 Financial management. The internal control unit lacks formal procedures for the 
monitoring of project-related activities. For that reason, the DCEA will prepare a 
procedures manual for the PEU that will be approved by MAG authorities. 

V. CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE SPECIAL PROVISIONS OF THE CONTRACT 

5.1 The following agreements and requirements should be included in the special 
provisions:  

a. A special bank account to be opened for the exclusive use of the program.  

b. The executing agency will deliver the audited annual and final financial 
statements for the project, with specific terms of reference acceptable to the 
Bank, within 120 days after the close of each fiscal year of the executing 
agency during the original disbursement period or its extensions. The final 
audit report will be delivered within 120 days after the close of the original 
disbursement period or its extensions.

VI. FIDUCIARY AGREEMENTS AND REQUIREMENTS FOR  
PROCUREMENT EXECUTION 

6.1 The applicable procurement policies for this loan are documents GN-2349-9 and 
GN-2350-9. The Bank’s Board of Executive Directors also approved the use of the 
electronic reverse auction and competitive bidding subsystems (document 
GN-2538-11) of the SCSP (Law 2051/03). The use of other country systems 
accepted subsequent to approval of the project will be implemented automatically, 
and so stated in the procurement plan. 

6.2 Procurement of works, goods, and nonconsulting services. Contracts for 
works, goods, and nonconsulting services1 subject to international competitive 
bidding (ICB) will be executed using the standard bidding documents issued by the 
Bank. Bidding processes subject to national competitive bidding will be conducted 
using national bidding documents agreed upon with the Bank. The project sector 
specialist will be responsible for reviewing the technical specifications of 
procurements during the preparation of selection processes. No selection processes 
involving single-source selection are planned initially, with the exception of fuel 
purchases under the fuel provision agreement between Petróleos Paraguayos 
(PETROPAR) and the executing agency,2 and other cases where it is justified under 
policy documents GN-2349-9 and GN-2350-9.  

6.3 Numerous low- and medium skilled operational staff will be hired (approximately 
5,300 people) to collect information in the field. To do so, an international competitive 
bidding process will be held to engage a firm with experience in human resources 
management, or an international agency with such experience will be contracted. 
The estimated budget to engage this firm is US$335,895, and the estimated 
personnel expenditure is US$7,028,731. 

6.4 Selection and contracting of consultants. Consulting service contracts generated 
under the project will be executed using the standard request for proposals issued 
or agreed upon with the Bank. The project sector specialist will be responsible for 
reviewing the terms of reference for the contracting consulting services.  

a. Selection of individual consultants. Pursuant to the procurement policies 
contained in document GN-2350-9. 

b. Training. A procurement workshop will be held. 

c. Use of country system. Pursuant to document GN-2538 of October 2013, the 
use of the SCSP electronic reverse auction and competitive bidding 
subsystems in Bank-financed operations will apply:  

(i) To all contracts for goods and nonconsulting services subject to the use 
of the electronic reverse auction procedure under the SCSP and 
involving amounts below the Bank’s established threshold for the 
shopping method for off-the-shelf goods (for reference, US$250,000)..  

(ii) To all contracts for works involving amounts below the Bank’s 
established threshold for use of the competitive bidding (shopping) 

                                                
1  Document GN-2349-9, paragraph 1.1: Nonconsulting services are treated as goods.

method for complex works (for reference, US$250,000), and for 
contracts for goods and nonconsulting services up to the amount 
established by the Bank for use of the shopping method for complex 
goods and services (for reference, US$50,000) 

(iii) Contracts for amounts equal to or greater than the aforementioned 
amounts will be governed by Bank policies (document GN-2349-9). 

6.5 Section 1 of the Bank policies (document GN-2349-9) will continue to be applicable 
to all executed contracts, regardless of amount or procurement method. Any system 
or subsystem approved subsequently will be applicable to this operation. The 
operation’s procurement plan and its updates will indicate what contracts are to be 
executed through the approved country systems.3 

6.6 Recurring expenditures. An intervention of this nature entails significant travel 
expenditures and an additional time commitment from employees of the MAG or 
other government agencies called upon to prepare and implement of the census, as 
well as process and disseminate the information generated. The estimated 
expenditure for these tasks is approximately US$1.3 million, broken down as follows: 
per diems (per MAG regulations) (33%), gas (21%), and additional compensation 
(45%). This last item must be justified by the Budget Act and in line with expense 
items 123, 125, and 137, depending on the different cases of employees that take 
on additional work. 

6.7 Advance procurement/retroactive financing. None for this operation. 

6.8 Domestic preference. None for this operation.

6.9 Procurement supervision. All procurement processes governed by policy 
documents GN-2349-9 and GN-2350-9 will be subject to ex ante review by the Bank, 
considering the position of the Ministry of Finance on the matter. Supervision of all 
procurement processes governed by the SCSP electronic reverse auction and 
competitive bidding subsystems (document GN- 2538-11) will be conducted through 
the country’s system.4 

6.10 Special provisions. No special provisions are anticipated, beyond those specified 
in paragraph 5.1. 

6.11 Records and files. The agreed formats and procedures to be described in the 
project’s Fiduciary Manual of Functions and Procedures should be used for the 
preparation and filing of project reports. 

VII. FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 

7.1 Programming and budget. (a) The PEU, reporting to the DCEA and in coordination 
with DINCAP, will centralize the coordination of execution, supported by other 
departments and units of the MAG, as necessary; and (b) the MAG will be 
responsible for budget programming, administration, and execution, under the zero-
based budget system. 

                                                
4  Depending on the scope of use of the system, supervision may be supplemented by project audits. If so, it 

should be mentioned in this Annex.

Annex III 
Page 6 of 6 
 
 

7.2 Accounting and information systems. The country uses the modified cash basis 
of accounting; however, cash basis accounting is used for the accountability process 
of IDB-financed projects.  

a. Information systems. The PEU will have access to the SIAF through 
DINCAP. The country systems do not issue the reports necessary for the Bank. 
These reports are prepared using different systems, which creates additional 
work for the PEU. 

b. Disbursements and cash flow. Program disbursements will be made through 
advances of funds, which must be corroborated through the monthly 
submission of a detailed financial plan for up to six months, and another for a 
longer period, which can be used to determine the program’s actual demand 
inferred from the multiyear execution plan, annual work plan, and procurement 
plan. The second and subsequent disbursements will be subject to the 
justification of 80% of the previous advance.  

c. Exchange rate. The exchange rate agreed upon with the executing agency for 
accountability will be decided by the borrower and executing agency during the 
loan negotiation process. 

d. Internal control and internal audit. The ICAS establishes an improvement 
plan for internal control. Additionally, the MAG internal audit unit does not 
include Bank-financed projects in its audit plan.  

e. External control and reports. The executing agency must deliver annual 
program audit reports prepared by an independent audit firm accepted by the 
Bank, on terms of reference previously approved by the Bank. The project's 
financial statements include a cash flow statement, statement of accrued 
investment income, the notes to these financial statements, and the statement 
from the project management team. The audit report will include evaluation of 
the internal control system. The project will require the selection of a Plus-level 
independent audit firm. External audits will be covered with loan proceeds, 
estimated at US$260,000 over the planned five years of execution of the loan. 

f. Financial supervision plan. Financial supervision may be adjusted based on 
project execution and internal audit reports.

Executive Summary 

Project Overview: The cashew nut sector stands out as one of the highest value-added flagship 

sectors featuring in the Government's Action Programme (GAP, 2016-2021), given its: (i) high 

potential to contribute to employment and income generation; (ii) contribution to food and 

nutritional security; and (iii) great export potential. Cashew nut is the country's second-largest 

agricultural export product after cotton, and accounts for 3% of the gross national product (GNP) 

and 25% of the income from agricultural exports. The project area alone generates more than 87% 

of national production. However, it is among the areas with the highest poverty rates, with an 

incidence of poverty rising from 36.2% in 2011 to 40.1% in 2015, well above the national average 

of 30.2%. With the strategic orientations of both Benin and the Bank in mind, the project design 

places particular emphasis on: (i) food and nutritional security; (ii) development of the sector's 

value chain, including local processing of raw cashew nuts (RCN); (iii) employment of youth and 

women; (iv) climate change (CC), strengthening population resilience and improving endogenous 

production systems. The project’s sector objective is to contribute to poverty reduction and improve 

food and nutritional security; its specific objective is to support a sustainable increase in stakeholder 

income and sector productivity. The project's total cost is UA 14.59 million and will take 5 years 

to execute. The main expected outputs include: (i) re-profiling 145 km of access roads; (ii) building 

and equipping 5 RCN storage warehouses each with a capacity of one thousand tonnes; (iii) 

rehabilitating 15,000 ha of old cashew nut plantations and supporting the creation of a modern 

cashew orchard of 3,000 ha for an expected improved yield of 700 kg per hectare; (iv) supporting 

job creation, identified in the various links of the sector, for 10,000 youths and women; (v) 

supporting the construction and equipment of 20 satellite RCN shelling units for the benefit mainly 

of women and 20 walnut and cashew apple processing units; (vi) installing 5 mini-power plants of 

10Kwc and 30 improved village water systems for communities and industrial processing units; 

and (vii) providing assistance to stakeholders in the sector to access bank credit through a 

facilitation fund hosted by the National Agricultural Development Fund (FNDA). In total, the 

project will directly reach more than 75,000 stakeholders in the sector, 30% of whom are women. 

Needs Assessment. RCN production in 2017 was estimated at 100,000 tonnes on 213,000 ha by 

200,000 small-scale producers. The sector's main constraints to development include: (i) the low 

yield of plantations (350 kg/ha compared to a world average of more than 900 kg/ha); (ii) the 

inadequacy and/or poor quality of agricultural infrastructure (storage warehouses, access roads); 

(iii) the low capacity of processing units (10% of national production); (iv) the non-existence or 

limited availability of bank credit; and (v) the organisational weakness of sector stakeholders. 

Value-added for the Bank. The project area has significant agricultural potential that has not been 

fully developed but is also one of the regions with the highest rates of poverty in the country. The 

project will contribute to the sustainable alleviation of food and nutrition insecurity and persistent 

poverty by focusing on women, youths, smallholders and private RCN processing initiatives, 

thereby contributing to attaining the Bank's High 5 strategic objectives, including "Feed Africa," 

"Industrialise Africa" and "Improve the quality of life for the people of Africa." 

Knowledge Management. The project will promote cropping systems that combine cashew nuts 

with food crops to meet food and nutritional security needs, while raising the RCN production and 

processing level for the market (increasing stakeholder income). The project will serve as a test 

model for sustainable management of tree plantations, based on the capacity of cashew tree 

plantations to sequestrate carbon, combat land degradation (climate change mitigation and 

adaptation), diversify and strengthen the livelihood of local communities, thus contributing to 

poverty reduction in the project area.

MANAGEMENT REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 

CONCERNING A LOAN AND GRANT PROPOSAL TO THE REPUBLIC OF BENIN TO 

FINANCE THE CASHEW NUTS SECTOR AND AGRICULTURAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP 

DEVELOPMENT SUPPORT PROJECT (PADEFA-ENA) 
 

Management hereby submits this report and recommendations concerning a proposal to extend an ADF loan 

of UA 7.12 million and award an ADF grant of UA 5.91 million to the Republic of Benin to finance PADEFA-

ENA. 

I. STRATEGIC THRUST AND RATIONALE  

1.1. Project Linkages with Country Strategy and Objectives  

1.1.1 The Government launched its Action Programme in December 2016 (PAG, 2016-2021), entitled 

"Benin Revealed"1 (PEA 2017), as the sole reference framework for Government action. The agricultural 

strategy, as outlined in the PAG, aims to make agriculture the main driver of wealth and job creation. The 

strategy comprises 7 agricultural development clusters (PDAs) and the promotion of 6 key agro-food sectors, 

including cashew nuts. The agricultural component of the PAG is based on the National Plan for Agricultural 

Investment and Food and Nutritional Security (PNIASAN, 2017-2021), which operationalises the Strategic 

Plan for the Development of the Agricultural Sector (PSDSA, 2017-2025). The key outcomes targeted through 

the Investment Plan include: (i) an annual increase in agricultural production of at least 6% between 2017 and 

2021; (ii) increased yields and reduced post-production loss rates in the agricultural, livestock and fisheries 

sectors; (iii) improved local processing rates for agricultural products; and (iv) increased employment created 

in priority value chains (for at least 30% of women).  

1.1.2. Youth employment remains a major and priority concern for the government (PAG, 2016-2021). 

Innovations in cashew value chains offer important employment opportunities for young people, including 

women. The project offers agricultural SMEs the opportunity to: (i) optimise access to finance and markets; 

(ii) promote best practice and innovative business models; and (iii) create employment opportunities. 

PADEFA-ENA will support young innovators to create effective business strategies and improve the 

productivity of the cashew nut value chain in Benin. 

1.1.3. The proposed project is fully in line with the main thrusts of Benin's national cashew nut sector 

strategy (SNFAB, 2016 - 2020), the implementation of which it aims to facilitate. The national cashew nut 

sector strategy is based on the following strategic thrusts: (i) improved orchard productivity; (ii) improved 

local capacity to process cashew nut products; (iii) organisation of the cashew nut marketing chain; (iv) cashew 

nut sector research; (v) cashew nut sector stakeholder organisation; (vi) cashew nut sector financing; (vii) 

regulation and legal framework for cashew nut sector development; and (viii) cross-cutting issues (gender, 

environment, climate change, public private partnerships, etc.). 

1.2. Rationale for the Bank’s Involvement 

1.2.1 Aimed at contributing more to the reduction of poverty and regional inequalities in the country, the 

Bank's interventions (CSP, 2017-2021) focus primarily on economically and socially disadvantaged areas with 

significant agricultural potential, including the support measures targeting the cashew nut and livestock 

sectors, and the development of infrastructure to bolster production, processing and access to basic services. 

The proposed project is of particular interest in the cashew tree-prolific area. Cashew nut is the second most 

important export product after cotton; it provides 3% of the country's GNP and 7% of its agricultural GNP; 

8% of the export revenue and 25% of export agricultural receipts. The project impact area (Alibori, Atacora, 

South Borgou, Donga and Collines) alone represents more than 87% of the national production provided by 

nearly 200,000 small-scale farmers. These regions are among the areas with the highest poverty rates, with 

the income poverty rate increasing from 36.2% in 2011 to 40.1% in 2015, above the national average of 30.2%. 

Furthermore, the cashew tree has the dual advantage of generating income in rural areas and sequestering 

carbon in increasingly soil degraded areas, such as the project region. The potential of the cashew nut sector 

includes the high carbon capture capacity, the existence of a local but also a sub-regional market for the sale 

                                                 
1  The choice of this name reflects the ambition of the highest authorities to further reveal the country’s economic potential to the world, thus strengthening 

Benin’s attraction.

of white and roasted almonds, the potential of the rapidly expanding organic fair trade market in Europe, and 

job creation opportunities for youths and women. The major constraints for the sustainable development of 

the cashew nut sector include the absence of coherent and specific policies and actions to promote the sector, 

the low quality of the main final products, such as cashew nuts and kernels, the low productivity of the varieties 

used, inappropriate post-harvest processing of nuts by farmers and wholesale traders, lack of mastery of 

efficient RCN processing techniques by processors, difficulties in accessing bank financing, difficult access 

to efficient inputs and equipment, low level of stakeholder organisation and poor stakeholder management 

capacity.  

The Bank's strategy for the period 2017-2021 aims to support the Government in implementing GAP (2016-

2021) for the structural transformation of the economy and poverty reduction. As a reminder, the CSP (2017-

2021) is structured along two main thrusts: Pillar 1 - develop agricultural and agro-industrial value chains; 

and Pillar 2 - strengthen infrastructure to support competitiveness and regional integration. The Bank's 

interventions under the first pillar support the development of agricultural value chains and agribusiness, 

including assistance for transformative investments; improving the agricultural sector's business environment 

to foster greater private sector involvement; skills development and entrepreneurship, particularly for youths 

and women; access to financing through risk-sharing mechanisms; and rural economic development through 

increased income and improved access to basic social services. Moreover, the proposed project is in line with 

the Bank's Ten-Year Strategy (2013-2022), particularly three of the “High 5s” to transform Africa socially 

and economically: “Feed Africa”, “Industrialise Africa” and “Improve the quality of life for the people of 

Africa.” The project is fully consistent with the Bank's objectives to contribute to the creation of 25 million 

jobs for the youths by 2025 as outlined in its Jobs for Youth in Africa Strategy. 

1.3. Aid Coordination 

1.3.1 The annual net flows of aid from development partners to the country represent nearly 30% of the 

state expenditure budget. Technical and financial partners (TFPs) are organised into joint thematic cooperation 

groups chaired by the Government, with a TFP as facilitator. The sector distribution of the Bank's active 

portfolio reflects the predominance of transport infrastructure (50%), followed by agriculture (33%) and 

energy (13%). This situation illustrates the portfolio's alignment with the Country Strategy (CSP, 2012-2016). 

The Bank is among the main stakeholders in the transport and agricultural sectors. The recent opening of its 

Country Office in Benin, with the effective presence of a Country Manager since January 2018, will contribute

II. PROJECT DESCRIPTION  

The sector objective of the project is to contribute to poverty reduction and improvement of food and 

nutritional security in Benin. The specific objective is to contribute sustainably to raise the income of 

stakeholders and the productivity of the cashew nut chain in Agricultural Growth Pole No. 4 (AGP 4).  

2.1. Project Components 

2.1.1 The project will be grounded on a sector value chain and integration approach to create an enabling 

environment for developing small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the cashew nut sector, for the 

employment of youths and women, and the creation of a sustainable impact on local development. 

2.1.2 Summary of Components: The project will be implemented over five years (2019-2024) through 

three components, the main achievements of which are described in detail in Annex C3 and summarised in 

the table below:

A1: Support for adaptation and carbon sequestration through sustainable management of old and new cashew 

tree plantations. Support for producing improved plant varieties to meet the rehabilitation needs of old 

plantations on 15,000 ha and creating a new 3,000 ha nursery by: (i) supporting agricultural research to 

increase existing mother trees (600 per 120,000 grafts per year), germs (5 per 200 higher tree clones); 4 

polyclonal nurseries of 5 hectares each and 30 irrigated woodlands of 5 hectares each; (ii) establishing 20 

demonstration plots and school grounds for disseminating innovations and new technologies: adapting 

farming and production system resilience to climate change and impact mitigation.  

A2: Supervising producers and creating pools of private service providers, supporting the training of 50 

agricultural advisers to train 25,000 farmers. Supervising 5,000 youths and women private service providers 

in 6 new trades identified for sustainable employment.  

A3: Socio-economic infrastructure rehabilitation/re-profiling of 145 km of feeder roads and building of 5 

cashew nut storage warehouses (1,000 tonnes each); drilling of 15 boreholes with manual power pumps and 

15 improved drinking water supply systems. Equipping 10 villages with a 10 KWp photovoltaic electricity 

system to supply villages and processing units. 

 

B1: Assistance for resilient land tenure security: (i) support for preparing the 20 Rural Land Plans (RLPs); (ii) 

support to Rural Municipalities for disseminating land transaction tools.  

B2: Organising, structuring and strengthening of stakeholders. The activities will be structured around the 

following thrusts: (i) support for structuring within the sector, in particular POs at village level; municipal and 

divisional associations; (ii) support for national professional federations in the various sector links; and (iii) 

institutional support at the grassroots level (IFA).  

B.3. Support for youths and women's entrepreneurship: Support for job creation for 10,000 youths (30% of 

whom are women) in the sector; Support for access to finance for stakeholders in the sector (30% of whom 

are women). Nutritional awareness of 1,500 people, 30% of whom are men. Identifying and strengthening 

existing incubator capacity to support young people in the sector.

2.2. Technical Solutions Adopted and Alternatives Explored 

PADEFA-ENA aims to support the entire cashew nut sector. Improving the quantity of RCNs produced and 

the quality of nut processing are the two key challenges for strengthening the competitiveness of the cashew 

nut sector in Benin, which faces stiff competition from its regional neighbours. It was decided to support the 

entire sector, including the thematic (Component A is intended to support the upstream part of the sector, and 

Component B the downstream) or geographical aspect (central and northern regions covered by the ATDA4, 

with 87% of the national cashew tree nurseries covered by the programme alone). PADEFA-ENA will 

contribute to improving the quality and quantity of cashew nuts and almonds produced, increasing 

employment and income in rural areas (farmers, stakeholders in new trades/private service providers (PSP), 

labourers employed by farmers or women workers in processing units, cashew nut collection and marketing 

agents). It will also help to raise the level of carbon sequestration in cashew plantations, while securing rural 

land rights (through support for the existing rural land plan) and enhancing food and nutritional security 

(through the promotion of appropriate food crop systems together with cashew plantations). 

Table II-2: Alternative Solutions Explored and Reasons for their Rejection  

Alternative Solutions Brief Description Reason for Rejection 

Building the project exclusively 

with the cashew nut industry inter-

professional group (IFA)) 

Supporting only members of the 

cashew nut sector inter-professional 

group (IFA) in Benin. 

The impact of the project on many 

stakeholders in the sector will be 

limited and can be equally 

frustrating for major stakeholders 

who are not members of the inter-

professional group. 

Financing activities through grants 
The project will finance the various 

stakeholders through grants. 

Financing processing and marketing 

activities will create disparities on 

the local market, and will penalise 

non-beneficiary private operators. 

The only activities to be subsidised 

are the rehabilitation of old cashew 

plantations and building the capacity 

of stakeholders. 

 

Establish new monoculture 

plantations. 

Plants grown on new plantations 

subsidised under the project are 

spaced in such a way that no other 

crops can be grown. 

Monoculture plantations will 

compete with food crops in the 

project area, implying the failure to 

achieve the project's objective of 

food and nutritional security. 

2.3. Project Type 

The PADEFA-ENA is an investment project financed by the ADF (loan and grant), the Government and 

project beneficiaries. 

2.4. Project Cost and Financing Arrangements 

2.4.1. The project's total cost, excluding taxes and customs duties, is estimated at CFAF 11.624 billion, or 

UA 14.594 billion (UA 1 equivalent to CFAF 796.489 in January 2019), of which UA 4.889 million in foreign 

exchange (33.50% of total project cost). The cost includes a 5% provision for physical contingencies and 3% 

for price escalation yearly. It should be noted that while contingencies for price escalation cover all capitalised 

activities during the five years of project implementation, the situation is different for physical contingencies, 

which do not cover items such as vehicles, operating costs (including staffing), etc. Thanks to this approach, 

project resources are better optimised. The project cost estimates are based on prevailing market prices in the 

country and in relation to the most recent achievements in the various areas of relevance to the project.

2.4.4. The project will be financed by a total ADF allocation of UA 13.03 million (CFAF 10.378 billion), 

comprising a loan and a grant of UA 7.12 million and UA 5.91 million, respectively. Therefore, the ADF is 

contributing 89.28% to the overall project funding, the Government CFAF 1.038 billion (10% of the ADF 

contribution and 8.93% of the total project cost) and the beneficiaries CFAF 207.565 million or 1.78% of the 

project cost. The following tables show the project's sources of financing by component and expenditure

2.5. Project Target Area and Beneficiaries 

The project zone is the area which comprises the agricultural growth pole N ° 4 (AGP 4) managed and 

administered by ATDA4, a public autonomous establishment. AGP 4 spans the entire Donga and Collines 

Divisions (“Départements”), and partly Borgou (South) and Zou Divisions (Djidja Municipal Council), with 

an estimated population of 2,150,000 of whom slightly over 50% are women. The project will cover the 

following fifteen municipal councils: Tchaourou, Parakou, N'Dali, Nikki, Pèrèrè located in the south of 

Borgou Division, Savalou, Bantè, Dassa-Zoumè, Glazoué, Savè, Ouessè municipal councils in Collines 

Division, Djougou, Ouaké, Bassila and Copargo municipal councils in Donga Division, and lastly Djidja 

municipal council in Zou Division. The direct beneficiaries are: (i) cashew nut farmers; (ii) cashew nut traders; 

(iii) raw cashew nut processors; (iv) exporters; and (v) the inter-professional cashew nut sector (IFA) and its 

regional and divisional constituents. The project will indirectly benefit the end consumers, as well as 

stakeholders involved or associated with the project at various levels, namely the Benin Cashew Development 

Authority, ATDA4, the DDAEPs of Borgou, Donga, Collines, Atacora, Zou, and Plateau Divisions, the 

Cashew Research Centre (CRA-Centre)/INRAB; the standardisation and quality support structures (ABSSA 

and ANM); DPV, DLROPEA, ANDF and DQIFE; the Faculties of Agricultural Sciences in Abomey Calavi 

(FSA/UAC), Ketou and Parakou, the National Fund for Agricultural Development (FNDA), and the 

Professional Association of Banks and Financial Institutions of Benin (APBEF). 

2.6. Participatory Approach to Project Identification, Design and Implementation 

Extensive consultations were held on the project at all stages of its preparation. The contacts established during 

the April 2017 identification mission were pursued during the preparation phase in January 2018, both in AGP 

4 and Cotonou. Meetings were held with administrative and local authorities, technical structures, professional 

agricultural organisations (OPAs), women's groups, private partners, as well as ongoing projects and TFPs 

involved in the cashew nut sector. This process will continue and will be relayed in the field by AGP 4 

DDAEPs, who are to serve as facilitators for all stakeholders. Moreover, implementing the project will require 

the establishment of mechanisms that will closely involve and empower the respective stakeholders, especially 

farmers and the private sector (agricultural SMEs). This approach will be pursued during project 

implementation and Bank supervision missions. The sustainability of interventions undertaken, particularly 

with regard to productive capital (ageing plantations and new cashew nurseries), requires full ownership by 

the stakeholders concerned, hence the option to prioritise the targeting of the most committed communities 

that must meet selection criteria (requests, land security, organisation method, contributions, commitments, 



 

7 

 

etc.). A presentation was made on project components and activities during the PADEFA-ENA appraisal 

mission, at a participatory workshop attended by all stakeholders. 

2.7. Consideration of Bank Group Experience and Lessons Learned in Project Design  

2.7.1 The 2017 portfolio review of Bank-financed projects in Benin identified project implementation 

weaknesses, including inadequate reporting or failure to address issues highlighted in audit reports, limited 

availability of quality staff for projects, and irregular physical and financial monitoring of projects. The 

institutional set-up envisaged under the project, namely delegated project management (MOD) and boosting 

of public-private partnership, addresses the underperformance of previous or ongoing projects. Project 

activities as concerns works, services and access to bank credit that fall within the ambit of the private sector 

will be pooled and entrusted, on a competitive basis, to specialise implementing agencies that will play the 

delegated project management role. The same review highlighted the need to: (i) facilitate access to bank 

financing for stakeholders in the sector by using reliable microfinance institutions; (ii) set up an effective 

monitoring and evaluation system; (iii) finance research and development activities; and (iv) provide priority 

support to beneficiaries through sustainable technical structures charged with exercising oversight functions 

on behalf of the State. All these issues were considered and incorporated in the project design during the 

formulation stages to avoid repeating the same mistakes. 

2.7.2. The project design took into account the exposure of the project impact area (PIA) to climate change. 

A study correlated the decrease in cashew nut yields with the increase in temperature and decrease in rainfall, 

predicting a reduction in rainfall amounts by up to 12% by 2050 in the area (Bello et al., 2016). The project 

will help to reduce carbon emissions and strengthen the adaptive capacity and resilience of the rural 

communities and endogenous agricultural production systems in the project area. 

2.8. Key Performance Indicators  

2.8.1 The key performance indicators are provided in the logical framework. Using the project's baseline 

situation, monitoring will mostly cover: (i) the rural poverty index within the project area; (ii) additional CO2 

sequestration; (iii) cashew tree productivity; (iv) average cashew tree and associated food crop production; (v) 

quantity of cashew nuts processed and certified; (vi) number of jobs created in the sector, of which 30% for 

women; (vii) the surface area of rehabilitated or newly created plantations; (viii) number of grafted plants 

produced; (ix) number of infrastructure built or rehabilitated (RCN storage warehouses, number of RCN 

satellite units for cashew shelling/processing, and production of cashew apple juice, etc.); (x) number of 

cooperatives created or structured with at least 30% of women on management committees; (xi) number of 

professional farmers' organisations (OPAs), youths and women trained in various segments of the value chain; 

(xii) number of managers and technical staff trained to supervise stakeholders (30% women); (xiii) additional 

production sold; (xiv) number of women and youths who received support from the project, including nutrition 

awareness; (xv) number of farmers and processors trained on best production or processing practice (30% 

women); (xvi) number of cooperatives and economic interest groups (EIGs) aligned on OHADA, including 

women's cooperatives; (xvii) number of organised and contracted supply networks, number of RCN satellite 

shelling units (100% women) created; and (xviii) number of stakeholders (30% women) trained in 

environmental management. 

2.8.2 Further gender-disaggregated indicators will be added when finalising the monitoring and evaluation 

system, and establishing the baseline situation, using the results-based management approach. These will 

include: (i) the proportion of women in each beneficiary group; (ii) the involvement of women and youths in 

producer and infrastructure management groups; and (iii) the area of cashew tree plantations operated by 

women and youths. Particular emphasis will be placed on monitoring socio-economic impacts (disaggregated 

data for women and youths, monitoring the performance of POs).  

2.8.3  As regards impact indicators, particular emphasis will be placed on targeting the parameters that can 

be monitored and collected internally, and on defining those that relate specifically to women and youths. The 

main indicators are: (i) the percentage of the rural population living on an annual income below the poverty 



 

8 

 

line; (ii) the percentage of the rural population living in food and nutrition insecurity; (iii) the production of 

additional cashew nuts; (iv) the volume and percentage of locally processed cashew nuts; (v) the degree of 

organisation of POs, including the performance of socio-professional organisations; (vi) the number of 

additional jobs created (including 30% for women's groups) in the sector (private service providers, PSP); and 

(vii) the number of additional agricultural businesses/SMEs created in the sector. 

2.8.4. The project’s internal monitoring and evaluation will be conducted by the monitoring and evaluation 

specialist of the Project Management Unit (PMU), in close liaison with all partners. Particular emphasis will 

be placed on targeting the relevant women-specific parameters (systematic disaggregation of data). Using the 

baseline situation, the monitoring will specifically cover: (i) the level of additional production (tonnes) and 

crop yields (t/ha); (ii) the increase in farmers' income, with particular reference to youths and women; (iii) the 

number of jobs created (support for the installation of young PSPs; development of new modern plantations, 

etc.); (iv) rate of infrastructure development (number of storage warehouses built, kilometres of feeder roads 

rehabilitated, etc.); (v) effective organisation of supervision and training (number of professional agricultural 

organisations and persons trained, including gender mainstreaming), (vi) women's involvement in decision-

making bodies and the rate of their access to land (at least 30% in new plantations); and (vii) the project's 

nutritional impact. All selected indicators under the project will be reconciled with those under the PNIASAN. 

MAEP’s DPP will conduct external monitoring jointly with CAA and DGFD. The various supervision 

missions and periodic activity reports will systematically report on progress towards achieving the indicators. 

III. PROJECT FEASIBILITY 

3.1. Economic and Financial Performance 

Table 3.1: Key Economic and Financial Data 

ERR = 29.84% 20% NPV = CFAF 9.319 billion 

The economic analysis was based on direct project costs and benefits. The project is based on the development 

of the cashew nut sector and includes several stages leading to the attainment of its set objectives. Thus, the 

economic analysis is based on the notion of operating cost centres and operating income net of taxes. 

Therefore, the following process steps were considered and analysed: 

i. Cashew nuts production and sales phase (field edge sale), both in terms of old plantations 

(15,000 ha), to be developed by farmers on bank credit financing through the Facilitation Fund 

with the FNDA, and new plantations (3,000 ha) that the project will support; 

ii. The raw material processing stage into cashew kernel and cashew apple juice, requiring both 

semi-industrial and industrial processing; 

iii.  The export sales stage of part of the raw walnut; 

iv. The sales stage of the finished products that constitute the almonds and juice from industrial 

processing, and involves two types of sales(local and export sales); 

v. Only agricultural production and production from semi-industrial and industrial processing 

from the “project” situation were considered. 

The economic analysis was conducted over the project’s 25-year lifespan, taking into account the “project” 

situation and the current level of cashew nut production yields under the project, which will increase from 350 

kg per hectare to 700 kg in the coming years for the plantations developed.  These yields per hectare will 

increase from 1,000 kg to 1,200 kg in the year of full production (full operation) for the new plantations 

established under the project, i.e. around 2027. It is also assumed that the project will start production one 

year after completion, in 2024/25. Furthermore, through the Facilitation Fund to be made available to farmers, 



 

9 

 

the project will only support investments during the implementation phase, in other words over the period 

2020-2024. The table below outlines the activities eligible for the Facilitation Fund hosted by FNDA. The 

Fund amounts to UA 3,608,700 (CFAF 2,874,286,000). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Finally, the unit prices and costs used are those applicable in the country and recorded during the field mission, 

at the level of producers, processors and authorised institutions in the sector. Details of the project economic 

analysis tables and other assumptions used to conduct the economic analysis are given in Appendix B7. 

 At the economic level. The project is economically viable and is relatively responsive to a 10% 
increase in economic expenditure, since the economic rate of return of 29.84%, although 

interesting, drops to 27.41% with an NPV of 6.562 billion, i.e. a decrease of CFAF 2.7 billion 

compared to a decrease of 2.43 points in profitability. Moreover, a 10% drop in income reduces 

economic profitability by nearly 4.30 points or approximately CFAF 4.910 billion.  The 

combination of both has a significant impact on the project's economic profitability: a 

simultaneous increase in operating costs of 10% and a 10% increase in income gives an ERR 

of 22.76% and an NPV of 20% (CFAF 2.126 billion), which indicates that the project remains 

relatively sensitive to these two factors occurring concurrently. Even under this scenario, the 

return on investment would be achieved after 2 to 3 years of project implementation (2027), 

i.e. three years after the project becomes operational – another proof that the project is 

economically viable. The project will also create thousands of jobs for both youths and women 

wishing to participate in the sector (see jobs under project Components A and B). 

 At the financial level. The financial analysis focused mainly on income generated along the 
supply chain by the various stakeholders: nursery growers, cashew nut farmers on old and new 

plantations, processors and raw nut exporters. 

 Nursery growers. The project will give them greater control over grafted plant production 
systems through the series of training sessions that they will undergo, improve their 

farming methods and increase the area under cultivation. Three pricing assumptions for 

the transfer of grafted plants studied on three types of farms will also boost nursery 

growers’ additional income per hectare compared to a no-project situation (see Annex 

B.7 for more details).  

Regarding the income derived by the other stakeholders, the financial gains for all stakeholders amount to 

CFAF 263.287 billion, i.e. an annual income of around CFAF 13.364 billion (see further details in Technical 

Annex B7).

3.2. Environmental, Social and Climate Impact 

3.2.1 Environmental and Social 

The Project has been classified under Category 1 according to the Bank's Environmental and Social Safeguards 

Instruments and in compliance with Benin's relevant regulations. Given the project’s specificity, an 

Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) was defined and validated at the national level. 

Overall, project activities will have major positive environmental impacts but will also entail some significant 

risks. Activities likely to have negative impacts include rehabilitating and extending cashew plantations, 

setting up socio-economic/community infrastructure, etc. 

Potential negative impacts. The project's negative environmental and socio-economic impacts include 

pressure on land resources and the risk of encroaching on the forest cover. There are very strong pressures on 

land due to the extension of the cultivated area following easy access to inputs and credit. Vegetation is 

destroyed and used to satisfy agricultural, livestock and people’s needs for forest products and derivatives. 

Declining soil fertility and low use of fertilisers for food crops cause the expansion of clearing and burning of 

savannahs and forests, at the expense of crops.  

Potential positive impacts. Therefore, project activities will have considerable positive impacts, among which 

development of production systems that would guarantee farmers significant and sustainable income, in 

addition to helping them to master innovative, value added-generating practices. Other positive outcomes 

include diversification of activities, improvement of the quality of life for youths and women, better access to 

social infrastructure and facilities, expansion of trade and income-generating activities, opening up of 

production areas, improvement of access to basic social services (health agencies, maternities, etc.), 

development of the production and distribution subsectors, etc. It is also worth mentioning the regeneration 

of degraded land, the improvement of the forest cover and the increased carbon sequestration capacity. 

Consultations with various project stakeholders showed high enthusiasm and total support for the project. 

According to them, the project will reduce emigration and foster local development. The project will also 

contribute to strengthening the resilience of people and ecosystems to climate change. 

Mitigation measures. The project provides for the construction of a number of socio-economic facilities and 

infrastructure to improve the population's access to them and open up certain production zones. Various other 

measures are also planned to improve the project's positive impacts, to which must be added the 

recommendations made during consultations. The risk of increasing pressure on land resources and 

encroaching on the forest cover figures among the major project environmental and socio-economic impacts. 

The following measures and recommendations were proposed: information and awareness-raising campaigns 

among all stakeholders; involvement of local authorities and communities, establishment of a consultation 

forum, building the capacity of the various stakeholders in the sector and setting up a programme to support 

the preservation and restoration of natural resources. The Environmental and Social Management Plan 



 

11 

 

(ESMP) has identified various measures, some of which particularly concern the construction of feeder roads 

and support infrastructure. These will be included in the bidding documents and service providers will be 

required to implement them during works. Moreover, in addition to the project, which incorporates the cost 

of certain activities, the ESMP provides for an additional CFAF 430,000,000 to cover environmental and 

social measures, among others. 

3.2.2 Climate Change: Spatial and temporal variations in rainfall are a real concern in undertaking 

agricultural activities in the project area as well as in all of the country's central and northern regions. The 

project would ensure the application of good agricultural practice by promoting the deployment of appropriate 

technical procedures. Where they exist, tools for establishing warning systems, such as collecting, processing 

and communicating climate data to stakeholders, are insufficient and/or obsolete. The project will contribute 

to improving these procedures by building capacity in terms of equipment, data collection and processing in 

the DDAEP areas, as well as ways of communicating with stakeholders. Training DDAEP officers in proper 

data collection is essential, as is the facilitation of a monthly meteorological sheet with trends observed. The 

project will support all activities already carried out in the region by INRAB to disseminate drought-resistant 

varieties of food crops produced on the sites. 

3.2.3 Gender mainstreaming and women's empowerment: the project will promote the inclusive 

approach with the strong involvement of youths, women, disadvantaged groups, local authorities and the 

private sector. 

3.2.3.1 Gender analysis of the cashew nut supply chain. Cashew nut cultivation involves men and women 

throughout the value chain, but with different roles and responsibilities. Given the perennial nature of cashew 

nuts, cultivation is mainly dominated by men because of women's limited access to land, which is a major 

constraint to their access to production. It is estimated that 90% of the plantations are owned by men. The 

presence of women in the sector as regards the production function is 10%, mostly comprising smallholders 

(less than 5 ha). Overall, women process, market and distribute the processed products since they have more 

expertise in conquering the market and the consumer. To overcome the gender inequalities observed, the 

project plans to carry out the following activities:  

3.2.3.2 Strengthen women's productive capacity. The project will provide training for all women directly 

involved in the project and traditional leaders on land security and women's rights to acquire land. An 

awareness-raising campaign on community user rights, conflict prevention and management mechanisms will 

be organised to facilitate support to women cashew nut cooperatives in acquiring land and land title in the new 

plantations. Out of a planned area of 3,000 ha of new cashew plantations, at least 30% will be allocated to 

women. To achieve this, the project will organise women producers into structured and operational groups to 

facilitate access to and use of the allocated plots. Farmers will be sensitised to cultivate some crops in 

association with cashew nut farming (maize, soya and groundnuts) to combat malnutrition and promote 

balanced nutrition. The project also includes a set of integrated services for women to improve their access to 

socio-economic infrastructure and innovative production technologies. The rehabilitation of rural roads, 

construction of storage warehouses, consolidation centres and installation of improved village water supply 

(HVA) will help to overcome the difficulties associated with the evacuation and preservation of cashew apples 

and nuts, and will facilitate access to drinking water in the villages around the sites to be developed. To take 

better account of women's needs in terms of access to factors of production, the project will help women to 

access processing materials and equipment through the Access Facilitation Fund under the FNDA. Women, 

individually or in cooperatives, will be able to benefit from the financing upon presentation of a bankable 

business plan. 

3.2.3.3 Building management, transformation and social life skills. As part of the plan to build technical 

capacity, all women directly involved in the project will receive literacy education, to reduce or eliminate the 

high rate of female illiteracy in the region. To build on the past record of women's leadership and strengthen 

their presence in governance structures in this very weak sector, the capacity of women in cashew apple and 

nut processing cooperatives and that of women farmers will be strengthened, particularly in simplified 

accounting, cooperative management, procurement and inventory management, leadership and 



 

12 

 

entrepreneurship, business plan development, capital mobilization, marketing and networking, to facilitate 

their access to finance. They will also benefit from capacity building in cashew nut and apple processing, as 

well as in equipment maintenance. The project's support for life skills development will focus on reproductive 

health, family planning, nutrition, social cohesion, culture of peace and conflict management. From a 

reproductive health perspective, modules on reproductive health, social cohesion and nutrition will be 

provided during the various training sessions envisaged under the project and dedicated to women. 

3.2.3.4. Improving gender knowledge. PADEFA-ENA will also contribute to strengthening the low level of 

gender responsiveness among stakeholders. To achieve this, a monitoring/evaluation system will be set up as 

part of project monitoring. The system will incorporate gender-disaggregated measurement indicators for 

knowledge enhancement on the different categories of beneficiaries, and for monitoring the impact of 

interventions by gender. Furthermore, a gender organisational audit of stakeholders will be conducted with 

the support of a consultant or a gender consulting firm. This audit will propose a gender-based technical 

capacity-building programme to address identified weaknesses. Support will also be provided for the 

introduction of gender training modules for agronomists and agricultural specialists at the Calavi, Ketou and 

Parakou Agronomic Science Faculties (ASFs) to ensure that gender equity is sufficiently reflected in 

agricultural operations. The feasibility of this curriculum consolidation will be discussed with the heads of the 

universities of Abomey-Calavi, Ketou and Parakou, and will depend on the medium-term training objectives 

of these institutions.  

3.2.3.5 Improvement of women's representation on decision-making bodies. The project will promote 

women’s integration and leadership in management committees and executive boards of professional 

organisations with the objective of attaining a 30% quota of women in decision-making positions. The project 

will also structure at least 50% of women's organisations active in the cashew nut sector. A gender specialist 

will be recruited into the project management unit to carry out and coordinate the proposed activities. 

3.2.3.6. Gender Marker System Categorization. The project is classified under Category 2 of the Gender 

Marker System. Details of comprehensive gender analysis and action plan are given in Technical Annex B.7. 

A CFAF 830 million budget (i.e. UA 1 million) has been set aside for gender promotion and women’s 

empowerment activities.   

3.2.4 Youth and Women's Employment and Inclusion: the project area has a high youth population 

(over 40% of the population). Relatively, more young men are employed (54%) than young women (59%). 

Moreover, young people aged 14-24 represent a significant share of the labour force in the informal sector 

compared to the overall population (91.1%), more so for young men (94.1%). The project will improve youth 

and women’s employment indicators. It will contribute to developing, structuring and financing new trades 

(private service providers, PSP) with a view to creating new jobs in rural areas, increasing cashew nut 

production (nurseries, maintenance specialists, grafters, plant health specialists, storage warehouse managers, 

input distribution kiosk managers, maintenance and care technicians, etc.) and processing (raw cashew nut 

shelling, cashew apple juice manufacturing, cashew shell processing). In this context, the project will finance 

training and contribute to the installation of 300 young PSP volunteers (30% of whom women). This material 

capacity building, combined with technical capacity building, will improve the productivity of young 

agricultural entrepreneurs and subsequently their income. Moreover, during the rehabilitation of old 

plantations and the establishment of new cashew orchards, youths trained by the project will be invited by 

SME promoters to provide remunerated service. The project will support ongoing initiatives in some 

municipal councils in the project area to train and set up young nursery operators. Therefore, an innovative 

financing mechanism will be carefully studied and put in place to facilitate the installation of the young people 

targeted. The technical expertise of the Faculty of Agricultural Sciences (FSA) of the National University of 

Abomey-Calavi will be leveraged in this regard. A consulting firm will also be hired to assist young 

entrepreneurs to prepare their feasibility studies and business plans. Girls must account for at least 30% of the 

young entrepreneurs supported by the project. Furthermore, the project's support for the establishment of 

private agro-industrial units will promote the employment of youths and women in particular. This will be the 

case with the planned establishment of 20 satellite cashew nut shelling units, mainly for women’s 

cooperatives, and the creation and/or modernisation/strengthening of 10 cashew apple juice production units 



 

13 

 

through the Facilitation Fund. The project will facilitate access to financing for these ongoing initiatives and 

encourage new operators to set up business in the various links of the sector. Overall, the project will help to 

generate 10,000 jobs for young people and women in the cashew nut value chain. The group of women 

involved in processing activities will be among the major target groups for nutrition awareness activities, 

linking them to processed products that provide nutritional benefits. 

3.2.5 Forced Resettlement: PADEFA-ENA's activities will not lead to any people displacement or 

resettlement. 

IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION 

4.1. Implementation Arrangements 

4.1.1 Procurement Arrangements. Procurement of goods (including services other than those of 

consultants), works and consultancy services financed by the Bank under the project will be in accordance 

with the Procurement Framework for Bank Group-financed Operations, October 2015 edition, and the 

provisions set forth in the Financing Agreement. More specifically, procurement will be carried out as 

follows: 

 The Borrower Procurement System (BPS): procurement methods and procedures (PMP) 
under Benin's procurement system, including its implementing legislation and decrees (Law 

No. 2017-04 of 19 October 2017 on the Public Procurement Code and its subsequent decrees 

and implementing regulations), using national standard bidding documents or other bidding 

documents as approved during project negotiations for low-complexity works and goods 

contracts provided for under the project and generally available in Benin, for which the 

fiduciary risk is considered relatively low.     

 The Bank's Procurement Methods and Procedures (BPM): the Bank's standard procurement 
methods and procedures, based on relevant standard bidding documents for larger and more 

complex works and goods contracts, as well as consultancy services, deemed most appropriate. 

4.1.2 Procurement Risk and Capacity Assessment (PRCA): country, sector and project risk assessment 

as well as assessment of the executing agency’s procurement capacity were conducted and the results used to 

guide the decision on the choice of the procurement system (Borrower or Bank) for specific activities or set 

of similar activities under the project. The project executing agency is the Territorial Agricultural 

Development Agency of Pole 4 (ATDA4) supervised by the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries 

(MAEP). ATDA4 is a financially autonomous social, cultural and scientific public institution/legal entity. 

ATDA4 is not fully operational because only members of the Board of Directors and some managers have 

been appointed. Consequently, the procurement risk is deemed high. The ATDA4 procurement bodies 

(Procurement Officer, Public Procurement Commission and Public Procurement Control Unit) do not exist, 

and staff of the Project Coordination Unit have not yet been appointed or recruited, including the procurement 

specialist to be dedicated to the project and who would have the necessary qualifications and experience. To 

reduce the risk to "moderate" or even "low", the Government has decided that ATDA4 will use the 

procurement organs of its parent ministry (MAEP) for procurement purposes. An assessment of MAEP’s 

capacity, expertise and experience have revealed that it is competent in this regard, given its experience in 

managing several projects financed by various donors, including the Bank. Moreover, ATDA4 shall recruit a 

procurement specialist dedicated to the project, whose profile and qualifications shall be approved beforehand 

by the Bank. Furthermore, it shall set up its own procurement organs. The Borrower and the Bank shall agree 

on a procurement plan for the first 18 months of the project, which shall be updated annually or as required, 

to take into account actual project implementation needs. Any amendment to the plan shall be subject to the 

Bank's prior approval. Appropriate risk mitigation measures have been included in the PERCA action plan 

indicated in Paragraph B.5.9 of Annex B5. 



 

14 

 

4.1.3 Financial Management and Disbursement. ATDA4 was established on 27 February 2017. 

Appointed by the Council of Ministers on 13 June 2018, its Board of Directors comprises a Director General 

(DG), a Director of Administration and Finance (DAF) and technical staff. The PADEFA-ENA steering 

committee is presided by the Chairperson of the ATDA4 Board of Directors. However, it should be noted that 

ATDA4 still has no financial management system in place to guarantee transparency, traceability and 

accountability regarding the use of project funds. To get to that level, the Beninese Government shall first 

establish and operationalise ATDA4 by taking the following measures: (i) finalise the organisational chart in 

accordance with the principles of internal control, in particular the separation of incompatible functions, with 

the appointment/recruitment of managers, especially those in the Directorate of Administration and Finance 

(Heads of Administration and Maintenance, Accounting and Finance, Procurement) and staff assigned to them 

(Accountant, Cashier). It is worth mentioning that on 17 April 2018, the Government appointed an accountant 

to manage funds for ATDA4 operations. The accountant is under the supervision of the Inspectorate General 

of Finance and the Bureau in charge of analysis and investigation; (ii) prepare the Administrative, Financial 

and Accounting Procedures Manual covering expenditure management cycles (procedures for the 

procurement of goods and services), assets management (fixed assets, stocks), cash flow management (orders, 

disbursement, cash flow monitoring and control) and resource mobilization (capital call, direct payments), the 

accounting, financial and budgetary information cycle, the staff management cycle and the control and internal 

audit cycle; (iii) implement an integrated multi-project and multi-station management system for maintaining 

the project's budgetary, analytical and general accounts; the general accounting should be compatible with 

private commitment-type accounting, in line with SYSOHADA principles and norms; (iv) set up  internal 

audit mechanisms within the General Directorate, by recruiting an internal auditor to ensure that the project's 

internal control system is operational and effective; and (v) establish external audit mechanisms, including the 

recruitment of independent external auditors in accordance with the terms of reference agreed with the Bank 

and in line with the Bank's requirement to submit audit reports by 30 June of the year following the year 

audited. Pending the establishment of project management and operationalisation structures, the overall 

fiduciary risk, including the inherent risk and the risk of non-control, and resulting from the assessment of the 

ATDA4's financial management capacity, will remain high. Details are provided in the Technical Annexes of 

the Appraisal Report. With regard to the line of credit component and/or a guarantee fund to partner banks to 

finance targeted and/or dedicated investments in the cashew nut production, processing and marketing sector, 

an agreement will be signed with the National Agricultural Development Fund (FNDA). An assessment of the 

FNDA has shown that it is relatively new given its date of establishment; its structure is gradually being set 

up. Although not all key positions have yet been filled, there is a recruitment plan in place to address this 

weakness in the very short term. The Fund is supported by the Government of Benin and certain technical and 

financial partners, including the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, the Belgian Cooperation 

Agency and the European Union Delegation. Through various multifaceted support measures, the structure 

obtained all the management tools required for its operation as of end-2018, particularly the administrative, 

accounting and financial procedures manual, including an organisation chart and job descriptions, an 

operational procedures manual for various windows, and a monitoring/evaluation manual. Furthermore, the 

Fund also set up a computerised accounting and financial management system. However, these tools have not 

yet been put to the test since they were installed quite recently. Therefore, it is imperative that prior to 

allocating resources to FNDA: (i) the recruitment process for key staff must be finalised; (ii) staff must be 

trained on using the management tools and a copy of each manual must be given to every staff; (iii) the 

integrated accounting and financial management system must be configured to record expenditure by activity 

and resources by source of financing, since the FNDA is meant to receive funding from various sources.  

Disbursements: Fund resources will be disbursed in accordance with Bank rules and procedures, particularly 

as contained in the Disbursement Manual. The following three payment methods will be used: (i) direct 

payment for the procurement of works, goods and services; (ii) the special account method for operating 

expenses to be charged to the ADF grant. A special account will also be opened under the ADF loan to receive 

facilitation funds meant for the FNDA; and (iii) reimbursement for expenditures pre-financed by the 

Borrower/Donee, in agreement with the Bank. The FNDA will open a dedicated account only for facilitation 

funds transferred periodically from the dedicated loan account.  Two agreements will be signed in this regard: 

(i) an agreement between the Donee and FNDA specifying the terms and conditions for providing the funds, 



 

15 

 

including FNDA management fees and any interest during reimbursement to the Caisse Autonome 

d'Amortissement (CAA); (ii) an agreement between FNDA and the Caisse Autonome d'Amortissement (CAA) 

specifying the terms and conditions for reimbursing the funds to CAA upon project completion and where 

applicable, after a grace period. FNDA will be required to check the loan applications to be financed, in 

addition to closely monitoring the funds disbursed to financial service providers. Regular reports will be 

prepared and forwarded to both the project and the Bank. Facilitation funds will be disbursed based on a six-

monthly budget through approved applications. Regular periodic reports will be produced and forwarded to 

the project and the Bank. A counterpart account will be opened to receive counterpart funds. The fiduciary 

risk of cash management will remain high if the above provisions, which guarantee the permanent availability 

of counterpart funds, are not adopted. 

4.1.4 External Audit. Project audit shall be carried out by an audit firm acceptable to the Bank, recruited 

for a period of one year renewable, depending on the quality of services delivered and over a period not 

exceeding three financial years. The terms of reference shall require the Bank's approval and include yearly 

audit of funds made available to FNDA, at the same time as the project itself. The auditor shall give an opinion 

on the performance of the special account, its compliance with contractual clauses, the performance of 

agreements and dossiers submitted and financed. Upon project completion, this mission will be entrusted to 

FNDA's external auditor and a copy of the auditor’s reports shall be sent to the Bank. The ATDA4 shall 

forward the PADEFA-ENA audit reports to the Bank latest 30 June of the year following the end of the audited 

financial year. Audit fees will be paid from project resources, using the direct payment method. 

4.2. Monitoring  

4.2.1 The project will be implemented over five years, from the first quarter of 2019. The Bank will 

organise the launch mission when the team is in place and all necessary conditions have been met for a quick 

and efficient start of the project. 

4.4.2 Internal monitoring/evaluation will be provided by the project’s Internal Monitoring and Evaluation 

Department (SSEI), and will cover physical and financial monitoring, by component and expenditure 

category, in addition to assessing the project's impact on beneficiaries and the environment using relevant 

indicators established in a concerted manner. The SSEI will be supported in the beginning by a consultant to 

establish/confirm the baseline situation, and implement a monitoring and evaluation system incorporating 

verifiable indicators. The baseline study will include the gender profile in agriculture, to deepen the knowledge 

of beneficiary groups, especially on socio-economic aspects. This system must be operational latest six months 

after project take-off. In this regard, the project will produce quarterly and annual activity reports highlighting 

implementation status and outcomes of various components, in line with the performance indicators set out in 

the logical framework. 

4.2.3 The MAEP Directorate of Planning and Forecasts (PPD/MAEP) will be charged with external 

monitoring and evaluation, jointly with CAA and DGFD. The project will make resources required for this 

purpose available to the DPP, CAA and DGFD. Provision has been made for a mid-term review to ensure that 

the project is running smoothly and to propose any necessary adjustments. A joint final assessment is also 

scheduled towards the end of the project to draw lessons and build on project achievements. The AfDB 

Country Office in Benin will play an important role and participate in Bank supervision missions and 

monitoring meetings organised by the Government. In addition, the Bank will monitor the implementation of 

project activities through quarterly progress reports submitted by the PMU. Below is a summary of the project 

implementation schedule.

4.3. Governance. Progress has been made in economic and financial governance. Reforms have been 

implemented to strengthen public finance management and mitigate fiduciary risks. However, there is still 

need for improvements with regard to domestic resource mobilization, public resource programming and 

allocation. Although progress has been made in aligning the public procurement system with WAEMU 

guidelines, sluggish procurement persists as one of the main weaknesses that hamper the implementation of 

development programmes. 

4.4. Sustainability. The project aims to initiate real sustainable development, by placing sector 

stakeholders at the heart of decision-making while building their capacity to assume new responsibilities. An 

intervention process governed by eligibility criteria will be adopted to ensure the effective involvement of 

beneficiaries and avoid potential conflicts. The project will support communities to enhance their technical 

and organisational capacity, thereby fostering better expertise and ownership. Specifically, committees will 

be set up or revitalised at site for the proper management and regular maintenance of collective socio-

economic infrastructure. Private sector involvement in cashew nut processing and marketing activities is also 

a guarantee for sustaining the dynamics of the value chain. The sustainability issue, including the maintenance 

and management of infrastructure set up, was a central concern during project design. Therefore, measures 

will be taken for each type of infrastructure to ensure proper management and maintenance: maintenance of 

rehabilitated rural roads (comprehensive agreement signed with municipal councils); private sector 

involvement (through a PPP mechanism) in the management of storage warehouses; and the establishment of 

committees to manage improved village water supply systems. 

4.5. Risk Management. The foreseeable inherent project risks include: (i) risk related to land conflict. 

This could be mitigated by supporting the social assessment process for cashew plantations to be rehabilitated 

and new farms to be established. In this regard, the project provides support for land tenure security at the 

sites; (ii) transhumance risk, which could be mitigated by supporting municipal councils in developing 

endogenous conflict management mechanisms; and (iii) risk related to the low level of support from 

stakeholders in the sector, which will be mitigated through information/awareness campaigns and support for 

strengthening cooperatives and trading platforms at all levels of the value chain; (iv) as regards the risk of 

work execution delays, the mitigation measures would include having recourse to suitable procurement and 

parcelling methods, bidding documents for service roads and construction of storage warehouses prepared 

with the assistance of the delegated contracting authority. 

4.6. Knowledge Building. PADEFA-ENA will contribute to the training and knowledge consolidation 

of the various stakeholders, especially producers, through Component B "Develop value chains", especially 

thanks to the support and training provided by technical departments in terms of outreach, structuring and 

organisation. Using inclusive methods, it will also enable young people and women to develop technical and 

entrepreneurial skills, and to set themselves up on lands with infrastructure and modern farming equipment. 

Finally, the project will establish an integrated knowledge management and sharing system for project

Project Summary 

1. The Integrated Agricultural Value Chains Development Project in Congo 
(PRODIVAC) will primarily focus on the corridors of the major commercial centres of 

Brazzaville and Pointe Noire, and the farming basins in the departments of Plateaux, Pool, 

Bouenza, Cuvette and, Niari. PRODIVAC is consistent with the National Development Plan 

(PND 2018-2022) drawn up by the Government of Congo and which targets agriculture as one 

of the main pillars of diversification, growth, competitiveness, sustainable job creation and 

poverty reduction, in response to the poor performance of the oil sector. The general objective 

of the project is to contribute to the improvement of food and nutrition security as well as 

diversification of the national economy. Its development objective is to promote competitive 

and resilient agriculture by developing agrifood value chains in Congo. Project activities will 

focus on four value chains (cassava, maize, poultry and fish) that have been prioritized by the 

direct stakeholders concerned, based on market demand, their contribution to the national 

economy (import substitution) and their potential impact on farming households, youth and 

women. 

2. PRODIVAC activities will benefit 355,000 persons, 40% being women and 40% 
being young people in various segments of targeted agricultural value chains. The project 

comprises the following components: (i) skills development and promotion of agricultural 

entrepreneurship; (ii) improvement of the productivity and resilience of agricultural production 

systems; (iii) institutional development and public-private dialogue; and (iv) project 

coordination and management. The total project cost over a six-year period is estimated at 

EUR 85.4 million (CFAF 56 billion), financed through a loan of EUR 73.2 million from the 

Bank and contributions of EUR 7.3 million from the Government of Congo and EUR 4.9 

million from beneficiaries.  

Needs Assessment.  

3. Development of the four agricultural value chains targeted by the project is plagued 
by several constraints. For cassava, these are: (i) low yields of approximately 8 tonnes per 

hectare (t/ha), relative to a potential of more than 25 t/ha; (ii) unregulated rudimentary and 

hygienic conditions for processing cassava into flour and "chikwangue"; and (iii) the lack of 

transport means, inaccessibility to farming areas and harassment on the highways. For the 

poultry (chickens and eggs) sector, the constraints are: (i) difficulties in the supply of day-old 

chicks, livestock feed (mainly maize as well as vitamin and trace element supplements); and 

(ii) weak veterinary advisory support services. For maize, which is the main raw material in 

the manufacture of animal feed, the constraints are: (i) the limited (technical and 

entrepreneurial) capacities of small producers; (ii) difficult access to quality seeds and other 

technologies; and (iii) insufficient infrastructure and equipment for production and marketing. 

Finally, for fish, the constraints are: (i) inaccessibility to production basins; (ii) insufficient 

advisory support; (iii) poor organisation of sector stakeholders; and (iv) supply difficulties for 

improved fish feed, good quality fry and other plant ingredients. These four value chains are 

equally hamstrung by significant financing constraints. 

4. Value-Added of the Bank: The Bank's added value comes from its experience gained 

through operations in the rural and agricultural sector. The project took into account the lessons 

learned from assessment of the report from the Bank's Independent Evaluation Department 

(IDEV) on AfDB support for AVC1 development, which includes recommendations on the 

following key principles: (i) analyse the entire value chain; (ii) develop a strategy to ensure

iii 

 

inclusiveness; (iii) maintain adaptability to market changes; (iv) think in terms of profitability 

with added value; and (v) develop plans to create a sustainable impact. PRODIVAC is 

consistent with the strategic objectives of inclusive and sustainable growth found in the Bank's 

2013-2022 Ten-Year Strategy, Pillar 1 on “Promoting agro-industrial value chains” of the 

2018-2022 Country Strategy Paper (CSP). Furthermore, this operation constitutes a major 

contribution2 to implementation of the National Agricultural Development Plan (PNDA) 2018-

2022, whose operational budget has been estimated at over CFAF 1000 billion, with a financing 

gap of over CFAF 959 billion, or nearly 84% of needs. PRODIVAC's conceptual approach took 

the guidelines of the "Feed Africa" strategy into consideration, including the flagship 

programmes on Technologies for African Agricultural Transformation (TAAT), youth 

entrepreneurship development in agriculture and agribusiness, risk-sharing mechanisms in 

agricultural finance, and the Africa Climate-Smart Agriculture (ACSA) flagship programme. 

The project's design is also consistent with the guidelines of the Subregional Forum on Boosting 

the Rural Economy in Central Africa, jointly organized by the Bank and the International 

Labour Office (ILO) in February 2019 in Brazzaville.  

5.  Knowledge Development: PRODIVAC will generate knowledge on themes related 

to improving the economic environment of the various crop sectors (inclusive sector policies, 

promotion of local products and development of standards, trade and tariff policy, development 

of appropriate financial products and trade ties, financing of innovations, incubation of 

agricultural enterprises and financing of innovations, etc.). The development of financing 

mechanisms in partnership with financial institutions will produce positive experiences as well 

as best practices and approaches that could be used in other value chains and countries to 

support the development of financial products tailored to youth enterprises and the financing 

needs of small, medium and large enterprises. As part of knowledge management, an electronic 

library containing all relevant documents from the agricultural sector, an inventory of best 

practices, local knowledge and innovations will be set up and made accessible to stakeholders 

and the public. This activity will be developed as part of institutional support to the Directorate 

for Studies and Planning (DEP) in the Ministry of Agriculture. The project's monitoring and 

evaluation system and a communication strategy will be developed to produce and disseminate 

the information developed. The knowledge generated by the Project will improve the 

interventions of ongoing projects, enhance the design of new projects and boost participation 

in policy dialogue. 

  

                                                 
2  The Bank's expected contribution to the agro-industrial sector during implementation of the CSP is estimated at UA 290 

 million, or about CFAF 232 billion, representing 24% of the financing gap.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF BANK GROUP MANAGEMENT TO THE 

BOARD OF DIRECTORS CONCERNING A PROPOSAL TO AWARD A LOAN TO THE 

REPUBLIC OF CONGO TO FINANCE THE INTEGRATED AGRICULTURAL VALUE 

CHAINS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IN CONGO (PRODIVAC) 
 

Management hereby submits this report and its recommendation concerning a proposal to award 

a loan of EUR 73,200,000 (seventy-three million two hundred thousand euros) to the 

Government of the Republic of Congo to finance the Integrated Agricultural Value Chains 

Development Project in Congo.  

 

I. STRATEGIC GUIDELINES AND OBJECTIVES 

1.1. Project Relation to Country Strategy and Objectives  

1.1.1  PRODIVAC is consistent with the National Development Plan (NDP 2018-2022) 

prepared by the Government of Congo whose two strategic priorities are: (i) reform of the 

education system as well as skills development and vocational training; and (ii) diversification of 

the economy with priority given to the agricultural, tourism and industrial sectors. The government 

holds the view that agricultural sector diversification would generate supplies for the processing 

industry, capitalize on attendant opportunities and synergies and reduce dependency on the outside 

world for food. This operation is a major contribution to implementation of the National 

Agricultural Development Plan (PNDA) 2018-2022, whose operational budget is estimated to 

exceed CFAF 1000 billion, with a financing gap of over CFAF 959 billion, or nearly 84% of needs. 

The project will contribute to the reduction of food imports estimated at approximately CFAF 600 

billion per year and mainly consisting of meat products, more than 50% of which is meat and eggs.  

1.1.2 PRODIVAC is consistent with the strategic objectives of inclusive and sustainable 

growth outlined in the Bank's Ten-year strategy 2013-2022, as well as the High-5 priorities. It is 

also consistent with the Bank's Country Strategy Paper (CSP) 2018-2022, which seeks to diversify 

and enhance the competitiveness of the Congolese economy, with a view to ensuring inclusive and 

sustainable growth, mainly through two pillars, namely: (i) promotion of agro-industrial value 

chains; and (ii) strengthening of human capital and governance. The Bank's expected contribution 

to the agro-industrial sector during implementation of the CSP is estimated at UA 290 million, or 

about CFAF 232 billion, representing 24% of the financing gap. The project design is consistent 

with the guidelines of the Bank's “Feeding Africa” Strategy, which focuses on the value chain 

approach, productivity improvement and resilience, with the adoption of technologies 

(Technologies for African Agricultural Transformation (TAAT); Africa Climate-Smart 

Agriculture (ACSA). The project is aligned with Job for Youth strategies, including the ENABLE 

YOUTH initiative. Lastly, the project will contribute to the strengthening of women's economic 

empowerment and the establishment of appropriate financing mechanisms for the agricultural 

sector. Its design is also consistent with the guidelines of the Subregional Forum on Boosting the 

Rural Economy in Central Africa, jointly organized by the Bank and the International Labour 

Office (ILO) in February 2019 in Brazzaville. The forum highlighted the need to develop youth 

skills and entrepreneurship, innovations and investments to improve the productivity and 

attractiveness of the agricultural and rural sectors, diversify income sources and ensure social 

inclusion.

1.2.  Rationale for Bank Intervention 

1.2.1  The Bank's intervention, which is a response to the request of Congolese authorities, is 

justified by the need to support the Congolese economy's diversification strategy by mobilizing 

major investments for the structural transformation of the agricultural sector. Indeed, the agro-

industrial sector presents many opportunities in terms of income generation for small producers, 

job creation, especially for youths and women, and improved food and nutritional security. 

Through the constraints identified, the Bank's various missions made it possible to propose priority 

intervention areas in four value chains namely: cassava, maize, poultry and fish. 

1.2.2 With regard to cassava, the main constraints identified are: (i) low yields of about 8 

tonnes per hectare (t/ha) in rural areas, relative to a potential that exceeds 25 t/ha; (ii) unregulated 

rudimentary and hygienic conditions for processing cassava into flour and chikwangue; (iii) lack 

of transport means, limited access to production areas and harassment on the highways. Regarding 

the poultry sector (chicken and eggs) the constraints are: (i) challenges in the supply of day-old 

chicks, livestock feed (mainly maize as well as vitamin and micro-nutrient supplements); and (ii) 

weak veterinary advisory and support services. With regard to maize, which is the main raw 

material in the production of animal feed, the constraints are: (i) the limited (technical and 

entrepreneurial) capacities of small producers; (ii) difficulties in accessing quality seeds and other 

technologies; and (iii) inadequate production and marketing infrastructure and equipment. Lastly, 

regarding fish, the constraints are: (i) inaccessibility to production basins; (ii) insufficient advisory 

support; (iii) no stakeholder organization within the sector; and (iv) challenges in supplying 

improved feed, good fry and other plant ingredients. 

1.2.3 In rural financing, the main constraints are: (i) the unsuitability of the products offered 

(high interest rate, recovery period not concurrent with production cycles, etc.); (ii) the existence 

of uncontrolled agricultural risks; and (iii) considerable shortage of medium- and long-term 

lendable resources. In addition, the financial inclusion rate of the rural population, estimated at 

6%, remains low. The main reasons for such a low bank penetration rate include high poverty 

which accounts for insufficient incomes and the sheer size of the informal sector within which 

most economic actors operate.  

1.2.4 The project will help to eliminate the above-mentioned constraints by promoting 

inclusive agricultural and rural entrepreneurship. PRODIVAC supports competitive market-driven 

agriculture with strong private sector involvement. In addition, the project will support women's 

economic empowerment, entrepreneurship and youth skills development and the establishment of 

an appropriate agricultural financing mechanism. Lastly, the project will sustainably improve 

agricultural productivity by facilitating access to factors of production (improved and resilient 

inputs, machinery, labour, capital, land), soil fertility management and the improvement of rural 

infrastructure. It will achieve this mainly by opening up access to production  areas. The project 

will focus its operations on a limited number of value chains, namely: (i) cassava (Chikwangue, 

flour and other products); (ii) poultry (broilers and eggs); (iii) maize (for animal feed, direct 

consumption and breweries); and (iv) aquaculture/fish farming (fresh and salted/smoked fish). The 

selection of these value chains is informed by certain economic, environmental, social and 

institutional considerations namely: (i) market demand; (ii) their contribution to the national 

economy (import substitution and export growth); (iii) their potential impact on agricultural 

households, the youth and women; (iv) their production and productivity growth potential; (v) their 

contribution to food security and improved nutrition; and (vi) the opportunity to build on and 

consolidate past project interventions with a view to maximizing the outcomes of the current 

project.

1.3.  Aid Coordination 

1.3.1 The Ministry in charge of Planning currently plays a significant role in the coordination 

of operations. However, aid coordination in the agricultural sector will be further improved over 

the next years through the establishment of a thematic working group on agriculture and rural 

development in January 2019. The main donors in Congo’s agricultural sector are the World Bank 

which is financing the Commercial Agricultural Development Project with USD 100 million and 

the International Fund for Agricultural Development which is financing the Congo Inland 

Fisheries and Aquaculture Development Project (PDPAC) with USD 7.7 million. 

1.3.2 PRODIVAC will develop synergies and complementarities with ongoing investment 

projects and will mobilize co-financing and establish partnerships with future initiatives and 

projects. The project will also develop complementarities with an ongoing integrated initiative that 

connects small producers with an industrial processing plant in Loudima, Bouenza. The plant will 

have an annual production capacity of 16,000 tonnes of flour (bio-fortified with micro-nutrients) 

supplied at a social rate (less than 30% of the price of non-fortified flour) to the World Food 

Programme (for school feeding programmes and refugees as a substitute for rice imports) and to 

the national market. This approach will be developed through a public-private partnership with the 

participation of the government and United Nations agencies (WFP, FAO, IFAD). In addition, a 

request for the mobilization of parallel co-financing of UA 20 million from the Green Climate 

Funds is being prepared for approval in 2020. Lastly, expected partnership with the next IFAD 

project currently being designed will maximize the project's expected impact. The following table

2.2.  Technical Solution Adopted and Alternatives Explored 

2.2.1 Inclusive value chains and targeting of potential production areas. The project will focus 

its operations on a limited number of value chains (cassava, maize, poultry and fish) prioritized by 

direct stakeholders based on market demand, their contribution to the national economy (import 

substitution) and their potential impact on agricultural households, youths and women. The project 

aims at improving the competiveness of agricultural products, optimizing processing and 

marketing operations and facilitating business partnerships between small producers and private 

operators. Its focus will be on improving downstream agricultural production activities 

(processing, enhancing value-added and marketing), which should serve as a lever for improving 

production and adopting resilient technical routes. 



5 

 

2.2.2 Promotion of public-private partnership and facilitation of business partnerships among 

stakeholders. Agricultural sector transformation requires the involvement of the private sector 

which is the engine of growth, while the State plays the key role of defining strategic guidelines 

and facilitating the control and monitoring of development policies and actions through incentives 

and improvement of the business environment. There are opportunities to establish business 

partnerships between producer groups and private operators such as the Congo Sugar Refining 

company (Société agricole de raffinage industriel du sucre (SARIS)), the agro-pastoral company 

(ATORA), the Congolese Food Development and Distribution Authority (CODDIPA), Eco-Oil, 

AgriCongo, supermarkets as well as institutional markets such as the World Food Programme and 

public institutions (schools, public services). There is also the gradual emergence of a new class 

of agricultural entrepreneurs capable of investing in private farms and developing business 

relationships with small producers. PRODIVAC's interventions will help to facilitate negotiations 

between stakeholders or groups of stakeholders in the drafting of contracts. The simple contract 

farming model will be promoted for group marketing, and to facilitate financing within the value 

chains.  

2.2.3 Risk hedging and sharing facility: Target sectors will be financed through a technical 

mechanism linked to financial institutions in order to ensure the promotion of rural financial 

services and the sustainability of supply within the various segments of targeted value chains. The 

financing mechanism will make it possible to develop suitable financial products, including 

"mobile banking". This will involve: (i) the establishment of a direct credit window. PRODIVAC 

will set up a fund to provide partner financial institutions with stable lendable resources to 

adequately meet the financing needs of supported MPMEAs. Partner financial institutions (PFIs) 

will receive loans at an access rate of 3% per year, but will contribute 30% of the amount required 

to finance MPMEAs. The interest rates applicable to end borrowers will not exceed 9% per year. 

Beneficiaries' access to the window will be subject to: (i) a cash contribution of about 10%; (ii) 

the establishment of a mechanism known as a Guarantee Fund to support loans to MPMEAs and 

large companies operating in the sectors of the various PRODIVAC chains. Indeed, this Guarantee 

Fund is a hedging and risk sharing facility (HRSF). The project will consent to the establishment 

of a partial guarantee fund that will cover 50% of the risks in the event of default. Beneficiaries 

will also participate by providing commercial contracts appended to business plans within the 

context of productive partnerships. The conditions for the use of the HRSF will be discussed and 

specified with the PFIs concerned before the partnership agreements are formalized. Interest rates 

will be based on market rates and promoters will contribute 10% of the loan amount requested; 

and (iii) the creation of a capacity-building programme for stakeholders in the various 

sectors. 

 

2.2.4 This mechanism will be managed by a Financial Operator (FO) who will be selected on 

the basis of an analysis conducted with the support of an individual consultant. Consideration will 

be given to the strengths and weaknesses of existing refinancing and guarantee institutions 

(Garantie de l’Association Pointe Noire Industrielle, Support Fund for the Socio-economic 

Reintegration of Disadvantaged Groups, Agriculture Support Fund, etc.). The FO will be 

responsible for reviewing funding requests submitted by MPMEAs through partner financial 

institutions. This activity will make it possible to support the operationalization of the functional 

financing mechanism, prepare management tools, build the capacities of bank loan officers, 

promote the development of new financial products and the financial education of beneficiaries. 

2.2.5.  Skills development and youth entrepreneurship: With regard to technical and vocational 

training, PRODIVAC will finance: (i) the upgrading of the equipment of the Education, Training 

and Apprenticeship Centres (CEFA) in Dolisie, Brazzaville and Pointe Noire, financed through a 

previous Bank project; (ii) the upgrading of the equipment of Lycée Technique Industriel and 

Lycée d'Enseignement Professionnel Agricole in Brazzaville; (iii) the development and/or 



6 

 

adaptation of existing curricula to promising economic niches to facilitate youth access to 

employment; and (iv) the establishment of a platform/mechanism for anticipating skills needs and 

those of related occupations by building the capacity of teachers, business advisors, chambers of 

agriculture and all stakeholders in the education sector. With regard to youth entrepreneurship, 

PRODIVAC will finance the following activities: (i) prospective studies to identify 

entrepreneurship opportunities for the youth, raise awareness on entrepreneurship among the youth 

and provide guidance on existing entrepreneurship opportunities. Such awareness-raising will be 

conducted through workshops, for and media programmes, focusing on the success stories of 

young people who have prospered in the field of agricultural entrepreneurship; (ii) support for the 

establishment and assistance of 300 micro-, small- and medium-sized agricultural businesses 

(MPMEA) for youths through an incubation process of close supervision, coaching and mentoring; 

(iii) support for incubation centres, including the two Songhai centres in Congo and other public 

or private structures specializing in the business incubation process; and (iv) facilitation of a 

platform for young entrepreneurs. This activity will be developed in collaboration with the 

Ministry of Small and Medium Enterprises and with the support of specialized (international and 

national) technical assistance.4 

2.2.6 Competitive fund for innovation and promotion of youth entrepreneurship and 
agricultural start-ups. The project will finance an innovation fund to support entrepreneurs, youths 
and producers’ organisations (POs) who present innovative ideas and initiatives for improving 

value chain quality and performance, including: (i) the development of new products or markets; 

(ii) equipment and process testing; (iii) the use of alternative energy; (iv) new technologies that 

are more environmentally-friendly; (v) expertise in food quality and safety; (vi) the use of new 

information and communication technologies to market and promote products, including fortified 

cassava flour etc.; and (vi) the certification and labelling of processed products. Annual 

competitions will be organized at the national level to identify ideas and initiatives with the 

potential for large-scale impact. This fund will be managed with Association Pointe Noire 

Industrielle (APNI), which is already implementing a small- and medium-sized enterprises 

development programme, in collaboration with the Pointe Noire Chamber of Commerce, Industry, 

Agriculture and Crafts (CCIAM). Individual technical assistance will be mobilized for the 

development of operational procedures based on similar successful experiences (Tony Elumelu 

Entrepreneurship Program, AgriPitch, the Ivorian Competitive Fund for Agricultural Innovation, 

etc.). CCIAM will encourage financial institutions and operators in the telecommunications and 

private sector to co-invest in this fund, including buying shares in youth start-ups. 

2.2.7.   Sustainability of rural infrastructure. Actions to improve access will mainly be 

rehabilitation activities carried out from time to time to maintain critical areas (muddy segments, 

steep-sided low-lying areas, watercourse crossing points, steep slopes, etc.) to enable a given 

stretch of a road to be used all year round. The structures will be built of durable materials and 

designed to ensure proper drainage. Drawing lessons from road maintenance governance, the 

project will support local authorities and value chain actors to initiate local management by 

involving and empowering them at all implementation stages. This principle will strengthen local 

governance and the project's sustainability by enabling local authorities to play their roles in 

territorial development planning and infrastructure management in an inclusive manner. To this 

end, all sub-projects to be carried out under the project will be selected through a participatory 

process that involves the local authorities, economic actors and producer organizations in the 

relevant production areas.

2.5.  Project Area and Beneficiaries 

2.5.1 The project will primarily cover the corridors of major marketing and consumption 

centres of Brazzaville and Pointe Noire and the production areas in the Plateaux, Pool, and 

Bouenza Departments. The departments of Cuvette and Niari, in which the Songhai centres are 

located, will also be covered by the project, in particular with regard to the youth entrepreneurship 

component. However, the project will be flexible enough to support private investments outside 

these zones as well as priority sectors depending on market trends. Some project activities (access 

to financing, youth innovation funds, policy dialogue, etc.) will be more relevant from a thematic 

(value chains) and geographic perspective given their cross-cutting nature. The three departments 

selected have enormous potential for the development of agriculture, poultry and fish farming, 

with huge swathes of fertile land that remain unexploited. Furthermore, the project’s intervention 

in these areas, especially in the Pool Province, will contribute to peacebuilding and social cohesion.   

2.5.2.  The population of the three departments in the project area (25% of the country’s 

surface area) is 746,024 inhabitants, representing about 15% of the national population. 



9 

 

Agriculture is largely unmechanised and is practiced on very small farms of about 1 to 2 ha 

which produce 90% of the food yield. In this context, 70% of agricultural workers are women. 

The sector is characterized by slash-and-burn farming as well as low labour and surface area 

productivity. The real agricultural land occupancy rate remains low and output is insufficient for 

all sectors selected. These departments are connected to Brazzaville by national roads RN1 and 

RN2 and the Brazzaville-Pointe-Noire railway, which should create opportunities for produce 

marketing and the supply of inputs. Proximity to major urban centres is certainly an asset in 

terms of marketing and supply, but also a constraint due to the rural exodus of young workers 

drawn by more attractive conditions and opportunities.  

2.5.3.  Beneficiaries: The project will impact 355,000 persons in the different segments of the 

selected agri-food value chains. It will primarily target youths, women and vulnerable groups, 

including indigenous peoples, by increasing employment and income-generating opportunities in 

production and processing activities. It will do so by enhancing the attractiveness and profitability 

of such activities, supporting the development of agricultural entrepreneurship, providing adequate 

advisory support and promoting production-related activities (services, transport, marketing). 

More specifically, the project will seek to: (i) increase their incomes and enhance their economic 

independence; (ii) strengthen their decision-making ability and representation; (iii) promote 

women’s rights and financial autonomy; and (iv) reduce their workload. Women and youths will 

be targeted through the application of quotas and specific actions (Sub-components 1.2 on Youth 

Entrepreneurship Development and 2.3 on Women's Empowerment) to ensure their economic 

empowerment. The indirect beneficiaries of the project will be the populations of the departments 

of Brazzaville, Pointe Noire, Pool, Plateaux, Bouenza, Cuvette and Niari, who will benefit from 

improved market access for targeted agricultural products and job creation for young people. 

2.6.  Participatory Approach to Project Identification, Design and 

 Implementation 

2.6.1 In addition to consultations with government authorities and technical services of the 

ministries6 concerned by the project and with technical and financial partners in the agricultural 

sector, extensive consultations were also held with all stakeholders in the agricultural value chains. 

The various project formulation missions carried out visits to markets and private companies and 

held group discussions with young entrepreneurs as well as civil society and private sector 

organizations in Brazzaville and Pointe Noire. The missions made field visits to the Pool, Plateaux 

and Bouenza Departments and held consultations with the relevant stakeholders (producer groups, 

women's cooperatives, youth groups, local authorities and decentralized technical services). They 

also held consultations with several financial institutions, including the Bank of Central African 

States, commercial banks (UBA, BCI, BGFI-Bank) and microfinance institutions (CAPPED, 

MUCODEC and Crédit du Congo). The mission also met with major private operators in the 

Congolese agri-food sector, including SARIS, ATORA, CODDIPA and the Federation of 

Congolese Entrepreneurs, UNICONGO. 

2.6.2 These consultations made it possible to determine, among other things: (i) the production 

areas and priority sectors; (ii) market trends and trade flows; (iii) business opportunities and 

potential value added in the value chains; (iv) the interventions of previous projects; (v) the 

regulatory business environment, constraints on effective and adequate private sector involvement 

and participation; (vi) innovations and technologies to improve production and processing; (vii) 

the position and aspirations of women and youths in value chains; (viii) experiences and 

                                                 
6  The Mission worked closely and with the wide involvement of the technical services of the following ministries: Agriculture, Livestock and 

Fisheries; Forestry; Planning, Equipment and Major works; Equipment and Road Maintenance; Small and Medium Enterprises, Craft s and 

Informal Sector, Technical and Vocational Education, Skills Training and Employment; Scientific Research and Technological Innovation; 

Women's Development and Gender Integration in Development; Youth and Civic Education; Trade, Supply and Consumer Affairs; etc.  

 



10 

 

constraints in accessing finance, especially for agricultural, agri-business and MSMEA 

development in the medium and long terms; (ix) lessons learned from previous projects; and (x) 

specific issues to be explored in different areas. These consultations revealed that all segments of 

the agricultural value chains were underdeveloped and fragmented, and faced several constraints. 

Processing and marketing, in particular, have remained weak links in the agricultural value chains. 

Consultations with stakeholders will continue during project implementation to ensure the 

effective implementation and sustainability of operations. 

2.7. Bank Group Experience and Lessons Reflected in Project Design 

2.7.1.  Since 1967, the Bank has contributed UA 356 million to financing development 

operations in the Republic of Congo. Apart from the agricultural sector study conducted in 2012, 

the Bank’s agricultural sector investments in Congo date back more than 20 years. Its portfolio 

performance in Congo is considered satisfactory overall. The experience gained from cooperation 

with Congo during implementation of the country strategy and projects highlights the importance 

of: (i) focusing on selectivity and flexibility in project design and implementation; (ii) paying 

special attention to both physical investments and governance; (iii) building partnerships with the 

private sector; (iv) focusing on large, core/transformative, integrated projects; and (v) ensuring 

better quality at entry and applying a more pragmatic and realistic approach when programming 

operations. These lessons are reflected in the new Country Strategy Paper (CSP 2018-2022) 

through which the Bank intends to play the role of catalyst in the agribusiness sector, which is 

crucial to diversification of the Congolese economy.  

2.7.2  The project integrated the lessons learned from the IDEV (currently BDEV) evaluation 

of the Bank's support for AVC7 development, whose recommendations focus on the following key 

principles: (i) analyse the entire value chain; (ii) develop a strategy to ensure inclusiveness; (iii) 

maintain the capacity to adapt to market trends; (iv) think in terms of profitability with added 

value; and (v) develop plans to create a sustainable impact.  

2.8.  Main Performance Indicators  

2.8.1.  PRODIVAC's impact indicators are (i) a reduction in the chronic malnutrition rate from 

21% to 18%; (ii) an increase in agricultural-sector growth from 7 to 11%; and (iii) a significant 

reduction in food imports. Over six years, the project's outputs will directly benefit approximately 

125,000 people (and indirectly benefit about 355,000 people, of whom 40% are women and 40% 

are young people) in various segments of the cassava, maize, poultry and fish value chains. The 

project is expected to produce the following results: (i) an increase of at least 40% in the marketed 

volumes of the targeted value chains; (ii) a significant reduction in post-harvest losses and animal 

mortality (at least 60% on average); (iii) at least 400 small- and medium-sized agricultural 

enterprises promoted through the refinancing and financing risk-hedging mechanism; (iv) an 

improvement in the Rural Women's Empowerment Index (1 = low and 5 = high) from 1 to 3.5; (v) 

an increase in the agricultural loan portfolio of at least 7.5 billion outstanding loans at the end of 

the project; (vi) an average increase of more than 70% in the yield and output of the targeted 

sectors; and (vii) improved food diversity via greater production and consumption of iron-rich 

foods.

III.  PROJECT FEASIBILITY 

3.1.  Economic and Financial Performance 

3.1.1.  Financial performance was assessed for ten (10) typical models of farms and enterprises 

engaged in the production, processing, quality improvement and marketing of cassava, maize, 

poultry and fish, which reflect the range of activities that the project will support.  The financial 

analysis shows that these investments will contribute to boosting the net profits of these 

operations/companies substantially, which is evidence that the activities supported by PRODIVAC 

will be profitable. These results (Table 3.1) show that project support will improve the financial 

performance of MSMAEs engaged in production, processing, conservation and marketing.  

3.1.2. The economic analysis results show that the project benefits are very positive. The 

project's basic economic rate of return is 20.1%. The net present value is estimated at EUR 104.4 

million. However, this amount should increase if project benefits pertaining to the reduction of 

micro-nutrient deficiencies and chronic malnutrition, access to safe drinking water and sanitation, 

and the economic empowerment of women are factored into the equation. Indeed, reduction of 

malnutrition and access to safe drinking water will help to improve the overall health status of 

households, and lead to, inter alia, increased labour productivity for household members and 

reduced spending. Supporting young people through business incubation will strengthen their 

managerial capacity and boost self-employment and employment for other young people. 

Table 3.1: Significant Economic and Financial Figures 
 

ERR (baseline scenario): 20.1%  NPV amount: 104.4 (EUR million) 

 

3.1.3.  The sensitivity analysis based on a 30% increase in costs, a 30% decrease in benefits and 

a three-year delay in generating benefits, a 20% increase in input prices and a 20% decrease in 

product prices confirms the project's robust positive economic effects and impacts with economic 

rates of return of 17.9%, 16.2%, 15.3%, 10.2% and 17.6% respectively.  

3.2.  Environmental and Social Impacts 

Environment 

3.2.1  The project is classified under Category 2 of the Bank's Integrated Safeguards System 

(ISS) and the Bank's Climate Safeguards System (CSS), equivalent to Category B at the national 

level, although many sites and activities have not yet been identified at this stage of project 

preparation. Activities included in Component 2 of the project are likely to generate negative 

environmental impacts, such as: (i) pollution and waste generation during infrastructure 

construction works; (ii) pollution and waste generation during product processing within the 

various value chains; (iii) risks of land and water pollution and of the endangerment of the health 

of users by agrochemical products; (iv) degradation of the flora and fauna during the operation of 

quarries and borrow pits for construction work; (v) risk of accidents on construction sites and at 

processing unit sites and; (vi) the risk of transmission of communicable diseases on the various 

sites.  

3.2.2 However, the expected negative impacts will be limited in time. Given that the location 

and environmental and social characteristics of all investments are not known, an Environmental 

and Social Management Framework (ESMF) has been prepared in accordance with the 

requirements of the Bank's Integrated Safeguards System. The ESMF indicates the mitigation and 

management procedures, and measures that will have to be implemented by the project once the 

sites and sub-projects are known. These measures are outlined in the Environmental and Social 

Management Framework (ESMF) Plan and include: sub-project analysis and screening 

procedures; consultation, communication and conflict management procedures; environmental 



12 

 

and social management plans (ESMPs) and environmental and social clauses to be included in 

bidding documents and sub-project implementation contracts; guidelines on forests and wetlands; 

and guidelines on pesticide and pest management. The project’s activities will yield many positive 

impacts for both local communities and the environment. Therefore, the participatory approach 

involving local communities in the rehabilitation of road infrastructure, the promotion of more 

sustainable and climate-smart agricultural practices and the reduction of post-harvest losses will 

boost the livelihood resilience of rural households, restore soil fertility and increase tree cover, 

thereby significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  

3.2.3  Functions pertaining to environmental protection measures will include (i) screening of 

sub-projects and identification of their category using environmental and social selection forms; 

(ii) recruitment of consultancy firms/consultants to prepare ESMPs after validation of the process 

by the Directorate-General for the Environment; (iii) inclusion of environmental clauses into the 

recruitment process for implementing companies; (iv) monitoring/evaluation of the 

implementation of sub-projects; and (vi) coordination of audits. As a whole, the environmental 

and social function needs to be strengthened within the institutions involved in project 

implementation. Moreover, institutional and technical support, training and awareness-raising 

measures will have to be adopted to build institutional and human capacities. Such measures will 

seek to: (i) operationalize PRODIVAC's environmental management strategy; (ii) foster the 

emergence of local expertise and professionals in environmental and social management; (iii) raise 

the professional awareness and level of responsibility of the staff in production companies; and 

(iv) protect the urban and rural environment, health and safety of beneficiary communities. 

3.2.4  The total cost of the project ESMF is CFAF 374 million with provisions of (i) 

CFAF 110 million for studies including ESMPs, the Pest and Pesticide Management Plan (PPMP) 

and the Environmental and Social Management Systems (ESMS) Manual for each value chain; 

(ii) CFAF 105 million for training and awareness-raising; (iii) CFAF 50 million for compensation 

for any asset damage and; (iv) CFAF 79 million for monitoring/evaluation.   

3.2.5  Consultations were conducted under the ESMF at different periods of project 

preparation. Participants’ comments were integrated into the ESMF that has been validated by the 

Bank and the summary was published on 26/08/20198. 

Climate Change 

3.2.6  The impacts of climate change are evident in Congo through, inter alia, rising 

temperatures and increasingly erratic rainfall that affect the national agricultural sector, thus 

increasing the vulnerability of local communities to this phenomenon. PRODIVAC is proposed 

for classification in Category 2 for Climate Change as it will integrate the appropriate adaptation 

measures for all the selected sectors. These measures will be simple, affordable, already validated 

and tested in the country or sub-region and accessible to smallholders. They will include the 

dissemination of short-cycle varieties and the planting of cover crops and leguminous shrubs 

(agroforestry) on farms. Co-financing is being sought under the Adaptation Window of the Green 

Climate Fund. The eligible activities are those that fall under Component 2, which seeks to 

strengthen the resilience of agriculture through : (i) the dissemination of improved seeds, farming 

best practices and climate-smart technologies; and (ii) the construction of backbone infrastructure 

to ensure the sustainable development of agricultural value chains.

Gender  

3.2.7.  The project is classified in Gender Category No. 2, according to the Bank's Gender 

Marker System (GMS)9, as it will help to reduce the gender gap in terms of access to production 

factors and income. Women, who represent about 50% of the population of Congo and 70% of the 

agricultural workforce and contribute 80% to traditional subsistence agriculture, 22% to 

commercial agriculture, and nearly 90% to the processing of agricultural products, are more 

vulnerable to poverty. The project's targeting strategy takes this reality into account and will ensure 

that women have at least 40% representation in project activities. In addition, the project is 

investing approximately EUR 5 million to finance specific activities for the economic 

empowerment of women to (i) process and sell cassava products; (ii) process and sell fish; (iii) 

promote improved village poultry farming; (iv) organize women's groups and cooperatives, and 

capacity building; and (v) promote basic actions in nutrition, hygiene and sanitation.  

3.2.8.  In addition to sex- and age-disaggregated data, gender-specific indicators are included in 

the results-based logical framework to measure the women's empowerment index in agriculture. 

This index measures women's increased capacity to make strategic life choices within their 

households and communities, focusing on five areas of agricultural empowerment, namely: (i) 

production (women's role in family decision-making on agricultural production); (ii) resources 

(women's access to productive capital, access to and decision-making power over loans); (iii) 

control over income use; (iv) women's individual leadership and influence in the community; and 

(v) time allocation for women. This index will be used as a diagnostic tool and a monitoring 

indicator to measure how the project affects women's empowerment.  

3.2.9.  Specific activities for young people have been developed in sub-component 1.2. These 

activities include: (i) the identification and promotion of agricultural entrepreneurship 

opportunities; (ii) the establishment and support of micro, small and medium-sized agricultural 

enterprises run by young people, via, inter alia, innovative business incubators and financing; (iii) 

the establishment of a platform to exchange information, experience and networking among 

entrepreneurs (competitions will be organized to find a tool developer); (iv) the establishment of 

a competitive fund to innovate and promote entrepreneurship and agricultural start-ups owned by 

young people; and (v) the promotion of incubators for young people, especially by boosting 

existing initiatives such as Songhaï Center and CEFAs financed by previous Bank projects.   

Social Aspects 

3.2.10.  PRODIVAC will have major positive impacts on the living conditions of rural 

communities by improving the production structure in various agricultural sub-sectors and 

increasing access to basic infrastructure, such as rural roads, markets, drinking water and sanitation 

facilities. Project activities will focus on skills development and youth employment in rural areas, 

gender inclusion, improvement of the living conditions of beneficiaries, cooperative 

entrepreneurship to improve the distribution of value throughout the various value chains. The 

project will generate cross-cutting benefits for small family farms, women, young people and small 

and medium-sized enterprises in terms of improved incomes, greater productivity, and better living 

conditions for agricultural families. Finally, through the local development participatory approach 

adopted, PRODIVAC will help strengthen the social inclusion of minority groups, particularly 

indigenous peoples, and the reduction of inequalities along the value chains. 

 

                                                 
9 According to the Bank's GMP, a project is classified under the Category 2 if it reduces gender 

inequalities and or, women's economic empowerment is one of the effects of the project, but not 

the main one. 

 



14 

 

Forced Resettlement 

 

3.2.11  PRODIVAC activities will not involve the acquisition of land, the forced resettlement of 

communities and/or restriction of their access to resources or livelihoods. Support for the 

development of specific value chains will essentially entail guiding cooperative groups and private 

companies that own land in their production, processing and marketing activities, using 

technological packages, capacity-building, and better access to finance and partners in the value 

chains. The improvement of seeds, cuttings, fry and chicks will be conducted by existing research 

institutions and private investors who will use their own land. Seed and cutting growers and private 

investors will conduct their activities on their land and in accordance with the applicable national 

land tenure policies and laws.  

3.2.12  With regard to core infrastructure, the project will adopt an active approach that favours 

the participation and empowerment of sector stakeholders and local authorities at all stages of 

implementation (from planning to works completion). Requests for support must come from the 

Departmental Council or the Rural Community. Infrastructure sites such as markets and other 

buildings will be owned by local communities or the Departmental Council, which will be 

responsible for their management and maintenance. Rural access roads will be rehabilitated on an 

as-needed basis, focusing on critical points (muddy segments, steep-sided low-lying areas, 

watercourse crossing points, steep slopes etc.) with as much local support as possible. The Project 

will set up local and departmental complaint management committees that will also be responsible 

for initiating and supervising the payment of any compensation arising from the destruction of an 

asset or restriction of access to a resource as a result of project activities. Financial provision for 

such compensation has been made in the ESMP, in particular for infrastructure construction or 

rehabilitation sub-projects.  

IV.  EXECUTION 

4.1.  Implementation Arrangements 

4.1.1 National Steering Committee (CNP): PRODIVAC will have a National Steering 

Committee chaired by the Minister who serves as AfDB Governor (or his or her representative) 

with the Minister of Agriculture (or his or her representative) acting as deputy chair. The members 

of the National Steering Committee will include: (i) representatives of the ministries concerned by 

the project, in particular the Ministries of Agriculture, Planning, Finance, Forest Economy, 

Technical Education and Employment, SMEs, Industry, Social Affairs, Health, and those handling 

youth and women’s affairs; (ii) a private-sector representative, UNICONGO; (iii) a representative 

of Congolese producer organisations, the National Confederation of Congolese Producer 

Organisations (CNOP) and; (iv) a representative of the local authorities in the project area. This 

arrangement was adopted due to the selection of PACIGOF/PADEC, under the supervision of the 

Ministry of Planning, to host the Coordination Unit and given that the project spans several sectors. 

The mandate of the National Steering Committee, which will meet at least twice a year, is to: (i) 

review and approve the annual work plans and budgets prepared by the project; (ii) review the 

semi-annual progress reports, annual reports, mid-term review reports and project completion 

reports; (iii) ensure that programme/project activities are consistent with the sector programmes 

and strategies of the Ministries concerned by the project; (iv) review progress made towards the 

achievement of project objectives; (v) facilitate the coordination of project activities between the 

various implementing entities; and (vi) analyse implementation risks and obstacles and provide 

the necessary guidance to ensure the attainment of expected results. 



15 

 

4.1.2 Project Coordination Unit (PCU): The PCU will be hosted within the 

PACIGOF/PADEC Coordination Unit,10 which has proven experience in the administrative and 

fiduciary management and coordination of Bank projects and those of other financial partners. In 

addition, it is already involved in improving the business climate and supporting small and 

medium-sized enterprises. Consequently, this arrangement will yield efficiency gains by pooling 

certain resources and functions, including procurement, financial management, communication 

and knowledge management, administration, and human resources management. The PCU is 

expected to: (i) facilitate inter-sector coordination; (ii) monitor implementation of the 

recommendations from the CNP's deliberations and those of audit reports, portfolio reviews, mid-

term reviews; (iii) ensure the fiduciary management of the project; and produce any other 

document that falls within its remit. PACIGOF/PADEC coordination will be strengthened through 

a Deputy Coordinator; assistants responsible for fiduciary management, internal and external 

monitoring and evaluation (monitoring of implementation, outcomes and impact in collaboration 

with the National Statistics Institution), value-chain development and financing; a private-sector 

development and entrepreneurship expert, an environmental and social protection expert and 

support staff. The technical departments of the Ministries involved in implementing the project 

will be responsible for the technical execution of the components under their purview. Each 

directorate will designate a focal point to monitor day-to-day activities.  

4.1.3 Departmental Offices: Three departmental offices of the Project will be established in 

the departments concerned. They will be located in Kinkala, Djambala and Madingou. Agricultural 

sector leaders will be the project's focal points at the district level. The two Songhai centres will 

be directly monitored by the National Coordination Unit. The departmental offices will be 

responsible for the following tasks: (i) project coordination at the departmental level and 

establishment of ties with local authorities; (ii) preparation and monitoring/evaluation of AWPB 

(Annual Work Programme and Budget) at the departmental level and drafting of progress reports; 

(iii) provision of technical support for implementation of the technical components of the Project; 

(v) regular and close monitoring/supervision of the project and service providers; (vi) assessment 

of the agreements and performance contracts of local service providers; (vii) stakeholder 

mobilization for the implementation of operations; and (viii) development of synergies and 

partnerships within their respective project areas. Departmental office staff will comprise: (i) the 

office manager, who is an institutional development and capacity-building expert or a specialist in 

a similar field of expertise; (ii) an agricultural engineering technician; (iii) an agro-pastoral 

production systems technician; (iv) an agro-business advisor (processing and marketing); (v) a 

monitoring/evaluation and knowledge management assistant; (vi) an administrative and financial 

assistant; and (vii) support staff (one assistant, two drivers and two watchmen). 

4.1.4  Technical Assistance and Launch Support: In view of PRODIVAC's specific focus on 

innovative approaches to integrated value-chain development, including the promotion of youth 

entrepreneurship and the development of financing mechanisms, it is suggested that targeted 

technical assistance be mobilized to launch the project quickly and implement it efficiently. It will 

focus on: (i) developing strategic programming and country programme management tools; (ii) 

building the capacity of implementation stakeholders and launching specific institutional support 

activities; (iii) refining targeting and implementation approaches; (iv) reconfiguring the 

monitoring/evaluation system; (v) developing the scale-up strategy; and (vi) launching financial 

services access activities. To that end, the FAO's technical assistance will be mobilized to develop 

the seed sector and promote climate-smart technologies. With regard to skills development through 

technical and vocational training and entrepreneurship, ILO technical assistance will be mobilized 

to support the relevant technical ministry. PRODIVAC will also support the development of 

partnerships between the Compacts of the Bank-funded Multinational Programme Technology for

Africa Agricultural Transformation in (TAAT) and national research programmes on cassava, 

maize, poultry and fish farming.  

4.1.5  Implementation Stakeholders: Implementation stakeholders comprise specialized 

private companies, consultancy firms, specialized public entities and any other specialized 

structures, depending on the most appropriate procurement method. Technical Assistance and 

Local Support: The experience and lessons learned from project implementation in Congo 

highlight three major limitations: (i) delays at project launch (ii) weak implementation teams and 

operators; and (iii) onerous procurement procedures. Accordingly, technical assistance in the form 

of short-term individual consultants will be mobilized to: (i) update the manual and configure the 

PACIGOF management system; (ii) prepare the implementation and monitoring/evaluation 

manuals; (iii) prepare the implementation and bidding documents for 300 km of rural roads, in 

addition to the two TA packages for the financing and innovation fund component. These expenses 

will be covered as soon as the project is approved by the PACIGOF project.  

4.1.6  Procurement Arrangements: All goods and works obtained through international 

competitive bidding and consultancy services financed by the Bank shall be procured in 

accordance with the Procurement Policy for Bank-Group Funded Operations (dated October 2015) 

and using the appropriate standard bidding documents of the Bank. Goods and works obtained 

through national competitive bidding shall be procured in accordance with national public 

procurement laws, using the country's standard bidding documents, and with the provisions set out 

in the financing agreement. A procurement plan for the first 18 months was prepared by the 

Government during the appraisal mission and will be regularly updated during the project 

implementation phase. The procurement arrangements are outlined in the technical annexes. 

Financial Management and Disbursement Arrangements 

4.1.7 The fiduciary risk for PRODIVAC's financial management is assessed as moderate. The 

financial management arrangements within the PADEC/PACIGOF Project Coordination Unit at 

the Ministry of Planning, meet the Bank's minimum requirements as defined in the policy on 

"Financial Management of Projects Financed by the African Development Bank" issued in 

February 2014. This Unit, which has already implemented the PADE (WB) and PACADEC 

(ADB) projects, has relevant experience in implementing projects financed jointly by the Bank 

and the World Bank. Lessons learned from the implementation of completed PADE/PACADEC 

projects were factored into the assessment of the executing agency's capacity and financial 

management risk. These lessons will help to improve PRODIVAC's financial management 

through the risk mitigation measures proposed in the financial management action plan presented 

in the annex. These measures will make it possible to maintain a moderate level of fiduciary risk 

and to provide, with reasonable certainty, reliable financial information that is consistent with the 

Bank's minimum requirements.    

4.1.8 The fiduciary team will carry out its tasks under the supervision of the current 

administrative and financial officer whose capacities were deemed to be acceptable by the 

appraisal mission. The team's capacities will be strengthened via a project-funded on-site training 

programme. PRODIVAC’s financial management will be based on the existing system used by 

the PACIGOF/PADEC Project Coordination Unit (premises, equipment, manual, software, 

support staff, etc.). The current Coordinator, as well as the Deputy Coordinator to be recruited, 

will be responsible, in accordance with their respective terms of reference, for the administration 

of project resources, and shall authorize, together with the project accountant (or administrative 

and financial assistant) the disbursement of funds allocated to the project. Financial monitoring 

reports will be prepared in a format to be determined during the negotiation phase, and submitted 

to the Bank 45 days after the end of each quarter.  



17 

 

4.1.9 The recruitment of the external auditor will be the responsibility of the unit, and may be 

carried out in consultation with the Court of Auditors and Budgetary Discipline as part of the 

recourse to national systems as decided during the mid-term review of the Congo Country Strategy 

Paper. The external auditor's TORs will be adapted to take project specificities into account, and 

validated during the negotiations for the recruitment of an independent firm with experience in 

auditing Bank-financed projects. Audits will be carried out in accordance with the ISA/ISSAI 

international standards. The financial statements audited by the independent firm will be sent (see 

table for frequency) to the Bank no later than six months after the end of the financial year 

concerned. Due to the institutional arrangements of each implementing entity, and the 

arrangements described above, the possibility of recruiting a single auditor for all projects executed 

by the Ministry of Planning has not been considered. However, to the extent that the capacities of 

the Court of Auditors and Budgetary Discipline so permit, the Court may include  the organization 

of audit missions to Bank-financed projects in its annual programmes. A provision from loan 

resources will be allocated to cover the expenses of missions to be conducted under PRODIVAC 

and other Bank projects. 

4.1.10 Disbursement Arrangements : Loan resources will be disbursed in accordance with the 

Bank's Disbursement Manual as soon as the loan agreement enters into force and the conditions 

precedent to the first disbursement have been fulfilled. In general, three methods are used to 

disburse funds, namely: (i) the direct payment method; (ii) the working capital or special account 

method; and (iii) the reimbursement method. A disbursement letter setting out the specific 

disbursement terms of the project will be the subject of negotiations between the Bank and the 

Borrower. Counterpart resources will be disbursed in accordance with national procedures that 

provide for the opening of an account for external financing. Two special accounts will be opened 

in Brazzaville to receive Loan resources intended to cover operating costs and community 

activities. Project sub-accounts will be opened in the antennas with the authorization of the 

Ministry of Finance. 

4.2.  Monitoring  

4.2.1.  Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) will be based on four main pillars, namely: (i) the 

results-based logical framework that defines the results indicators (impacts, outcomes and 

outputs); (ii) the Annual Work Programmes and Budgets (AWPBs) that define the programme 

implementation activities, outputs and priorities; (iii) the monitoring/evaluation manual to be 

developed at project commencement and that will define the approaches, methods and tools for 

collecting, analysing data and disseminating the results achieved in terms of outputs, outcomes 

and impacts; and (iv) an IT platform to develop a consolidated geo-referenced monitoring and 

evaluation system, integrating the key indicators of the NDP in relation to ongoing projects, 

private-sector investments and the monitoring and evaluation systems of the NDP.  PRODIVAC 

monitoring and evaluation will include: (i) (ex ante) quantitative and qualitative impact studies 

that will facilitate the design of impact matrices and change trajectories; (ii) continuous internal 

monitoring of activities using a simple and reliable (digital) data collection system; (iii) 

participatory self-assessments with the active involvement of direct actors and stakeholders; (iv) 

supervision missions and ad hoc external assessments as identified by the supervision missions 

and stakeholders; (v) a mid-term review carried out jointly by the Bank and the Government at the 

end of the third year; and (vi) a final appraisal and impact study at project completion to facilitate 

the preparation of the final project report and inform the completion mission.  

4.3.  Governance  

4.3.1.  In terms of global governance, Congo scores 42.8 out of 100 and is ranked 42nd out of 54 

African countries on the Ibrahim Index of African Governance (IIAG). Under the impetus of the 

IMF, the Government has undertaken to conduct, with international assistance, an in-depth study 

on the governance situation in Congo. The Bank and the World Bank are supporting the country 



18 

 

to improve public finances and the business climate through the PADEC and PACIGOF projects. 

Specifically, governance risks in project implementation will be related to procurement, financial 

management, and land management. In this context, the Bank conducted detailed risk assessments 

at Borrower, sector, and project level during project design and, significant measures complete 

with action plans were prepared. PRODIVAC will also support the digitisation of agricultural land, 

linked to a geographical information system, to provide the country with an adequate land 

management tool. In addition, the participatory approach to local development, participation by 

the private sector, non-governmental organisations and beneficiaries in the steering and 

implementation of activities will promote citizen control as a guarantee of good governance. 

4.4. Sustainability  

4.4.1.  The possibility of sustainability and scale-up of the Project's achievements over the long 

term is high. Economic and financial analysis sensitivity tests show that the project remains 

profitable despite a reduction in profits, an increase in input prices and a decrease in product prices. 

The sustainability of investments and expected benefits is based on participatory and 

entrepreneurial approaches to capacity building, including (i) the structuring and 

professionalization of value chain organisations and actors on the basis of expressed demand, (ii) 

partnership with financial institutions to ease access to finance; (iii) the business and 

entrepreneurial dimension and the development of youth skills; (iv) the choice of proven and 

locally manageable techniques and technologies; and the participation and empowerment of value 

chain and local government actors for management of the infrastructure built; and (v) women’s 

economic empowerment. The Project, in collaboration with local authorities, will support the 

establishment of a sustainable management and maintenance mechanism for each infrastructure 

project, based on the organisation of beneficiaries into user associations, establishment of a 

management committee and maintenance fund.  

4.5.  Risk Management  

4.5.1.  The main risks that the project could face: (i) vulnerability to climate change; (ii) low 

capacity of youth support systems and value chain actors; (iii) low interest of financial institutions 

in developing specific financial products; (iv) reluctance of smallholders to innovate; (v) low 

capacity of service providers and (vi) inadequacies in rural infrastructure sustainability 

mechanisms. To mitigate these risks, the following actions will be taken: (i) the dissemination of 

smart agricultural technologies (community agroforestry, short-cycle and attack-resistant seeds, 

etc.); (ii) strengthening of links between agricultural promoters and chambers of agriculture/trades 

whose capacities will be built; (iii) promotion of internal value chain financing mechanisms and 

financial education for beneficiaries; (iv) technical assistance to financial institutions including the 

training and involvement of credit officers in the agricultural entrepreneurship process; (v) the 

adoption of demonstration farms that promote peer training of farmers; and the involvement of 

beneficiaries and local actors in the monitoring of works, the mobilisation of specialised technical 

assistance and the signing of performance contracts with service providers and project 

implementation unit staff. Residual management risks will be minimised through the competitive 

recruitment of staff and partners; the development of annual performance contracts, renewable 

based on good performance; and capacity-building for project management teams at different 

levels. 

4.6.  Knowledge Management  

4.6.1.  As part of knowledge management, an electronic library will be established to store all 

relevant documents from the agricultural sector, an inventory of best practices and identified local 

knowledge and innovations. The library will be accessible to stakeholders and the public. This 

activity will be developed as part of institutional support to the Directorate of Studies and Planning 

(DEP) of the Ministry of Agriculture. The tools and means of communication will be shared with 



19 

 

other projects in the agricultural sector, in particular PADEC and PDAC. A flexible knowledge 

management system, incorporating data, studies and documentation on the agricultural sector held 

by TFPs will be developed to ensure: (i) continuous information to improve programme 

performance; identification, analysis, documentation and dissemination of best practices; (ii) 

interactive and inclusive communication with project managers and all stakeholders; and (iii) 

visibility for policy dialogue and advocacy. Mechanisms of communication with beneficiaries 

upstream, during and downstream of the interventions will be developed. Project-generated 

knowledge will thus help to improve the interventions of ongoing projects, inform the design of 

new projects and boost participation in policy dialogues on themes that may affect improvement 

of the economic environment of sectors (inclusive sector policies, promotion of local products and 

development of standards, trade and tariff policy, etc.). The development of financing mechanisms 

in partnership with financial institutions will generate experiences, best practices and approaches 

that could be used in other value chains and countries to support the development of financial 

products tailored to youth enterprises and the financing needs of small, medium and large 

enterprises.

IV. USTIFICATION DU NIVEAU DE LA CONTREPARTIE A U FINANCEMENT 
BAD 

Introduction 

 

1.  Owing to the heavy dependence of the Congolese economy on oil, the fall in the price of 

this commodity has led to a deterioration in the country's fiscal position, thus negatively affecting 

its ability to co-finance projects as required by the Bank's policies for ADB countries. The sharp 

decline in oil revenue, which accounted for more than 80% of government income until 2014, is 

reflected in Government's inability to contribute at least 50% of the cost of projects co-financed 

with the Bank as required by the policy on expenditures eligible for Bank Group financing. It has 

also led to significant delays in the disbursement of national counterpart funds. This situation is a 

generic problem common to all the portfolios of the key technical and financial partners (TFPs) 

present in Congo. 

 

2.  To address this situation in the short run, the Bank had to grant waivers on the national 

counterpart amount for its new projects in accordance with the relevant provisions of the 

abovementioned policies, and to cover part of the national counterpart contribution for ongoing 

projects following the Government's requests. Given that low oil prices seem to be enduring, the 

Bank could review the financing model for its projects in Congo to adequately address the 

counterpart issue that particularly affects portfolio performance. 

 

Current Context  

 

3.  Congo's counterpart contribution required to finance ongoing projects is CFAF 123 billion. 

As a simple average, this amount exceeds more than 33% of the total portfolio cost. For some 

projects, the Government's counterpart amount exceeds 50% or even 68% of the total cost.

4.  In its information note to the Boards on Counterpart Funding and Recurring Costs 

(ADF/BD/WP/2016/29), the Bank stresses that "ADF countries newly eligible for ADB financing 

are particularly negatively impacted by the abrupt increase in their cost share in ADB-financed 

public sector investment operations". This situation has been particularly true for countries such 



V 

 

as Cameroon. This country lacked tax space to finance 50% of the cost of ADB-financed projects, 

since it is not used to financing more than 10% of the project cost. For a country such as Cameroon, 

no counterpart funds have yet been paid for the year 2018. In 2017, USD 3 billion of counterpart 

funds were paid out of a current amount of USD 17 billion. For all operations approved after 

Cameroon's graduation in July 2014, Management systematically requested the Boards to reduce 

the CPF to 15%. 

 

5.  For Congo Brazzaville, as shown in the table above, out of 7 ongoing projects, half did not 

entail a CPF. Delays in the disbursement of government counterpart funds lead to slippages in 

project implementation and sometimes to the restructuring of ongoing limited-impact 

operations. 

 

6.  Clearly, the level of Government's contribution is below the minimum rate of 50% of the 

total project cost for ADB countries, required by the Policy on Expenditure Eligible for Bank Group 

Financing under paragraph 4.2.2. Thus, in accordance with Section 4.2.2 of the aforementioned 

Policy (revised version of 19 March 2008) and the FVP/COO Directive of December 2014 on 

application of the said Policy regarding counterpart funds, this note presents the analysis that 

justifies the request for a waiver on the national counterpart amount, based on the following four 

criteria required by the abovementioned Bank's policy and directive:  
 

 The country's commitment to implement its overall development programme; 

 The financing allocated by the country to the sector targeted by Bank assistance; 

 The country's fiscal situation and debt level.  

 Upper cost-sharing limit and guidelines laid down in the country financing 
parameters. 

This waiver could be extended to other "ADB or Blend" countries in the Centre Region; these 

include the Republic of Equatorial Guinea (ADB) and Cameroon (Blend). 

 

Country’s Commitment to Implement its Overall Development Programme 

 

7.  After three years of severe economic crisis, Congo has just adopted a National Development 

Plan (NDP) 2018-2022. This Plan, which derives from the social project "The March towards 

Development", takes into account the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and those of Agenda 

2063 for Africa's development. The NDP identifies two strategic priorities: (i) reform of the 

education system and skills development and vocational training and (ii) diversification of the 

economy with priority to the agricultural, tourism and industrialisation sectors. This Plan aims to 

lay the foundation for sustainable and inclusive economic and social development, including 

through economic diversification, further construction of competitive infrastructure, improved 

governance, strengthening of human resources and promotion of regional integration. 

  



VI 

 

Financing Allocated by the Country to the Sector Targeted by Bank Assistance 
 

8. Mindful of the key role of the various target sectors of the Bank's operations in the 

Congolese economy, the Government in recent years sought to allocate significant resources to 

these sectors to improve their performance. It is worth recalling that Congo is one of the few RMCs 

that has mobilised an average of more than 50% of counterpart funds. It should be noted that, unlike 

most African countries, most transport infrastructure expenditure has been financed from domestic 

resources, with public sector financing through oil revenue averaging 75%. The authorities' 

financial effort was particularly significant for the road sub-sector, which saw its budget allocations 

increase by nearly 72.0% over the period. It reflects the authorities' awareness that road transport 

is one of the sub-sectors with the most significant rehabilitation and investment needs. 

 

9. Additionally, the Bank has a pipeline of projects for its re-engagement in Congo. This re-

engagement includes projects for the development of agro-industrial value chains, energy, regional 

infrastructure for economic diversification and sustainable and inclusive economic growth, and 

support for the strengthening of capital and governance for a total amount of UA 806 million. It 

should be noted that Congo has allocated significant resources to the financing of regional 

integration infrastructure. In particular, the country has significantly increased its participation in 

investments in regional road projects, particularly those of the Bank, which are increasingly co-

financed by the Government. Congo’s average contribution to Bank-financed regional integration 

projects is over 60%. However, despite the significant efforts made by the State over the past four 

years, the needs remain huge. 

The Country’s Fiscal Situation and Debt Level 

10. The country's fiscal situation has significantly weakened in recent years with the fall in oil 

prices leading to a deterioration in its fiscal position. The sharp decline in oil sector revenue, which 

accounted for more than 80% of government revenue until 2014, combined with an expansionary 

fiscal policy despite the sharp decline in oil prices, led to an average deficit of more than 19.9% 

between 2015 and 2017, after a decade of budget surpluses. In response to the persistently low oil 

prices, the Government adopted measures aimed at restoring fiscal balance. From a level of CFAF 

4,000 billion in revenue and CFAF 2,818 billion in expenditure in 2013, the State budget was 

significantly adjusted and stood at CFAF 1,415 billion in revenue and CFAF 1,828 billion in 

expenditure at the end of 2017, representing a deficit of 5.1% of GDP, due mainly to the contraction 

of public expenditure and suspension of certain investment projects. However, this was an 

improvement compared to the 2016 budget that stood at 12.9% of GDP. 

11. Regarding the country's debt level, external debt has been rising steadily since it reached 

the completion point of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative, rising from 20% of 

GDP to 118.7% of GDP in 2017. Congo presents the profile of a country with high risk of over-

indebtedness, according to the Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) conducted jointly by the IMF 

and the World Bank in 2017. Missing a payment due on 30 June 2016 on the country's only 



VII 

 

Eurobond issued in 2007 resulted in the downgrading of its credit rating11, highlighting the pressure 

exerted by the oil counter-shock on the country's fiscal and external positions and the need for 

Government to undertake a major structural reforms programme with the IMF. An agreement is 

being concluded with the establishment of a debt restructuring strategy. These measures are 

necessary to preserve the country's solvency and its ability to repay its debt in the medium term, 

including to the Bank and other international creditors. 

 

Upper Cost-sharing Limit and Guidelines Laid down in the Country Financing Parameters 

 

12 For countries such as Congo whose financing parameters (CFP) are not available, the World 

Bank Operational Guidelines specify that the share of total costs financed by the Bank in the overall 

lending programme is determined according to the country's ranking and per capita income. 

Specifically, these Guidelines set out the cost-sharing limits as follows: (i) 90% for IDA countries 

with per capita income below USD 1,235; (ii) 75% for IBRD and Blend countries in the same per 

capita income group; (iii) 60% for countries with per capita income between USD 1,236 and 4,465; 

and (iv) 50% for countries with per capita income above USD 4465. These limits apply to the 

Bank's overall in-country lending programme12 and not to individual projects. For individual 

projects, a minimum contribution of 10% is generally expected from the Borrower. Finally, in 

exceptional cases, the Guidelines offer the possibility of financing all project costs from external 

resources. 

 

13.  In the specific case of Congo, whose per capita income is USD 2,540, the Bank's share in 

the overall lending programme for the period 2013-2017 is 46.8% compared to a limit of 60%. On 

the other hand, the national counterpart for the project concerned (10.76%) is higher than the 

minimum contribution of 10% expected for individual projects. In addition, it is worth noting that 

Congo's contribution to the Project’s financing is higher than that requested for its new projects by 

the World Bank, which has revised the financing model for its operations in light of the decline in 

public revenue resulting from the fall in oil prices. 

 

14. In conclusion, based on the foregoing, and at the Government’s request, it is proposed 

that the national counterpart be set at 15% of the total project cost net of taxes. This level of 

counterpart takes into account the country's particularly difficult fiscal situation. The reality at 

present is that Congo is facing a severe economic crisis following the negative shock in the prices 

of oil sector products, the main source of the country's economic growth. This macroeconomic 

                                                 
11    In August 2016, the rating agencies Fitch, S&P and Moody's downgraded Congo's credit rating, the first two 

rating agencies placing it in the "Partial Default" category. This decision was taken after the country missed a 

payment on its single Eurobond issued in 2007, as part of the restructuring of its commercial debt to London Club 

creditors. The Government explained that this failure was due to a technical problem and not to cash flow 

constraints and has since made the outstanding payment. As a result of this regularization, Fitch upgraded Congo's 

rating to "CCC" while S&P restored it to "B-". 

12   A three-year rolling lending programme covering two previous years and the current year.

shock has led to a significant fiscal imbalance. Since the drop in oil prices, Congo has experienced 

revenue losses that have negatively impacted the State's finances, the financial sector and the real 

sector, and the country's inability to meet the payment of counterpart contributions to development 

projects and programmes, which stood at a cumulative amount of CFAF 123.214 billion at the end 

of 2017.The Congolese Government's contribution will be used to finance part of the works, and 

all the expropriation costs and operating costs of the executing agency as well as the fiscal 

expenditure associated with the programme resulting from exemptions from customs duties and 

other taxes.

PROJECT EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

Background: the African Development Bank-funded Project to Support the Development of 

Agricultural Value Chains in Six Provinces in the Democratic Republic of Congo (PADCA-6P) aims 

to sustainably improve food and nutrition security and increase the incomes of the target population. 

PADCA-6P will be implemented over a five-year period (2019-2024) for a total cost of UA 22.153 

million in the provinces of Kwilu, Kasaï, Haut Iomami, Iomami, Maniema, and Tshopo. It will target 

some 1,768,825 rural households, 60% of which are women, with 8, 394,125 direct beneficiaries, and 

build knowledge for the rural world at large.  

In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the agricultural sector employs more than 70% of the 

labour force in rural areas. Arable farmland, which is estimated at about 80 million hectares, is largely 

underutilized. Ten per cent is developed, that is about 3.5 million hectares used for farming and some 

4.5 million hectares for livestock breeding. Only 13,500 hectares, representing 3.2% of available 

areas, are irrigated. DRC’s agricultural sector can create more than 60% of jobs in the country, if 

managed sustainably. The diagnosis of the agricultural sector and the operations being implemented 

therein have helped to focus the project’s activities on four growth crop sub-sectors, namely cassava, 

beans, maize and rice.  

The DRC’s food deficit is estimated at between 20% and 30% of total food needs (according to 

region). In addition, the incidence of poverty at the national level, which stands at 63.4%, is very 

high, and 43% of under-five children suffer from chronic malnutrition, that is about 1 in 2 children. 

Furthermore, 38% of the country’s population lives on a poor and limited diet and only 9.3% of 

children aged 6-23 months have a minimum acceptable diet. According to a study on the Cost of 

Hunger in Africa carried out in DRC in 2017, economic losses owing to malnutrition in the country 

are estimated at 3% to 8% of the gross domestic product, that is an annual loss of USD 1.174 billion. 

Against this backdrop, the improvement of agricultural production is an urgent priority for the 

Congolese Government.  

Bank’s Value Added: the proposed project seeks to actively involve agricultural sectors in efforts 

to achieve economic growth so as to create jobs and generate substantial incomes in rural areas. It is 

perfectly in line  with the Strategy for Agricultural Transformation in Africa (2016-2025); the Bank’s 

Ten-year Strategy (2013-2022), particularly two of its High-5s, namely Feed Africa, and Improve the 

quality of life for the people of Africa; the strategy covering the 2014-2019 period titled “Addressing 

Fragility and Building Resilience in Africa”; the Jobs for Youth in Africa Strategy which targets the 

agricultural sector and the entrepreneurial training of rural youths; the Multi-Sectoral Nutrition 

Action Plan concerning the pillar that seeks to increase the production and consumption of safe and 

nutritious food; and the Bank’s Technologies for African Agricultural Transformation (TAAT) 

programme whose objective is to deploy agricultural technologies to increase the productivity and 

quality of agricultural production in targeted sectors. The project is technically justified and feasible 

and will generate positive impacts in terms of rebuilding the productive base, reviving economic 

activities and contributing to DRC’s efforts to achieve economic and social development. 

Knowledge Building: PADCA-6P will help to: (a) develop crop sub-sectors through the introduction 

and ownership of new technologies aimed at increasing the productivity of the crops identified; (b) 

provide institutional support, improve governance and build the capacity of existing entities in order 

to enhance their professionalization, particularly through the use of the value chain approach, and to 

improve coordination and dialogue between value chain actors through the platforms established. All 

these activities will serve as the Bank’s pilot schemes in DR Congo and generate invaluable 

knowledge for future developments in the country’s agricultural sub-sectors.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF BANK GROUP MANAGEMENT TO THE 

BOARD OF DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSAL TO GRANT A UA 20 MILLION TSF  LOAN TO 

THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO TO FINANCE THE PROJECT TO SUPPORT 

THE DEVELOPMENT OF AGRICULTURAL VALUE CHAINS IN SIX PROVINCES IN 

THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO (PADCA-6P) 

Management hereby submits the following report and recommendation concerning a proposal to 

grant a UA 20 million ADF loan to the Democratic Republic of Congo to finance the Project to 

Support the Development of Agricultural Value Chains in Six Provinces in the Democratic Republic of 

Congo (PADCA-6P). 

I. STRATEGIC THRUST AND RATIONALE 

1.1 Country Context 

1.1.1  The period of political transition in the Democratic Republic of Congo which began at end-

2016 ended with the holding of presidential, legislative and provincial elections on 30 December 

2018. The country experienced its first peaceful transfer of power on 24 January 2019 between an 

outgoing and an incoming President of the Republic. On the economic front, The Democratic 

Republic of Congo recorded a growth rate of 8.3% on average over the period 2013-2015. However, 

this growth momentum was interrupted in 2016 (2.4%) due to a sharp fall in the prices of the 

country’s main export products (copper and cobalt) and political instability. Growth rose to 3.7% in 

2017 and 4.1% in 2018, driven by an increase in mining production and a rise in the prices of mining 

products especially in 2017. However, the country’s recent economic performance has had a limited 

impact on the population’s well-being due to low inclusiveness of growth which is driven mainly by 

the mining sector. Despite its enormous potential, DRC is one of the world’s poorest countries. More 

than 82% of the population lives below the poverty line (USD 1.25 a day). Developments in the 

present political context marked by the holding of the December 2018 (presidential and legislative) 

elections will help to lay the foundations for the country’s socio-economic development. Poverty, 

discrimination and violence against women are major causes of malnutrition. The poor (invariable 

and undiversified) diet that mothers and their children live on has irreparable consequences on the 

development of children and, hence, leads to economic losses due to a decrease in productivity. 

1.1.2 DRC has considerable agricultural potential and offers tremendous opportunities for 

investment, especially a potential market of more than 100 million inhabitants, given its population 

and that of neighbouring countries. Arable farmland which is estimated at about 80 million hectares 

is highly underdeveloped (10% is developed). Food crop production, excluding groundnuts, 

plantains and cereals, is estimated at about 17 million tonnes on 3,700,000 hectares of land. Food 

shortage is estimated at 20% to 30% of total food needs (according to the regions). 

1.1.3 Agricultural and rural sector development is hampered by numerous constraints including 

(i) advanced environmental degradation and inadequate basic infrastructure; (ii) weak institutional 

and management capacity; (iii) low access to inputs, production equipment and supervisory services, 

and lack of access to markets; and (iv) weak capacity of farmers’ organizations and difficulties in 

accessing financial services and governance. According to the National Agriculture Investment Plan 

(NAIP), the major challenges to be met by the country to significantly alleviate rural poverty by 2020 

are: (i) securing and modernizing the farming system to sustainably improve sub-sector production; 

and (ii) overcoming malnutrition and food insecurity. 



 

2 

1.2 Project Linkages with Country Strategy and Objectives 

1.2.1 The project is consistent with the five main priorities of the National Agricultural 

Investment Programme (PNIA) which are to: (i) improve agricultural governance, promote gender 

mainstreaming and build human and institutional capacity; (ii) sustainably promote agricultural sub-

sectors, particularly food sub-sectors, and develop agri-business in order to increase the incomes of 

farmers and other sector operators; (iii) improve the management of the population’s food and 

nutrition security and build strategic reserves; and (iv) develop and disseminate research products to 

users and improve the level of professional competence of various actors. 

1.2.2 The project is also consistent with the priorities of the Bank’s 2013-2017 Strategy for DRC 

(updated at end-2018 and whose update for the second time to 2020 is under study) which seeks to 

help the country to emerge from fragility by creating conditions conducive to strong and inclusive 

growth driven by renewed vitality in the productive sectors of the economy. It is particularly 

consistent with the second pillar of the Country Strategy Paper (CSP) which aims to build the 

Government’s capacity to increase public revenue and establish a framework of incentives for private 

investment, especially in the second thrust which seeks to create conditions conducive to inclusive 

and diversified growth driven by private investment. Lastly, the project is in line with the CSP’s 

spatial approach which consists in focusing the Bank’s operations in the country’s greater centre 

region. 

1.2.3 PADCA-6P is aligned with the Bank’s Ten-year Strategy (2013-2022) and will contribute 

to achieving two of its five (5) strategic priorities, namely Feed Africa and Improve the quality of 

life for the people of Africa. The project is also perfectly in keeping with the thrusts of Feed Africa: 

Strategy for Agricultural Transformation in Africa 2016-2025, Multi-Sectoral Nutrition Action Plan, 

and Jobs for Youth in Africa Strategy. The project is technically justified and feasible and will 

generate positive impacts in terms of rebuilding the productive base, reviving economic activities 

and contributing to DRC’s efforts to achieve economic and social development. 

1.3  Rationale for Bank Involvement  

1.3.1 DRC and its partners are committed to strengthening the population’s resilience through a 

collaborative approach linking food security, social cohesion and access to financial resources in 

order to achieve stability. In this regard, agriculture has been re-positioned at the centre of political 

and strategic concerns to ensure the country’s sustainable recovery. Thus, the objective of Congolese 

authorities is to achieve a sustained annual growth rate of more than 6% in the agricultural sector by 

2020, which is essential to reduce poverty, ensure food and nutrition security for the Congolese 

people, generate sustainable jobs and incomes, especially for the youth. In addition, given the heavy 

concentration of the Congolese economy on the mining sector, the development of the agricultural 

sector contributes to diversifying the productive fabric, thus reducing the vulnerability of the 

economy to external shocks resulting from fluctuations in the prices of mining products. DRC 

imports about USD 1.5 billion worth of food products per year. The project, which will help to 

increase agricultural production (especially food production), is a response to food insecurity. 

1.4  Donor Coordination 

1.4.1 The activities of DRC’s development partners are coordinated through the Aid and 

Investment Management Platform (PGAI) hosted in the Ministry of Planning. This platform records 

the investments made by the various partners, but technical activities are discussed and planned in 



 

3 

thematic groups chaired by the Ministry exercising supervisory authority over the theme. For 

example, the Agriculture and Rural Development Thematic Group is chaired by the Ministry of 

Agriculture. In September 2013, the Ministry of Agriculture, in collaboration with this thematic 

group and in consultation with all stakeholders, designed the National Agricultural Investment 

Programme (PNIA) for the period 2014-2020. 

II. PROJECT DESCRIPTION 

2.1. Project Objectives and Components 

2.1.1  The project’s sector objective is to contribute to sustainably improving food and nutrition 

security. 

2.1.2  The project’s specific objective is to improve agricultural production by: (i) increasing the 

productivity of the growth sub-sectors, namely cassava, maize, bean/cowpeas, and rice; (ii) building 

the capacity of stakeholders to ensure the sustainability of investments in value chains; and (iii) 

promoting youth and women’s entrepreneurship. 

2.1.3  Project Design 

The project design is based on the value chain approach and takes into account the TAAT initiative 

which aims to contribute significantly to: (i) increasing agricultural productivity and production by 

identifying and disseminating appropriate farming technologies; (ii) conducting training and 

extension campaigns for the adoption of good farming practices through the effective provision of 

technologies to farmers; and (iii) promoting a plant sub-sector development policy.  

2.1.4  The project will comprise the following three components: (1) Plant Sub-sector 

Development; (2) Institutional Support, Improvement of Governance and Capacity Building; and (3) 

Project Coordination, Management and Monitoring and Evaluation. Table 2.1 below presents project

2.2 Technical Solutions Adopted and Alternatives Explored 

2.2.1 The replacement of the cowpea varieties being disseminated with new iron- and zinc-rich 

varieties (high iron bean – HIB) which meet market requirements (major market classes) will 

significantly increase production and profitability for all actors involved in the value chain. The 

importance and adoption of high iron beans have been well documented in Rwanda and published in 

international science journals (Hass et al. 2016; Oparinde et al. 2015, 2016).  

2.2.2 The continued promotion of new varieties by extension officers and all project partners will 

help to accelerate the adoption and use of new technologies. To fast-track the adoption of input 

technologies, it is necessary to use the integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) approach.

Name Brief Description Reasons for Rejection 

Adoption of 

techniques for 

the use of 

fertilizers 

The integrated soil fertility management 

(ISFM) approach should be used to 

better rationalize the use of fertilizers. 

Former soil fertility management paradigms which 

focused on fertilizer or “low input” approaches, and 

rarely on both, ignored the vital scientific fact that 

fertilizers are more effective and efficient on well-

conserved soils which contain organic matter. 

Use of bean 

varieties being 

disseminated 

(traditional) 

The replacement of the bean varieties 

being disseminated with new iron- and 

zinc-rich varieties (high iron bean – 

HIB) which meet market requirements 

(major market classes) will help to 

significantly increase production and 

profitability for all the actors involved 

in the value chain. 

The replacement of the bean varieties being

2.3. Project Type 

This is an investment project. It falls within the framework of the assistance provided to regional 

member countries by the Bank through the Feed Africa initiative and the value chain approach, and 

is in keeping with the Feed Africa strategy. 

2.4 Project Cost and Financing Arrangements 

2.4.1 The indicative project cost is estimated at about UA 21.434 million (USD 30.008 million), 

excluding tax and duty of which 64% in foreign exchange and 36% in local currency. The project 

will be financed as follows: UA 20 million ADF loan, and the remaining UA 1.434 million the 

counterpart contribution of the Government (less than 10% of the total project cost – see supporting 

documents in Annex C.4) and beneficiaries. Project activities will be implemented over a five-year 

period. The summary project cost, financing breakdown and expenditure schedule are presented in 

Tables 2.4 to 2.6. 

2.4.2 The Bank loan will be used to finance all works exclusive of taxes, except community 

infrastructure for which municipal councils will be required to pay a 10% contribution (FEICOM 

will assist beneficiary local authorities in mobilizing this counterpart contribution). Goods and 

services will be fully financed in accordance with the appended financing plan. Civil servants’ salary 

and part of office rental (1/3) costs will be borne by the Government.

2.5. Project Target Area and Beneficiaries 

2.5.1. The project impact area is defined by crop and by province as follows: (1) Kwilu: cassava 

and maize (Idiofa, Bulungu and Bagata Territories); (2) Lomami: maize (Ngandajika Territory and 

Muene-Ditu Centre); (3) Kasaï: maize (Mweka Territory); (4) Haut Lomami: beans (Kanyama 

Territory); (5) Maniema: rice (Kibombo, Kassongo, Kabambare sites); and (6) Tshopo: rice (Opala, 

Isangi, Imela, and Banalia Territories). These areas were proposed based on the following criteria: 

(i) accessibility; (ii) existence of infrastructure (warehouses and packaging lines); (iii) mastery of the 

relevant crop by experienced farmers with a high level of organization; (iv) easy access to inputs and 

a high level of production; and (v) existence of plant materials for reproduction and propagation. The 

targeted provinces have a substantial and diverse agricultural potential which, if harnessed, will help 

to partly reduce the country’s food shortage. 

2.5.2 This is one of the priority development areas defined in the Government’s Five-Year 

Programme 2012-2016.This choice is also based on a spatial approach as recommended in the 2013-

2017 CSP, which has been extended to 2020 and focuses particularly on the central and neighbouring 

provinces, and on criteria for the use of the integrated approach to sector-based operations, and the 

consolidation and enhancement of the achievements of Bank-funded and supported operations. The 

provinces of Maniema and Tshopo (rice-growing provinces) have been added to those of the Centre 

Zone to take into account the Government’s desire to implement many operations in the country’s 

rice production sub-sector and to complement the operations of other technical and financial partners 

(IFAD). 

2.5.3. Project Beneficiaries 

Some 1,768,825 rural households, including 60% of women, will benefit directly from the project. 

Given that the average size of a household is about six (6) people, 10.612.950 people will therefore 

benefit directly from the project. The benefits will take several forms, including capacity building in 

the use of modern farming techniques, innovations and good farming practices. Other benefits 

include increased productivity and production, better crop management, improved food and nutrition 

security and increased household incomes, as well as improved general well-being of households. 

Besides the rural households that will benefit directly from the project, about 3,353,650 households 

would benefit indirectly from the project through the dissemination of farming technologies, 

innovations and good practices among the direct project beneficiaries. 

2.6 Participatory Approach for Project Identification, Design and Implementation  

2.6.1. The project design is based on the value chain approach adopted for the TAAT programme 

and takes into account several factors including, in particular, proven high-performance technologies, 

agricultural sub-sector support infrastructure, ability of producers and available manpower, conditions 

for market access, market demand and consumer preference.  

2.6.2 A broad-based participatory approach was used during the preparation of PADCA-6P. During 

the preparation mission, discussions and exchanges were held with all stakeholders involved in project 

implementation. Meetings were held with the representatives of the Ministry of Finance and the 

Ministry of Agriculture, particularly the Project and Programme Monitoring Unit of the Ministry of 

Finance. Discussions were held with key agricultural sector stakeholders such as the National Institute 

of Economics and Agricultural Research (INERA), the National Seed Service (SENASEM), the 

National Extension Service (SNV), Provincial Inspectorates of Agriculture, and other seed sub-sector 



 

10 

and private sector stakeholders represented by the Fédération des Entreprises du Congo (Federation of 

Congolese Businesses) and the General Directorate of the Bukanga Lonzo Agro-industrial Park. 

Consultations and due diligence meetings were held with the key TFPs operating in the agricultural and 

nutrition sector in DRC, notably the Inter-Donor Group for Agriculture and Rural Development 

(GIBADER), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the World Food Programme (WFP), the 

European Union (EU), the Belgian Development Agency (ENABEL – formerly Belgian Technical 

Cooperation) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), to familiarize 

them with ongoing operations and envisage improved aid and operation coordination. 

2.6.3 This participatory, inclusive and holistic approach which is based on lessons learned from 

similar projects aims to contribute significantly to:(i) increasing agricultural productivity and production 

by identifying and disseminating appropriate technologies;(ii) providing training and organizing 

agricultural extension campaigns on the adoption of good farming practices through the effective 

provision of technologies to farmers;(iii) promoting a plant sub-sector development policy; and (iv) 

offering vulnerable groups, particularly women and youths, the opportunity to participate fully in the 

main stages of agricultural sub-sector development. Discussions with the authorities and officials of the 

Ministry of Agriculture, other technical and financial partners (GIBADER and FAO), as well as 

farmers’ groups and associations, and NGOs led to a better definition of the priority actions to be 

implemented in this regard. 

2.6.4 Field visits and discussions held with actors on agricultural value chains helped to identify 

major weaknesses in (i) the production chain (input supply, support/counselling and poor organization, 

inappropriate farming practices, and lack of equipment); (ii) processing (poor organization, lack of 

equipment and inadequate marketing); and (iii) marketing. 

2.7. Bank Group Experience and Lessons Reflected in Project Design 

2.7.1 As at 31 December 2018, the Bank Group’s active portfolio in DRC comprised a total of 31 

public sector operations for a cumulative amount of UA 1 020.67 million. This includes 25 national 

operations for a cumulative amount of UA 895.77 million, of which 21 investment projects (UA 891.15 

million), 3 studies (UA 3.90 million) and 1 emergency humanitarian operation (UA 0.72 million).These 

operations are financed mainly by the ADF for a total of UA 873.21 million (of which UA 163.49 

million under the Transition Support Facility (TSF), that is 18.25%),the Rural Water Supply and 

Sanitation Initiative(RWSSI): UA 4.87 million, the African Water Facility (AWF): UA 1.53 million, 

and the Forest Investment Programme (FIP): UA 15.43 million. The portfolio also includes 6 regional 

projects for a total amount of UA 124.90 million, financed by the ADF, of which UA 65.90 million 

under the TSF. At the national level, the breakdown of the portfolio by sector, which is perfectly 

consistent with the orientations of the CSP and the Bank’s five operational priorities and Ten-year 

Strategy, is as follows: infrastructure sector: (79% transport: 41%, energy: 26%, water and sanitation: 

12%); agricultural sector: 12%; governance sector: 7%, and social sector: 2%.Concerning the 

agricultural sector, 6 national operations are being implemented for cumulative net commitments of UA 

107.65 million (see Annex 3). 

2.7.2 On the whole, from the CSP analysis, portfolio performance as at 31 December 2018 was 
considered satisfactory with a score of 3 on a scale of 4. Performance has remained stable compared 

with the CSP mid-term review carried out in 2015 and the one carried out during the extension of 

the CSP in 2017 to 2020. However, the Portfolio Flashlight Report noted that portfolio performance 

is moderately satisfactory. According to the December 2018 Flashlight Report, only 66% of the 

portfolio achieved a performance considered satisfactory (that is 47% of the portfolio with a 



 

11 

performance considered satisfactory and 19% with a performance considered moderately 

satisfactory), while 33% of the portfolio has an unsatisfactory performance.  

2.7.3 Despite the improvements noted, the implementation of operations continues to face 
recurrent problems which affect performance. These constraints include: (i) delays in fulfilling the 

conditionalities of agreements, particularly the ratification of loan agreements and the fulfilment of 

first disbursement conditions; (ii) the insufficient involvement of line ministries in project 

monitoring; (iii) the poor financial management of some projects, including the conduct of audits; 

and (iv) long delays in the processing of some files by the Bank. 

2.7.4 In light of these findings and in a bid to ensure rapid and consistent project implementation, 
the project design aims to: (i) ease conditions precedent to first disbursement under the project; 

(ii)better involve the line ministry (Ministry of Agriculture) in project monitoring through the 

Secretary-General and the support ministry (Ministry of Rural Development); (iii) promote closer 

and greater collaboration between sector (AHAI) and regional (RDGC)directorates and strengthen 

the country office to ensure the swift processing of files submitted to the Bank for approval. 

2.8 Key Performance Indicators 

2.8.1 The main performance indicators contained in the project logical framework are:(i) food 

insecurity rate; (ii) severe malnutrition prevalence rate; (iii) level of increase in food crop 

productivity (cassava, rice, maize, beans/cowpeas);(iv) number of women and youths integrated into 

agricultural value chains; number of job and economic opportunities created for youths and women; 

(v) number of households that have adopted new technologies; (vi) increase in crop productivity 

through proper fertilization;(vii) number of groups structured; (viii) number of seed producer and 

multiplier groups supported; (ix) number of seed laws adopted; and (x) number of platforms 

facilitating technological innovations established. Concerning the food and nutrition security of 

people in DRC, the food insecurity rate will be reduced to less than 20%, the severe malnutrition rate 

from 10% to a level below 5%, and the chronic malnutrition rate from 43% to below 20%.The 

productivity and production of beans will be increased to 0.86 t/ha, cassava from 8 t/ha to 10 t/ha, 

rice from 0.720 kg/ha to 4-7 t/ha and maize from 0.8 t/ha to 1.5 t/ha.  

2.8.2 The number of households adopting new technologies is estimated at more than 75%. The 

number of women and youths involved in agricultural value chains is expected to be 80 000 (women) 

and 60 000 (youths). In the second year, the project will establish the baseline situation and register 

beneficiaries in the production basins of each crop. All these indicators relate to the African 

Development Bank’s Feed Africa programme. 

III. PROJECT FEASIBILITY 

3.1. Economic and Financial Performance 

3.1.1. Project financial analysis was conducted using three models of activity based on market 

prices. The main assumptions underlying the analyses include: (i) 80 000 farmers are actively 

engaged in agriculture under the project at full capacity; (ii) the project will lead to a 25% increase 

in incomes; (iii) farmers will adopt improved varieties of maize, bean and rice seeds; (iii) a 20-year 

period was used to measure the incremental benefits of the project; (iv) the opportunity cost of the 

capital used to update future benefits was estimated at 12%.  



 

12 

3.1.2 For economic analysis: (v) the value of wage labour was adjusted using a conversion factor 

of 0.75; and (vi) the rehabilitation of the seed system will ensure national supply of quality seeds. 

These analyses were carried out based on financial and economic costs generated using Costab 32. 

The financial and economic analysis is summarized in Annex VII and developed in Annex B6 of 

Volume II of the Appraisal Report. 

3.1.3 The project is expected to generate the following benefits: (i) increased food production; 

(ii) increased private sector investments; (iii) improved seed production and storage; (iv) increased 

average household income; (v) job creation for 140 000 farmers and entrepreneurs; and (vi) improved 

nutrition through use of bio-fortified foods. 

Table 3.1: Key Economic and Financial Figures 

IRR (baseline scenario): 19%   NPV equivalent to:  FC 18 753 235 485.13   

ERR (baseline scenario):  26%   NPV equivalent to:  FC 22 530 519 219.40   

NB: Detailed calculations are presented in Annex B7 

3.1.4 Financial Analysis: based on the above assumptions, the financial analysis generated a net 

present value of FC 18 753 235 485.13 and a 19% internal rate of return, as shown in the technical 

annexes (B6). Based on the above analysis, the project is deemed financially viable. The 19% IRR 

is above the opportunity cost of capital (12%). 

3.1.5 Economic Analysis: the economic analysis was carried out using the same approach as for 

the financial analysis, based on the reference prices of tradeable goods and the total project cost. In 

addition, other indirect benefits were also expected such as reduced post-harvest losses, the 

establishment of an agricultural equipment service centre, a reliable soil information system for 

fertilizer mixtures, an efficient system for the distribution of inputs through the farmer database 

system and reduced cost of transporting goods and services. However, it was difficult to assess these 

additional benefits in monetary terms owing to the limited scope of this report. Under such 

conditions, the economic analysis showed an NPV of FC 22 530 519 219.40 and a 26% IRR, as 

shown in the technical annexes. 

3.2 Environmental and Social Impact 

Environment 

3.2.1 The proposed activities do not entail any physical or economic resettlement. The project 
falls under the TAAT initiative which focuses much more on technology transfer. Besides 

introducing and disseminating new technologies in production areas, the project will only rehabilitate 

infrastructure deemed necessary. Production is mostly rain-fed and rice is irrigated in some areas 

under well controlled conditions.  

3.2.2 PADCA-6P has been classified under Environmental Category 2 pursuant to the Bank’s 

environmental and social assessment procedures (ESAPs), considering the nature of its activities. An 

environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA), together with an environmental and social 

management plan (ESMP), was prepared between January 2019 and March 2019, PADCA-6P 

outcomes are not expected to generate major environmental and social impacts. They will mostly 

address the following real social problems: (i) improvement of the food and nutrition security of the 



 

13 

people; (ii) provision of support for the production, supply and distribution of improved seeds, taking 

into account climate, certified plant material and input risks/variations; (iii) promotion of farm 

mechanization; (iv) promotion of processing systems; and (v) building the technical and 

organizational capacity of farmers’ organizations, civil society and the private sector involved in the 

value chains of the agricultural products concerned. These outcomes will radically improve the living 

conditions of the beneficiary populations (employment of youths and women) in the six project 

provinces and at the national level.  

3.2.3 There will be no irreversible or large-scale negative impact. Most of the impacts will be 

temporary and limited in time. The negative environmental and social impacts of PADCA-6P 

activities will be: (i) risks of pollution of the ground water and water rivers as well as soil degradation 

linked to the use of pesticides and fertilizers (even the project will promote the use of the use of 

mineral and organic fertilizers with local adaptation according to soil deficiencies locally adapted 

mineral and organic fertilizers, depending on soil deficiencies); (ii) fertilization and cropping (crop 

association and rotation) and herbicide (biodegradable materials will be recommended to reduce 

negative impacts) system. 

3.2.4 Socially, there could be the recrudescence of water-borne diseases; insecurity and social 

constraints due to the influx of migrant populations into the project area; risks of accidents and 

nuisances resulting from the rehabilitation and construction of various infrastructure such as 

platforms (the project will set up 6 multipurpose platforms (MPPs) in the project area). Each MPP 

will cover a surface area of between 100 and 200 square metres, including access to drinking water 

and sanitation in storage areas (100-square metre storage room). To prevent these risks, measures 

have been proposed in the ESMP and the overall cost of implementing the environmental and social 

safeguard measures will stand at USD 505,000. The Project Management Unit will be responsible 

for implementing the ESMP. 

Adaptation to Climate Change 

3.2.5 The agricultural sector is very vulnerable to climate change in DRC because of the extreme 

variability of climate parameters, especially rainfall. Seasonal droughts cause serious disruption of 

agricultural calendars, while agriculture is rain-fed, which significantly affects production and, 

hence, the food security of communities, especially in rural areas. They also cause poverty because 

farming is the main means of livelihood in these areas. In addition, the climate risks identified under 

PADCA-6P are compounded by a rain-dependent production system, subsistence agriculture, 

environment-unfriendly farming practices, absence of rigorous compliance with crop management 

techniques and lack of a climate risk information and management system. The specific impacts in 

the project impact area include: (i) drop in the yields of the main crops (cassava, maize, rice, beans 

and cowpea), including those targeted by PADCA-6P; (ii) physical and chemical soil degradation 

leading to reduced agricultural productivity and pasture plant resources for animals; and (iii) 

worsening of land conflicts. 

Gender Situation 

3.2.6 Gender equality is a right enshrined in the country’s constitution. The country has also 

ratified international protocols on the promotion of gender equality. However, despite the progress 

made regarding the legal framework, gender equality is still a major challenge in the country.  Gender 

equality-related issues may be mainstreamed in the various value chain development activities.  

Although women play a key role in agriculture, they face many challenges and constraints, 



 

14 

particularly limited access to the various means of production, unequal access to agricultural inputs 

(seeds, fertilizers, etc.) and lack of access to credit.  

3.2.7 For women to also benefit from the project, specific activities will be designed for them to 

enhance their economic and social empowerment. The project will seek to: (i) ensure socio-economic 

empowerment; (ii) increase the participation of men and women in the promotion of agribusiness in 

the project areas; (iii) create conditions for equal access to project resources by men, women and 

youths; and (iv) increase the participation of women in the decision-making process throughout the 

agricultural value chain. The project will encourage a gender transformation approach through: (a) 

capacity building in all aspects of the agricultural value chain, including the establishment of 

cooperatives/business associations headed by women, and the development of their leadership and 

entrepreneurship technical skills; and (b) the construction of gender-sensitive infrastructure. The 

project will also support gender-specific monitoring and evaluation information activities that will 

be indicated in the reports prepared. 

IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION 

4.1 Implementation Arrangements – Monitoring and Evaluation Mechanism  

4.1.1 PADCA-6P will be placed under the oversight of the Ministry in charge of agriculture 

through the Secretariat General for Agriculture (SGA) which, in that capacity, will facilitate 

interactions with the other sector ministries and technical and financial partners. It will also 

coordinate monitoring and evaluation activities. Consultation at the national level will be carried out 

by a National Steering Committee (CNP) which, for reasons of harmonization and consistency, will 

be the same one set up under PEJAB (see Volume II- Technical Annex B5). At the decentralized 

level, consultation will be carried out by Provincial Consultation Committees (CCs). These bodies 

will validate and supervise the implementation of provincial investment planning in order to ensure 

alignment and coherence with provincial and national strategies and other sector operations.  

4.1.2  Regarding the Project Management Unit (PMU), it was agreed that the PEJAB Coordinator 

will be the PDACA-6P Coordinator, assisted by a project officer. The PMU will be responsible for 

project implementation, assisted by a project officer recruited for that purpose. It will ensure effective 

management and recruit the experts required (1 procurement expert, 1financial management expert, 

1 accountant, 1 environmental expert, 1 rural infrastructure expert placed on secondment from the 

Ministry of  Rural Development and 1 value chain monitoring and evaluation officer). The project 

will supply additional equipment (logistics, ICT and management tools). The project will provide 

resources to reinforce the project management and coordination entity.  

4.1.3 The project monitoring and evaluation mechanism will be designed taking into account the 

target indicators adopted for the project components as well as their expected impact, outcome and 

output indicators. Socio-economic surveys will be conducted according to a frequency to be 

determined to inform the performance and impact indicators. At project start-up, a baseline situation 

will be clearly established, with gender-disaggregated data to provide information on the level of the 

initial key indicators that will be monitored. Monitoring and evaluation activities will be carried out 

in collaboration with the National Agricultural Statistics Service. 

4.1.4  Quarterly and annual progress reports will also be prepared and submitted to the Bank, in 

accordance with the agreements signed. The Bank will field at least two monitoring and supervision 

missions annually. The DRC Country Office will maintain permanent dialogue with the Government 



 

15 

and monitor the project. At the end of the project, the Government will prepare a Completion Report 

on the basis of which the Bank will draft its Project Completion Report (PCR). 

4.2 Procurement Arrangements 

4.2.1 Procurements of goods (including non-consultancy services), works and consultancy 

services financed by the Bank under the project will be done in accordance with the “Procurement 

Policy and Methodology for Bank Group-funded Operations” approved in October 2015, as well as 

the provisions set forth in the Financing Agreement. Specifically, procurements will be done in 

accordance with: (i) the Borrower’s national procurement procedures (NPPs)  governed by Law No. 

10/10 of 10 April 2010 on Public Procurement, as well as its implementing decrees; (ii) Bank 

procurement methods and procedures (BPMPs) using relevant standard bidding documents (SBDs) 

for contracts that are (a) above the thresholds shown in Annex  B7, Para. B.7.3.2 or (b) for 

procurements for which the Borrower’s national procurement procedures (NPPs) is considered 

inappropriate; and (iii) third party procurement systems (e.g. co-financing).  

4.2.2 Procurement Risk and Capacity Assessment (PRCA): the country, sector and project 

procurement risks as well as the procurement capacity of the executing agency (EA) were assessed 

and the findings used to guide the selection of the procurement system (Borrower, Bank or third 

party) to be used for specific activities or group of similar activities under the project. Appropriate 

risk mitigation measures have been included in the action plan presented in Para. B.7.9. of Annex 

B7. 

4.2.3 PADCA’s PMU will be responsible for procurement of goods, works and services. The 

PMU will backed by the Public Procurement and Management Unit (CGPMP) of the Secretariat 

General of MINAGRI, in pursuance of the provisions of Section 13 (1) of the Public Procurement 

Code, as supplemented by Article 2 of Decree No. 10/32 2012 on the establishment, organization 

and functioning of the Project and Public Procurement Management Unit. 

4.2.4 The unit’s procurement capacity is deemed insufficient. The Implementation Unit of 

PADCA-6P should therefore recruit a project procurement expert whose commencement of work 

should be approved beforehand by the Bank.  

4.2.5 A procurement plan (PP) was designed during project preparation. The PP will be updated 

by the PMU at project start-up and posted on the Bank’s website. The PP will cover an initial period 

of 18 months and updated each year as appropriate, but always after 18 months during the project 

implementation period. The procurement plan, detailed procurement methods and the goods and 

service procurement table are presented in the technical annexes of the report (Annex B7). 

4.3 Financial Management Arrangements 

Project financial management will be entrusted to a project team to be recruited. The team will 

benefit from the close collaboration of the Coordination Unit of PEJAB through: (i) the supervision 

of financial and accounting tasks; (ii) the updating of management tools (existing software and 

manual); (iii) the reinforcement of the internal control mechanism; (iv) the preparation of interim 

financial reports and annual financial statements; and (v) the monitoring of audit activities and 

transmission of audit reports to the Bank. The PADCA-6P procedures manual will be based on that 

of PAJEB, but revised to take into account the specificities of PADCA-6P. The project financial 

management conditions will be confirmed and presented in detail in Volume II- Technical Annexes 

of the Project Appraisal Report. 

 



 

16 

4.4 Disbursement Arrangements 

4.4.1 Loan resources will be disbursed in accordance with the Bank’s Disbursement Manual once 

the Loan Agreement enters into effect, and the conditions precedent to first disbursement are 

fulfilled. It is envisaged that the first disbursement will be effected within the three months following 

signature of the Loan Agreement. The following disbursement methods will be used for 

disbursement of loan resources by the Bank: (i) the direct payment method and (ii) the revolving 

fund or special account method, and (iii) the reimbursement method. The direct payment method 

will be used for payment of works, goods and services contracts. The special account method will 

be used to finance operating expenses. The Bank will transmit the "Disbursement Letter" specifying 

the special provisions for the withdrawal of project funds and management of special accounts.  

4.4.2 The Bank reserves the right to take protective measures in compliance with the general 

conditions to, among other things, suspend the disbursements of funds where its fiduciary 

requirements are not met.  

4.4.3 The Government will contribute to project financing through accounting valuation of the 

recurrent operating expenditure (salaries, rents, etc.) of the SGA financed by the State budget. There 

will be no other disbursements in terms of financial flows in respect of the national counterpart 

contribution. 

4.4.4 Disbursements will be made according to the list of goods and services and in accordance 

with Bank rules and procedures as laid down in the disbursement manual. Disbursement conditions 

are presented in detail in the technical annexes. 

4.5 Audit Arrangements  

External Audit: on the date of project appraisal, the SGA had not submitted the 2017 audit report 

for the Study on the Development of Agro-industrial Parks due on 30 June 2018, that is a delay of 

close to 8 (eight) months. The 2017 PPF audit reports for PEJAB and LEAFII were deemed 

acceptable by the Bank. Many audit reports are expected on 30 June 2019, and the processes for the 

recruitment of audit firms are ongoing. Annual project audits financed with loan resources will be 

conducted by an independent external audit firm to be recruited on a competitive basis and in 

accordance with the standard terms of reference (ToR) in force at the Bank. The external auditor 

could be recruited in collaboration with the Court of Auditors.  Audit-related expenses will be borne 

by the project. Audits will be conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing 

(ISA) and International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAI). Financial statements 

audited by the independent audit firm will be transmitted (see table for frequency) to the Bank within 

the six months following the closure of the financial year under consideration.

4.7 Governance 

4.7.1 The Mo Ibrahim Foundation report on 54 African countries (2017 Edition) notes that DRC 

is among a group of countries that made the most remarkable progress in the 2017 Index of African 

Governance. The World Governance Index created by the World Bank also shows significant 

progress regarding transparency and accountability, political stability, government effectiveness, 

regulation, rule of law and control of corruption. The project will contribute to enhancing agricultural 

governance in the provinces of Kwilu, Kasaï, Lomami, Haut-Lomami, Tshopo and Maniema in 

support of the promotion of the agricultural value chain. 

4.7.2. The recent presidential election is expected to strengthen governance quality. PADCA-6P 

implementation will be placed under the oversight of the Ministry in charge of agriculture through 

the Secretariat General for Agriculture which, in that capacity, will facilitate interactions with the 

other sector ministries. It will also coordinate monitoring and evaluation activities. Consultation will 

be carried out by a National Steering Committee (CNP) at the national level and by Provincial 

Consultation Committees (CCs) at the decentralized level. 

4.7.3 The improvements noted notwithstanding, the Bank portfolio review showed that the 

implementation of operations is still facing recurrent problems that affect performance. The 

constraints faced include: (i) bottlenecks in the fulfilment of loan agreement conditionalities, 

particularly the ratification of loan agreements and the fulfilment of conditions precedent to first 

disbursement; (ii) the low involvement of oversight ministries in project monitoring; and (iii) the 

poor financial management of some projects, especially the conduct of audits. To mitigate these risks 

and enhance good governance, the project will reinforce the PADCA management team which will 

comprise a procurement expert. In addition, the project will support local governance through greater 

regional consultation, secured land tenure systems and capacity building for infrastructure 

management cooperatives and bodies.  

4.8 Sustainability 

4.8.1 Project sustainability will be ensured by enhancing the capacity of institutional actors 

(beneficiaries, State services, service-providing NGOs, local elected representatives, etc.) to replicate 

the good initiatives the project would have developed throughout its existence. The potential effect 

and the sustainability of the expected impacts of the implementation of the activities of the various 

sub-sectors mainly depend on the project’s holistic approach, its intervention and support principles 

upstream and downstream of the sub-sectors.  



 

18 

4.8.2 The sustainability of investments and expected benefits is contingent upon: (i) beneficiaries 

who are better trained and equipped for production and processing; (ii) the choice of locally tested 

and easily mastered varieties, techniques and technologies; (iii) support for the restructuring and 

supervision of beneficiaries in the management, maintenance and replacement of productive 

facilities; (iv) social cohesion, especially community work, which will  contribute to ensuring 

sustainability ; (v) institutions and other actors who are trained and empowered to better conduct 

participatory variety selection (PVS) tests and adoption of good farming practices; (vi) the 

development of partnerships and synergies with national institutions and organizations such as the 

National Extension Service, the National Seed Service and the National Institute of Agronomic 

Studies and Research, which will contribute to ensuring sustainability; and (vii) the involvement of 

the private sector in seed multiplication and the marketing of products, which will ensure continuity 

of production, processing and marketing.  

4.8.3 The national and international laws in place in DRC require the conduct of a prior 

environmental and social impact assessment, especially Law No. 11/9 of 9 July 2011 on the 

fundamental principles for protection of environment, Section 2 of which states that: “Every 

development, infrastructure or industrial, commercial, agricultural, forestry, mining, 

telecommunications, etc. project likely to have an environmental impact shall be subject to a prior 

environmental and social impact assessment, together with its duly approved management plan”. 

4.9 Risk Management 

4.9.1 The project will adopt a participatory approach based on response to request. It will 

introduce technological and technical innovations already tested in research/development institutions 

and/or pilot farmers, through the activities of research centres.  As a result, the technical risks related 

to these activities will be few. The other risks that could affect PADCA-6P are:  

(i) The difficulties in finding local service providers capable of providing the institutional 
and technical support that the project seeks to develop;    

(ii) The weak capacity of the population to implement a participatory, decentralized 
approach for expressing priority needs in a context characterized by the absence 

and/or weakness of grassroots community organizations.   

Mitigation  measures: the risk mitigation strategy adopted by PADCA-6P consists in: (i) promoting 

the structuring, organization and capacity building of the population/farmers’ organizations; and (ii) 

developing, in collaboration with financial partners and specialized NGOs in the provinces 

concerned, consultation and conflict prevention mechanisms among traditional rulers and 

decentralized local authorities. The new political climate ushered in by the presidential and 

legislative elections is expected to mitigate this risk. 

4.9.2 The major potential risks that project implementation may face and their mitigation 

measures are presented in the table below: 

  



 

19 

4.10. Knowledge Building 

4.10.1 Cassava sub-sector activities contribute to knowledge building and sharing. They include: 

(i) the dissemination of production and processing technologies which will help to develop expertise 

in the sub-sector and promote mechanization; (ii) training in production and processing and exchange 

visits which are tools for interaction between researchers, advisory support workers and 

beneficiaries; (iii) awareness-raising and information dissemination through various communication 

channels (community radios, media programmes, website, etc.); and (iv) promotion of innovative 

actions for  youth and women employability in the growth areas of the sub-sector.  

4.10.2 The project will use the Semi-Autotrophic Hydroponic (SAH) rapid multiplication 

technology. The introduction of this technology helps to rapidly obtain large quantities of healthy 

cuttings.  

4.10.3 Regarding fertilization, the project will introduce the integrated soil fertility management 

(ISFM) approach which combines organic and inorganic soil fertility inputs. To improve agronomic 

efficiency, the use of mineral and organic fertilizers with improved varieties will be promoted. They 

will also be adapted to the local context in case the soils need additional lime or dolomite for greater 

increase in productivity. 

 

 

No. Potential Risks Level Mitigation Measures 

1 Insufficient synergy of action 

between project partners 

High - Establishment of a project coordination 
unit and proper planning of activities, 

and fielding of joint missions 

- Reinforcement of collaboration and 
coordination between research and 

agricultural counselling institutions. 

2 Insufficient support from the 

population 

Moderate - Establishment of an appropriate 
communication plan for all actors and 

agricultural counselling and training 

activities 

- Establishment of platforms 

3 Worsening of the political and 

security crisis in the country and its 

spread to the project area 

 

High 

- Establishment of coordination branches 
in the provinces 

- Coordination of security information 
with the United Nations system  

- Facilitating social cohesion  

4   Climate hazards and pest 

outbreaks 

High - Mainstreaming of the adaptation 
dimension in activities   

- Integrated farming approach and use of 
resistant and tolerant varieties 

5 Inadequate road infrastructure Moderate - Synergy with existing AFDB projects

Project Summary 

1. Project overview: The Rural Economy Integrated Development Support Project 
(PROADER) will be implemented in the rural areas of Kasaï-Central, Kasaï, Kasaï-Oriental, 

Kwilu, Kwango, Kongo Central and Mai-Ndombe Provinces. About 60% of the inhabitants of 

these provinces live below the extreme poverty line of USD 1.9 per day. The targeted corridor is 

an integral part of areas most severely affected by the humanitarian crisis in the Democratic 

Republic of Congo (DRC). The area has a huge agricultural, forestry, pastoral and fisheries 

production potential, and can serve as a vector for the promotion of agribusiness. It is the junction 

area between the West (Kinshasa border with the Republic of Congo), the Southwest (border with 

Angola) and the Southeast (Grand Katanga towards Zambia). The overall objective of the project 

is to promote a dynamic and prosperous rural economy by improving agricultural and rural 

socioeconomic services, and by diversifying and enhancing agricultural production. To achieve 

this objective, PROADER’s activities will be centred on the following components: (a) local 

governance and institutional capacity building; (b) promotion of productive and social 

investments; and (c) project coordination and management. The project cost is estimated at UA 

49,49 million, of which UA 39,99 million will be contributed by ADF Loan, UA 2,1 million by 

ADF grant from Loan cancellation, UA 6,84 million by the Government and UA 0.56 million by 

the project beneficiaries. The project will be implemented over a six-year period. 

2. PROADER will directly affect 380,000 households in the 30 selected agricultural, 
forestry and pastoral basins, representing nearly 10% of households in the seven targeted 

provinces, or about 2 million people, of whom 50% are women and at least 40% are young 

people. The project will indirectly affect nearly 500,000 households or about 2.6 million people. 

The expected project benefits are the increase in rural household income, the reduction in chronic 

malnutrition among children under five, the increased share of the agricultural sector in the 

national Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and the enhanced resilience of rural households. 

3. Needs assessment: The Bank’s intervention is justified partly by the considerable 

investment needs of the DRC agricultural sector, which must be met to allow the actors of this 

sector to fully play their roles in the structural transformation of Congolese agriculture. The 

project area is replete with natural resources that offer value-adding opportunities with the 

potential to generate wealth for the rural economy. However, agricultural/rural development 

continues to face problems that hinder the dynamism of the rural economy and should, therefore, 

be given special attention. These problems include: (i) the low productivity of traditional 

subsistence farming systems characterised by shifting cultivation and slash-and-burn practices, the 

use of degenerated local seeds, rudimentary farming techniques and high vulnerability to climate 

change. According to the E-QUIBB 2016 survey, 1.8% of households use modern farming 

techniques and 0.8% have access to agricultural machinery; (ii) weak local governance leading to 

significant inadequacies in the planning and maintenance of basic infrastructure required for 

economic development; and (iii) lack of development opportunities for small- and medium-sized 

enterprises in occupational areas related to the development of agricultural and rural services. The 

formal request of the DRC Government was made to the Bank in March 2019. 

4. Bank’s value-added: The Bank’s value-added stems from its experience acquired 

through its interventions in the agricultural and rural sector. Bank intervention will consolidate the 

gains of Bank-financed rural development sector projects under which several rural infrastructure 

facilities were rehabilitated. It will also revive the rural sector, which was left in utter shambles by 

the conflicts. This project lays special emphasis on the establishment of a sustainable mechanism 

for the management and maintenance of rural infrastructure, including roads, with the building of 

the institutional and financial capacity of Decentralised Territorial Entities (ETDs) and the 

involvement of economic actors and the communities concerned. 



iii 

 

5. Knowledge building: PROADER will generate knowledge on the development of the 

rural economy in the DRC, including the challenges, methodologies and benefits of local planning, 

integrated water management, digitisation of farms and registration of producers, the public-

private-producer partnership (or 4P)1 and the financing of gender mainstreaming innovations. As 

part of knowledge management, an electronic library will be set up to store all relevant documents 

from the agricultural and rural sector, which will be accessible to stakeholders and the public. To 

this end, an inventory of best practices, identification of local knowledge and innovations will be 

carried out. This activity will be developed as part of institutional support to the Department of 

Studies and Planning (DEP) of the Ministry in charge of Rural Development. The project's 

monitoring and evaluation system and the gender-sensitive social and institutional communication 

strategy that will be developed will facilitate the production of information for dissemination to 

stakeholders, particularly through partner community radio stations. The knowledge generated by 

the project will help to fuel policy dialogues, support and improve the design of new projects.  

 

                                                 
1  A 4P is a cooperation arrangement between a government, entrepreneurs and small producers, who agree to work together to 

reach a common goal or perform a specific task, while jointly assuming the risks and responsibilities and sharing benefits, 

resources and skills. An illustration of a 4P is presented in Annex B.1.4, Volume II, of the Appraisal Report.

BANK GROUP MANAGEMENT’S REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION TO THE 

BOARD OF DIRECTORS CONCERNING A PROPOSAL TO GRANT A LOAN TO THE 

DEMOCRATIC DEVELOPMENT REPUBLIC OF CONGO TO FINANCE THE RURAL 

ECONOMY INTEGRATED DEVELOPMENT SUPPORT PROJECT (PROADER) 

 

Management hereby submits this report and its recommendation concerning a proposal to grant a 

Loan of UA 39.997.947 and a Grant of UA 2.100.000 from Loan cancellations to the Government 

of the Democratic Republic of Congo to finance the Rural Economy Integrated Development 

Support Project. 

I. STRATEGIC THRUST AND OBJECTIVES 

1.1. Project Linkages with Country Strategy and Objectives 

1.1.1 The project is consistent with the DRC's 2016-2021 Strategic Development Framework 

(SDF), which seeks to achieve economic and social development by diversifying the economy 

through: (i) agriculture and the agro-food chain; (i) forest exploitation, timber processing and 

marketing industries; (iii) mining; (iv) construction and building materials; (v) the tourism and 

hotel business; and (vi) financial services. The project is also aligned with the National 

Agricultural Investment Plan (PNIA) for 2014-2020, whose overall objective is to stimulate 

sustained annual growth of the agricultural sector by more than 6% - an essential prerequisite for 

reducing poverty, ensuring the people’s food security and nutrition, and sustainably generating 

jobs and income. PROADER is in line with the country's Decentralisation Policy, which 

empowers the Provinces and ETDs to plan and assume responsibility for the economic 

development of their communities and to become real drivers of development from the grassroots. 

According to the 1-2-3 Survey (2016), 63.4% of the population, or 46 million Congolese, live 

below the poverty line and close to three-quarters of them below the extreme poverty line. In 

terms of the human assets index (HAI) and the human development index (HDI), the DRC ranks 

146th out of 157 countries, with an HAI of 0.37 (2017), and 176th out of 189 countries with an HDI 

of 0.457 (2018). The country offers very few formal job opportunities and overall 

underemployment affects 85.7% of the workforce (82% of men and 89.7% of women).  

1.1.2  PROADER is consistent with the 2013-2017 Country Strategy Paper (CSP), extended 

respectively to the end of 2018 and the end of 2020, the two pillars of which are: (i) development 

of private investment and regional integration support infrastructure; and (ii) building central 

government’s capacity to increase public revenue and create an enabling framework for private 

investment. The project will help to strengthen the structural transformation of the rural and 

agricultural sector, which offers a real opportunity to diversify the country's economy and create 

jobs. The project design is in line with the Bank's "Feed Africa" strategy, which is based on the 

value chain approach and seeks to improve productivity and resilience by adopting technology 

through two flagship programmes: Technologies for African Agricultural Transformation (TAAT) 

and Africa Climate-Smart Agriculture (ACSA). PROADER is also aligned with youth 

employment strategies, including the “ENABLE YOUTH” initiative. Lastly, the project will help 

to strengthen women's economic empowerment, and thus dovetails with Pillar 2 of the Bank's 

Gender Strategy, which is based on women's economic empowerment. 

1.2. Rationale for Bank Intervention  

1.2.1. The development of agriculture and agribusiness is an economic diversification pillar of 

the Strategic Development Framework (SDF), aimed at the economic and social development of 

the DRC. The DRC abounds in natural resources, which offer opportunities for the creation of 

value-added that could lead to the generation of wealth for the rural economy. However, 

agricultural/rural development continues to be handicapped by: (i) the low productivity of 

traditional subsistence farming systems characterised by shifting cultivation and slash-and-burn 



2 

practices, the use of degenerated local seeds, rudimentary farming techniques and high 

vulnerability to climate change; (ii) weak local governance leading to notable inadequacies in the 

planning and maintenance of basic infrastructure required for economic development; and (iii) the 

lack of development opportunities for small- and medium-sized enterprises in occupational areas 

related to the development of agricultural and rural services.. Therefore, the project will help to 

strengthen the structural transformation of the agricultural and rural sector, which offers a real 

opportunity to diversify the country's economy and create jobs, especially for young people. It will 

support the improvement of agricultural productivity and the organisation of small producers to 

guarantee regular and appropriate supply for agro-industries located in the selected production 

basins and operating in the priority value chains of the targeted areas. Moreover, this intervention 

will enhance and consolidate the major gains of previous Bank-financed projects in terms of rural 

development sector infrastructure, and will thus promote the revival of a rural sector that was 

completely in tatters due to lack of investments and as a result of conflicts in the project areas. 

Furthermore, the Bank's intervention will help to strengthen social cohesion and reduce the 

fragility of the intervention area, which is the focus area of the operational activities of the current 

CSP. 

1.2.2. The agricultural and rural sector requires significant investments to enable all actors in 

the sector to fully play their role in the transformation of Congolese agriculture. In this context 

and as a result of its experiences gained through the implementation of its strategies for 

transforming agriculture, overcoming fragility and building resilience in Africa, the Bank enjoys a 

real comparative advantage as far as this intervention is concerned. 

1.3. Aid Coordination 

1.3.1. The activities of the DRC's development partners are coordinated through the Aid and 

Investment Management Platform (PGAI), hosted in the Ministry of Planning. Technical activities 

are discussed and planned in thematic groups, including the Inter-Donor Group for Agriculture 

and Rural Development (GIBADER). PROADER will develop synergies and complementarities 

with ongoing investment projects in the agricultural and rural sector financed by other donors, 

which include: (i) the Government-funded Agricultural Voluntary Programme (PVA); (ii) the 

PAPAKIN project, financed by IFAD; (iii) the Kwilu/Kwango Districts Agricultural Development 

Programme (PRODAKK) and the Kwilu/Kwango Access Improvement Programme (PRODEKK), 

financed by the Kingdom of Belgium and implemented by Enabel (former Belgian Technical 

Cooperation); and (iv) the World Bank-funded Growth Pole Development Project (PDPC) in the 

Western Region. Lastly, the project will scale up successful public-private-producer partnership 

initiatives in village palm oil value chains (with the private concern known as Huilerie, 

Plantations, Élevage du Kwango Kwilu - HPEK) (Kwango Kwilu Oil Mill, Plantations and 

Livestock Company), maize with STRATEGOS, cassava with two private concerns: Entreprise de 

Consultance et de Services Agricoles au Congo (Consultancy and Agricultural Services Enterprise 

in Congo) (ECOSAC) and LAYUKA. The project will support the country in mobilising climate 

funds. Lastly, an expected partnership with the next IFAD project that is being designed for 

Kassaï Oriental and Central will maximise the project impact. The following table provides a 

summary of the coordination of the agricultural sector.

2.2. Technical Solution Adopted and Alternatives Explored  

2.2.1 Participatory local development. In accordance with the Constitution of 18 February 

2006, which confers on Decentralised Territorial Entities (ETDs) the responsibility of planning 

and overseeing the economic development of their communities, EDTs are required to manage 

operational activities in their territory. In this context, they play a key role in establishing good 

local governance, facilitating the development of the rural economy and the maintenance of rural 

infrastructure. Under PROADER, preference will be given to the demand-driven approach and the 

strengthening of local project management. In this regard, project investments will not only be 

based on the needs clearly expressed by the actors within the context of the development of value 

chains, but must also support the development of the local economy and be linked to local 

development plans.  

2.2.2 Development of public-private-producer-partnership (4P)3: There are specialised private 

agricultural enterprises in the project intervention area that offer small producers various services, 

including mechanisation, improved input supply and agricultural advisory services. The project 

will adopt the "subcontracting" approach by delegating services related to the improvement of the 

                                                 
2  Including physical and financial contingencies. 
3  A 4P is a cooperation arrangement between a government, entrepreneurs and small producers, who agree to work together to reach a common 

goal or perform a specific task, while jointly assuming the risks and responsibilities, and sharing benefits, resources and skills.

agricultural productivity to specialise agricultural enterprises located in the production basins and 

operating in the targeted value chains. These enterprises will be responsible for supporting 

producers by: (i) providing agricultural advisory services (application of good farming practices), 

(ii) ensuring access to resilient and good quality agricultural inputs (improved seeds and cultivars, 

fertilisers, pesticides, etc.); (iii) purchasing the surplus marketable production from small 

producers and/or unions, following an aggregation model, at a fair price that takes into account the 

cost of production and the market price. Specialised private agricultural enterprises will also 

process raw products into finished and/or semi-finished products for sale on the local, national and 

international markets, which will create value-added in the basins with spin-offs on the rural 

economy in terms of job creation. Specialised private agricultural enterprises will be remunerated 

based on the work actually carried out after the quality of such work has been assessed by all the 

parties concerned (the project/the Government, the private operator and the union). In this regard, 

PROADER will sign partnership protocols/contracts with the following specialised agricultural 

enterprises: (i) Huilerie, Plantation, Élevage de Kwilu/Kwango (HPEC) (Kwilu/Kwango Oil Mill, 

Plantation, Livestock Company), headquartered in Kikwit (Kwilu Province), to support farmers' 

unions in the production of palm oil from the village oil palm plantation covering an area of 2,000 

hectares; (ii) STRATEGOS, headquartered in Lusanga, Kwilu Province, to support 10,000 

producers in maize production. Its intervention will cover 350 villages within a radius of about 50 

km of Lusanga on the right and left banks of the Kwilu River; (iii) LAYUKA, headquartered in 

Madimba, Kongo Central, to support 200 producer associations, representing about 5,000 

households, in cassava production; (iv) Consultance et des Services Agricoles (ECOSAC Sarl) 

(Consultancy and Agricultural Services), to support small producers in the production of cassava. 

This company is currently operating in Bukango Lonzo, Kwango Province, where it is 

headquartered, but plans to set up operations in Kikwit and Bandundu City (Kwilu Province) to 

support the activities of small-scale cassava producers.   

2.2.3 Youth skills development and innovation.: The project will set up a competitive 

mechanism for innovation and promotion of youth entrepreneurship in rural areas. It will finance 

an innovation fund to support entrepreneurs, young people and producer organisations (POs) with 

innovative ideas and initiatives for improving the quality of life and income in rural areas. These 

innovations could concern: (i) the development of new products or new markets; (ii) equipment 

tests and processes; (iii) the use of alternative energy; (iv) new environment-friendly technologies; 

(v) expertise in food quality and safety; (vi) the use of new information and communication 

technologies in the marketing and promotion of products, including fortified cassava flour; and 

(vi) the certification and labelling of processed products. Annual competitions will be held at the 

national level to identify ideas and initiatives with potential for large-scale impact. The innovation 

selection process will include the following steps: Phase A, preselection of the best ideas in 

agricultural value chains based on project profiles submitted by potential candidates; Phase B 

intended to (a) identify potential applications of the technology, (b) learn to recognise the 

market(s) targeted, (c) guide research and development (R&D) taking into account market needs, 

and (d) conduct a technical and commercial proof of concept, to validate the business model and 

design the business plan. By means of a stringent selection process, candidates with the greatest 
potential to succeed will be selected; and Phase C dealing with the funding and close 

support/coaching/mentoring of candidates whose innovations were selected. Individual technical 

assistance will be mobilised for the development of operational procedures based on similar 

successful experiments (Tony Elumelu Entrepreneurship Program, AgriPitch, the Competitive 

Fund for Agricultural Innovation of Côte d'Ivoire, etc.). Financial institutions, telecommunications 

sector operators and private concerns will be encouraged to co-invest in this fund, including 

through acquisition of stakes in the identified micro-, small- and medium-sized agricultural and 

rural enterprises (MPMEARs).

2.2.4 Promotion of community agroforestry: Various agroforestry models have already been 

tested in many African countries with positive results and trials have also been conducted 

successfully in the DRC. The agroforestry system model that will be promoted by the project is 

based on the association between food production (cassava and maize, plus legumes/beans and 

soya beans), fruit trees and charcoal production with Acacia auriculiformis as flagship species for 

soil fertilisation. The model chosen is based on the success of the Mampu Agroforestry Project 

funded by the European Commission, which covers an area of 8,000 hectares. Agroforestry will 

aim to: (i) increase cassava production and yield from 9 tonnes per hectare to 15 tonnes per 

hectare, for a total area of at least 10,000 ha, while slashing production costs by about 30%; (ii) 

increase maize production and yield from 1.5 t/ha to 3 t/ha, for a total area of at least 5,000 ha, 

while slashing production costs by about 25%; and (iii) increase farmers' income by at least 20%.    

2.2.5 Sustainability of investments. The opening up of production areas will mainly concern 

targeted rehabilitation consisting of treatment of critical points (quagmires, low-lying areas, water 

crossing points, steep-slope areas, etc.) to allow the year-round use of a given road section. The 

structures will be made of durable materials and sized in such a way as to allow the proper flow of 

water. The project will support the establishment and operationalisation of multifunctional service 

platforms (PMS) for the promotion of women's economic empowerment. Each platform will 

include a Gender Multifunctional Centre (CMG) for rural job training, awareness raising, 

managerial and leadership capacity building for women. Each infrastructure promoted and 

implemented by the project will be accompanied by a service package (maintenance system, 

technical training in the use and management of the infrastructure, etc.).

2.5. Project Area and Beneficiaries  

2.5.1 PROADER will carry out its operations in seven provinces, namely Kongo Central. 

Kwango, Kwilu, Maindombe, Kasaï, Kasaï Occidental and Kasaï Oriental. This area has 

enormous potential for agro-pastoral and fisheries production. It is the main supplier of staple 

foodstuffs to the country's major cities (Kinshasa, Lubumbashi, Mbuji-Mayi, Kananga, Kikwit and 

Matadi). Moreover, about 70% of the population of this area is rural, having agriculture and 

related activities as their main source of livelihood. With a total population estimated at 

19,558,3054, the project area accounts for nearly 25% of the DRC's total population and covers 

about 22% of the national territory. The project area is part of the Government's priority 

development areas, the more so since the corridor targeted by the project, including the central 

region, is one of the areas most severely affected by the humanitarian crisis in the DRC. 

2.5.2 This area is crossed by the railway and National Road No. 1 (RN 1), which are the part of 

the regional network connecting Kinshasa to Johannesburg in South Africa. Until now, this vast 

territory did not enjoy the benefits of cross-border trade because of its isolation. The operations 

currently being carried out by the Bank on RN1 in coordination with other technical and financial 

partners (TFPs), in particular the European Union, for the extension of this road up to Mbuji-

Mayi, and the World Bank, for the rehabilitation of the Ilebo-Lubumbashi railway, will help to 

open up this major corridor. The project’s intervention area is a continuation of the Bank's 

previous operations in the agricultural and rural development sector in the Central Region and 

Kongo Central.   

2.5.3. Beneficiaries. The Project will target mainly small family farms, producer organisations 

(POs) and their unions, cooperatives and micro-, small- and medium-sized agricultural and rural 

enterprises (MPMEARs) upstream and downstream of the production chain. Of all these actors, 

special attention will be given to women, young people and MPMEARs owned by young people 

and women. The other PROADER beneficiaries are the EDTs, central and devolved State public 

entities, and specialised private agricultural enterprises operating in the targeted production basins 

that not only provide support services, including agricultural extension services and inputs, but 

also add value through the processing of agricultural products. PROADER will directly affect 

380,000 households in the 30 targeted agricultural, forestry and pastoral basins, representing 

nearly 10% of households in seven targeted provinces, or about 2 million people, of whom 50% 

women and 40% young people. Indirectly, the project will affect some 500,000 households or 

about 2.6 million people. PROADER will primarily target young people and women, by 

increasing employment opportunities and income from production and processing activities, 

supporting the development of agricultural entrepreneurship in activities related to production 

(ploughing service, transport, road maintenance, processing, marketing, etc.) and providing 

appropriate advisory support. 

2.6.  Participatory Approach for the Project Identification, Design and Implementation  

2.6.1 The project was designed using a participatory approach based on consultations with the 

various stakeholders throughout the formulation process. In this context, the Secretariat General 

for Rural Development set up a multidisciplinary team of national experts who worked closely 

with Bank experts during the project preparation and appraisal phases. The consultations included 

the Ministries of Rural Development, Agriculture, Decentralisation, Planning, Gender, Child and 

Family, Small- and Medium-sized Enterprises and Technical and Vocational Training, the private 

sector, represented by the Federation of Congolese Enterprises (FEC), non-governmental 

organisations, producer umbrella organisations, producers and processors of agricultural products, 

individually or in association, political and administrative authorities as well as devolved technical

services in the project area, private agricultural operators, ETDs, project managers, specialised 

private agricultural enterprises, microcredit institutions, and several NGO-led initiatives in the 

agricultural and rural development sector.   

2.6.2 These consultations, among other things, helped to identify and more clearly define: (i) 

production basins and priority sectors; (ii) market dynamics and trade flows; (iii) business and 

value-adding opportunities in value chains; (iv) previous project operations; (v) the business 

regulatory environment; constraints to the involvement and effective/proper private sector 

participation; (vi) innovations and technologies for the improvement of production and 

processing; (vii) the involvement and aspirations of women and young people in value chains and; 

(viii) experiences and constraints regarding access to funding, especially on a medium- and long-

term basis, for agricultural and rural development ventures, agribusiness and MPMEARs. 

Stakeholder consultations will continue during project implementation to ensure effective 

implementation and the sustainability of interventions.   

2.7. Consideration of Bank Group Experience and Lessons Learned in the  Project Design 

2.7.1. The portfolio performance as of 31 December 2018 is generally satisfactory, with a rating 

of 3 on a scale of 1 to 4. The average portfolio age increased from 3.8 years in 2017 to 4.4 years as 

of 31 December 2018. The national portfolio does not include any project-at-risk (PAR). 

Regarding the agricultural and rural sector in the DRC, the operations carried out over the past 

five years relate to: (i) the financing of the Rural Infrastructure Development Support Project 

(PADIR), scheduled to close on 31 December 2019. PADIR’s physical implementation rate is 

nearly 98%, with a disbursement rate of 92%. The project has made significant gains in the 

rehabilitation of rural roads (1,300 km) as well as the building of several other rural infrastructure 

facilities leading to the revival of the rural sector that was completely moribund; (ii) new projects 

including the Youth Entrepreneurship in Agriculture and Agri-Business Project, targeting young 

graduates and the Agricultural Value Chain Project in six provinces, which focuses on the 

dissemination of agricultural technologies developed by TAAT programme compacts. Recurrent 

problems have been highlighted by lessons learned from previous projects and the portfolio 

performance, including: (a) difficulty in ensuring the timely fulfilment of conditions precedent to 

loan effectiveness and first disbursement, (b) delays in the procurement process, with a negative 

impact on overall disbursement, and (iii) weak empowerment of beneficiaries of rural 

development projects. 

2.7.2. These weaknesses are addressed in the revised Portfolio Improvement Plan (PAP) 

2018/2019. Hence, the project design takes these lessons into account through: (i) support for local 

participatory development in terms of building the capacity of local actors in project planning and 

management; and (ii) encouragement of sustainable partnerships between public and private actors 

and producers to improve access to agricultural and rural services. Furthermore, the Bank will 

strengthen its presence on the ground to facilitate the close monitoring process. In addition, the 

project will draw lessons from the report of the internal audit conducted by the Bank in 2017 on 

projects financed in Central Africa, especially as concerns delays in the submission of audit 

reports and the low level of implementation of the environmental and social management plans.    

2.7.3 The project has taken into consideration the lessons learned from IDEV's assessment of 

the Bank’s support for the development of agricultural value chains (AVC)5, which recommends 

the following basic principles, among others: (i) analyse the entire value chain; (ii) develop a 

strategy to ensure inclusion; (iii) maintain the ability to adapt to market developments; (iv) think 

in terms of profitability with value-added; and (v) establish plans for creating a sustainable impact. 

Accordingly, the project design capitalised on the guidelines of the sub-regional forum on the

revitalisation of the rural economy in Central Africa, jointly organised by the Bank and the 

International Labour Office (ILO) in February 2019 in Brazzaville. These are: (a) increase 

investment and attractiveness of rural areas, (b) promote an integrated training and skills 

development system to address the challenges of innovative agriculture, (c) diversify the rural 

economy through the development of rural occupations and opportunities in rural areas, and (d) 

develop skills and approaches that take into account the crisis and resilience context. 

2.8. Key Performance Indicators 

2.8.1. PROADER’s impact indicators are: (a) improvement of farm household income from less 

than USD 2,000/year in 2018 to USD 3,500/year in 2025; and (b) reduction of chronic 

malnutrition rate among children under 5 in rural areas from 43% in 2019 to 38% in 2025 The 
project is expected to produce the following outcomes: (i) increase of the percentage of the 

population in targeted basins with access to all-season roads from 25 to 60%; (ii) improvement of 

the rate of access to mechanisation from 0.8 to 10%; (iii) increase of the percentage of the budget 

allocated by ETDs for the maintenance of access roads to production basins from 0 to 10%; (iv) 

improvement of the rate of rural women’s access to technological innovations in agriculture from 

0 to 30%; (v) improvement of the productivity of the following main crops: maize - from 0.8 to 2 

t/ha ; cassava - from 8 to 20 t/ha; palm nuts - from 2.5 to 20 t/ha/year; (vi) 40% increase in 

additional marketed volume; (vii) reduction of post-harvest losses from 30% to 20% for cassava 

and from 25% to 10% for maize; (viii) improvement from 8.4% to 20% the percentage of children 

between 6 and 23 months with a minimum acceptable diet; (ix) improvement of the rural women 

empowerment index from 1 to 3 (scale of 1 = low and 5 = high). The project’s detailed baseline 

situation, including the environmental and social baseline situation, will also be prepared by 

capitalising on the results of the household surveys to be conducted at the completion of PADIR in 

collaboration with the National Institute of Statistics (INS). To assess the progress achieved, 

surveys will be carried out at mid-term and at project completion in the same areas (project and 

buffer areas where the baseline surveys were conducted). 

III –  PROJECT FEASIBILITY 

3.1. Economic and Financial Performance 

3.1.1. Financial performance was assessed for four (4) typical model farms and enterprises that 

produce cassava, maize and palm nuts, and carry out cassava processing operations, reflecting the 

range of activities that the project plans to support. Financial analysis shows that these 

investments will lead to a substantial increase in the net profits of farms and enterprises, which 

means that the PROADER-supported activities will be profitable. As indicated by Table 3.1 below, 

these results show that the project support will improve the financial performance of farms, 

cooperatives, micro, small- and medium-sized agricultural and rural enterprises (MPMEARs) 

engaged in the production, processing and marketing of these food products.   

3.1.2. Financial analysis: Based on the above assumptions, the financial analysis generated a 

net present value of USD 86.4 million and a financial internal return rate (FIRR) of 18%, meaning 

that the project is financially feasible.  

3.1.3.  Economic analysis: The economic analysis was carried out using the same approach as for 

the financial analysis, which consisted in analysing the benefits generated by the farms and 

enterprises concerned, based on the reference prices of the tradable goods and the total project 

cost. The results of the economic analysis show that the benefits of the project are positive.  The 

project's economic return rate (ERR) is 19% and the net present value (NPV) is estimated at USD 

95.5 million. However, these benefits should be higher if account is taken of the unquantifiable 

gains derived from nutritional and financial education, access to clean water, sanitation, women's 

economic empowerment and improved accessibility of production areas. Nutritional education and 



11 

access to clean water will help to improve the health condition of households, which would result 

in improved labour productivity of household assets and a reduction in household medical 

expenses, among other benefits. Access to road infrastructure will not only increase the volume of 

marketed production but would also facilitate access to health and education services for 

beneficiaries. The improvement in the curriculum of technical and vocational training centres will 

enable the latter to offer young people quality training tailored to the needs of the job market.  

Sensitivity analysis confirms the strength of the project’s positive economic effects and impacts.

ERR (baseline scenario): 19%; NPV: USD 95.5 million  

 

 

3.2.  Environmental and Social Impacts 

Environment 

3.2.1 The project is proposed for classification in Category 2 of the Bank's Integrated 

Safeguards System (ISS) and the Bank’s Climate Safeguard System, equivalent to Category B at 

the national level, although at this stage of preparation most of the sites and activities are yet to be 

determined. The activities under project component 2 are likely to have adverse impacts on the 

environment, namely: (i) the production of pollution and waste during infrastructure construction 

works; (ii) the production of pollution and waste during the processing of value chain products; 

(iii) the risks of land and water pollution by agrochemicals, endangering the health of users; (iv) 

the risk of plant and wildlife degradation during the operation of quarries and borrow pits for 

construction works; (v) the risk of accidents at construction sites and on the sites of processing 

units, and (vi) the risk of spread of communicable diseases on the sites.   

3.2.2 However, the expected negative impacts will be limited in scope and time. The "capacity 

building" component will contribute significantly to strengthen local governance and the ongoing 

decentralisation process, and to reduce conflicts over the use of natural resources (IWRM 

approach/support for the promotion of the green economy and the blue economy). The IWRM-

associated blue economy promotes the conservation of aquatic ecosystems, as well as the use and 

sustainable management of their resources. Given their nature, the planned activities are certainly 

not likely to generate any negative impacts or major risks, or lead to any significant asset losses or 

displacement. However, the building of certain production and processing support infrastructure 

facilities, depending on their size and the situation of the host environment, is likely to affect the 

environment, and possibly cause negative impacts on the biophysical and human ecosystems if 

preventive or mitigation measures are not considered at this project design stage and during 

implementation.   

3.2.3 Given that the siting and environmental and social characteristics of all investments are 

not known, an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) has been prepared in 

accordance with the requirements of the Bank's Integrated Safeguards System. The ESMF 

indicates the mitigation and management procedures and measures that will need to be 

implemented by the project once the sites and sub-projects are known. These measures are 

described in the Environmental and Social Management Framework Plan (ESMFP) and comprise, 

among others, sub-project analysis and screening procedures, consultation, communication and 

conflict management procedures; environmental and social management plans (ESMPs) and 

environmental and social clauses that should be included in competitive bidding documents and 

sub-project implementation contracts, forest and wetland management guidelines, and pesticide 

and pest management guidelines. The project activities will have many positive impacts on both 

the local communities and the environment. Thus, the participatory approach involving local 

communities in the rehabilitation of access facilitation infrastructure, the dissemination of more 



12 

sustainable and climate-smart agricultural practices, including community agroforestry, and the 

reduction of post-harvest losses, will enhance the resilience of the livelihoods of rural households, 

restore soil fertility and increase tree cover, thereby significantly reducing greenhouse gas 

emissions.   

3.2.4 Functions relating to environmental safeguard measures will include: (i) the screening of 

sub-projects and identification of their category based on the environmental and social selection 

sheets; (ii) the recruitment of firms/consultants for the ESMP preparation after validation of the 

process by the Directorate General of the Environment; (iii) the inclusion of environmental clauses 

in the process of recruiting works implementation contractors; (iv) monitoring and evaluation of 

the implementation of sub-projects; and (vi) audit coordination. The entire environmental and 

social function needs to be strengthened within the institutions involved in project 

implementation. Furthermore, measures should be adopted to support institutional and technical 

measures, training and awareness-raising in order to build the capacity of structures and human 

resources that will be set up. Such measures will aim to: (a) operationalise the PROADER Project 

environmental management strategy, (b) foster the emergence of local expertise and professionals 

in environmental and social management, (c) raise the level of professional consciousness and 

accountability among employees in production enterprises, and (d) protect the urban and rural 

environment and the health and safety of beneficiary communities. 

3.2.5. Consultations were held in the context of the ESMF at various phases of the project 

preparation and participants' observations were incorporated into the Environmental and Social 

Management Framework (ESMF). The ESMF was validated by the Bank's Safeguards Department 

and published on 2 October 20196.  

Climate Change  

3.2.6 The impacts of climate change can be seen in the DRC through the persistence of high 

temperatures, heavy rains, land degradation (particularly gully erosion), the prolonged dry season, 

increased sequences of dry spells during the rainy season, and floods, among others. Given that 

agriculture remains rain-fed, these phenomena exacerbate the vulnerability of the rural population. 

More frequent and longer seasonal droughts lead to disruptions in agricultural calendars. In terms 

of agricultural production, these climatic disturbances should have a direct impact on food 

security, which is already precarious for a large majority of the Congolese population. The project 

will contribute to the resilience of communities and ecosystems by improving the living 

conditions and food and nutrition security of rural communities. This is in line with the country's 

nationally determined contribution (NDC) in respect of climate change, which targets a 17% 

reduction in greenhouse gas emissions over the period 2021 to 2030. The project is classified 

under Category 2 of the Bank's Climate Safeguards System. Activities financed under PROADER 

will strengthen the resilience of ecosystems and communities to climate change by improving 

production systems, limiting the practice of extensive farming, restoring ecosystems through the 

application of good agricultural practices, institution building on climate change and green 

growth, and capacity building on climate change. The project plugs into the Bank's Climate 

Change Action Plan and contributes to domestic climate financing through the activities under 

Component 2. 

Gender 

3.2.7. The project is classified under Gender Category 27 of the Bank's Gender Marker System 

(GMS), since it will help to narrow the gender gap in terms of access to factors of production, 

                                                 
6  https://www.afdb.org/en/documents/rdc-projet-dappui-au-developpement-integre-de-leconomie-rurale-proader-resume-cges  

 
7  A project is classified in Gender Category 2, when gender equality (GE) and/or economic empowerment (EE) is one of the project outputs, but 

not the main one. PROADER is in this situation.

knowledge, innovation and income improvement. Women, who make up about 50% of Congo's 

population and 70% of the agricultural workforce, account for 80% of food crop production, 22% 

of commercial agriculture, and nearly 90% of agricultural processing, are more severely affected 

by poverty. Therefore, the project's targeting strategy takes this into account and will ensure that at 

least 50% of women benefit from project activities. The project will mobilise nearly USD 5 

million to finance (i) the construction and equipment of gender-specific multi-service platforms 

for rural women. These platforms will act as multipurpose incubators for technical and 

entrepreneurial capacity building, learning, advocacy and female leadership; (ii) the organisation 

of foras and exchange trips; and (iii) the promotion of essential activities in the areas of nutrition, 

hygiene and sanitation. Hence, the project will help to enhance the economic empowerment of 

women in the project area through a series of integrated actions, including building their capacity 

in that area of activity, establishing sustainable agricultural production systems, providing access 

to inputs in production basins and markets, easing their work and setting up a framework tailored 

to the conditions of women farmers. As much as possible monitoring indicators will be gender 

disaggregated to take gender aspects into account.   

3.2.8. In addition to the gender and age disaggregation of indicators, gender-specific indicators 

are included in the results-based logical framework for measuring women's empowerment index in 

agriculture. This index measures the increase in women's capacity to make strategic life choices in 

their households and communities, focusing on five areas of agricultural empowerment: (i) 

production (women's role in decision-making in the household context regarding agricultural 

production); (ii) resources (women's access to productive capital, access to and decision-making 

on credit); (iii) control over the use of income; (iv) leadership and individual influence of women 

in the community; and (v) time allocation for women. This index will be used as a diagnostic tool 

and as a monitoring indicator to measure the project’s impact on women's empowerment.   

Social 

3.2.9. The project will strengthen food and nutrition security, especially for children under five, 

and promote the creation of local employment opportunities. It will help to reduce poverty and the 

vulnerability of communities, while decreasing unemployment and the exodus of young people 

particularly through the development of 300 micro-, small- and medium-sized agricultural and 

rural enterprises in agricultural and rural occupations (product processing, manufacture of 

equipment and material, maintenance of agricultural equipment and machinery, supply of 

production factors, including inputs, etc.). PROADER will contribute to the enhancement of local 

governance through institution and capacity building for ETDs, as well as to the economic 

empowerment of women who, with their rising literacy rates, should be able to improve their 

participation in household decision-making concerning production, in addition to increasing their 

power over the distribution of household income. The project will improve access to socio-

economic services through the construction of about 100 social infrastructure facilities that will be 

identified in a participatory manner. As far as young people are concerned, they will be offered 
specific benefits through (i) the establishment and support of youth-oriented micro-, small- and 

medium-sized agricultural enterprises and the setting up of a competitive fund for innovation and 

promotion of youth entrepreneurship and agricultural start-ups; and (ii) the improvement of the 

skills and employability of young people.   

Forced Resettlement  

3.2.10. PROADER activities will not entail land acquisition or the forced resettlement of people 

and/or restriction of their access to resources or livelihoods. In terms of transformative 

infrastructure, the project will adopt an intervention approach that emphasises the participation 

and empowerment of sector and local community actors at all stages of implementation (from the 

planning of activities to the completion of works). Requests for support should come from ETDs 

or producer unions/cooperatives. The sites for infrastructure, such as markets and other buildings, 



14 

will be owned by ETDs or communes that will be responsible for their management and 

maintenance. The rehabilitation of agricultural feeder roads will be on an ad hoc basis and will 

focus on critical points (quagmires, low-lying areas, watercourse crossing points, steep-slope 

areas, etc.) with maximum reliance on local participation. The project will establish local and 

provincial complaint management committees that will also initiate and supervise the payment of 

any compensation that may be payable for the degradation of an asset or restricted access to a 

resource because of project activities. Financial allocation for these compensations will be 

provided for in the ESMP, particularly for infrastructure construction or rehabilitation sub-

projects.   

IV. IMPLEMENTATION 

4.1. Implementation Arrangements 

4.1.1 The project will be under the supervisory authority of the Ministry of Rural Development 

(MDR). PROADER will be managed by the existing Steering Committee (COPIL) responsible for 

agricultural and rural sector projects and programmes. COPIL will be expanded to include 

Secretaries-General of the Ministries in charge of Decentralisation, Planning and Land Affairs. 

COPIL shall meet at least twice a year and shall be mandated to: (i) review and approve the annual 

work plans and budgets (AWPBs) prepared by the project; (ii) review half-yearly, annual and mid-

term review and project completion reports; (iii) ensure that the activities of sector-based 

programmes/projects are in line with project objectives; (iv) review progress towards achieving 

project objectives; (v) facilitate the coordination of project activities carried out by the various 

entities involved in the implementation; and (vi) analyse the risks and obstacles related to the 

project implementation and formulate the necessary guidelines for achieving the expected 

outcomes.   

4.1.2 The Project Management Unit (PMU). On the operational front, PROADER will be 

anchored to the Directorate of Rural Economy, whose capacity will be strengthened by the project. 

This Directorate will be strengthened by the establishment of a Project Management Unit that will 

comprise a national coordination unit and three branches covering the three targeted economic 

hubs. To that effect, the Ministry of Rural Development will nominate the following staff: (i) 

Director of Rural Economic, Project Coordinator; (ii) Administrative and Financial Director 

(DAF) of the Ministry of Rural Development; (iii) Accountant; (iv) Monitoring and Evaluation 

Expert; (v) National Expert in Procurement; (vi) Administrative and Financial Assistant; (vii) 

Bookkeeper; and (viii) two drivers.  The qualifications and experience of the nominated staff 

should be prior acceptable by the Bank. The management tools (financial management software, 

database, etc.) that were developed in the context of the PADIR project and are already in use, as 

well as the monitoring and evaluation, financial management and accounting team will be 

capitalised on. The PMU will: (i) ensure inter-sector coordination; (ii) monitor the implementation 

of the recommendations of COPIL deliberations, the recommendations of audit, portfolio review 

and mid-term review reports; and (iii) oversee the fiduciary management of the project and 

undertake all other matters deemed of its competence.   

4.1.3 The PMU team will be strengthened by a project manager with sound knowledge of 

agricultural development and private sector issues, working under the authority of the Director of 

Rural Economy; an accountant and an assistant accountant working under the supervision of the 

Administrative and Financial Directorate (DAF) of the Ministry of Rural Development, a 

procurement expert who will be under the supervision of the Procurement Unit of the Ministry of 

Rural Development, a monitoring and evaluation expert (RPSE) and an IT specialist/database 

manager, a communication expert (RCOM), a skills development and entrepreneurship expert, 

who will also cover the woman’s empowerment component, a rural engineer, an environmental 

and climate change expert, and the necessary support staff (cashier, secretary, drivers, guards, 

etc.). The PMU will work directly with the Technical Directorates of the Ministries involved in 



15 

the project implementation. Each technical directorate will designate a focal point for the 

operational monitoring of the technical implementation of the component falling within its 

jurisdiction.   

4.1.4 Departmental branch offices. Three project branch offices will be established to cover 

the targeted provinces. They will be located in Matadi, Kikwit and Mbuji Mayi. Provincial Rural 

Development Inspectors will be the project focal points in each province. The provincial branches 

will be responsible for: (i) coordinating the project at the provincial level and establishing links 

with local authorities; (ii) developing the annual work plan and budget (AWPB), ensuring the 

monitoring and evaluation of AWPB-related activities at the provincial level and drafting progress 

reports; (iii) providing technical support for the implementation of the project’s technical 

components; (iv) monitoring and ensuring close supervision of the implementation of project 

activities and service providers; (v) participating in the tripartite (Government/private 

sector/producers) evaluation of agreements and service providers’ performance contracts; (vi) 

mobilising actors involved in the implementation of operations; and (vii) developing synergies and 

partnerships across their area of intervention. Each branch office will be headed by a Branch 

Manager and will comprise an expert specialised in one of the three sectors (animal, plant and 

fisheries), a capacity strengthening and gender expert, a decentralisation and local governance 

expert, an accounting assistant, a monitoring officer, a procurement assistant with expertise in 

civil or rural engineering, and support staff.   

 

4.1.5 The Project Manager and technical staff will be recruited based on an open invitation to 

bid, and following the Bank’s opinion concerning the recruitment report. The Secretary-General 

for Rural Development will set up an inter-ministerial recruitment commission for the assessment 

of applications. PMU staff will sign annual contracts, renewable if their performance is deemed 

satisfactory, following the annual evaluation. The evaluation of staff performance will be based on 

the following criteria: (i) disbursement rate; (ii) quality of the implementation of the components; 

(iii) compliance with good governance and transparency requirements; and (iv) the AWPB 

implementation rate. The Project Manager will be evaluated by the Director of Rural Economy, 

while the rest of the staff will be evaluated by the Project Manager.   

4.1.6 Technical assistance and start-up support: The experience and lessons learned from 

project implementation in the DRC highlight three major constraints: (i) delays in project start-up; 

(ii) weakness of implementation teams and operators; and (iii) bureaucracy surrounding the 

procurement process. To accelerate the implementation of PROADER, technical assistance from 

the Department of Rural Economy of the International Labour Office (ILO) in Turin will be 

mobilised. The ILO's technical assistance will focus on the preparation of planning and 

management tools for the rural economy of EDTs targeted in the context of DRC’s 

decentralisation. Therefore, pre-start-up activities should now be initiated. These activities 

include: (i) launching the technical staff recruitment competitive process; (ii) updating the 

administrative, financial and accounting procedures manual and the project implementation, 

monitoring and evaluation manual; (iii) preparing competitive bidding documents for the 

procurement of equipment and materials; (iv) raising awareness among stakeholders and preparing 

the AWPB and the Procurement Plan for the first 18 months of project implementation; (v) 

preparing partnership contracts with private specialised agricultural enterprises and agreements 

with various technical departments and services involved. The implementation of these activities 

can be supported by technical assistance. Expenditures relating to these activities will be 

coordinated by the Secretary-General for Rural Development and covered by PADIR resources. 

Moreover, the Bank, acting through the PADIR and PRISE projects, had recruited technical 

assistance services for procurement and financial management, one of whose missions was to 

build the capacity of national counterparts. Hence, the MDR has competent services and qualified 

financial management and procurement officers. In accordance with the Paris Declaration, these 



16 

structures will support the project in their areas of expertise, to ensure ownership of the project by 

these public entities.    

Arrangements for the Procurement of Goods, Works and Services  

4.1.7 Procurement of all goods and services through international bid invitations, as well as the 

use of consultants financed from Bank resources will be conducted in accordance with the Bank's 

Procurement Policy for Bank Group-Funded Operations, dated October 2015, using appropriate 

standard Bank bidding documents and in accordance with the project financing agreement clauses. 

In accordance with the Bank policy and in the light of several evaluations conducted, it was 

convened that: (a) works for agriculture, rural, social infrastructure and for the rehabilitation of 

administrative building as well as diverse goods, vehicles, and material for project management 

unit, provincial offices and local government offices, will be procured using national procurement 

system as stipulated in law 10/010 of April 2010 for public procurement; (b) all other works and 

goods different from the above will be procured in accordance with Bank’s procurement policy. 

Procurement of goods and works through national bid invitations will be carried out in accordance 

with national procurement legislation, using the country's standard bidding documents and the 

provisions set out in the financing agreement. A procurement plan for the first 18 months was 

prepared by the Government during the appraisal mission and will be regularly updated 

throughout the project implementation period. The procurement arrangements are detailed in the 

technical annex. 

4.1.8 Evaluation of Risks and Capacities in Procurement (ERCA).  In order to take into 

account project specificities, the bank evaluated: (i) the risks at national, sectoral and project 

levels; and (ii) the capacity of the implementing entity.  The results of these evaluations concluded 

that the risk level is substantial for the procurement under the project. Nevertheless, appropriate 

risks mitigation measures have been proposed in the technical appendix to ensure a satisfactory 

project execution.    

4.1.9.   Particular Modalities related to the Utilisation of National System. The use of national 

procurement system requires the setup of particular measures to allow the bank to continue 

ensuring its fiduciary responsibility even in this case.  These measures are described in paragraphs 

B.5.7 of technical appendix B5 and consist of the following aspects: (i) eligibility; (ii) audit of 

public procurement; (iii) complains management; (iv) publication of bid results; (v) control of 

reasonable price; and (vi) reports.    

Financial Management and Disbursement Arrangements  

4.1.10 The Bank's decision on whether to use the national public finance management (PFM) 

system or otherwise was reviewed based on: (i) the assessment of the country's PFM performance; 

(ii) the Bank’s guidelines, practices and risk tolerance; and (iii) other factors such as perception of 

the governance and corruption levels. This review indicates that the level of risk, as assessed under 

CSP 2013-2020, does not allow the Bank to adopt an approach based exclusively on national 

public financial management procedures and systems. However, the reforms initiated by the 

Government have provided the Secretariat General for Rural Development (SGDR) with an 

operational administrative and financial directorate, as per Decree No. 15/043, which 

decentralised public expenditure authorisation centres through the establishment of the 

Administrative and Financial Directorate (DAF). The assessment of the capacity of the Ministry of 

Rural Development was carried out in accordance with the Bank's policy, based on lessons from 

implementing the PADIR and PRISE projects. The fiduciary risk of PROADER’s financial 

management is deemed substantial. The financial management arrangements proposed to support 

the Project Management Unit (PMU) meet the Bank's minimum requirements, as defined by the 

policy on “financial management of projects financed by the African Development Bank”, issued 

in February 2014. The arrangements will help to improve the financial management of the project 



17 

through the risk mitigation measures agreed in the financial management action plan detailed in 

annex. These measures will maintain the fiduciary risk at a moderate level and provide, with 

reasonable assurance, reliable financial information consistent with the Bank's minimum 

requirements. 

4.1.11 The financial management system will rely on the DAF, which will be strengthened with 

the management tools acquired from previous projects, especially from the PADIR project 

currently drawing to a close. At the time of the mission, only the PRISE project regularly 

submitted audit reports deemed acceptable by the Bank. The DAF will be strengthened by 

bringing on board financial staff (accountant, assistant accountant, treasurer) dedicated entirely to 

PROADER. This directorate will oversee financial and accounting operations related to the 

financial and accounting management of the project and will co-sign payment requests and 

documents. This approach allows the Ministry of Rural Development, through the conduct of 

PROADER activities, to mobilise the counterpart resources to be used for local economic 

development, as well as ensure the effective management of external resources. The project will 

contribute to the training of DAF executives in the area of planning/programming and budgeting, 

financial management of development operations, monitoring of audits and financial supervision.   

4.1.12 Annual audits of project loan resources will be performed by the Court of Auditors, 

which will include PROADER's audit missions in its annual work programme. The Court of 

Auditors may be assisted by an external auditor whose recruitment will devolve on the PMU, in 

accordance with the terms of reference in force at the Bank. Audited financial statements will be 

forwarded (see table for frequency) to the Bank latest six months after the close of the fiscal year 

concerned. The capacity of the Court of Auditors will be strengthened to enable it to include audit 

missions of Bank-funded projects in its annual programmes while undertaking to forward reports 

of financial years to the Bank on schedule. A portion of the loan resources will be allocated to 

expenses related to missions that would be carried out for PROADER and other Bank-financed 

projects. The terms of reference of audit missions should be those in force at the Bank, which may 

be used subject to obtaining the Bank’s prior opinion.   

4.1.13 The planned disbursements from the loan resources will be made in accordance with the 

Bank's Disbursement Handbook upon effectiveness of the Loan Agreement and fulfilment of 

conditions precedent to first disbursement. Generally, three methods are used for the disbursement 

of funds at the Bank: (i) the direct payment method; (ii) the working capital or special account 

method; and (iii) the reimbursement method. A disbursement letter specifying project-specific 

disbursement arrangements will be negotiated between the Bank and the Borrower. Two special 

accounts will be opened in Kinshasa, of which one is to receive the loan resources intended for the 

financing of working capital needs and a second one to receive the loan resources intended for the 

financing of community activities. In addition, the Ministry of Finance will authorize the project 

to open sub-account for each PROADER provincial branch.    

4.2.  Monitoring  

4.2.1. The PMU will assume primary responsibility for the internal monitoring of activity 

implementation and the ensuing impacts. It will prepare quarterly and annual progress reports 

focused on the analysis of the technical (outputs, outcomes and impact) and financial outcomes 

relative to the AWPB forecasts and the progress towards achieving the final result. Information 

will be tapped from monitoring and evaluation tools (manual, database of household surveys 

conducted in the context of PADIR with the support of the National Institute of Statistics). 

Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) will include internal monitoring (implementation monitoring), 

external monitoring (outcomes and impact monitoring, and participatory evaluation and planning) 

and should enable the identification of problems, risks and measures taken to mitigate them, and 

the evaluation of the performance of project actors. The implementation manuals and the PADIR 

monitoring and evaluation system (including the manual, the database and the geographic 



18 

information system) will be updated and/or developed to take the specific features of PROADER 

into account.   

4.2.2. Half-yearly external monitoring missions under the leadership of the MDR Secretariat 

General, comprising three to four COPIL members and to whom may be added other experts as 

necessary, will be fielded prior to the holding of COPIL meetings. At the provincial level, under 

the coordination of Provincial Rural Development Inspectorates, quarterly monitoring missions 

will be carried out with the participation of other relevant provincial technical services. These 

missions are intended to review the progress of the project, evaluate its performance and the 

quality of its management and achievements and, if necessary, propose adjustments in 

consultation with the Bank.  All monitoring mission reports should be attached to the project 

progress report. A focal point of the Ministry of Environment in Kinshasa will be involved in the 

coordination of environmental and social safeguard activities. In addition to the close monitoring 

that will be carried out by the Bank's Country Office in the DRC (COCD), the Bank will also keep 

an eye on the project through half-yearly supervision missions leading to the preparation of aide-

memoires, reports on implementation progress and results (IPR), using the Bank’s template. These 

aide-memoires and IPR reports will be used to rate the overall project performance and conduct 

the project’s annual external technical and financial audits. 

4.3. Governance  

4.3.1. According to the 2017 Mo Ibrahim Index of African Governance (IIAG), the DRC 

ranked 47th out of 54 countries, with a score of 32.1 out of 100. Scoring 20 on a scale ranging 

from 0 (very corrupt) to 100 (very clean), the DRC ranked 161st out of 180 countries in 

Transparency International’s 2018 global Corruption Perception Index, representing a loss of 2 

spots compared with the 2015 raking. In addition, according to the Bank's Country Policy and 

Institutional Assessment (CPIA), the country's overall governance rating stagnated at 3.2 between 

2013 and 2015, before declining to 3.1 in 2016 and 3.07 in 2018. The public finance management 

reform process initiated since 2008 has led to: (i) the adoption of a Public Finance Reform 

Strategic Plan and a Public Finance Organic Law (LOFIP) introducing the results-based budget 

system; and (ii) the setting up of a Steering Committee for Public Finance Reform (COREF).   

4.3.2. The risks of poor governance related to this project mainly concern the procurement and 

implementation process. This risk will be mitigated by: (i) the presence of a senior procurement 

expert in the Project Management Unit (PMU) and three procurement assistants at the provincial 

branch offices; (ii) the holding of information, training and technical assistance sessions with the 

PMU, decentralised territorial entities and procurement committees, to allow better ownership of 

the Bank's procurement procedures; (iii) the existence of an administrative, financial and 

accounting procedures manual and a community procurement manual; (iv) ex-ante or ex-post 

control of the different stages of the procurement process; and (v) supervision and financial audits 

of the project. Furthermore, the DRC Country Office (COCD) will provide continuous support in 

procurement, contract and financial management. In addition, the participatory approach to local 

development with the involvement of ETDs, the private sector, non-governmental organisations 

and beneficiaries in the steering and implementation of activities will promote citizen control, 

thereby guaranteeing good governance.   

4.4. Sustainability  

4.4.1. The probability of sustaining and even scaling up the project’s gains in the long term is 

high. The sensitivity tests of the economic and financial analysis show that the project remains 

profitable despite the fall in profits, the escalation of input prices and the drop in commodity 

prices. The sustainability of investments and expected benefits is based on the existence of an 

institutional framework for rural infrastructure piloting and management, as well as participatory 

and entrepreneurial capacity-building approaches. Regarding rural infrastructure, especially rural 



19 

roads, there is a maintenance mechanism that depends on financing from the road maintenance 

fund and on local road maintenance committees (CLERs) for manual repair works, while 

monitoring is ensured by the Directorate of Agricultural Road Roads and the empowerment of 

decentralised territorial entities. Thus, PROADER will support this institutional arrangement by 

providing CLERs with road maintenance equipment and by assisting them in establishing small- 

and medium-sized labour-intensive enterprises. These road maintenance arrangements remain 

valid for all infrastructure built under this project. In collaboration with the ETDs, the project will 

support the establishment of a sustainable management and maintenance mechanism for each 

infrastructure provided, based on the promotion of micro-, small- and medium-sized maintenance 

enterprises. This principle will strengthen local governance and the sustainability of project 

achievements, thus enabling ETDs to play their roles in land-use planning and the inclusive 

management of the structures. ETDs will be strengthened to improve resource mobilisation. In this 

regard, all sub-projects carried out under the project will be selected through a participatory 

process, involving ETDs, economic actors and producer organisations of the relevant production 

basins at the local level. In addition, the development of public-private-producer partnerships with 

the participation of specialised private agricultural enterprises located and operating in the targeted 

production basins, the structuring and professionalisation of organisations and players in value 

chains based on an expressed request will help ensure the ownership and use of the infrastructure.   

4.5. Risk Management  

4.5.1. The main risks that the project could face are: (i) vulnerability to climate change; (ii) low 

sustainability of the infrastructure set up; (iii) reluctance on the part of public entities regarding the 

empowerment of ETDs; (iv) bad governance; and (v) poor knowledge of gender issues by actors 

and their impact on the performance of household activities. To mitigate these risks, the following 

measures will be taken: (a) dissemination of smart farming technologies (community agroforestry, 

short-cycle and attack-resistant seeds, etc.); (b) establishment of a local infrastructure maintenance 

mechanism with the empowerment of ETDs, private agricultural enterprises, small- and medium-

sized enterprises, cooperatives and producer associations; (c) dissemination of legislation on 

decentralisation and capacity building for public entities; (d) strengthening of citizen control with 

the empowerment of beneficiaries and economic actors in the planning, implementation and 

project output management process, and raising of stakeholder awareness of the available 

remedies; and (e) gender mainstreaming in local planning strategies and raising of household 

awareness on the benefits of gender mainstreaming. Residual management risks will be minimised 

through competitive recruitment of staff and partners and preparation of annual performance 

contracts, renewable based on good performance, as well as capacity building of project 

management teams at the different levels.  

4.6. Knowledge Building 

4.6.1. As part of knowledge management effort, an electronic library will be set up for the 

storage of all relevant documents on the agricultural sector, best practices, local knowledge and 

innovations. The library will be accessible to stakeholders and the public. This activity will be 

developed as part of the institutional support for the Studies and Planning Directorate (DEP) of the 

Ministry of Agriculture. The communication tools and resources will be shared with other projects

Appendix IV- Key Drivers of Fragility and Sources of Resilience of the DRC  

The corridor targeted by PROADIER, including the central region, is one of the areas most 

severely affected by the humanitarian crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo. In April 2017, 

five provinces in this central region were deeply affected by the high levels of insecurity, 

stemming from interethnic tensions and clashes between armed groups. In 2017, the humanitarian 

crisis in the DRC worsened and spread, affecting people in this area previously considered stable, 

and undermining the resilience of people who were victimised by the previous crisis. The DRC 

recently became the African country most severely affected by population movements, with 1.7 

million new IDPs in 2017, bringing the total number of IDPs to 4.3 million, 52% of them women 

(as of 30 November 2018).   

In the Kassaï Provinces, there are areas, albeit isolated, where the risks of resurgence of inter-

community tensions are still present. More than 102,000 conflict-affected persons are in need of 

non-food items, shelter and tools, and 400,000 children are at risk of dying from severe acute 

malnutrition. According to official sources, between 1 October 2018 and 31 January 2019, 

402,300 Congolese nationals returned from Angola. National data validated by the Directorate 

General of Migration (DGM) show that 300,365 voluntary returnees and 101,935 deportees were 

received in five provinces of the DRC: Kasaï, Kasaï Central, Kwango, Kongo Central and 

Lualaba. During this period, 28,563 people crossed the border at a rate averaging about 635 per 

day. In addition, deportees account for 84% of returnees, with 50% of them transiting through 

Kwango Province. Given the sensitivity of the context, there is a need to carry out community 

activities in order to promote social cohesion through: (i) the active and participatory 

involvement of local communities in implementation activities; (ii) harmonisation of intervention 

procedures and targeting criteria; (iii) front-end analysis of the risks and issues related to the “do 

no harm” principle.    

 
Key Drivers of Fragility Main Sources Resilience 

Political, Institutional and Security Factors 

 

*Pockets of insecurity in the eastern and central parts of 

the country with the proliferation of armed groups; 

*Relative political stability that may be undermined 

despite the holding of the elections;  

*Various dysfunctionalities characterised by: (i) weak 

capacity; (ii) public services run by staff that are ageing 

but not replaced; (iii) incomplete decentralisation; and 

(iv) lack of independence of the judiciary and high 

levels of corruption; (v) high levels of human rights 

violations.   

Huge potential for renewable natural resources, especially 

forest and water resources 

 

 

The country abounds in rich and varied natural resources 

whose rational exploitation offers a real opportunity for 

sustainable development and green growth promotion. It 

has a forest cover of about 1.5 million km², water resources 

of 19,967/m3/year/inhabitant, an estimated hydropower 

potential of 100,000 MGW and a wide range of mineral 

resources (over 1,100 minerals and precious metals listed).   

 

Economic Factors 

 

* Undiversified economy, exposed to external shocks; 

* Unattractive business environment and undeveloped 

financial system; 

* Low tax revenue mobilisation capacity;  

*Lack of economic infrastructure (energy, transport, 

agriculture, ICT). 

 

Vast industrialisation potential of the agricultural and 

energy sector  

 

 

The development of the country's agricultural potential 

could accelerate the transformation of agriculture. 

Agricultural land is estimated at about 80 million hectares, 

of which barely 10% is farmed annually. The climatic and 

ecological conditions are very conducive to the farming of 

various crops, including export crops. 



VI 

 

Social Factors 
* Low human development levels, high poverty, 

inequality and unemployment levels, especially among 

young people and women; 

*Lack of social infrastructure (health, education, water); 

*Persistence of gender inequalities and gender-based 

violence; 

*Large population displacements as a result of the armed 

conflict and possible instigation of ethnic and 

community tensions. 

Privileged Geographical Position  

 

The DRC has 9 neighbouring countries and is at the meeting 

point of five regional economic communities. This position 

is a major asset for the country’s development and offers it 

enormous potential for trade with several countries if 

multisector interconnections are organised. 

Environmental Factors (Climate Change and Related 

Risks) 

 

*High deforestation levels in the Congo Basin, frequent 

floods and low resilience of communities to climate 

change; 

*Significant mercury emissions from artisanal mining 

activities, representing a major risk to human health. 

Environmental Factors  

 

Given that the project area is part of the Congo Basin, it can 

contribute to climate change mitigation through the 

restoration of forest landscapes, reduction of emissions from 

deforestation and forest degradation, and climate finance. It 

can also create opportunities for green growth through 

sustainable development of targeted sectors (energy, 

agriculture, etc.).

PROJECT SUMMARY 

1. Project Overview: 
 

1.1 The Sierra Leone Agribusiness and Rice Value Chain Support Project (SLARiS) aims 

to stimulate a viable upstream agribusiness sector in Sierra Leone in order to promote economic 

diversification, food security, sustainable employment opportunities and improved livelihoods. 

These are all key identified priorities of the New Direction Agenda and the Medium Term 

National Development Plan of the Government of Sierra Leone. The development goal of the 

project is to promote domestic agribusiness focusing on priority agricultural value chains which 

will serve as sustainable and inclusive business opportunities targeted at enhancing production 

and productivity to improve the livelihoods of men and women beneficiaries. The project will 

primarily focus on the rice value chain which is the staple food in Sierra Leone. It will also 

support the emergence of maize and livestock as secondary value chains which have the strong 

potential of meeting domestic food demands, import substitution, improving nutrition and 

farmers’ income. The SLARiS project which will be executed in the identified high potential 

agro-ecological zones in the country (specifically Kambia, Kenema and Moyamba) will be 

implemented over a period of five (5) years (2019 – 2024). The project comprises three (3) 

components namely: a) Support to Enhancement of Agricultural Input Production & 

Distribution Systems; b) Support to Agribusiness Development; and c) Institutional capacity 

development and Project Management. The total project cost is UA 8.52 million with an ADF 

Grant of UA 7.99 million (93.8%) and Government of Sierra Leone (GoSL) contribution of 

UA 0.53 million (6.2%). The project benefits from parallel co-financing from the Islamic 

Development Bank (USD 34.12 million) and the International Fund for Agricultural 

Development (USD 11.2 million) 

  

2. Needs Assessment:  
 

2.1. Sierra Leone is food insecure, with over half the population (i.e. more than 3.5 million 
people) lacking access to sufficient amounts of safe and nutritious food. The Global Hunger 

Index 2018 ranked Sierra Leone as the sixth hungriest country in the world, with an estimated 

35.7% of the population undernourished. These households are exposed to acute fragility and 

unable to cope with socio-economic and environmental shocks such as drought, floods and 

fluctuating food prices. Importation of staple foods such as rice and maize are high due to the 

inability to meet market demand through domestic production. According to the Ministry of 

Agriculture and Forestry, the total rice demand was 1,600,000 metric tons in 2018. In contrast, 

local production was only 700,000 metric tons, with the balance imported from international 

markets. The annual cost of rice imports (including seeds and grains) alone stands at about 

USD 250 million. Similarly about 20,000 metric tons (40 % of total demand) of maize is 

imported into Sierra Leone annually, which is closely associated with equally high importation 

of poultry products as the main ingredient in animal feed is maize.  

 

2.2 Despite the huge potentials of the country’s agriculture, the sector has not been able to 

attain national food and nutritional security, and generate of decent employment opportunities 

for the country’s bulging youth population. The seemingly lacklustre performance of the 

agricultural sector in Sierra Leone is the result of a combination of weak public policy and 

institutions, limited infrastructure, and failures in both the input and output markets. These 

greatly impede the sector’s productivity growth, and its capacity to support the country’s 

poverty reduction and youth employment generation efforts. Specifically production and 

productivity are constrained by low use of improved technologies particularly agricultural 

inputs (e.g. improved seed varieties, fertilizers and pesticides), low levels of value chain 

integration mainly due to inefficient systems that undercut competitiveness, limited access to 



 

v 

 

agricultural finance and a weak enabling environment. Sierra Leone’s dependency on food 

imports and food aid exacts dire socio-economic consequences on the economy and is 

unsustainable. Economic diversification to promote domestic agricultural production and 

productivity is therefore imperative. This is critical to ending hunger and enhancing food 

security as per the Sustainable Development Goals, improving economic growth, social 

welfare, livelihoods and job creation as well as building resilience to shocks.  

 

2.3 The rationale for this project is premised on the fact that Sierra Leone is endowed with 
agro-ecological conditions and water resources to support a vibrant agricultural sector. There 

is significant opportunity for growth in the agribusiness sector across the value chain. 

Furthermore, Sierra Leone’s Medium Term National Development Plan (2019-2023), the 

National Strategic Agriculture Development Plan (NSADP) (2010-2030) which is Sierra 

Leone’s in-country version of the Comprehensive African Agriculture Development 

Programme (CAADP) and the recently launched National Agriculture Transformation Strategy 

(NATS) (2019-2023) evidence clear commitment by the Government of Sierra Leone to 

diversify its economy from its dependence on mining through promoting investments to 

strengthen the agriculture sector and thereby increase its contribution to the national economy. 

Expanding the agribusiness sector will also assist the Government of Sierra Leone to tackle the 

major challenge of youth unemployment in the country (estimated at 60%) which remains an 

important source of fragility. The project will seek to create new jobs to ensure socio-economic 

empowerment, particularly amongst the youth and women by supporting them along the value 

chain. 

 

3. Bank’s Value Added: 
 

3.1 The Bank’s comparative advantage and added value in the project are derived from its 

accumulated expertise and experience in funding agriculture and agribusiness projects in 

various Regional Member Countries (RMCs). The SLARiS project will provide opportunities 

to capitalize on the Bank’s experience in supporting public sector enabled and private sector 

led growth of agricultural value chains and on the gains of past projects in the Mano-River 

Union region, other ECOWAS countries and across the continent. Lessons were drawn from 

extensive continent-wide analysis carried out under the Technologies for African Agricultural 

Transformation (TAAT) and its associated TAAT-Savanah, the Continental Investment 

Program on Rice Self Sufficiency in Africa (CiPRISSA) and the African Agricultural Seed 

Index (TASAI) program as well as various investment operations in Gambia, Ghana, Guinea-

Bissau, Senegal and Zambia. 

 

4. Knowledge Management:  
 

4.1 The project will support research and knowledge development in collaboration with the 
Sierra Leone Agricultural Research Institute (SLARI), AfricaRice and Njala University to 

develop: i) an effective agricultural input system; (ii) innovative crop production techniques 

for rice and maize in the presence of soil challenges; (iii) the emergence of a robust maize value 

chain with strong linkages to the livestock industry; and (iv) support the growth of horticulture. 

The knowledge generated from the research will be disseminated amongst farmers for better 

productivity at the farm level, agro-dealers and agribusiness actors. Additionally, this project 

will implement the ENABLE-Njala Youth Empowerment Model which is an innovative 

initiative combining research, integrated farming systems with business incubator and 

accelerator systems. These experiences will be documented and could be useful in the design 

of other youth in agribusiness development projects. Finally, collaborative knowledge 

development will enhance the systemic development of capacity in agriculture university 

faculties in Sierra Leone.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF MANAGEMENT TO THE BOARD OF 

DIRECTORS ON THE PROPOSED ADF GRANT TO THE REPUBLIC OF SIERRA 

LEONE FOR THE SIERRA LEONE AGRIBUSINESS AND RICE VALUE CHAIN 

SUPPORT PROJECT (SLARIS) 

 

Management hereby submits this Report and Recommendation for an ADF grant of UA7.99 million 

from the African Development Fund to the Government of Sierra Leone to finance the Sierra Leone 

Agribusiness and Rice Value Chain Support Project. 

I. STRATEGIC THRUST & RATIONALE 

1.1 Project linkages with Country Strategy and Objectives 

1.1.1 Rice is by far the most important crop in the food economy of Sierra Leone. With an average 
annual per capita consumption of about 131 kg which is one of the highest in the world, rice is 

synonymous with food and constitutes a larger portion of total food intake than any other cereal. In 

fact, in rural areas of Sierra Leone, rice provides up to 75% of total calorie intake. Sierra Leone was 

a net rice exporter in the 1970s and the country still retains its agro-ecological competitive advantage 

to satisfy domestic requirements for food and to increase incomes for smallholders. However, 

limitation to domestic production continue to exist principally as a result of unfavourable policies 

and insufficient access to (i) quality agricultural inputs (seed, fertilizer and pesticides) (ii) improved 

production technology and capabilities and (iii) affordable finance. The total area under rice 

cultivated in Sierra Leone is about 530,000 hectares produces an average of 700,000 metric tons/year 

(compared to an estimated annual milled-rice requirement of 1,600,000 metric tons), which 

corresponds to a very low yield of 1.3 tons/ha. Presently, there is a sharp decline in the incomes of 

farmers due to importation of rice which puts heavy stress on the country’s foreign exchanges (annual 

rice import bill averages about USD 250 million). Rapid population growth, coupled with the 

escalating rural-urban migration, and environmental degradation pose serious threats to food security 

in the country.  

 

1.1.2 The proposed project is well aligned with Sierra Leone’s Medium Term National 
Development Plan (MTNDP) (2019 – 2023). The MTNDP articulates agriculture as one of the 

primary drivers of economic diversification and inclusive economic development. At the sector level, 

the project is in accordance the National Strategic Agriculture Development Plan (NSADP) (2010-

2030) which is Sierra Leone’s in-country version of the Comprehensive African Agriculture 

Development Programme (CAADP). It is also consistent with the recently launched National 

Agricultural Transformation Strategy NATS (2018- 2023) which focuses on developing agricultural 

value chains, making available improved inputs (seeds, fertilizers, pesticides and machinery), 

increasing productivity and production, and establishing crops and livestock processing zones across 

the country. The Strategy prioritises four components, namely: rice self-sufficiency, livestock 

development, crop diversification and bio-diversity management. It strengthens three enablers that 

include: improvement of the policy environment, promoting women and youth in agriculture, and 

setting up of private-sector-led mechanisation. Implementation of the NATS is expected to address 

low productivity, improve linkages with industry and access to financial services and markets. The 

approach also targets urban, peri-urban and rural communities particularly women and the youth as 

well as improved institutions and infrastructure aimed at revitalising rural communities.  

 

 

1.1.3 The project is consistent with the Bank’s Country Strategy Paper (CSP) for Sierra Leone 
(2013 – 2017, extended to 2019) through its Pillar 1: Enhancing Economic Governance and 

Transparent Management of Natural Resources Revenue. During the CSP Mid-Term Review in July 

2016 it was decided to place more emphasis on sub-pillar 3 of Pillar 1 which deals with enabling 

business environment and private sector development, in order to enhance pay-off in deepening the 



 

2 

 

inclusive growth agenda of the strategy. Pillar 1 was specifically re-focused to emphasize private 

sector development, agribusiness and agro-processing.  The project is well aligned to sub-pillar 3 of 

pillar I of the strategy. 

1.2 Rationale for Fund’s involvement 

1.2.1 The agriculture sector in Sierra Leone is important for employment (70% of the national 

labour force), income (more than 40% of GDP) and as a source of food and nutrition. The climate 

and ecological conditions are highly favourable for agriculture. Rice is the single most important 

commodity in Sierra Leonean agriculture mainly because it is the staple food of the local diet. Nearly 

85% of Sierra Leonean farmers grow rice and it is also dominant in terms of cultivated area, volume 

produced and contribution to farm income. More than 5.4 million hectares of arable bolilands, 

mangroves, inland valley swamps, and riverine grasslands are suitable for growing rice and other 

crops. Yet only 10% of these fertile, diverse lowlands are under cultivation. Rice farming is 

dominated by smallholder farmers with average land holdings of 0.5-2.0 hectares and a few medium 

to large scale producers. 

1.2.2 Sierra Leone was self-sufficient in rice production in the 1950s and even exported rice within 

the Mano River Union region in the 1970s. However the onset of the civil war in the 1980s dealt a 

heavy blow to all sectors of the economy. In the case of agriculture, production was seriously 

undermined, agricultural extension services were handicapped and distribution of food disrupted by 

insecurity and lack of mobility resulting in severe food shortages. With the exception of the decline 

caused by the outbreak of the Ebola Virus Epidemic in 2014/2015, the Sierra Leonean economy has 

exhibited strong post-civil war recovery. Yet despite these gains in the agriculture sector continue to 

lag in performance. Over the years Sierra Leone unable to meet local demand through domestic 

production has become a net importer of food and major importer of rice, wheat flour, sugar and 

poultry. Importation of these four commodities consumes an average of $ 700 million of the country’s 

foreign exchange annually. Rice imports alone account for 14.3% and has been on the increase over 

the past decade. Current domestic rice output is 700,000 metric tons compared to total domestic 

demand of 1,600,000 metric tons (approximately 42.9% rice self-sufficiency). The national demand 

for rice is expected to increase to an estimated 2,130,000 metric tons by 2025. Locally produced rice 

is not only more nutritious but also attracts a 15% to 20% premium over comparable grades of 

imported rice. Rising population and domestic demand for local rice presents a viable opportunity 

for investment in domestic rice production. 

1.2.3 Three critical constraints to on-farm productivity in Sierra Leone were identified as access to 

inputs including finance, improved technologies and access to markets. The supply of improved seeds 

fertilizer, agrochemicals and animal feeds is below current demand and far below potential demand. 

According to data collected in the 2015 Comprehensive Food Security and Vulnerability Assessment, 

the most commonly constraint cited by farmers to increasing agricultural production was the 

unavailability of improved seeds. The continuous involvement of Government in the production, 

procurement and distribution of seeds, fertilizers and other agro-inputs to the farmers at non-

competitive market prices is a major disincentive to private sector involvement in agricultural 

transformation that ought to be government-enabled and private sector-led. It is estimated that only 

5% of farmers in Sierra Leone have access to improved seeds varieties. Furthermore, agricultural 

input distribution systems are weak with a ratio of 1 agro-dealer for every 17,033 agricultural 

households in Sierra Leone. Addressing these constraints will improve production and productivity, 

and the latter will lead to better incentives for producing improved food availability, employment 

(particularly for the youth and women) and higher household incomes. 

1.2.4 With the recent volatility in iron prices, the need to diversify the economic base of Sierra 

Leone becomes ever more compelling. Sustainable reductions in poverty will depend on key sectors, 

particularly agriculture, which employs the majority of the population, especially in rural areas. The 



 

3 

 

renewed focus will be to transform the largely subsistence low-input, low-output agriculture into a 

more productive and commercialized system capable of creating gainful employment as a basis for 

broad-based poverty reduction. The project will promote agricultural transformation by supporting 

the emergence of competitive agribusinesses in the agricultural input supply sector.  It will incite the 

development of a private sector driven agricultural input (seeds, fertilizer and pesticides) production 

and distribution which is key to ensuring the timely availability of high-quality of improved, 

appropriate products at affordable prices for commercial and smallholder farmers in Sierra Leone. 

Furthermore, the project will provide support to national institutions and policymakers to create and 

maintain enabling environments that will accelerate the development of competitive formal input 

systems to adequately farmers. 

 

1.2.5 Rice has been selected as the initial crop that this project will focus on because there is strong 

domestic demand for it along with consumer preference. While maize will be the secondary crop due 

its market potential and linkage to the livestock and fisheries industries through its use in the 

production of animal feed.  The project will therefore promote inclusive economic development by 

targeting areas where rice and maize farming is already being practiced but has not been taken to its 

full economic and business potentials. To this end, the project will serve as a bridge between the 

existing major players and medium to small scale producers through supporting out-growers scheme 

with technical assistance. The project seeks to ensure socio economic empowerment, increase the 

involvement of both genders in the advancement of the agribusiness sector in Sierra Leone; create 

conditions for equitable access by men and women to project resources and increase decision-making 

for women along the agricultural value chain. Project interventions will thus deliberately target 

women and youth as beneficiaries and provide opportunities to increasing household income levels. 

 

1.2.6 The project activities are closely aligned to the Bank’s Country Strategy Paper as it will 

induce a great level of private sector participation in the sector’s development and overall economy 

at large. Furthermore, the project is consistent with the Bank Group’s policies and strategies including 

the Ten Year Strategy (2013-22) and the High Five Priority Areas particularly Feed Africa, and 

Improve the Quality of Life of Africans. It supports the Bank’s Strategies for African Agricultural 

Transformation (2016-2025) and Jobs for Youth in Africa (2016-2025) as well as the Strategy for 

Addressing Fragility and Building Resilience in Africa (2014-2019). The project is also firmly rooted 

in the Bank’s main agriculture flagship programs focused improving agricultural productivity 

through technology dissemination and scaling (TAAT, TAAT-S and PHAP), enhancing resilience to 

climate change through climate-smart agriculture and promoting youth empowerment (ENABLE 

Youth). Finally, the proposed project is line with the Bank’s Regional Integration Strategy 

Framework 2018-2025 (Pillar 2: Trade and Investment, which also includes the “Agricultural 

Transformation”) and the CCAP of the Bank for promoting climate-resilient agriculture. 

1.3 Donor Coordination 

1.3.1 Sierra Leone continues to be highly dependent on external development assistance. The Bank 

engages in dialogue with Development Partners under the guidance of the aid effectiveness principles 

embodied in the Paris Declaration, Accra Agenda for Action and Sustainable Development Goal No. 

17 - strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable 

development. The main DPs active in the agriculture sector include the AfDB, the World Bank (WB), 

the IsDB, the IFAD, the FAO and WFP. The Presidential Taskforce on Agriculture chaired by the 

President of the Republic of Sierra Leone and comprised of the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, 

other relevant Ministers and heads of DPs active in the agricultural sector is the main decision-

making body and coordination mechanism in the sector. In addition, an Agriculture Advisory Group, 

comprising DPs, private sector and others, provides technical support to program implementation. 

The Bank is an active participant in the DP Group and other diverse micro and thematic advisory 

groups including the National Rice Working Group.

1.3.2 This project is the outcome of extensive consultations with DPs in the agricultural sector. It 

benefits from parallel co-financing from the IsDB (USD 34.12 million) and IFAD (USD 11.8 

million). The SLARiS project will focus on optimizing the agricultural input supply system which 

would feed into the IsDB financed Rice Value Chain Development Project (RVCDP) and the IFAD 

financed Agricultural Value Chain Development Project (AVDP) both of which target upstream 

production and value addition. 

II. PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
 

2.1 Project Components 
2.1.1 The overall goal of the project is to stimulate a viable upstream agribusiness sector in Sierra 

Leone in order to promote economic diversification, food security, sustainable employment 

opportunities and improved livelihoods.  The specific project objective is to transform the agricultural 

input supply sub-sector as a viable and inclusive business opportunity, in order to promote enhanced 

production and productivity required to improve the livelihoods of beneficiaries along priority value 

chains (rice and maize).  
 

2.1.2 This objective would be achieved through: a) support and promotion of reliable access to 

quality input markets (seeds, fertilizers and pesticides) through liberalisation, adequate regulation 

and certification of the sub-sector sector which in turn is expected to facilitate the entry of new actors 

and expansion of business opportunities by the existing players; b) creation of an enabling 

environment for private sector led agribusiness growth upstream in the value chain through support 

to the emergence and growth of private seed producers and agri-input (seeds, fertilizers and 

pesticides) agro-dealers;  c) empowering young men and women to engage in the agriculture sector; 

d) supporting growth in farmer efficiency, productivity and income through providing improved 

technologies, climate-smart farming techniques, innovations and good agricultural practices; and e) 

increasing reliable output market through strengthening outgrower farming models. 
 

2.1.3 The project consists of the following components: (1) Support to Enhancement of 

Agricultural Input Production & Distribution Systems; (2) Support to Agribusiness Development; 

and (3) Project Management and Institutional Capacity Development.

2.2 Technical solutions retained and other alternatives explored  

2.2.1 The technical solutions which were retained comprises of a multipronged approach based on 

government creating an enabling environment to drive domestic private sector production and 

distribution of agricultural input supply for farmers in order to increase production and productivity 

in the targeted value chains. In addition, the youth empowerment scheme under the project 

encapsulates technical training as well as practical skills in agriculture and agribusiness activities. 

Two alternatives to the investment approach were considered and rejected are as follows: 
 

Table 2.2: Project Alternatives Considered and Reasons for Rejection 

 

2.3 Project Type 

2.3.1 This intervention is designed in the form of a stand-alone Investment Project with the main 

aim of up-scaling production and productivity and reducing imports of rice and maize through 

provision of agribusiness development, technical assistance and capacity building. 

2.4 Project cost and financing arrangements  

2.4.1 Project Costs: The total cost of the project is estimated at UA 8.52 million (USD 11.93 

million), net of taxes and customs duties, and based on 2019 prices, comprising  36.29% of the total 

cost in foreign cost, and 63.71 % in local costs. The project cost comprises an ADF grant of UA 7.99 

million (USD 11.19 million) (93.8 %) and GoSL in-kind contribution of UA 0.53 million (USD 0.74 

million) (6.2%). This cost is inclusive of physical and price contingencies estimated at average rates 

of 6% and 7% respectively. The price contingencies were estimated on the basis of actual and 

projected levels of local and foreign inflation rates of about 5.5% and 2.2% per annum, respectively. 

The physical contingencies are estimated from 0 to 15%. The ADF grant contribution to the project 

cost exceeds the threshold of 90% stipulated by the Policy on Expenditures Eligible for Bank Group 
Financing. This is justified by evident commitment to the project exhibited by the GOSL which is a 

transition state confronted with budget constraints in the face of significant development challenges.  

A summary of the project cost estimates by components and expenditure accounts is shown in Tables 

2.3, 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6 below, while details are provided in the Technical Annexes – Volume II of the 

appraisal report. 
  

Alternative name Brief description Reasons for rejection 

Alternative 1 Support the development of 

special agro-industrial 

processing zones in Sierra Leone  

Currently the level of agricultural productivity and 

production of priority crops is too low to sustain a 

viable SAPZ. This could be considered for future 

projects. 

 

Alternative 2 Focus AfDB financing on 

infrastructure development of 

feeder roads in the same area at 

the IsDB project 

Better value for money would be derived from 

available AfDB allocation by financing the 

establishment of a viable private sector led 

agricultural input supply system, agribusiness 

enhancement and youth development compared to 

a purely infrastructure investment in feeder roads.

2.5 Project’s target area and population  

2.5.1 Project Areas: The project interventions will be implemented in the high agricultural 

production potential zones of Kobia and Rokupr (Kambia), Kenema (Kenema) and Njala (Moyamba) 

Districts. These areas were selected following initial technical recommendations and also after the 

stakeholder consultations based on the criteria of: (i) potential for successful rice and maize 

production; (ii) market proximity; (iii) population and poverty incidence; and (iv)ability to build 

synergies with parallel co-financed investments of other development partners particularly the IsDB 

and IFAD. 

 

2.5.2 Project Beneficiaries: The estimated number of direct beneficiaries is about 32,000 farmers 

in the high potential targeted regions/zones. In addition, 1000 young agri-preneurs and 4000 young 

graduates (disaggregated by age and gender) will benefit from the incubation program and the new 

agribusiness training curriculum respectively. The project will create approximately 50,000 direct 

jobs and improve the lives of 150,000 indirect beneficiaries. 

2.6 Participatory process for project identification, design and implementation 

2.6.1 The Project was conceived following GoSL request to the AfDB to support a Rice Value 

Chain Development Project in 2018. On the strength of this formal request, the Bank fielded a project 

identification mission between 21 and 26 September 2018, followed subsequently by a preparation 

mission from 21 to 30 January 2019. An appraisal mission was mounted between 18 and 29 March 

2019 to fine-tune the project. The proposed project is the result of wide and detailed consultations 

with the various stakeholders including the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Ministry of Trade 

and Industry, Ministry of Youth, National Youth Commission, Ministry of Social Welfare, Gender 



 

9 

 

and Children’s Affairs, Ministry of Technical and Higher Education, Sierra Leone Agricultural 

Research Institute, Sierra Leone Seed Certification Agency, the Seed Multiplication Program, private 

sector actors including seed companies, animal feed millers, the Sierra Leone Chamber for 

Agribusiness Development, the Environmental Protection Agency, various Commercial Banks, and 

wide range of Development Partners (IFAD, IsDB, FAO, EU, WFP and WB). Apart from bilateral 

and focus-group meetings, a stakeholder consultative workshop which brought together 

representatives of the various stakeholders of the project was also organised during the appraisal 

mission. 

2.6.2 In effect, the project design and its listed activities were the outcome of broad-based 

consultations (meetings, discussions and workshops) with all the stakeholders who expressed their 

views on what the project should aimed at achieving. This participatory and consultative process 

clearly identified lack of quality inputs (particularly seeds), technologies and finance as three key 

challenges to the development of the agriculture sector. The components of the project were therefore 

designed to address the problems identified during consultations. The participatory process will 
continue throughout program implementation to ensure ownership and sustainability. 

2.7 Bank Group experience, lessons reflected in project design  

2.7.1 The Bank’s ongoing portfolio comprised a total of 18 operations, with a total commitment of 

UA 129.49 million (Annex 1). In terms of sector distribution, infrastructure accounts for 89.12% of 

the total portfolio, of which energy, transport, water and sanitation account for 45.14%, 20.48% and 

34.38% respectively. Although the Bank was previously active in the agriculture sector having 

funded 8 operations and studies since inception, there is currently no active agriculture project in the 

portfolio. The 2018 Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR) assessed the overall performance 

of the portfolio as satisfactory, with a rating of 2.96 on a scale from 1 to 4. Implementation progress 

(IP) was rated 2.93, while average development objective (DO) was rated 3.0 indicating that the 

ongoing operations have high likelihood of meeting their development objectives. There is no project 

at risk. The overall supervision rating is Non-PP/Non-PPP. The Country Policy and Institutional 

Assessment (CPIA) rating is 3.2 for 2014 (3rd Quintile). There is no Project Completion Report (PCR) 

backlog for closed Projects. Nevertheless, the CPPR highlighted challenges in existing project 

implementation including procurement, contract and financial management and results monitoring 

and evaluation. The CPPR recommended that the Bank should continue improving portfolio quality 

ensuring higher quality at entry of project, providing regular fiduciary clinics to project management 

agencies and increasing the use of country systems where possible.  

 

2.7.2 The Bank has accumulated notable experience in the implementation of agriculture sector 

projects in Sierra Leone. Although the last agriculture project closed in 2013, previous agricultural 

projects funded by the Bank include the Torma Bum Rice Development Project, the Moyamba 

Integrated Rural Development Project, the Northern Integrated Agricultural Development Project, 

the Artisanal Fisheries Development Project, the NERICA Rice Dissemination Project and the 

Agricultural Sector Rehabilitation Project. The Bank has gained useful experiences from its on-going 

and previous operations across various sectors in the country. The lessons garnered from these design 

and implementation experiences as well as the CPPR have been duly incorporated into this project.

2.8 Key performance indicators  

2.8.1. The project’s key performance indicators to be measured throughout the project life are 

presented in the Results Based Logical Framework. The M&E expert of the PMU will carry out 

internal project monitoring and evaluation in collaboration with MAF to monitor performance. 

Regular implementation progress will be measured through Quarterly Progress Reports, bi-annual 

Bank supervision missions (by Headquarters and CoSL), and annual technical and financial audits. 

The main indicators defined for monitoring the program outputs, outcomes and impact include: (i) 

poverty reduction; (ii) improved incomes; (iii) reduction in food imports; (iv) improvement in seed 

quantity and quality; (v) number of young men and women agripreneurs trained; (vi) number of youth 

and women led agribusinesses established; (vii) improvement in market linkages; and (viii) number 

of beneficiaries (males and females) trained. 

 

Various supervision missions and periodic progress reports will systematically render an account on 

the achievement level of the indicators. These will be regularly presented to decision and policy 

makers to guide project mid-term review and to facilitate project management after completion. 

III - PROJECT FEASIBILITY 

3.1 Economic and financial performance  

3.1.1 A financial assessment of the project was undertaken using activity models, and on the basis 

of prevailing market prices. The key assumptions underlying the analyses include: (i) Additional 

quantity of foundation seeds (rice- 9500 metric tons and 2600 metric tons maize) will be produced at 

full capacity of the project; (ii) production of certified improved seed varieties; (iii) a 10-year time 

period was used to measure the incremental benefits from the project. Farm gate prices were used in 

estimating the total revenue from the project; (iv) the opportunity cost of capital (OCC) used for 

discounting future benefits was estimated to be 12%. For the economic analysis; (v) hired labour 

value was adjusted by a conversion factor of 0.75. These analyses were carried-out with financial 

and economic costs generated using Costab 32. Summary of financial and economic analysis is in 

Annex VII and further elaborated in Annex B6 in Volume II of the appraisal report. 

 

3.1.2 On the basis of the above-captured assumptions, the project is expected to generate the 

following benefits: (i) Increase rice production and productivity resulting in total annual rice of 

1,600,000 metric tons; (ii) Increase maize production and productivity resulting in total annual rice; 

of 150,000 metric tons; (iii) improve market linkage and value chain for rice and maize production; 

(iv) improve average household income of beneficiaries to USD 800; and (v) provide employment 

for 20,000 farmers and entrepreneurs.

EIRR (base case) 20%         USD  16,325,400.25 

NB: detailed calculations are available in Annex B6 

 

 

3.1.3 Financial analysis: Based on the above assumptions, the financial analysis generated Net 

Present Value (NPV) of USD 12,105,388.14 and internal rate of return (IRR) of 19%, as captured in 

the technical annexes (B6). Based on the above analysis, the project is deemed financially feasible. 

The FIRR of 19% is higher than the opportunity cost of capital (12%). 

 

3.1.4 Economic analysis: The economic analysis was conducted using the same approach as the 

financial analysis, on the basis of shadow prices (prices in conditions of the efficient market 

operation) of tradable goods and total cost of project. In addition, other indirect benefits were also 

expected, such as, easy access to markets through market linkages; provision of agro-service centre, 

reliable market information system and business developments from the incubation trainings. 

However, these additional benefits were difficult to value in monetary terms due to the limited scope 

of this report, hence they could not be adequately captured in the analysis. In these conditions, the 

economic analysis yielded an NPV of USD 16,325,400.25 and EIRR of 20% as captured in the 

technical annexes. 

 

3.1.5 Sensitivity Analysis: The results of the sensitivity analysis indicate that with 5%, 10% and 

15% decrease in production the FIRR decreases to 18%, 17% and 16% respectively. The same 

exercise was carried out for successive decrease in prices by 5, 10, and 20% with a combination of 

yield decline. A decrease in output prices by 20% (switching values) would have to occur before the 

project’s economic benefits reduces to break-even point at 12%, the opportunity cost of capital. A 

combined 10% decrease in output price and 15% decrease in output will break-even at 12%, the 

opportunity cost of capital. 

3.2 Environmental and Social Impacts  

3.2.1 Environment: Based on the proposed project scope the environmental and social (E&S) 

classification is Category 2 according to the African Development Bank’s Environmental and Social 

Assessment Procedures (ESAP). There are parallel co-financed investments from the Islamic 

Development Bank, the World Bank and IFAD and these donors had earlier prepared Environmental 

and Social Management Framework, and Pest Management Plan for the project. These documents 

were reviewed and found to have followed the African Development Bank Environmental and Social 

Assessment Procedures (ESAP). Hence these safeguards documents were adopted and their 

Executive Summaries disclosed on the Bank’s website on 22nd May 2019.  

 

3.2.2 The classification and attendant requirement is commensurate with the project classification 

stipulated by the Sierra Leone Environmental Protection Regulations. The principal objectives of 

conducting this environmental and social assessment and planning was to ensure that the project 

integrates mechanisms to reduce environmental impacts along the entire value chain, from 

production, marketing to product value addition/manufacture, usage and disposal.  

 

3.2.3  Environmental and Social Management Framework indicate that although the project will 

have some site specific negative impacts, it is also posed to have numerous positive impacts among 

them, notably: (i) improved production and competitiveness of selected agriculture commodities that 

will contribute to increased income opportunities for value chain actors, and support the local 

economy of the provinces; (ii)  reduced food imports; (iii) improved agronomic practices and 

technologies for rice and maize improved varieties that are adapted to the local conditions; (iv)  

improved agricultural production, productivity and market linkages that will foster job creation along 



 

12 

 

the value chains (improve quality and quantities of seeds; (v) improved incomes for women and men;  

(vi) increased  number of private sector input producers and distributors; (vii) increased training of 

Youth (disaggregated by gender); (ix) established youth-led agribusinesses ; and (x) improved market 

linkages. 

 

 3.2.4 The negative impacts will stem from a number of rehabilitation activities in the infrastructure 

development and value chain components of the project. The potential negative impacts of the project 

include those associated with the rehabilitation and equipping of two Seed Multiplication Centers, 

agriculture production and value chain activities. Rehabilitation activities may result in; (i) noise, 

vibration and emissions from operation of machinery that may impair air quality and induce health 

implications; (ii) generation of wastes (including rehabilitation waste and construction wastes); (iii) 

occupational health and safety of the rehabilitation crew. During operation phase, agriculture 

activities of value chain actors may lead to: (i) increased use of agrochemicals including pesticides 

and fertilizers, which may contribute to soil and water (surface and groundwater) contamination, and 

increase health-risks of people exposed to pesticides; and (ii) waste and effluents from processing 

and marketing facilities. These impacts are site specific and can be readily managed with the 

application of well-defined measures elaborated in the detailed site specific ESMPs. Some of the 

mitigation measures to be implemented include: (i) refilling the exposed or excavated soil soon after 

completion of works and avoiding or minimizing compaction of soils; and (ii) capacity building of 

value chain actors to promote good agriculture practices, improved agriculture technologies such as 

integrated soil fertility management (ISFM), integrated pest management (IPM) and sustainable land 

and water management practices.  

 

3.2.5 Climate Change: Agriculture production in Sierra Leone is vulnerable to the impacts of 

climate variability and change. Drought and floods are increasing in frequency and intensity, while 

average temperatures during the growing season are rising. Crop failures, reduction in productivity 

and outbreaks of pest and diseases are exacerbated by extreme climatic events. Cognizant of the 

national commitment to combat climate change, the project is being prepared taking into 

consideration the various National Strategies, Plans and Institutions relevant to Climate Change 

Overall, the project will facilitate climate resilience along the selected value chains by promoting 

climate smart agriculture and improved agriculture technologies. 

 

3.2.6 Gender: Women make up more than half of Sierra Leone’s agricultural labor force yet they 

are under-represented in land ownership and income. Discussions during the appraisal mission 

identified four major constraints that limit women’s productivity (as compared to men) and their full 

inclusion in the domestic agricultural economy namely: lack of access to assets, lack of access to 

financing, limited training and time constraints. To alleviate these constraints, the project will seek 

to: (i) increase the number of female entrepreneurs in agribusiness by providing training and 

improving access to financing; (ii) increase income by improving productivity and training women 

in core business skills; (iii) increase access to niche markets by marketing products from women-led 

value chains; and (iv) reduce women time constraints by providing them with improved technologies 

and adequate agro processing equipment’s and trainings.  

 

3.2.7 Five actions and interventions will foster these expected results: trainings and sensitization 

campaigns, financing, enhancing market links, strengthening women’s business groups and 

increasing their access to farm inputs. To implement these actions and monitor them efficiently, the 

Project Management Team will include a Youth and Gender expert to work closely with the Gender 

in agriculture and Nutrition Unit of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry as well as the Ministry 

of Social welfare, Gender and Children’s Affairs. Based on the above expected outcome, activities 

and strategy, the project is classified as Category 2, in accordance with the Bank’s Gender Marker 

System. 

 



 

13 

 

3.2.8 Human Capital, Youth Employment and Jobs: The rapidly growing youth population and 

youth unemployment was a major root cause of the outbreak of civil conflict. According to the 

National Youth Commission of Sierra Leone, the problem of youth unemployment is very complex 

as there are three categories of unemployed youth: uneducated, semi-skilled, and educated youth. 

Approximately 60% of youth are underemployed or unemployed and an estimated 800,000 youth 

today are actively searching for employment. Furthermore, illiteracy remains a persistent challenge 

and youth that lack the skills and education find it extremely difficult to compete for the limited jobs 

available. The main reasons for this high level of unemployment are lack of financial or other 

resources to start businesses, family responsibilities and the lack of skill requirements or experience. 

This frequently causes feelings of hopelessness and despair among young people pushing them to 

migrate from rural to urban areas .As young people move to the urban areas in search of better 

opportunities, urban migration is exerting more pressure on the limited infrastructure. The need to 

address youth unemployment and its underlying causes cannot be over-emphasized, given that large 

numbers of unemployed youths are a potential source of insecurity in view of their vulnerability to 

recruitment into criminal and violent activities. Youth unemployment in Sierra Leone has been 

recognized as a potential trigger for social instability, the prolonged state of underdevelopment and 

economic stagnation. 

 

3.2.9 Agricultural transformation is one of the key enablers for employment and job creation 

especially for young people in Sierra Leone and Africa at large. This project will support agribusiness 

training/incubation, entrepreneurship development through establishing an Enable Youth 

Agribusiness Centre of Excellence in partnership with Njala University of Agriculture.  In an 

integrated model the Agribusiness centre will offer multi-purpose training to meet the needs of Njala 

university students, rural youth and farmers including women. It will offer trainees an 

integrated/holistic practical training opportunity to gain experience from the units that will be 

established at the university (sequenced from production, harvesting, agro-processing, packaging, 

sales and marketing). This practical experience is expected to prepare the trainees for both 

employment and agripreneurship. A tracer study will also be carried out to monitor the progress 

achieved by youth supported by the project. It is estimated that 1,000 young promising agripreneurs 

will be supported to establish their own businesses while 4,000 will be equipped with technical skills 

to access employment. The project will create approximately 50,000 direct jobs and further 150,000 

jobs indirectly. 

 

3.2.10 Social Impact: The project will increase farmer incomes, improve livelihoods and 

consequently support better health, education and well-being indicators among project beneficiaries. 

Youth (both male and female) employment has a positive social impact on economic growth and 

productivity that cannot be ignored. When a great amount of skilled youth and university graduates 

(including young women) in Sierra Leone are able to find jobs and put their knowledge and 

capabilities into innovation and contributing to economic growth. Furthermore, having a large share 

of the workforce mainly youth employed will lead to increase productivity and gross domestic 

product (GDP). Increased capacity of youth (including women) through skill development and job 

creation under the Project will strengthen community cohesion and empowerment thus making it less 

likely for youth to engage in violence crime. 

 

3.2.11 Addressing Fragility: Sierra Leone has made significant progress in consolidating peace and 

security country-wide and in rebuilding its economy that was nearly destroyed by the decade long 

conflict. While Sierra Leone has not fully recovered from the twin shocks of the 2014-2016 Ebola 

crisis and slump in global commodity prices that severely affected the economy and created political 

uncertainties, it has been able to maintain security in the aftermath of the drawdown of the UN 

Mission and conducted peaceful political transition between parties. Rapid urbanization fuelled by 

migration of mainly youth from rural localities into the city of Freetown in search of opportunities is 

posing serious development challenge for the Government of Sierra Leone. In post conflict country 



 

14 

 

of such with major infrastructural deficits, the mass movement of people into Freetown increases 

more pressures on the Government and slow development of the city. Urban migration rate is 

currently 4.20% (about 46,000 people per annum) of the existing 1.1 million people living in 

Freetown which is exerting more pressure on the city limited infrastructure as estimated 15% of the 

country population lives in Freetown and environs alone. This has resulted to creating unsafe 

settlements around the city especially protected enclaves.  

 

3.2.12 Sierra Leone continues to experience some challenges stemming from the root causes and 

drivers of fragility which manifested itself over the decade-long conflict. The underlying drivers of 

fragility continue to pose significant downside risks for the country’s development. The root causes 

of fragility persist in all their political, economic, social and environmental dimensions and 

expressions. Intermediate drivers of fragility, such as limited national cohesion, food insecurity, high 

rates of youth unemployment, gender inequality, high levels of perceived and real corruption, weak 

human and institutional capacities and poor economic governance systems, especially public 

financial management (PFM) and limited revenue management systems are prevalent. With the 

above, the country has more pressures compared to capacity to withstand it. Increasing the Sierra 

Leone capacity and at the same time reducing these pressures through meaningful interventions will 

assist build resilience. 

 

3.2.13 Involuntary resettlement: There will be no resettlement as a result of the project. Any 

proposed activity will be located in areas which have no land disputes. No land acquisition is 

envisaged under this Project. 

IV.    IMPLEMENTATION 

4.1 Implementation Arrangements  

4.1.1 Executing and Implementing Agencies: The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry will be 

executing agency and will execute the project through a project management team to be established. 

The Sierra Leone Agricultural Research Institute (SLARI), Njala University and SLESCA will be 

implementing entities of certain activities of the project. 

 

4.1.2 A National Project Steering Committee (NPSC): The National Project Steering Committee 

will be constituted   of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (Chair), Ministry of Finance, Ministry 

of Planning and Economic Development, Ministry of Youth/ National Youth Commission, SLARI, 

SLESCA, SLECAD, Farmers Federation, Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development, 

Ministry of Social Welfare, Gender and Children’s Affairs, Environmental Protection Agency, Njala 

University, Civil Society Representative as well as the Chairperson of the each of the District 

Councils . The NPSC will be convened by the Chair on a semi-annual basis. The NPSC will be mainly 

responsible for: (i) policy and strategic guidance on all issues relating to the project; (ii) approval of 

project investments; (iii) approval and monitoring of project annual work plans and budgets; and (iv) 

resolving implementation bottlenecks and providing positive impetus to facilitate achievement of the 

project’s development objectives (results/outcomes). The Project Core Team on behalf of the 

Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, will convene the NPSC meetings and act as its Secretariat. The 

NPSC will provide guidance and general oversight functions, including policy and strategic 

orientation of the program. 

 

4.1.3 Project Management Team (PMT). The project management team will include: (i) Project 

Manager, Internationally recognised Seed Expert, Agribusiness Specialist, Social/Gender Expert, 

Crop/Extension Expert and Youth Coordinator, M&E Specialist, Procurement Specialist and an 

Accountant. The Project Manager, Seed Expert and the Fiduciary Team would be advertised and 

recruitment done on a competitive basis, while the other experts will be designated by the Ministry 

of Agriculture and Forestry. The team will report to the Permanent Secretary through the Chief 



 

15 

 

Agriculture Officer in the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and would be charged with the 

management and coordination of the Project’s activities. All team members will be subject to annual 

performance-based contracts and (ii) the project will also fund the necessary IT and office equipment 

as well as field vehicles to facilitate supervision and coordination activities. The project management 

team will be based in Moyamba District. 

 

4.2 Procurement and Financial Management Arrangements  

4.2.1 Procurement Arrangements: The Procurement of goods, works and consultancy services 

financed by the Fund will be carried out in accordance with the “Procurement Framework for Bank 

Group Funded Operations” dated October 2015 for high value contracts and the Recipient’s 

Procurement System for low value contracts.  The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Food 

Security will serve as the executing agency for this project and a Project Management Team (PMT) 

will be established that will be charged with the responsibility of implementing the project.  The 

Project Management Team will comprise a Procurement Specialist who will be recruited on a 

competitive basis to provide support on procurement related activities and also mentor the existing 

Procurement Officers managing the procurement unit of the ministry.  The PMU will carry out the 

procurement of goods, works, and consultancy services including preparation of procurement plan, 

standard bidding documents, open and evaluate bids, contracting and management of contract 

execution.  

 

4.2.2 Procurement Risks and Capacity Assessment (PRCA): The procurement capacity of the 

Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry was assessed and it was noted that the Procurement Officers are 

University graduates and they have acquired some experience on the Recipient’s procurement 

system. However, they have limited knowledge and experience on the Bank’s Procurement 

framework and will require further procurement training and mentoring on the use of donor 

procurement policies in readiness to assume procurement function of the a National Development 

Partners Program Coordination Office (NDPPCO).The procurement plan for the project will be 

prepared for the entire project duration and included in Section B5 of the Technical Annexes to this 

report. 

 

4.2.3 Financial Management: The financial management of the project will be handled an 

experienced qualified Project Accountant (PA) with hands-on experience on use of accounting 

software and practical application of International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS, 

Adopted by the GoSL for financial reporting). The Project Accountant (PA) will be competitively 

recruited. The PA will use the Tompro Accounting package (in harmony with other projects under 

MAF) for accounting and financial reporting. On a quarterly basis the PA will generate interim 

financial reports (IFRs) from Tompro, for the benefit of MAF and transmit copies to the Fund within 

30 days after the end of each calendar quarter. The project financial statement at end of the year shall 

be audited and certified copies together with the related management letter submitted to the Fund 

within 6 months after the end of each financial year. A  Financial Management Manual (FMM) and 

Project Implementation Manual (PIM) will be customised from the existing manuals and adopted to 

codify FM practices and guide project implementation. The internal auditor responsible for MAF 

will provide internal checks and periodically review project operations. The internal auditor will 

report to the NPSC through the Director of Technical Services and the NPSC ensure that all audit 

recommendations implemented and monitored. 

 

4.2.4 Disbursement Arrangement: Four disbursement methods are used by the Fund in disbursing 

funds to projects. The assessment recommends: (i) Direct payments; and (ii) Payments through 

Special Account (SA) under this project. The other 2 methods –reimbursement and reimbursement 

by guarantee shall be available to the project, if desired. Direct payments will be used for the 

payments against larger contracts signed between project management and contractors/suppliers/ 

service providers. The SA method will be used for meeting recurrent/ administrative expenses and 



 

16 

 

smaller contracts under the project. Here, a United States Dollar denominated Special Account will 

be opened at a Commercial Bank acceptable to the Fund, to receive funds from the Fund. A local 

currency account will be opened at same Bank to receive transfers from the SA for making payments 

in local currency. A second local currency account will be opened at the same bank for project 

operations.. All disbursements will follow with the disbursements procedures outlined in the Bank’s 

Disbursement Handbook. 

 

4.2.5  External Audit: The Auditor General (AG) of Sierra Leone will be responsible for the audit 

of the project on an annual basis in line with the Constitution of Sierra Leone, and use of country 

systems. Whilst the project will not pay related audit fees from its resources for audits performed by 

the AG, it shall bear reasonable incidental audit expenses duly submitted by the AG and cleared by 

the Fund. However, in instances of workload, where the AG cannot perform the audit, MAF and the 

Fund will be notified in time for an independent audit firm to be competitively recruited. The auditor 

terms of reference (TOR) will be agreed with the Fund. Certified copies of the audit reports, together 

with the accompanying management letter, must be submitted to the Fund within six (6) months at 

the end of each financial year.  

4.3 Monitoring and Evaluation  

4.3.1 The M&E system will be developed and managed by the M&E Officer, within the framework 

of the project Results Based Logical Framework. The M&E Officer will regularly track, document 

and report the project’s results and progress, facilitate knowledge building, and share knowledge with 

key stakeholders. The monitoring and reporting plans will be developed based on gender 

disaggregated indicators in the log frame. It will be part of the obligation of all project implementers 

to provide reports in prescribed format on outputs and outcomes achieved within the implementation 

agreements. The Project will provide financial resources to facilitate training, proper data gathering, 

processing and reporting. 

 

4.3.2 The project’s reports and key milestones are indicated in the table below. The Fund will 

supervise the implementation of the project through regular Supervision Missions which will be 

undertaken at least twice a year. These missions will verify implementation progress to ensure that 

key verifiable indicators, including gender specific indicators, related to the outputs, outcomes and 

impacts are being monitored. The M&E activities, including implementation progress and 

expenditure will therefore be an integral part of the project implementing agency, as a regular 

management function through the PMU’s M&E Specialist. The PMU will submit to the Fund 

progress reports, annual work plans and budgets, and annual procurement plans using Fund’s format. 

The quarterly progress report will be submitted to the Fund within 45 days after the end of the 

reporting period, whilst the annual progress report will be submitted within three months after the 

end of reporting period.

4.4 Governance 

4.4.1 According to the 2018 Mo Ibrahim Index on African Governance (IIAG), Sierra Leone ranked 

26th out of the 54 African countries assessed with a score of 50.9 which is slightly higher than the 

continental average of 49.9. Sierra Leone’s performance across four categories of governance namely 

(a) Safety & Rule of Law (20th out of 54), (b) Participation & Human Rights (15th out of 54), (c) 

Sustainable Economic Opportunity (39th out of 54), and (d) Human Development (44th out of 54). 

With regard to corruption perception, the 2018 Transparency International Report ranks Sierra Leone 

129th out of 180 with a Corruption Perception Index (CPI) of 30, on a scale of 0 (high corruption) to 

100 (very low corruption). 

 

4.4.2 In order to support the ongoing reform momentum in the country and foster good governance, 

the Fund, in close collaboration with the IMF and other partners, has regularly maintained sustained 

policy dialogue with the Sierra Leonean authorities through reform and institutional support 

operations. The government’s recent reform to operationalize the Treasury Single Account is a 

welcome step, as are policies to ensure that spending commitments are in line with the available 

financing envelope. More broadly, these efforts will lead to better governance, helping promote 

macroeconomic stability and inclusive growth. 

 

4.5 Sustainability 

4.5.1 One of the key aspects of the project is commercial orientation. This implies bringing out the 

business opportunities in the agriculture sector. The project activities will lead to the emergence of 

business oriented agripreneurs who are expected to run their businesses as a going-concern with the 

enhanced capacity they will receive from the project. This will lead to economic sustainability of the 

project. Also, the participatory approach adopted during the design stage of project will continue 

even at implementation in order to enhance ownership by beneficiaries thus ensuring sustainability. 

Implementation through government line ministries will ensure that project activities are in line with 

broader government programmes. All the critical enabling infrastructure that the project would invest 

in under the SMP, SLESCA and the ENABLE-Njala Youth Program will have in place, a 

management arrangement that would ensure that they are run on commercial basis by private 

operators under special management agreement with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. 

4.6 Risk management 

4.6.1 Risks to the successful implementation of the project and attainment of targeted outcomes 

and impact will stem primarily from the uncertainty in Government’s commitment to liberalize the 

domestic seed sector. The mitigation is that the National Seed Act was promulgated in 2017, which 

clearly depicts a publicly enabled but private sector driven seed sector.  

 

4.6.2 A related risk is the ability of private sector agro-input producers and agro-dealers to 

effectively fill the market void that would be created from Government’s withdrawal from 

procurement and distribution of seeds and other agro-input. The mitigation is that the project will 

support the provision of incentives including training and capacity building to provide a conducive 

enabling environment for private sector growth during the gradual withdrawal of Government from 

the sub-sector. 

 

4.6.3 Another risk relates to the novelty in the implementation of a commercially oriented youth in 

agribusiness empowerment project within an existing national university in Sierra Leone. The 

mitigation here is that they would not offer the service free but the project will pay for the incubation 

of the identified entrepreneurs who will form satellite farms for the anchor investors. The mitigation 

is that Funds will be managed by a carefully selected funds manager and also the risk for default by 

borrowers limited as the cost Potential risks are summarized below. The overall risks are rated 

moderate as they are manageable and mitigation measures will be in place.

No. Potential Risk Rating Mitigation Measures 

1. Government commitment to deregulating 

the agricultural input supply sector. 

Low Project is aligned to the MTNDP & 

NATS’s focus of economic 

diversification and private sector led 

supply systems 

2. Political influences of SMP, ENABLE-

Njala & SLeSCA  

Low SLESCA, SMP & ENABLE-Njala 

will be run as PPP outfits to ensure 

autonomy, efficiency and 

sustainability. 

3. Young agripreneurs are unable to establish 

viable businesses on their own. 

Medium Incubation training, business 

development, competitive seed grant 

and linkage to markets are provided to 

increase probability of success 

4.7 Knowledge building  

4.7.1 The project will support research through providing support to the Sierra Leone Agricultural 

Research Institute (SLARI) which has a long standing cooperation with the Consultative Group for 

International Agricultural Research Agencies. This research will support the development of 

improved breeder and foundation seeds for rice and maize as well as the varietal maintenance of these 

varieties. The project also includes collaborative knowledge development through Njala University, 

the foremost agricultural university in Sierra Leone. The knowledge generated through these research 

avenues will be disseminated to farmers through strengthened extension services to support better 

productivity at the farm level and youth to promote agribusiness development.

Project Executive Summary 

Project Overview: the Value Chains, Agricultural and Rural Entrepreneurship Support Project 

(PACVEAR) will be implemented in three regions, namely Bafata, Oio and Gabu, in northern and eastern 

Guinea-Bissau. The project’s objective is to improve the rice and market gardening subsector production 

environment, and promote enterprises in all targeted subsector value chain links to create sustainable jobs 

and increase rural income. 

The project will be implemented over five years (November 2019 to December 2024). The total project 

cost, exclusive of taxes and customs duties, is UA 10.62 million (XOF 8.607 billion) financed through a 

UA 5.46 million Transition Support Facility  (TSF) grant (51%), a UA 3.04 million TSF loan (29%) and 

a UA 1.06 million African Development Fund (ADF) loan (10%). 

The project will directly benefit 4 400 households and farmers in the project area, i.e. 35 000 people, at 

least 13 000 of them women. The expected project outcomes are: (i) an additional annual production of 

4 000 tonnes of rice and 2 000 tonnes of market garden produce; (ii) creation and/or strengthening of 600 

agricultural and rural enterprises to create 2 000 sustainable jobs, 30% of them for women and 40% for 

youths; and (iii) increase in average rural income to XOF 250 000 per household. 

Needs Assessment: Irrigated areas (18%) are still too small to reduce the shortfall in rice production, 

estimated at 80 000 tonnes per year. The project will increase irrigated areas by developing additional 

660 hectares of land, half of which will be equipped for full irrigation water control with the availability 

of detailed designs and bidding documents for 720 hectares. In addition, the main sources of fragility in 

the country include political instability, extreme poverty and high youth unemployment, as well as lack 

of opportunities for youth socio-professional integration. Consequently, it is necessary to design an 

agricultural and rural enterprises development programme targeting youths and women that would 

contribute to addressing this unemployment challenge. 

Value Added for the African Development Bank: Through its previous operations, the Bank has helped 

to increase developed areas and to acquire specific expertise in key domains (irrigation, seed production 

and control, solar energy, processing, etc.). With PACVEAR, the Bank will help to consolidate the gains 

of previous operations and promote rural entrepreneurship, with a view to boosting growth and the 

professionalisation of the agricultural sector. By supporting the development of agricultural 

infrastructure, the Bank will create factors conducive to the development of agricultural and rural 

enterprises in all targeted subsector value chain links, thus creating employment particularly for youths 

and women (production, processing and marketing). 

Knowledge Management: The project will generate knowledge that will be used to create numerous 

jobs through the upgrading of incubation centres to train and support youths willing to embark on 

agribusiness activities. The project will also support the Food and Nutrition Security Information System 

(SISSAN) in collecting and processing data for use in developing relevant sector policies. In addition, 

PACVEAR’s specific contribution to structuring the seed subsector through the introduction of 

technologies for African agricultural transformation (TAAT) will help to generate knowledge that will be 

used to consolidate production methods, thus increasing production. The setting up of demonstration units 

and the dissemination of best practice, as well as the introduction of solar energy in drainage and 

agricultural product processing and conservation systems will further enhance knowledge, particularly on 

new technologies in these areas.

VALUE CHAINS, AGRICULTURAL AND RURAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP 

SUPPORT PROJECT (PACVEAR) 

Management hereby submits the following report and recommendation concerning a proposal to award a 

UA 5.46 million TSF grant and extend a UA 3.04 million TSF loan and a UA 1.06 million ADF loan 

to the Republic of Guinea-Bissau to finance the Value Chains, Agricultural and Rural Entrepreneurship 

Support Project (PACVEAR). 

I. Strategic Thrust and Rationale 

1.1  Project Linkages with Country Strategy and Objectives 

1.1.1  PACVEAR is fully consistent with Guinea-Bissau’s strategic orientations, particularly the Terra 

Ranka Strategic and Operational Plan (2015-2020), which hinges on four main engines of economic 

growth, including agriculture and agro-industry. It also plugs into Sub-programme 1 of the second 

generation of the National Agricultural Investment Programme (PNIA) “Promotion of Crop Production 

Sub-sectors”, adopted in December 2017, which focuses on the development of food crops (including 

rice) and market gardening through better control of water and increased access to factors of production. 

It aligns with the orientations of the Letter of Agricultural Development Policy (LADP) and its action 

plan, which aim to guarantee food security, increase and diversify agricultural exports and improve the 

living conditions of rural dwellers. It also embraces the orientations of the National Food Security 

Programme (PNSA) and the Rice Farming Development Programme (PDR - 2016). PACVEAR is 

consistent with the “Develop Infrastructure to Promote Inclusive Growth” pillar of CSP 2015-2019 

through the development of agricultural infrastructure and opportunities in agriculture (especially for the 

youth and women).  

1.1.2  Guinea-Bissau is characterised by fragility, further aggravated by overall institutional weakness 

and a non-inclusive development model without economic alternatives. Sector constraints include the 

isolation of production areas, the obsolescence of production systems, inadequate access to inputs and 

weak agricultural product processing capacity. The main challenge is to strengthen institutional, economic 

and social resilience, while building the capacity of actors, reducing gender disparities and supporting the 

country's structural transformation through the construction of key infrastructure to ensure inclusive and 

green growth. Agricultural transformation through the development of value chains, the promotion of 

youth entrepreneurship, the mainstreaming of the gender dimension and greater involvement of non-State 

actors (including the private sector) will contribute to building resilience and reducing fragility in the 

country. 

1.1.3  In spite of Guinea-Bissau’s agricultural potential, the State’s withdrawal from the agricultural 

sector and the political crises of the last few decades have impeded genuine agricultural development in 

the country. This lack of interest in the agricultural sector has led to a serious structural weakening of 

production systems (agricultural and livestock). This is compounded by vagaries of the weather and 

climate change, which pose a serious threat with consequences on the management of ecosystems and 

other renewable agricultural and natural resources, all of which can impede the country’s social cohesion, 

stability and sustainable development. This combination of structural and cyclical crises has far-reaching 

consequences on the entire agricultural, silvicultural and pastoral sector, food and nutritional security, and 

the livelihoods of most of Guinea-Bissau’s population who depend on agriculture (in the broadest sense). 

1.1.4  According to the agriculture sector study conducted in 2014 (Portuguese Cooperation Trust 

Fund), it is essential to optimise the use of farmland, create added value for products, and enable 

households to generate sufficient income to purchase certain commodities. Rice is the staple foodstuff 

(eaten by 90% of Guinea-Bissau’s households) and food deficit is made up annually by rice imports of 

about 80 000 tonnes. The promotion of market gardening, stockbreeding and related services will not only 

help to diversify the sources of food, but also improve the income of rural communities, particularly 

women and youths in the targeted regions in the northern and eastern parts of the country. Garden crop 

production currently meets only 60% to 70% of demand. The main constraints on growth subsectors (rice 

and market gardening) are the remoteness of production areas, the degradation of production systems, 

insufficient access to inputs (particularly quality seeds) and markets, weak processing capacity, the lack 

of information and economic opportunity exploration networks to promote the employability of rural 



 

2 

youths, and the inadequate private sector integration into the value chains of growth subsectors and related 

activities to act as an engine and a lever for private enterprises. 

1.2 Rationale for Bank Involvement 

1.2.1 PACVEAR is in line with two of the Bank’s High 5s, namely “Feed Africa” and “Improve the 

quality of life for the people of Africa”. The project will contribute to attaining these two priorities by 

developing rice and market garden value chains, building the capacity of actors, creating jobs and 

improving income. The project is aligned with the Bank’s Long-term Strategy (LTS 2013-2022) and its 

two overarching objectives: inclusive growth and transition to a green economy. 

1.2.2  PACVEAR is aligned with the Bank's Long-Term Strategy (SLT 2013-2022) and its two major 

objectives of inclusive growth and transition to green growth. The project is built on the three areas of 

special emphasis of the LTS: fragile States, agriculture and food security, and gender. It is consistent with 

the orientation of the Bank’s new Strategy for Agricultural Transformation in Africa (2016-2025), which 

puts special emphasis on the development of value chains and agricultural entrepreneurship. In addition, 

it will contribute to achieving the objectives of the Enable Youth and Jobs for Youth in Africa flagship 

initiatives, by promoting capacity building and the creation of opportunities for youths. Furthermore, the 

project is in keeping with the Bank’s Technologies for African Agricultural Transformation (TAAT) 

programme, which focuses on the adoption of new production and processing technologies in agricultural 

value chains. 

1.2.3  PACVEAR concords with the Bank’s Gender Strategy (2014-2018) “Investing in Gender 

Equality for Africa’s Transformation”, more specifically Pillar II, “Economic Empowerment”. It also 

follows the recommendations of the gender profile prepared by the Bank and UNWomen in 2015, on the 

need to integrate women into value chains. Specifically, it plugs into climate-change adaptation initiatives 

by promoting renewable energy, water-saving technologies and resilient methods. 

1.2.4  Agriculture remains one of the country’s most important strategic sectors and the only sector 

that can benefit the largest number of people, combat food and nutrition insecurity and provide jobs for 

young people and women. The continuous support provided by the Bank to the sector is justified by: (i) 

the highly satisfactory performance of similar Bank-funded operations, notably the Agricultural and Rural 

Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project (PRESAR) (completed in 2012) and the Rice Value Chain 

Development Project (PDCV-Riz) (launched in 2017); (ii) unmet needs in terms of irrigation 

infrastructure and support as well as the development of value chains and agricultural entrepreneurship; 

and (iii) the strong mobilisation and involvement of the Government, local and regional actors and 

beneficiaries. The activities proposed by the project, namely the development of irrigation schemes 

(particularly full control of irrigation water), the integration of value chains and agricultural 

entrepreneurship will help to promote the employment of young people and women in rural areas, 

strengthen adaptation to climate change and increase the resilience of segments of the population that are 

vulnerable to food and nutrition insecurity. 

1.3  Aid Coordination 

1.3.1  Since the April 2012 crisis, the technical and financial partner (TFP) consultation framework 

that was operating through multi-sector thematic groups has been put on hold. However, it should be noted 

that, in general, aid coordination and monitoring mechanisms have always suffered from the structural 

weaknesses of public administration. In this regard, before the coup d’état of 2012, the Bank approved a 

technical assistance project (PECA II) to build coordination capacity. The project included the convening 

of donor round tables in Brussels in March 2015 as well as capacity-building activities organised by the 

Ministry of Economy and Finance. 

1.3.2  Based on the “Letter of Agricultural Development Policy”, several bilateral and multilateral 

partners provided significant support for rural development, food and nutrition security in Guinea-Bissau, 

including: (i) IFAD (Economic Development Project for the Southern Regions - PADES and design of a 

new project for the diversification of family farming in the eastern and northern regions); (ii) BOAD 

(Food Security Support Project - PASA and Project to Promote Rice Cultivation by Youths - PPRFJ); (iii) 

ECOWAS (support for the preparation of the National Agricultural Investment Programme - PNIA); and 

(iv) WAEMU (feasibility study on the Irrigated Rice Cultivation Intensification Support Project - PAIRI 

and the Crop and Grain Storage Warehouse Construction Programme). It is worth noting that ECOWAS, 



 

3 

WAEMU and CILSS set up the Global Alliance for Resilience Initiative – Sahel and West Africa (AGIR) 

whose objective is to achieve “zero hunger” in 20 years. From an institutional standpoint, the activities of 

partners are coordinated by the Ministry of Economy and Finance. For agriculture in particular, the 

partners reached a consensus on the sector strategy, notably PNIA, during the partners’ round table 

convened in Brussels in March 2015. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) plays 

a major role in policy support and coordination of activities. 

The project will establish synergies with projects being implemented and those being designed. More 

broadly, the involvement of the various partners in the rural sector (agriculture, livestock production, 

fisheries and environment) is presented in Annex A4 of Volume 2 and summarised below:

II. Project Description 

2.1. Project Objectives and Components 

PACVEAR’s overall objective is to contribute to enhancing the competitiveness of subsector value chains 

(rice and market gardening) to boost inclusive and sustainable growth in the agricultural sector. Its specific 

objective is to improve the rice and market gardening subsector production environment, and promote 

enterprises in all targeted subsector value chain links, with a view to creating sustainable jobs and 

increasing rural income. PACVEAR, which will be implemented over a five-year period (November 2019 

to October 2024), comprises three main components: (i) Improve the Competitiveness of Agricultural 

Value Chains (rice and market gardening); (ii) Promote Agricultural and Rural Entrepreneurship; and (iii) 

Project Coordination and Management. The table below presents a summary of the activities selected. A 

detailed description of the activities is provided in Annex C3 of Volume 2.

2.2 Technical Solutions Adopted and Alternatives Explored 

2.2.1  The technical solutions adopted for PACVEAR are based on field data and lessons drawn from 

similar projects, discussions with beneficiaries, the specific characteristics of each site to be developed, 

the water resources to be mobilised as well as the ease of managing facilities and equipment. Therefore, 

the proposed works take into account not only rice cultivation, but also horticulture which is already being 

carried out in the lowlands with full irrigation water control, particularly during the dry season. Three 

options were considered: (1) lowlands with full irrigation water control will be developed into small plots 

that are easy to manage, maintain and improve; (2) market gardening areas will be systematically equipped 

with a mini submersible solar-powered borehole pump, a storage tank, a drip irrigation system1 and a 

protective grid fence and hedges; and (3) the mechanisation of tillage operations by providing support to 

agricultural mechanisation service providers (tractors and accessories) in project impact areas will 

contribute to improving tillage operations and creating new employment opportunities for youths. 

Table 2.2: Alternatives Explored and Reasons for Their Rejection 
Alternative Rejected Brief Description Reason for Rejection 

Develop just one large area 

with full irrigation water 

control where the project 

would be concentrated  

 

Construction of a large pumping station, covered 

water transportation canals with large civil 

engineering structures for water collection, 

carriage and distribution.  

This alternative does not ensure the availability 

of labour, in terms of quantity or quality, for the 

development of the facilities and the investments 

required. It is quite likely that the area will not be 

fully used. In addition, it will be quite difficult to 

manage and maintain the area. 

Develop market gardening 

areas with indurated wells 

without any dewatering 

mechanism  

Construction of one or more wells 5 metres to 10 

metres deep (one well per hectare) where 

irrigation water is collected manually and then 

stored in small basins and carried to the parcels 

by the farmers using watering cans or buckets.  

The manual collection of water from indurated 

wells and irrigation with watering cans makes the 

task, which is carried out mainly by women, very 

tedious and takes up an enormous amount of 

work time and water. This problem will be 

compounded in the medium term once 

groundwater dries up, obliging farmers to fetch 

water from a greater depth (20 metres to 30 

metres). 

Develop animal-drawn 

cultivation in the intermediary 

phase instead of motorising 

soil cultivation activities.  

Animal-drawn cultivation practised in the 

project regions is suited for light soils with 

limited humidity, to ensure high productivity. Its 

effectiveness largely depends on the physical 

conditions of the area to be cultivated.  

Large arable land in the region, the short period 

available for soil preparation and the short rainy 

season are factors militating against animal-

drawn cultivation.  

 

2.3 Project Type 

2.3.1 PACVEAR is an investment operation financed with ADF and TSF resources. The Government of 

Guinea-Bissau has not yet started implementing projects and programmes using the sector-based approach, 

given a number of institutional constraints and the fragility context. For now, the project approach is the most 

appropriate to ensure the achievement of outcomes and the effective/efficient use of the resources allocated to 

the project, which will also consolidate the gains achieved with PRESAR and PDCV-Riz. 

2.4. Project Cost and Financing Arrangements 

2.4.1. The project cost, exclusive of taxes and custom duties, is estimated at UA 10.62 million, (XOF 8.607 

billion). The foreign exchange portion represents 36% of the total cost, exclusive of taxes, or UA 3.85 million. 

Custom duty and taxes will be covered by the State, which shall to take the necessary measures to implement 

this provision. A 4% provision for physical contingencies and a 3% provision for price escalation have been 

included in the project cost. The summary of the project cost by component and expenditure category, as well 

as the expenditure schedule are presented in Tables 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5 below. 

 

 

 

                                                 
1  Overall, market gardening areas in Guinea-Bissau are irrigated manually (98% using watering cans). Consequently, drip irrigation will be 

introduced gradually over time. In this regard, basin irrigation (water is pumped from the well into a reinforced concrete storage tank and then 
conveyed gravitationally through buried pipes to supply small 2 metre to 3 metre brickwork basins) will first be used in market gardening areas. 

Each small basin will supply irrigation water to ten 250 m2 plots, or 0.25 hectares. Once women farmers are able to control the cost of managing, 

operating and maintaining their market gardening areas, a drip irrigation system will be established to replace the small basins.

2.4.2 The project will be financed with a UA 5.46 million TSF grant (51% of the project cost), a UA 

3.04 million TSF loan (29% of the project cost) and a UA 1.06 million ADF loan (10% of the project 

cost). Considering the country’s fragile context, the Government’s financial contribution is estimated at 

UA 0.20 million (2% of the project cost). It will cover detailed design and BDs for sites already developed, 

the allocation of premises for the PMU (head office at Bissau and field office in Bafata), the procurement 

of subsidised fertilisers (INPA), support for the preparation of the seed subsector diagnosis and the 

implementation of the seed subsector action plan, support for the establishment of the framework for the 



 

7 

monitoring of TFP operations, and dissemination of data through the Food and Nutrition Security 

Information System (SISSAN). The contribution of beneficiaries will be limited to the computation of 

their participation in easy-to-undertake ongoing development and maintenance works, estimated at UA 

0.86 million (8% of the project cost). The breakdown of project cost by source of financing is given in

2.5 Project Target Area and Beneficiaries 

2.5.1  PACVEAR will cover three regions in northern and eastern Guinea-Bissau, namely Bafata, Oio 

and Gabu, out of the country’s nine regions. It will cover 57% of the national territory and accounting for 

43% of the country’s total population2. The project impact area was selected based on several criteria: (i) 

the need to consolidate the gains of other Bank operations implemented in Bafata and Oio, and to extend 

them to Gabu - a region with a huge irrigation potential; (ii) geographic concentration of operations and, 

hence, sustainability and better visibility of actions; (iii) absolute poverty rates prevailing in the area, 

namely 83% in Gabu, 75% in Bafata and 73% in Oio; (iv) food and nutrition insecurity (above 15.6%); 

(v) high youth unemployment (30% in 2010); (vi) small area of irrigated land (18% of the agricultural 

potential); (vii) lack and obsolescence of facilities, difficulty in accessing factors of production (certified 

seeds, quality inputs, ploughing and post-harvest equipment, etc.); (viii) eagerness of youths and women 

to farm the land to be developed; and (ix) existence of local private initiatives that provide a real breeding 

ground for local small- and medium-size enterprises capable of enhancing the growth of value chains3.  

2.5.2 The infrastructure sites were selected based on the needs expressed at the grassroots level and a 

multi-criteria analysis combining: (i) the existence of local and sector operational dynamics; (ii) the 

absence of latent land conflicts; (iii) the commitment of FOs and local communities to ensure the 

management of the facilities to be developed; and (iv) the optimisation of the outcomes of similar projects 

(PRESAR/AfDB, PAIRI/WAEMU, PPRFJ/BOAD, etc.) to improve data quality at project entry. Thirteen 

(13) lowland rice cultivation sites have been selected under PACVEAR (the detailed list of sites is 

presented in Annex C3 of Volume 2)4.  

2.5.3 Specifically, PACVEAR will benefit many rural producers who would have easier access to 

facilities, inputs and equipment, and probably sell their produce more easily and at reduced cost. Project 

activities will focus on two highly vulnerable target groups in rural areas - women and youths. The project 

will directly benefit 4 400 households/farmers, or 35 000 people, at least 13 000 of them women. It will 

indirectly benefit all households in the three regions concerned through the outcomes of its activities and 

transformational investments. From the institutional viewpoint, the project will involve some 110 FOs, 

unions, EIGs and management committees. The implementation of project activities will create 2 800 

                                                 
2  Projection derived from the results of the 2009 GPHS based on a population growth rate of 2.2%. 
3  There is a need to build on the innovative initiatives implemented by NGOs and associations operating in the project area, such as ADPP, 

APRODEL, COAJOQ and ADIC-Nafaia, to promote value chains and create jobs. 
4  Detailed design and BDs (PAIRI 2018) for 12 of the 13 lowlands selected are available. This would help to rapidly commence works during the 

first year after the review of BDs.

decent jobs (for men, women and youths)5. 

2.6  Participatory Approach for Project Identification, Design and Implementation 

2.6.1  The project design was based on a participatory and inclusive approach involving all 

stakeholders, namely technical services, producer organisations, women’s/youth groups, civil society, 

private sector, development partners, beneficiary populations, projects, etc. These broad-based 

consultations were carried out through numerous meetings held during project identification, preparation 

and appraisal. This helped to make sound technical and operational choices that could contribute to 

ensuring the sustainability of project outcomes. During several visits to potential project sites and the sites 

of previous projects, discussions were held with the communities concerned and the representatives of 

producers to better identify the difficulties they faced, prioritise the activities to be implemented and select 

the relevant sites. That process helped to win the support of various stakeholders and led to a broad 

consensus on project design and implementation arrangements. 

2.6.2 This entire participatory process revealed great interest for the project, which builds on the 

achievements of PRESAR, PDCV-Riz and other past and ongoing projects. Producers reaffirmed the need 

to fully exploit the project area’s considerable potential and opportunities to mainstream pilot activities in 

the livestock sector particularly in Gabu district. Women expressed their interest for market gardening, 

processing and marketing of farm products, with the modernisation of production and processing tools 

and improved access to markets. Youths showed their enthusiasm in promoting agricultural and rural 

entrepreneurship through training, incubation and post-incubation support for private individual or 

collective initiatives in all value chain links. The development of a good communication strategy for 
PACVEAR and the maintenance of the participatory approach during its implementation are guarantees 
that local actors will take ownership of the project during the implementation phase. 

2.6.3 The consultations and working sessions held with technical services such as the General 

Directorate of Agriculture, the General Directorate of Livestock, the National Institute of Agricultural 

Research (INPA), Directorate of Seed Control and Certification, and NGOs (ADPP, APRODEL, ADIC-

Nafaia and COAJOQ) on the implementation of some project activities will help to ensure the 

methodological ownership of the project by partners and to conclude partnership agreements upon project 

start-up. 

2.6.4 Sites were selected for the development of irrigation schemes through field visits, consultations 

with technical services, farmer organisations, women’s and youth associations, beneficiaries and the 

analysis of the relevance of studies and projects such as the Irrigated Rice Cultivation Intensification 

Support Project – PAIRI (WAEMU, 2018) and the Project to Promote Rice Cultivation by Youths – 

PPRFJ (BOAD, 2015). The outcomes of these consultations are reflected in this appraisal report. 

However, adjustments may be made during project start-up. 

 

2.7. Bank Group Experience and Lessons Reflected in Project Design 

2.7.1 The Bank’s active portfolio in Guinea-Bissau as at May 2019 comprised ten (10) operations for 

a total net commitment of UA 73.47 million, of which eight (8) national public sector projects (UA 45.52 

million) and two (2) regional operations (UA 27.95 million). There is no ongoing project under the Bank’s 

private sector window. There is no problematic project (PP) or potentially problematic project (PPP). The 

distribution of the national project portfolio by sector is as follows: energy (74.7%); governance (13.7%) 

and agriculture (11.6%). The portfolio’s age has dropped considerably, from 6.2 years in 2014 to 2.6 years 

in 2017, due mainly to the closure of old projects (Education III and Health II). There are three ongoing 

operations in the agricultural sector, namely the Rice Value Chain Development Project – PDCV-Riz (UA 

4.19 million), the Study on the Revival of the Cotton-Textile Sector (UA 0.35 million) and the Emergency 

Assistance for Fall Armyworm Control (UA 0.73 million). 

2.7.2 The Agricultural and Rural Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project (PRESAR) financed by the 

Bank to the tune of UA 5.8 million, which was completed in 2012, rehabilitated/developed 3 800 hectares 

                                                 
5  The Employment Impact Assessment of the Job Saving Plan (PES) conducted by AfDB in 2018 showed that agricultural sector investments have 

a significant multiplier effect on employment (every UA 1 million invested creates at least 282 direct and indirect jobs). This sector has the most 

significant impact on the poorest quintile and helps to increase the number of people in the middle class.

of lowlands and mangroves, and provided support for the development of 460 hectares of market 

gardening areas. The project completion report prepared in February 2014 rated the project performance 

as satisfactory (score of 3.12 on 4), despite its implementation in a difficult socio-political context. In 

addition, the PDCV-Riz initiated in 2017 envisaged the development of 470 hectares of lowlands and 

mangroves, and 19 hectares of women’s market gardening areas equipped with solar-powered pumps and 

the construction of access roads, markets, input stores, product storage and conservation areas. Thus, the 

two projects funded by the Bank have significantly increased the land area available for cultivation (about 

5 000 hectares), improved agricultural production (rice and market garden products), increased income, 

and opened up and integrated production areas into the market economy. Lessons from these experiences 

are that the implementation of an inclusive participatory approach to infrastructure development, together 

with a mechanism for supporting grassroots actors, offer genuine opportunities for improving food 

security and farmers’ income. PACVEAR will also focus on rural entrepreneurship, which is an 

innovative approach adopted to boost agricultural sector growth and professionalisation. 

2.7.3  The project is also based on the conclusions of the mid-term review of the Bank’s Country 

Strategy and Programme in Guinea-Bissau for the period 2015–2019 conducted by IDEV in September 

2018, which recommends that the Bank should improve the quality of its portfolio, supervise operations 

more effectively, build the capacity of government technical services, select local operators/implementing 

partners based on objective criteria, better mainstream gender particularly by involving community 

leaders in raising awareness on gender equity and equality in agricultural development and, lastly, make 

project outcomes and impacts more sustainable. 

These recommendations have been taken into account by: (i) improving the quality of project design 

through the involvement of the PDCV-Riz project team designated by the PACVEAR 

coordination/management unit, formulating and analysing the relevance of available engineering studies 

on irrigation schemes; (ii) setting up an internal monitoring committee to supervise the project (twice a 

year); (iii) planning government technical service capacity-building activities; (iv) involving sector 

leaders in the selection of beneficiary sites and infrastructure management; (v) building the technical 

capacity of management committee members in infrastructure maintenance with the participation of 

SMEs; (vi) assessing implementing partners and developing new selection criteria; (vii) establishing an 

effective results-based project monitoring and evaluation mechanism, and building the project team’s 

capacity in monitoring and evaluation; and (viii) mainstreaming the gender dimension in all project 

components by improving production capacity, rice and market garden product conservation, building the 

capacity of women and youths, improving product processing and marketing capacity, and raising 

awareness for behaviour change. 

2.7.4  Final design and BDs for sites for the development of irrigation schemes (with total or partial 

irrigation water control) are available (12 out of 13 lowlands covering about 560 hectares, or 85% of the 

area to be developed). These studies were analysed during project preparation/appraisal missions and used 

as a basis for estimating investments in the irrigation schemes envisaged under the project. Once the loan 

agreement is signed, the PDCV-Riz team will start adapting the BDs to Bank standard BDs and launch 

bid invitations for works, thus helping to comply with timeframes. Standard plans for storage warehouses 

and vaccination yards are also available. 

2.7.5  To select local partners responsible for coordinating and organising producers around value 

chains and supporting young economic project promoters, PACVEAR solicited the services of 

experienced local NGOs that have a satisfactory working relationship with the Bank or other partners. 

Agreements and protocols specifying their roles and expected outcomes will be concluded with these 

entities. 

The NGOs concerned are APRODEL (Bafata), ADPP (Oio), ADIC-Nafaia (Gabu) and COAJOQ 

(Cacheu). APRODEL and ADPP are currently involved in PDCV-Riz and will be maintained. ADIC-

Nafaia satisfactorily implemented many activities on behalf of several partners, including FAO, the 

European Union and the World Bank. It is currently supervising the beneficiaries of 500 hectares of 

lowlands in Gabu Region. COAJOQ, which is based in Canchungo Division in Cacheu Region, is 

involved in implementing the European Union-funded Integrated Project to Revitalise the Private Sector 

in Cacheu Region. It is currently collaborating with 37 local producer associations with 1 850 members, 



 

10 

50% of them women practising market gardening. It also participates in the training of youths in 

agricultural mechanisation within an associative and sustainable context. 

2.8 Key Performance Indicators 

2.8.1  A gender-specific baseline situation will be established to examine the context, the level of 

indicators to be informed and other relevant parameters before project start-up. This will help to regularly 

assess the progress made, particularly in terms of outcomes and impact. Special emphasis will be laid on 

targeting those parameters that can be monitored and collected internally, and others specifically related 

to women and youths (women- and youth-disaggregated data). It will be necessary to analyse youth 

employment, salt flats and climate change issues in the current project area. 

The monitoring/evaluation specialist will monitor and evaluate project activities and results-based logical 

framework indicators internally, in close collaboration with technical experts (infrastructure engineer, 

employment promotion specialist and value chain expert) and project partners, including support NGOs. 

2.8.2  The key performance indicators that will be monitored based on the baseline scenario include: 

(i) surface area of lowlands developed with partial irrigation water control for rice; (ii) rice-growing areas 

developed with full irrigation water control; (iii) market gardening areas developed; (iv) number of short-

cycle livestock units promoted by gender; (v) infrastructure developed and operated (number of markets 

commissioned, kilometres of feeder roads developed, stores for storage of produce built, etc.); (vi) level 

of additional production (tonnes) and crop yields (t/ha); (vii) number of farmers (including women) per 

type of facility; (viii) number of demonstration units (DUs); (ix) number of structured producer 

organisations and facility management committees established; (x) growth level of farmers’ income, 

including those of women and youths; (xi) number of jobs created for youths and women through 

entrepreneurial initiatives and number of young entrepreneurs trained, incubated and installed; (xii) 

number of producers, processors and traders trained and organised; (xiii) level of involvement of women 

in decision-making bodies and their rate of access to post-development land; (xiv) number of processing 

units established and allocated (including for women); and (xv) number of nutrition activities supported, 

number of school canteens supported and level of impact on food and nutrition security. 

2.8.3  All indicators selected for the project will be aligned on those selected for PNIA II and will help 

to enhance the performance of the agricultural sector in Guinea-Bissau. The Bank’s various supervision 

missions and periodic progress reports will reflect the level of achievement of the indicators. 

 

III Project Feasibility 

3.1 Financial and Economic Performance 

Table 3.1: Key Financial and Economic Data  

NPV (8%) XOF 20 944 million 

EIRR (baseline scenario) 16.9% 

 

3.1.1 The project financial and economic analysis was carried out based on the cost/benefit of 

additional cash flows from the two priority sector crop (rice and market gardening) and livestock (small 

ruminants, broilers and pigs) entrepreneurial production models. The detailed assumptions of the financial 

and economic analysis, the tables of farming models (the baseline and “with project” situations) and the 

financial and economic flows are presented in Annex B7 of Volume 2. The results of the financial and 

economic analysis show that PACVEAR is financially and economically profitable. 

3.1.2 Financial performance: the additional income from various farming models adopted are as 

follows: (i) farms benefiting from the development of 364 ha of lowlands with partial irrigation water 

control (rainy season rice cultivation) with an income of  XOF 0.237 million/ha; (ii) farms benefiting from 

the development of 296 ha of lowlands with full irrigation water control (double-cropping of rice and 

market garden products) with an estimated income of XOF 1.680 million/ha; (iii) 60 ha of market 

gardening areas for women (rainy season and off-season crops) with an income of XOF 5.867 million/ha; 

(iv) pig farms (introduction of 1 genitor boar for 3 sows for 30 beneficiaries) with an income of XOF 8.22 

million/beneficiary in peak year; (v) poultry farms (broiler chickens) with an average income of XOF 0.38 



 

11 

million/beneficiary; (vi) small ruminant farms (2 genitors and 8 female) ) with  an average income of XOF 

2.98 million/beneficiary. The additional income generated by the project will contribute to increasing 

overall value added, hence its contribution to agricultural GDP. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) 

is estimated at 14.8% for an NPV, at the opportunity cost of capital 8%, of XOF 20.11 billion, which 

reflects a significant result. 

3.1.3 Economic performance:  the basic economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is 16.9% for a NPV, 

at the opportunity cost of capital 8%, of XOF 20.944 billion, and the cost/benefit ratio (CBR) is 2.1. This 

amount is significant, especially as some of the benefits could not be taken into account in calculations 

owing to lack of data for assessing them, notably the improvement of living conditions and food and 

nutrition security thanks to increased income, food availability, the impacts of watershed and 

environmental protection actions, capacity building for other types of economic activities carried out by 

beneficiaries and multiplier effects on sector players (suppliers of inputs, equipment, services, etc.).  

Sensitivity tests were conducted taking into account a possible increase in costs (+10%), a decrease in 

agricultural production in case farmers do not adopt the proposed farming techniques (-10%) and a 

reduction in benefits (-10%) caused by plant and animal species, coupled with an increase in investment 

costs (+10%).  The respective IRRs for sensitivity tests are 15.0%; 14.8% and 13.1%. Other sensitivity 

tests were conducted taking into account assumptions of flow variability resulting from endogenous 

variables, and are presented in Annex B7 of Volume 2. 

3.1.4 The other project economic impacts can be summarised as follows: (i) the upstream effects of 

additional income on service providers (contractors, suppliers, NGOs, consulting firms); (ii) the 

downstream effects of additional income generation on producers, traders and processors who are mostly 

women and youths; (iii) a decrease in foreign exchange costs in the trade balance, thanks to the significant 

reduction in rice importation; and (iv) the impact on wealth creation in the country owing to an increase 

in GDP resulting from the generation of additional value added. Project benefits for households will 

improve the nutrition of vulnerable groups (children, women of childbearing age and the elderly), ease 

the hardship of the tasks of agricultural workers, especially women, reduce the impact of monetary and 

non-monetary poverty, and strengthen the livelihoods and the resilience of PACVEAR target groups to 

food insecurity and the effects of climate change, among others. 

3.2. Environmental and Social Impact 

3.2.1  Environment: PACVEAR is classified under Environmental Category 2 according to the 

Bank’s Environmental Safeguards Policy. It underwent a strategic environmental and social assessment 

(SESA) and has an environmental and social management master plan (ESMP)6. The Competent 

Environmental Assessment Authority (Autoridad de Avaliação Ambiental Competente - AAAC) of 

Guinea-Bissau has also classified the project under Environmental Category B, which is equivalent to 

Environmental Category 2 of the Bank's safeguards, in accordance with Law No. 10/2010 of 24 September 

2010 relating to environmental assessment.  

3.2.2 PACVEAR’s infrastructure will not generate significant environmental and social impacts.  

However, there will be a few negative impacts during the lowland development and infrastructure 

construction phase. These will include sound emanations, increase in dust in the air, earthworks, risk of 

STI/HIV/AIDS transmission during the construction phase, and the outbreak of malaria and waterborne 

diseases during the operations phase. These impacts will be relatively moderate and limited to receiving 

environments with low ecological sensitivity. The dispersal of the facilities across the three regions in the 

northern and eastern part of the country will also reduce their impacts, which will be limited in time and 

mitigated by appropriate measures. The project impact area does not contain protected areas or gazetted 

forests7.  

                                                 
6  Engineering and environmental studies on irrigation scheme development sites are available. However, the sites for support facilities (water points, 

rural roads, storage warehouses, etc.) are not known at this stage. If necessary, they will be the subject of environmental impact assessments to be 

carried out by a private service provider at project start-up and submitted to the Bank. Against this backdrop, it was decided that a strategic 

environmental and social assessment (SESA) should be conducted and an environment and social management master plan (ESMP) prepared. 
7  Guinea-Bissau has no gazetted forest. The relics of primary forests are gradually being replaced by mono-specific cashew nut plantations, which 

considerably reduce biodiversity in these three regions.

3.2.3  Project facilities will not entail any displacement of people or restriction of their access to 

property or livelihoods. Deeds of transfer and operation will be issued to farmers’ organisations (FOs) 

that will act as representatives of beneficiaries. This will lead to secure land tenure for the sites to be 

developed. Consultation frameworks comprising traditional authorities, landowners, support/assistance 

organisations and beneficiary organisations will be established for the issuance of an operation permit in 

the form of a deed of gift to beneficiaries (at least 30% to women and 20% to youths) by land right holders. 

To ensure the sustainable operation of the facilities built, sensitisation and information meetings will be 

held, followed by a landowner and land right owner identification phase that will lead to the signing of a 

deed/declaration of gift by village landowners, endorsed by the village chief, the mayor of the municipality 

or even the governor of the region concerned. Most of the facilities to be built by the project will be a 

concrete response to priority development problems (lack of irrigation water, lack of infrastructure to 

support agricultural value chains, construction of access roads, access to markets, etc.). 

3.2.4  Impact mitigation measures to be implemented before, during and after construction works as 

well as the improvement activities envisaged (protection of facilities, fruit tree planting, etc.) will 

strengthen project environmental compliance. Project environmental management activities will be 

coordinated by PACVEAR’s environmental expert who, under a framework agreement, will be backed 

by the Competent Environmental Assessment Authority (AAAC) for better management of the 

environmental aspects of the project. The project will also use the services of environmental focal points 

(EFPs) in the Regional Directorates of Forestry and Wildlife to conduct environmental monitoring during 

the implementation phase. These workers will undergo training in environmental and social assessment, 

and will receive the support and permanent assistance of the AAAC in carrying out the various activities. 

3.2.5  The budget allocated for environmental monitoring and evaluation is UA 162 000. This amount 

will cover the development of specific ESIAs and ESMPs for some sites (provisions) by an external 

consulting firm, the implementation of the mitigation measures contained in them, campaigns to raise 

beneficiary awareness and institutional support to the AAAC.  The ESMP summary is presented in Annex 

B8 of Volume 2. The environmental and social management framework and its summary were approved 

by the Safeguards and Compliance Department (SNSC), and posted on the Bank's website on 13 June 

2019. 

3.2.6  Climate change: a climate change risk assessment was conducted for the project using the 

Climate Safeguards System (CSS). The project is classified under Climatic Category 2 and may be 

vulnerable to climate risks. Practical risk management and adaptation options will be incorporated into 

project design and implementation plans. 

3.2.7  There is no known history of severe drought in the project area. In the course of the rainy season, 

rice farms may sometimes become flooded in places during periods of normal rainfall. This phenomenon 

is primarily the result of sand silting in the natural canals that serve as outlets to the production sites. To 

address the impacts of climate change, the project will adopt measures prescribed by the National Action 

Programme for Adaptation to Climate Change (PANA) following participatory assessments of the 

country’s vulnerability and adaptation to climate change, based on the agricultural sector diagnoses. The 

project will fully align its activities with PANA’s strategic orientations by developing lowlands and 

horticulture, supporting school canteens and establishing school gardens with a view to strengthening the 

food and nutrition security of the beneficiaries. The project will use a holistic approach that is designed 

to eliminate constraints at all levels of rice and horticultural value chains. Specifically in horticulture 

areas, PACVEAR will introduce solar technology and the plot water-saving system to control water and 

reduce water extraction.  

3.2.8  For better management of occasional flooding in rice fields, the natural canals of the target sites 

will be drained and resized to allow for the evacuation of any excess flow in the rice-growing lowlands 

concerned. To prevent silting in rice fields, which is the primary cause of flooding in the lowlands, bunds 

consolidated with soil-fixing plants will be built opposite slopes with strong runoff. The project will also 

make it easier for producers to acquire certified seeds by putting in place a programme, in conjunction 

with the National Institute of Agricultural Research (INPA) and seed multiplier organisations. It will also 

introduce the rational use of fertiliser to improve yields and, hence, agricultural productivity. The related 

agricultural infrastructure will be set up and designed with additional measures for adapting to climate 

change, to make them more resilient.

3.2.9 Gender: the Value Chains, Agricultural and Rural Entrepreneurship Support Project (PACVEAR) 

takes into account all the components of the gender dimension through the following activities: 

- Improvement of rice and market garden produce production and conservation 
capacity: the project will facilitate women’s access to land by allocating 30% of the rice 

fields developed and 90% of market gardening areas to women. The risk of limited access 

to land by women and youths has been taken into account as this concern will be an integral 

part of the intervention criteria, and the land issue will be systematically clarified before 

any operation (prior authorisation, land negotiation by the competent authorities, etc.).  

- Capacity building: the skills of women and youths will be developed through training in 
the use of improved seeds and rice farming, market gardening and cereal farming 

techniques.  

- Improvement of product processing and marketing capacity: the project will provide 
women’s groups with equipment for rice processing and husking (rice parboiling) and 

processing into by-products. This will lighten their workload and improve the quality of 

rice produced.  

- Awareness-raising for behaviour change: awareness and communication campaigns 
will be organised to improve the nutritional status of under-five children and pregnant 

women. The selection of themes will vary according to the needs of each project area: for 

instance, nutrition and health (family planning and reproductive health, HIV/AIDS, etc.), 

education (education of the girl child), conflict management, gender and gender-based 

violence, etc. 

Gender categorisation: PACVEAR is classified under Gender Category 2 according to the “Gender 

Marker System”. The gender analysis and action plan for implementing gender promotion and women's 

empowerment activities are presented in Annex B10 of Volume 2. 

Gender promotion activities concern: rice-growing areas (30%), market gardening areas for women 

(90%), processing equipment, drying units, promotion of women-headed small- and medium-size 

enterprises (at least 30%), promotion of gender equity and equality within farmers' organisations through 

workshops, training of members of women and mixed farmers’ organisations in farming techniques, 

leadership and gender, experience-sharing trips and equitable access to socio-economic infrastructure 

(feeder roads, storage warehouses, etc.). The budget allocated for the gender dimension is estimated at 

UA 2.786 million, i.e. approximately 27% of the total budget (cf. Annex B10, Volume 2). 

3.2.10  Nutrition: horticultural production on approximately 60 hectares of land will contribute to 

improving the nutrition of beneficiary households and have a positive impact on the health of the most 

vulnerable segments of the population, namely children and women of childbearing age. The project will 

develop initiatives to improve the hygiene and nutritional quality of food consumed by the people, 

especially women and children. It will also collaborate with RESAN for the pilot development of six 

school canteens and six school gardens. Additional peak year production of horticultural and animal 

products will contribute to making people’s food and nutrition better. Activities aimed at informing, 

raising awareness and educating on nutrition, hygiene and the prevention of the resurgence of waterborne 

diseases will also contribute to improving people’s health and nutrition. To enhance market access for 

processed products, PACVEAR will sensitise and support processing units/SMEs in upgrading 

parcelling/packaging and labelling according to standards. The budget allocated for nutrition support 

measures is UA 123 000. 

3.2.11  Social issues: the envisaged infrastructure and support for rice farming and market gardening 

will help to reduce the problems of low productivity and product conservation, and to better structure 

value chains for the benefit of beneficiaries. The project will pay particular attention to women and youths 

who are very active in rural areas, but often lack adequate training and resources. The development of 

market gardening areas primarily for women will enhance their empowerment and promote a more 

balanced diet in households. Specific support will also target women and young people in the development 

of rural entrepreneurship. In addition, training in organisational development and the structuring of FOs 

and producer unions will improve their roles in local governance and decision-making bodies, as well as 

the monitoring of the outcomes of activities promoted within such organisations.  



 

14 

The rehabilitation of feeder roads, the construction of markets and storage warehouses, and the setting up 

of small processing units will help to reduce post-harvest losses, increasing the availability of food 

products and household income. Improving access to socio-economic infrastructure will contribute to 

easing daily tasks and allow beneficiaries to engage in income-generating activities such as market 

gardening, seed production, poultry and pig farming, as well as agricultural product processing and 

marketing, including small-scale breeding.  

The jobs that will be created through the promotion of rural entrepreneurship among young people and women 

(close to 2 000 people targeted) and the establishment of many enterprises by this population segment will 

contribute to developing a business culture among people proposing projects aimed at increasing income in 

the project area, and fostering the creation of growth poles that can reduce youth urban migration, including 

attempts to immigrate.  

3.2.12  Involuntary resettlement: PACVEAR’s activities will not lead to any people displacement or 

restriction of access to property or means of livelihood. 

IV. Project Implementation 

4.1. Implementation Arrangements 

4.1.1  PACVEAR will be under the supervisory authority of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural 

Development (MADR). It will be attached to the General Directorate of Agriculture. Project piloting and 

supervision activities will be carried out by the PDCV-Riz steering committee set up by Decree No. 

1/2018 of 4 January 2018, which will be amended by ministry decision, at project start-up to take its 

specificities into account. The committee will meet once a year in ordinary session. The chairmanship 

will be ensured by the Minister MADR or his representative and the secretariat by the coordinator of the 

PMU. Also, a technical committee for monitoring the project will be set up. It will meet every three 

months to monitor project implementation, quarterly review of the activity report, as well as the technical 

program and the quarterly budget, and identify opportunities and constraints to improve project outcomes.  

4.1.2  PACVEAR will be coordinated by the PDCV-Riz Management Unit whose mandate will end in 

December 2020. This team satisfactorily implemented PDCV-Riz projects and, previously, PRESAR. It 

was also involved in PACVEAR preparation and appraisal. The PMU will be headed by the Coordinator, 

supported by the following sTSFf: an administrative and financial officer, a procurement specialist, a rural 

engineer, and an agronomist specialised in value chains, agricultural and rural entrepreneurship, and 

support sTSFf (drivers, secretaries, messengers, etc.). The team will be maintained and consolidated with 

the competitive recruitment of an environmental monitoring/evaluation specialist, a rural infrastructure 

specialist (technical assistance), a procurement specialist and an accountant. Apart from the fiduciary team 

(the Coordinator, the administrative and financial officer, the procurement specialist, the accountant, etc.) 

that will operate from project head office in Bissau, all other experts will be based at the field office in 

Bafata. 

4.1.3 The project intervention strategy will be based primarily on subcontracting. Under the 

agreements signed with the project, the national technical services (and their decentralised entities) will 

be strongly involved as project owner, works controller and supervisor, as well as executing agency, 

service provider or project manager. Private service providers (contractors, suppliers, consulting firms, 

individual consultants, etc.) will be recruited on a competitive basis and linked to the project by contracts. 

4.1.4  Applicable procurement policy and framework: the procurement of goods (including non-

consultancy services), works and consultancy services financed by the Bank under the project will be 

done in accordance with the Procurement Framework for Bank Group-funded Operations approved in 

October 2015, as well as the provisions set forth in the Financing Agreement. Specifically, procurement 

will be done in accordance with Bank Procurement Methods and Procedures (BPMPs), using relevant 

standard bidding documents (SBDs) for goods and works contracts as well as consultancy services for 

which BPMPs are considered most appropriate. An analysis of Guinea-Bissau’s procurement system as 

presented in Technical Annex B5 of this report showed that the procurement risk is substantial. As a result, 

the Bank’s Procurement Methods and Procedures will be used for PACVEAR’s implementation. A 

capacity building action plan will be discussed with the Guinea-Bissau authorities to enable the use, in 



 

15 

the short term, of the national procurement system following the conduct of reforms identified as 

necessary. 

4.1.5 Procurement risk and capacity assessment (PRCA): to take project specificities into account, 

the Bank assessed: (i) country, sector and project risks; and (ii) the executing agency’s capacity. The 

outcomes of these assessments revealed a substantial procurement risk level, and guided the decision to 

use BPMPs for all project activities. Appropriate risk mitigation measures have been included in the 

PERCA Action Plan presented in Annex B5, volume 2.  

4.1.6 Procurement arrangements: PACVEAR’s management will be under the responsibility of the 

PDCV-Riz actual management team. This institutional arrangement is the result of the desire to build on 

the achievements of the key sTSFf of this ongoing Bank-funded project. It is worth pointing out that the 

team had already implemented other Bank projects, including PRESAR. Support from a procurement 

expert was deemed necessary in view of the workload that will have to be added to the procurement 

activities of PDCV-Riz. The current team will be strengthened with the competitive recruitment of an 

environmental monitoring/evaluation specialist, a rural infrastructure specialist (technical assistance), a 

procurement specialist and an accountant. All experts will sign a performance contract that will be subject 

to an annual performance review. 

4.1.7  Financial management: the project implementation team will be responsible for the 

administrative, financial and accounting management of PACVEAR. The team will monitor and supervise 

project implementation, and should have sufficient technical, human and material resources to set up an 

efficient internal control system and an acceptable financial management system, particularly through 

proper and exhaustive recording of all transactions carried out during the project cycle, the safekeeping 

of financial information and assets, and information on and audit of the resources provided.  

The assessment of the PDCV-Riz implementation unit’s capacity revealed that it has the minimum 

capability and tools for proper recording of funds and accountability. However, given the unit’s duty to 

manage many projects simultaneously, it shall be strengthened with additional human resources, 

particularly an accountant experienced in managing development projects implemented using a private 

accrual accounting system. The accountant shall be recruited through open call for applications based on 

Bank rules and procedures. The recruitment will be monitored by the Bank's Fiduciary Services and 

Inspection Department (SNFI), which shall validate both the integrity of the process and the accountant's 

qualifications. 

The project administrative, accounting and financial procedures manual has already exist in PDCV-Riz. 

This document should be reviewed to take into account the multi-project management dimension of the 

executing agency and submitted to the Bank for approval. The manual will take PACVEAR’s components 

and categories into account. It will also include the general, budgetary and analytical accounting plans, 

the accounting principles and methods, as well as all applicable posting details.  

An integrated accounting and financial management software is also available. It should be reconfigured 

to make it multi-project, multi-user, multi-currency and multi-donor, thereby enabling the production of 

general, analytical and budgetary data required for financial and accounting monitoring, i.e. for producing 

financial statements by expenditure component, category and activity; and by source of financing for 

resources. At the minimum, the software should have the following modules: (i) general accounting; (ii) 

budget management; (iii) contract management; (iv) tangible assets management; (v) financial 

monitoring, etc. It will also be configured to have the three (3) levels of registration, validation and 

approval. At the end of the year, the software should help to obtain summary annual financial statements 

comprising a table of resource applications for the year, together with a balance sheet, a statement of 

special account reconciliation, and notes to the financial statements, among others. It will also allow for 

the monitoring of budget execution. 

Accounts will be kept based on the private accrual accounting system and using an integrated software 

adapted to development project management. The accounting plan will be drawn up based on the 

accounting standards of the revised Uniform Act of the Organization for the Harmonisation of African 

Business Law (OHADA) in force in Guinea-Bissau.   

Lastly, the project will produce an annual work programme and budget (AWPB) that will take into account 

all funding from all partners, as well as quarterly financial management reports based on the 



 

16 

implementation of the annual work programme and budget, and appended to the quarterly progress reports 

submitted to the Bank, in which a clear analysis must be made between budget forecasts and executions 

for the quarter. Any gaps should be analysed and explained.  

4.1.8  Disbursements: the Bank’s resources will be disbursed according to its rules of procedure, 

notably the disbursement manual. Disbursements will be made through the following three methods 

presented in detail in the project Appraisal Report (Annex B4 Volume 2): (i) the special account method; 

(ii) the direct payment method; and (iii) the reimbursement method. 

4.1.9 Auditing: the internal audit function as well as the PACVEAR internal control system will be 

assessed once or twice yearly by the General Inspectorate of Finance (IGF), depending on project risk 

assessment. An agreement will be prepared for that purpose and submitted for the Bank's no-objection 

opinion. An institutional support in the form of IT software and hardware will also be provided to the 

IGF. The external audit of project accounts will be conducted by an independent audit firm acceptable to 

the Bank and based on terms of reference agreed beforehand with the Bank. The recruitment of the 

external auditor will be in accordance with the Bank’s rules and procedures for the use of consultants. The 

auditor will be required to submit his/her report within six months following the close of the financial 

year audited. 

 

4.2. Monitoring 

4.2.1  Monitoring mechanisms: the project’s monitoring and evaluation system will be designed in 

relation to the expected impacts, outcomes and outputs contained in the project logical framework. The 

system will be participatory and will provide regular relevant information on performance and impact 

indicators as well as on the implementation of activities scheduled. A baseline situation will be 

established, based on the identified and selected sites many of which have already been studied. The 

monitoring and evaluation framework will systematically include gender-disaggregated data. 

Furthermore, targeted surveys will be conducted to better understand issues relating to income, food 

security, nutrition, job creation, gender mainstreaming, vulnerability and resilience. The information 

collected will be fed into the computerised monitoring and evaluation system to capture the actual values 

of project activities and inputs, and gauge project outcomes and impacts. In turn, these will be recorded 

in periodic progress reports highlighting the project implementation status and the achievement of 

outcomes.  

The Bank and MADR will supervise project implementation through a reinforced internal monitoring 

technical committee. Given the country’s weak capacity and fragility, the Bank, as part of its new 

development and business delivery model, will closely monitor all activities, especially by fielding 

periodic supervision missions (twice yearly).

4.3. Governance 

4.3.1  Guinea-Bissau’s political, economic and social governance indicators remain mixed, in spite of 

the progress made in recent years. As regards political governance, it is necessary to find lasting solutions 

to possible conflicts and establish mechanisms for ensuring justice. Guinea-Bissau’s governance and anti-

corruption performance is low, due generally to frequent political and institutional crises. In 2018, the 

country was ranked 42nd out of 54 countries in the Mo Ibrahim Index of African Governance (and 
particularly the 42th in the rule of law sub-indicator), which is a slight improvement over the last three 

years. In the area of economic governance, particularly in public financial management, the country’s 
performance has deteriorated because of the crisis and the capacity to mobilise domestic resources remains 

weak, as noted in the Bank’s analysis on the governance of projects approved in 2015 and in the 2016 
Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) scores.  

4.3.2  As part of PACVEAR’s implementation, and in an effort to mitigate the risks inherent in the 

weaknesses and instability of the administration and improve project quality-at-entry, it was decided to 

maintain the PMU of the ongoing PDCV-Riz since the unit is already conversant with Bank procedures, 

and to build on existing implementation studies. Moreover, although progress has been made in aligning 

the public procurement system with WAEMU directives, the bureaucracy characterising the procurement 

system is still one of the main challenges in implementing development programmes. Regarding 

procurement, operational arrangements were adopted to address the weaknesses noted. 

4.3.3  With regard to professional organisation in Guinea-Bissau, much remains to be done to promote 

effective rural stakeholder representative institutions. Producers are organised within professional 

agricultural organisations, including the National Association of Farmers of Guinea Bissau (ANAG) and 

the National Consultation Framework of the Farmers’ and Agricultural Producers’ Organization of 

Guinea-Bissau (QNCOCPA/GB). In addition, due to lack of resources, the activities of these organisations 

have had limited impact on their members, particularly in producer management and training. Many local, 

cultural, youth and women's associations are also present, and a large number of producer groups have 

been set up, with some of them already well organised. They are indispensable relays for support to small 

producers and the professionalisation of farmers. Nevertheless, the development of these associations is 

facing various constraints, including: (i) legislation that is ill-adapted to the current conditions of 

producing, processing and marketing products; (ii) difficulties in obtaining legal recognition; (iii) lack of 

training of managers in management and facilitation; (iv) lack of access to technical and market 

information; and (v) poor knowledge of legislation, particularly as regards the taxation system. 

PACVEAR is intended to better structure and organise producers and value chains stakeholders by 

strengthening and empowering community entities that represent the target beneficiaries. 

4.4. Sustainability 

4.4.1  The sustainability of project investments relates mostly to the capacity of the beneficiaries to 

ensure infrastructure maintenance and management regularly and over time. Irrigation, pastoral and 

support infrastructure management committees will be set up prior to the start of the construction of each 

facility, and are expected to facilitate community mobilisation and participation. Management committee 

members will receive organisational, technical and facility management support to enable them to 

supervise the work of contractors, in collaboration with the project team and the works control firm. The 

involvement of these committees in close works monitoring and acceptance will enhance their ownership 

of infrastructure built, thus resulting in greater sustainability. The project will also organise exchange 

visits to other facilities by management committee members.  

4.4.2  The project will build the capacity of young local artisans in routine infrastructure and equipment 

maintenance (cleaning of canals, maintenance of pumps, cleaning of irrigation basins, etc.) and provide 

them with kits for these operations. These local artisans could operate as maintenance service providers 

and will be easy to mobilise in case of breakdown.  

Beneficiaries, particularly producer groups, farmers' organisations and management committees, will also 

be structured, in collaboration with technical partners. The managerial, accounting and logistical capacity 

of these entities will be built to enable them to continue to provide services over time. Project-driven 

development of local expertise will promote long-lasting technical capacity, thus guaranteeing 

infrastructure sustainability.

4.5. Risk Management 

The potential risks and proposed mitigation measures are presented in the table below. 

Risks Risk Level Mitigating Measures 

Political instability, due to a difficult 

economic situation  

High Contribution to improving socio-economic and 

environmental resilience for greater stability.

Moderate 

Training of producers in plant disease management and 

ecologically appropriate use of pesticides. 

Low capacity of implementation partners 

and contractors, resulting in poor 

performance and delays in project 

implementation 

Moderate 

Careful selection of implementation partners and 

contractors. 

Close control of partners and works contractors by the PIU 

and consulting firms, the technical monitoring committee, 

the beneficiary management committee and the PMU. 

4.6. Knowledge Building 

PACVEAR will contribute to the development and consolidation of producer expertise.  Adopting an 

inclusive approach, it will enable young people and women to develop technical and entrepreneurial 

capacity by settling on land with modern farming infrastructure and resources. The project will also help 

to generate knowledge that will be used to create many jobs by upgrading incubation centres that could 

train and support young people wishing to engage in agribusiness. Moreover, it will support the Food and 

Nutrition Security Information System (SISSAN) in collecting and processing data that will be used to 

formulate sound sector policies. Furthermore, the project’s specific contribution to structuring the seed 

sector with the introduction of Technologies for African Agricultural Transformation (TAAT) will 

generate knowledge that will enhance production techniques, thus increasing production. The 

establishment of demonstration units, the dissemination of best practice, the introduction of solar 

technology into dewatering and processing systems, and the preservation of agricultural products will 

further strengthen the sector. 

PACVEAR will support MADR in preparing strategic and sector discussion themes through external 

service providers. The themes  include: (i) agricultural sector institutional study; (ii) diagnostic of the 

performance of youth incubation centres (ADPP and COAJOQ) and support for their evolution into pilot 

incubation centres; (iii) youth agricultural and rural entrepreneurship promotion strategy: potentials and 

constraints; (iv) support for updating legislation and veterinary regulations; and (v) support for the 

collection, processing and dissemination of data on the Food and Nutrition Security Information System 

(SISSAN).  

As regards communication and visibility of project actions, there will be: (i) awareness-raising and 

information dissemination through various communication channels (community radios, media 

programmes, website, films, etc.); and (ii) promotion of innovative youth and women's employability 

actions and activities to build the resilience of vulnerable groups to food and nutrition insecurity. 

V. Legal Framework

IV 

Annex IV: Fragility Context 

1.  Fragility in Guinea-Bissau is reflected by the gap between the State and the society, with weak 

State institutions and a weak State presence outside of Bissau, which renders the State ineffective in the 

eyes of many citizens. Furthermore, the military is strongly engaged in political and economic spheres, 

the justice sector is weak and the economy is undiversified and captured by elite interests. Guinea-Bissau’s 

fragility factors, which considerably impede the development of its institutions and inhabitants, can be 

summed up in five key areas: (i) an endemic lack of governance and functional institutions, fuelled by 

political instability and elite capture; (ii) a dysfunctional and politicised security sector; (iii) a captured 

and undiversified shock-prone economy; ( (iv) a gap between urban and rural areas resulting in acute lack 

of infrastructure and services; and (v) lack of investment in human development and human capital.  

2.  In Guinea-Bissau, poverty is both a symptom and a cause of political instability and violence. 

Decades of political instability and weak capacity of social and economic institutions have created an 

environment that undermines development and makes the country one of the poorest in the world. The 

dominant role of the cashew sector is a key structural challenge in Guinea-Bissau. Cashew is the most 

important agricultural product in the country, accounting for more than 90% of total exports. About 80% 

of the population relies on cashew nuts as the main source of income, which they exchange for rice (staple 

food) or other consumer goods. Although Guinea-Bissau has the potential to produce its own rice, most 

of its rice fields are not under cultivation, and the country imports most of its rice. 

The exploitation of natural resources, including agriculture (cashew), fisheries and forestry, is 

affected by rent-seeking behaviour because of weak controls and lack of monitoring. By limiting the 

number of export licences, many sector decrees issued by the Council of Ministers in 2017 also reflect 

weak governance and rent-seeking comportment in the public sector, particularly with regard to cashew. 

3. The weakness of State institutions and the lack of State presence outside of Bissau are a deciding 

factor of fragility, which has rendered the State ineffective in providing services, thus creating mistrust 

between citizens and the State. Today, 40% of the population lives in Bissau, which enjoys greater access 

to public services and has a relatively low poverty rate, with 50% of its population living below the 

national poverty line (USD 2 a day). The national average of people living below the national poverty line 

is 70%, suggesting that 80-90% of Guinea-Bissau's poor people live in rural areas. The incidence of 

poverty in rural areas is higher in the north where most of the rural population is concentrated. The few 

local services (water, education and health care) are often provided by non-State actors. The lack of socio-

economic opportunities among youths may increase social unrest and riots. About 60% of Guinea-Bissau's 

population is under 25, has not benefited from a functional education system and stands a very slim chance 

of entering the formal economy which, in any case, offers very few jobs. 

4. In spite of the significant progress made over the past fifteen years, Guinea-Bissau's human 

development indicators are still among the lowest in the world. In 2017, Guinea-Bissau was ranked 178th 

in the Human Development Index. Guinea-Bissau's GDP per capita is USD 723 and life expectancy at 

birth is 57.8 years, or three years below the average of sub-Saharan African countries. The level of 

employment in the formal sector is low and youth unemployment is very high. Due to the precarious 

nature of Guinea-Bissau’s institutions and discriminatory traditional practices, women's access to services 

is quite limited, particularly in terms of education, as reflected in literacy rates below the national average. 

Women in Guinea-Bissau are disproportionately affected by human rights violations, especially sexual 

and gender-based violence, discrimination in the workplace, child marriage, etc. More than 48% of 

women have been subjected to genital mutilation despite the 2011 law banning the practice. 

5. These fragility factors notwithstanding, the country has sources of resilience and other factors 

capable of neutralising fragility drivers that the government, the Bank and other development actors 

should strengthen to prevent further instability. They include: (i) regional integration within regional 

organisations and West African regional markets; (ii) a vibrant civil society; and (iii) community 

solidarity. 



 

V 

6. PACVEAR will help to reduce fragility by applying the following measures during its design 

and implementation stages: (i) strengthen non-State actors such as grassroots associations, local NGOs 

and the private sector in terms of their economic and social commitments; (ii) strengthen dialogue with 

the Government of Guinea-Bissau, as well as with other TFPs to keep abreast of developments in the 

political and security situation, and factor political risks into the project's monitoring and evaluation 

system; (iii) ensure that the project takes account of social sensitivities by seeing to it that certain segments 

of the society are not left out and especially that gender equity is taken into account when making 

decisions related to access to land at community level; (iv) ensure that the project includes ancillary 

activities aimed at empowering the most vulnerable segments of society; (v) under the project, implement 

activities to raise awareness among and empower residents of the project area concerning good nutrition 

practices and ways of achieving food security; and (vi) contribute to the creation of sustainable jobs, 

especially for young people.

PROGRAMME SUMMARY 

General Overview: The Republic of Guinea covers an area of 245,857 km² and had an 

estimated population of about 11,555,061 in 2017, comprising 51.61% women and 48.39% 

men. The rural population, estimated at 64.41%, derives most of its income (79%) from 

agricultural activities. There is, however, a marked contrast between the country’s economic 

situation and its natural potential. In addition to its mineral wealth, there are significant surface 

water (188 km3) resources and 72 km3 of groundwater. Estimated arable land potential is 6.2 

million hectares, of which 25% are cultivated annually. According to 1993 estimates, there were 

70,000 km² of rich and varied grazing land composed of almost 350 fodder species. The country 

has about 300 km of coastline with significant artisanal and industrial fisheries potential. 

However, Guinea’s imports of fresh food products are valued at almost USD 745 million 

(2016), most of which can be produced locally, in particular, cereals with an import value of 

USD 339 million in 2016. 

In order to reverse this trend and boost sustainable development, the Government has launched 

many development initiatives on the basis of growth sources and lessons learned from past 

decades, including Vision 2040, reflected in the Plan for Economic and Social Development 

(PNDES).  The PNDES is being implemented through the National Agricultural Development 

Policy (PNDA) whose implementing instrument is the National Agricultural Investment, Food 

and Nutrition Security Plan (PNIASAN). PDZTA is the 1st phase of a programme of ten (10) 

agrihubs under the PNIASAN and is intended to strengthen economic activity in the Boké and 

Kankan regions, particularly in agriculture, livestock, fisheries, forestry, industry, mines, 

handicrafts, trade, catering, hotels, banks, etc. Over 80% of these activities are carried out in 

the informal sector. Cereal production is very important as well as market garden and food 

crops. These regions are considered to be cereal basins and provide real opportunities for the 

supply of maize, the manufacture of cattle and poultry feed but also of fortified cereals to reduce 

chronic malnutrition. The establishment of storage facilities and a processing zone for 

aggregating cereal products, in particular maize and even sesame, might boost the agricultural 

sector in these two regions that lack commercial and road infrastructure and have limited 

opportunities for reaching outlets. Other crops such as mangoes and cashew nuts are becoming 

increasingly important. Since there is no processing unit in the region, most of the output is 

exported as raw products. 

The Bank’s intervention will contribute to the development of two (2) major regions in Guinea 

with an administrative area of about 103,333 km², of which 31,186 hectares lie in the Boké 

Region with an arable land area of about 2,720,000 ha, of which 800,000 ha lie in the Boké 

Region alone.  The programme will cover about 110,000 ha throughout the entire programme 

area (PA) and have a significant impact on about 220,000 direct beneficiaries and 670,000 

indirect beneficiaries, 50.7% of whom will be women. 

Needs Assessment: The programme area covers the two (2) regions of Boké and Kankan, 

whose hydro-agricultural and socio-economic potential warrants the establishment of a 

production and processing system for agricultural products which constitute these regions’ 

potential.  The programme is based on the establishment of agro-parks for the upstream 

processing of production and to serve as outlets for agricultural products, thereby contributing 

to an all-round drop in imports of agro-food products whose volume and amounts are 

approaching worrisome levels.  

 



 

 

 

v 

In accordance with its strategic directions, the country will contribute to the processing of 

agricultural products while improving productivity and production in growth sectors, resulting 

in a reduction in the imports of various agro-food products, with as main outcome the 

transformation of Guinean agriculture and improvement of food and nutrition security. 

Bank’s Value Added:  The PDZTA-BK’s objective is to provide Guinea with support to   

implement its agricultural transformation process by promoting private investments by 

establishing conditions and implementing a wide range of incentive measures that will attract 

national and international private sector investors to the Boké and Kankan agro-industrial parks.  

These conditions and measures concern: (i) the implementation of measures likely to create an 

enabling environment for the establishment of agro-industrial enterprises in the parks; (ii) the 

establishment of long-term smart infrastructure to facilitate the installation of private operators, 

their operations and transactions linked to their activities; and (iii) improved operation of 

growth-bearing sectors. This innovative approach was proposed as the flagship programme of 

the Bank’s 2016-2025 ‘Feed Africa’ Strategy  known under the flagship’s programme name of 

‘Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zones’ (SAPZs). Its proposed approach is to increase 

private investment in the agricultural sector through the creation of favourable conditions by 

central government, an area in which the Bank has both experience and expertise. It can also 

mobilise its domestic financial resources as well as additional resources from its technical and 

financial partners and private banks on the basis of its Triple A rating. The Bank has also 

acquired experience in setting up such operations in Togo, Ethiopia, DRC, Zambia and 

Tanzania.  It will, therefore, be able to roll out this operation with every chance of success.  

Knowledge Building and Management: Implementation of the Special Agro-Industrial 

Processing Zones Development Project (PDZTA-BK) will help to build a body of knowledge 

that could be replicated throughout the programme to develop ten (10) agricultural development 

hubs in the country including those of Boké and Kankan. This will concern knowledge on: 

(i) the most effective way of working with the private sector, either on the basis of a PPP 

formula or in the form of a non-sovereign operation (NSO) or a combination of the two 

formulae ; (ii) a multi-sector approach involving the intervention of sectors such as transport, 

energy, water and sanitation, agribusiness, agriculture, communication (NICT), education, 

health and nutrition, employment and trade; (iii) a combination of: (a) two of the Bank’s 

strategies, namely ‘Feed Africa’  and ‘Jobs for Youth’ to enhance the skills of youth, and (b) at 

least  four (04) flagship programmes , namely, the Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zones 

(SAPZs), Technologies for African Agricultural Transformation (TAAT), Agricultural Value 

Chains (AVC), Post-Harvest Losses Reduction and ENABLE Youth programmes.  (iv) product 

processing, as a great challenge for which solutions will be sought under this programme; 

(v) employment in general and in the agricultural sector in particular, as a solution proposed in 

the Programme; and (vi) a contribution to the reduction of massive imports of agro-food 

products by the Continent, and by Guinea, in particular.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE MANAGEMENT OF THE BANK 

GROUP TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS ON A PROGRAMME TO DEVELOP 

THE BOKÉ AND KANKAN SPECIAL AGRO-INDUSTRIAL PROCESSING ZONES 

Management submits this report and its recommendation on a proposed ADF loan of UA 2.99 

million, an ADF grant of UA 2.94 million (including UA 331,461 from cancelled resources) 

and a TSF loan of UA 3.69 million from the ADF country allocation to the Government of 

Guinea to finance the activities of the PDZTA_BK, the first phase of Guinea’s Agri-hub 

Development Programme. 

I. STRATEGIC THRUST AND RATIONALE 

1.1 Programme Linkages with Country Strategy and Objectives 

1.1.1 The Programme is consistent with Pillar 2 of the National Plan for Economic and 

Social Development (PNDES) 2016-2020, i.e. sustainable and inclusive economic 

transformation that will result in the establishment of development hubs in Boké and Kankan 

based on agricultural potential which is one of the major assets of Guinea and these regions. It 

also has a strategic linkage with the three (3) other PNDES pillars: (i) Pillar 1: Promoting good 

governance for sustainable development by promoting good governance of the country’s 

agricultural wealth; (ii) Pillar 3: Inclusive development of the human capital by investing in it 

in order to take charge of the development of Guinea’s Special Agro-Industrial Processing 

Zones; and (iii) Pillar 4: sustainable management of natural capital by ensuring that agricultural 

development hubs are not established at the expense of natural resources.  

1.1.2 At sector level, the PNDES is implemented through the National Agricultural 

Development Policy (PNDA) whose implementing instrument is the National Agricultural 

Investment and Food and Nutrition Security Plan (PNIASAN) 2018-2025 which itself is in 

keeping with the Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zones Development Programme (PDZTA-

BK) through its priority activities which are the development of plant, animal and fisher y   

products. Therefore, PDZTA-BK is, , an operational means of focusing efforts on achieving a 

6% growth rate of agricultural value added and a central government budget allocation of 10% 

to the agricultural sector (Maputo Commitment). PDZTA-BK is, therefore, fully aligned with 

the country’s strategic objectives. 

1.2 Programme Alignment with Bank Policy 

1.2.1 This programme is considered as a priority by the Bank as part of its  strategic choice 

of transforming Guinean agriculture as reflected in Pillar 2 of the 2018-2022 CSP concerning 

the development of agricultural and industrial value chains. It is also consistent with the Bank’s 

second strategic thrust, its Strategy for Agricultural Transformation in Africa (2016-2025) [the  

2016-2025 ‘Feed Africa’ Strategy], one of the Bank’s Hi-5s, which are to: (i) Light Up and 

Power Africa; (ii) Feed Africa; (iii) Industrialise Africa; (iv) Integrate Africa; and (v) Improve 

the quality of life for the people of Africa. The programme’s alignment with the Bank’s policy 

is further underscored by the fact that it will help to boost the transformation of Guinea’s 

agriculture, industrialisation and increase Guinea’s energy capacity.  More specifically, it is 

fully in keeping with the promotion of smart agriculture and product enhancement on every 

link in the priority value chains promoted under this operation. 

  



 

 

2 

 

1.3 Rationale for Bank’s Involvement 

1.3.1 Like most RMCs, Guinea imports most of its fresh food products which are valued at 
almost USD 745 million (2016), most of which can be produced locally, in particular, cereals 

with an import value of USD 339 million in 2016. However, Guinea has strong agricultural 

potential, particularly in terms of its abundant land and water resources, a 43,000 km2 

continental shelf and enjoys mild temperatures providing it with significant opportunities for 

the development of a varied range of agro-silvo-pastoral products and significant potential for 

the development of a blue economy. The Bank has defined 5 operational priorities for such a 

situation, one of whose four objectives is to reduce imports and make Africa a net exporter. 

Guinea has, therefore, followed in the Bank’s footsteps with different strategies aimed at 

addressing this situation by developing Guinea’s agricultural potential, by establishing long-

term infrastructure in the areas of transport, energy, agricultural production, marketing and 

processing with private sector involvement in the sector. 

1.3.2 The Bank’s interventions, through the PDZTA-BK, which is the first phase of a 
programme of ten (10) agro-hubs, are consistent with the Bank’s CSP (2018-2022) and Hi-5s. 

The programme will help to effectively boost economic development since it is consistent with   

the Bank’s strategies by consolidating the role of the private sector and communities in rural 

development, a guarantee of inclusiveness in Africa, and in Guinea, in particular.  It was, 

moreover, designed on the basis of complementarities with ongoing operations and those under 

preparation, especially those relating to implementation of the Boké-Québo Road Project and 

the Support Programme for the Transformation of Guinean Agriculture and Youth Agricultural 

Entrepreneurship (PATAG-EAJ), with a view to seeking synergies. This programme will, 

therefore, seek to leverage the ongoing actions in the Boké and Kankan Regions to ensure the 

operation’s relevance and effectiveness. 

1.4 Aid Coordination 

1.4.1 Development aid is coordinated by the Government of Guinea through the Coordination 
and Consultation Framework (CCF) at the level of the Permanent Secretariat at the Office of the 

Prime Minister. All the TFPs align their operations with those of the Guinean Government. While 

implementing the PNDES 2016-2020, the Government affirmed its will to strengthen aid 

coordination by setting up consultation mechanisms. In addition to the Coordination and 

Consultation Framework (CCF), which is the strategic coordination forum between the Government 

and the TFP, a Technical Monitoring Committee (TMC) has been set up to strengthen inter-sector 

coordination and Thematic Dialogue Groups (TDGs) established, bringing together TFP and 

government representatives at sector level. The ‘rural development, food security and environment’ 

thematic group is chaired by the World Bank representing the TFP and the Ministry of Agriculture 

for the Government. 

1.4.2 The Bank, through COGN, is an active member of the CCF and some TDGs. The key 
ongoing programmes supported by the TFPs with an Agricultural Value Chain (AVC) 

component with which the PDZTA must seek synergies are contained in Volume 2. These 

are: (i) the Agri-hub G Agricultural Development Support Programme (PADAG –Abu Dhabi 

Fund); (ii) the Family Farming, Resilience and Markets Programme in Upper and 

Middle Guinea (AgriFARM - IFAD) ; (iii) the World Bank’s Guinea Integrated Agricultural 

Development Programme (PDAIG); (iv) the WB’s Agricultural Sector Support Programme 

(PASAG); (v) the World Bank’s Enclave Programme for Agribusiness Development in the 

Boké Region, being prepared for 2019; (vi) the JICA (Japan) Rice Sub-Sector Technical 

Assistance Operation; (vii) the USAID Guinea Agricultural Services (GAS) Programme; and 

(viii)  the Programme for the Socio-Economic Integration of Guinean Youth (INTEGRA-ITC). 



 

 

3 

 

1.4.3 The programme is also designed in phases and on the basis of complementarities with 
the Bank’s programmes, in particular, the Boké-Québo Road Construction Programme with a 

rural roads component for access to agricultural production zones and the Support Programme   

for the Transformation of Guinean Agriculture and Youth Agricultural Entrepreneurship  

(PATAG-EAJ). This first phase that only involves the Bank will be followed by others, 

gradually mobilising several technical and financial partners (TFP).

II. PROGRAMME DESCRIPTION  

2.1 Programme Components 

2.1.1 The Boké and Kankan Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zones Development 

Programme (PDZSTA-BK) is the first phase of a programme to develop ten (10) agrihubs. Its 

goal is to contribute to the reduction of food imports and improve Guinea’s food and nutrition 

security by establishing private sector-driven agro-industrial development hubs. The 

programme will be implemented through the following three (3) components: (i) Establishment 

of governance in the Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zones (APZ); (ii) Development of 

processing and access infrastructure; and (iii) Programme coordination and management.  

 

2.1.2 The programme will build on production activities as well as those concerning the 

establishment of access and marketing infrastructure for operations that are starting up or being 

prepared for 2019, upstream of the agro-industrial parks, for the supply of raw materials in the 

first phase. In Boké Region, these programmes are the Bank’s PTAG-EAJ programme (UA 

8.99 million), the Bank (UA 40.04 million) and European Union (EUR 20.38 million) Boké-

Québo Programme and the World Bank’s Enclave Programme for Agribusiness Development 

(USD 50.00 million).  In the Kankan region, these are the IFAD AgriFarm (USD 61 million) 

ABEDA (USD 20 million) and OFID (USD15.00 million) Programmes.  Additional financing 

is, therefore, required in equivalent amounts of USD 137.57 and USD 96 million for the Boké 

and Kankan regions. The first phase of the programme will not be exposed to the risk of lack 

of agro-park production or supply if the actions are well coordinated between the different 

sectors and technical and financial partners.

2.2 Technical Solutions Retained and Other Alternatives Explored 

2.2.1 The PDZTA-BK’s objective is to approach the key issue of the transformation of 

Guinean agriculture, through an approach that puts the private sector in a leadership role 

while the public sector attempts to create incentive conditions that are likely to attract 

private investors to fully developed and serviced agro-industrial parks. It is necessary to 

adopt an agricultural development approach based on Special Agro -Industrial Processing 

Zones (APZ). The APZs for spatial development initiatives are based on agriculture and 

designed to concentrate agricultural processing activities in areas of high agricultural 

potential in order to boost productivity and integrate the production, processing and 

marketing of a number of agricultural crops. These initiatives may or may not enjoy Special 

Economic Zone status. They contribute to the operationalisation of the ‘agricultural value 



 

 

5 

 

chain’ concept by giving it content, i.e. : (i) agricultural production sites in compliance with 

the required standards through the Technologies for African Agricultural Transformation 

(TAAT) Programme which proposes cutting-edge technological innovations adapted to 

production conditions; (ii) agro-industrial parks for the processing of raw materials from 

the production sites serving as outlets for agricultural output; (iii) establishment of  key 

physical and smart infrastructure for connections to markets and major mass consumption 

centres countrywide and outside the country.  In some cases, they are also known as Agro-

Industrial, Agribusiness parks, Mega Supply Parks, agro-hubs and agro-clusters, etc. 

2.2.2 The approach is integrated and pragmatic, innovative and inclusive in all the 

agricultural value chain links and is wealth-creating through the jobs it generates but also   

because it contains foreign exchange outflows due to a reduction in imports of agro-food 

products. It is the focus of efforts of all the other sectors that contribute to the success of 

agricultural development, in particular, the industrial, transport, energy, water and NICT 

sectors, including within the Bank. It also incorporates the interventions of the other 

development partners in a systematic bid to seek synergy-creating complementarity.  In the 

case of the PDZTA-BK, this concerns the World Bank, IFAD, the European Union, AFD 

and the Abu Dhabi Fund. 

2.2.3 The APZ approach also focuses on support from the key actors of promising sub-

sectors through the implementation of a capacity building programme to develop specific 

advanced skills to meet the programme’s requirements. 

2.2.4 In the case of the PDZTA-BK, the main crops and stock farming activities concern 

(i) cash crops such as cashews, oil palms, sesame and soya; (ii) food products such as rice, 

fonio, groundnuts, maize, potatoes, yams and cassava ; (iii) fruit such as oranges, mangoes 

and pineapples; (iv) market garden products, in particular, tomatoes, onions, okra and 

chillies; (v) poultry and sheep breeding; (vi) fishery products from fish farming; (vi) non-

wood forest products such as honey, leaves, wild seeds and fruit, oils and resins, infusions, 

etc. 

2.2.5 The APZ technical solutions break with the traditional approach adopted to 

improve productivity, production and sales without specifying the content . 

Table 2.2  

ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS EXPLORED AND REASONS FOR REJECTION  

ALTERNATIVE 

SOLUTION 
BRIEF DESCRIPTION REASONS FOR REJECTION 

Traditional approach for 
agricultural programmes 

Approach aimed at improving productivity, 
production and sales  

This approach has no value chain content 
and is, therefore, constrained by the reality 
on the ground concerning the key issues of 
processing, markets and outlets. 

Mono-sector agriculture-
based approach 

Sector approach based solely on agricultural 
activities  

It does not integrate the other development 
sectors that impact on agricultural 
development and thus constitute factors for 

that sector’s success.  

Mainly use of Bank’s 
public resources 

The programmes are mainly financed from 
the Bank’s and Government’s public 
resources 

AVC financing needs exceed the Bank’s 
public resources for they include private 
sector financing, co-financing by 
development partners and non-sovereign 
operations. 

Extension of 

technological innovations 
using the traditional 
method of training and 
visits to producers 

Approach based on regular visits to producers  

in accordance with a specific schedule and a 
supervisory framework with tools such as the 
contact group (CG), observation point (OP) 
and the system study point (SSP) 

In addition to being cumbersome and costly, 

this method has shown its limitations in the 
past and is less effective is less effective 
than the client-supplier system that focuses 
on skill development in all the relevant 
areas of activity.

2.3 Programme Type 

The Special Agro-Industrial Processing Development Programme (PDZTA-BK) is a public 

investment programme aimed at creating the required conditions for increasing private 

investment in value added creating sub-sectors, especially regarding agricultural product 

processing, the supply of inputs and provision of agricultural and marketing services.  This 

programme will be implemented in several phases on the basis successive ADF allocations and 

the mobilisation of additional donor resources. 

2.4 Programme Cost and Financing Arrangements 

2.4.1 Programme Cost: The total programme cost for the ten (10) Special Agro-Industrial 

Processing Zones (SAPZ) is estimated at around UA 550 million (about USD 758 million), the 

first phase of which was appraised at UA 120.84 million (GNF 1,535.75 billion), including a 

pilot phase.  The total cost of the pilot phase which fully covers Boké and partly Kankan, is 

estimated at UA 12.04 million (GNF 152.92 billion), excluding taxes and customs duties. These 

costs comprise UA 7.19 million (GNF 91.32 billion) in foreign exchange and UA 4.85 million 

in local currency (GNF 61.65 billion). They include provisions for physical contingencies and 

financial contingencies which are respectively estimated at an average of 3% and 4 %.  The 

provision for financial contingencies was estimated on the basis of current and forecast average 

annual inflation rates for respective local currency and foreign exchange costs of 8.0 % and 

1.8 %. The provision for physical contingencies is estimated at between 0 and 7 %. A summary 

of the programme’s estimated cost by component and expenditure category is presented in the 

Tables below, including the detailed costs. The first phase of the programme will concern the 

establishment of APZ governance and the total or partial completion of the respective agro-

parks of Boké and Kankan.  The programme will be rolled out gradually, as and when the 

additional resources are mobilised.  The pilot and first two phases will cover Boké and Kankan.

2.5 Programme Target Area and Beneficiaries 

The Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zones Development Programme (PDZTA) covers two 

regions and the Bank’s intervention will contribute to the development of two (2) major regions 

in Guinea with an administrative area of about 103,333 km², of which 31,186 hectares lie in the 

Boké Region with an arable land area of about 2,720,000 ha, about 800,000 ha of which lie 

solely in the Boké Region.  The programme will cover about 110,000 ha throughout the entire 

programme area (PA) and have a considerable impact on about 220,000 direct beneficiaries and 

670,000 indirect beneficiaries, of whom 50.7% will be women. It concerns the Kankan Region 

in Upper Guinea where several small and medium-sized agro-food enterprises have been set up 

including the Guinea Fruit Corporation, Maden Mining Ltd, Diaoune Agro-Industry and the 

Coopération des professionnels agricoles de Guinée (Guinean agricultural professional 

organisation) (CPA-G) and the Boké Region where agro-food SMEs are also developing. 

Economically, the region is very dynamic as a result of the mining of minerals by Chinese and 

American companies.  

The Bank’s intervention will contribute to the development of two (2) major regions in Guinea 

with an administrative area of about 103,333 km², of which 31,186 hectares lie in the Boké 

Region with an arable land area of about 2,720,000 ha, of which 800,000 ha lie solely in the 

Boké Region.  The programme will cover about 110,000 ha throughout the entire programme 

area (PA) and have a considerable impact on about 220,000 direct beneficiaries and 670,000 

indirect beneficiaries, 50.7% of whom will be women 

2.6 Participatory Process for Programme Identification, Design and 
 Implementation 

2.6.1 A consultation-based participatory process was the guiding principle for the project’s 

design. It was adopted for discussions and consultations with officials from the Ministries 

concerned (agriculture, industry, transport, energy, trade, etc.), public administrations, the 

private sector,  local authorities (of Kankan and Boké), producer organisations, civil society 

and TFP (World Bank, AFD, IFAD, European Union, Chinese and Japanese Cooperation and 

the Abu Dhabi Fund). It was implemented in the following stages: (i) preparation and proposal 

by the country team of terms of reference for the programme feasibility studies; (ii) preparation 

by the Bank team of a report on the establishment of a Programme Preparation Facility (PPF); 

(iii) preparation of the PPF by the Bank until its approval by the country team; (iv) broad-based 

consultation of stakeholders during project appraisal in Conakry, Boké and Kankan, especially 

during the assessment of environmental safeguard measures required for environmental 

categorisation and publication of the summary of the Strategic Environmental and Social 

Assessment (SESA) Report; (v) continuation of consultations during the appraisal mission 

during field visits to Kankan and Boké, consultations with all the stakeholders and key actors 

(civil society, public administration, private sector and technical and financial partners) in 

Conakry. 

2.6.2 This proposal is also a response to strong demand from grassroots communities, due 

to inconsistencies between the potential of the regions concerned and weak agricultural 

development in the zones concerned. This participatory process will continue during the 

programme’s implementation through: (i) a steering structure that will bring together  

representatives of all parties, (ii) capacity building for institutions and communities on the 

participatory process, (iii) community involvement in the implementation of activities; and (iv) 

the establishment of a programme results-based monitoring and evaluation system.  In addition, 

the Bank’s Country Office in Guinea will constantly ensure that the consultation mechanism is 

operational throughout the programme’s implementation.

2.7 Bank Group Experience, Lessons Reflected in Project Design 

2.7.1 The PDZTA’s formulation incorporates the lessons learned from the Bank’s previous 

and ongoing operations in Guinea and through the regional member countries taking into 

account issues concerning portfolio performance and the country’s fragility. These lessons were 

reiterated in the most recent July 2018 review following which portfolio performance was 

considered to be satisfactory.  However, the review noted that efforts should be continued in 

order to improve: (i) the effectiveness period (11 months instead of the Bank’s recommended 

6 months); (ii) mobilisation of programme management teams; (iii) procurement periods 

considered to be too long; (iv) mobilisation of counterpart funds; (v) the programme personnel 

performance monitoring system  by the systematic establishment of performance contracts and 

renewal of staff contracts on the basis of the results of the annual staff evaluation; and (vi) the 

time taken to update the baseline situation and establish the monitoring and evaluation system. 

2.7.2 The Portfolio Performance Improvement Plan (2018 PPIP) also recommended that   

specific measures be taken to accelerate the programme implementation rate.  This 

recommendation, which has been  taken into account in this proposal,  is reflected in: (i) the 

maintenance of stakeholder dialogue and close monitoring by the Bank’s Country Office 

(COGN) in order to mitigate risks relating to delays in the PDZTA-BK implementation and 

administration period and process and the fulfilment of conditions precedent to effectiveness; 

(ii) improvement of quality at entry by using advance procurement action for preparing bidding 

documents and management tools (Manual of Accounting and Financial Procedures-MAFP, 

Computerised Accounting and Financial Management System – SIGCF, and of monitoring and 

evaluation prior to Programme commencement; and (iii) capacity building for programme 

management teams in procurement and financial management. It is also worth noting that the 

ongoing portfolio has been considerably rejuvenated in recent years, that the average age for 

operations fell from 5.5 years in 2011 to 2.7 in 2017 and that it contained no problematic 

programme (PP) or potentially problematic programme (PPP) in 2017.  

2.7.3 The PDZTA design, therefore, took into account the lessons learned from previous 

operations and incorporated in the 2018 PPIP in order to meet the design and implementation 

criteria contained in Presidential Directive 002/2015.

III. PROGRAMME FEASIBILITY 

3.1 Economic and Financial Performance 

3.1.1 The programme is designed to have direct spinoffs in terms of crops promoted and 

developed through private investments to establish agribusinesses, i.e. about 100 units per agro-

industrial park in Boké, with a total of 200 agribusinesses in under ten (10) years in these two 

regions. In addition to the spinoffs from private enterprises established in the Boké and Kankan 

agro-industrial parks, significant income will be earned by the beneficiaries of the agricultural 

production sites, also developed and from which enterprises will be supplied with raw materials 

concerning the crops and stock farming activities already mentioned in Section 2.2, i.e. cashew 

nuts, oil palms, sesame, soya, rice, fonio, groundnuts, maize, potatoes, yams, cassava, fruit 

(oranges, mangoes and pineapples), tomatoes, onions, okra and chillies, poultry, sheep, 

fishery products, non-wood forest products such as honey, leaves, wild seeds and fruit, oils 

and resins and infusions, etc..  However, the analysis does not take into account revenue 

generated at farm level given that this first phase of the programme only concerns agro-

industrial parks. 

3.1.2  In addition to these spinoffs, the programme is designed to generate other benefits 

such as: (i) the creation of temporary and permanent jobs as a result of the programme’s 

achievements estimated at 500 per processing unit (i.e. 10,000, for the agro-industrial units 

alone).  



 

 

11 

 

3.1.3 Financial Analysis: Much of the above-mentioned spinoffs does not concern 

commercial transactions or is not even tangible and is not suitable for an analysis of financial 

performance on the basis of existing markets.  Under these conditions, it was not considered 

relevant to factor it in to a quantitative analysis on the basis of a production or profitable   

business model approach.  It was, however, possible, to carry out a cost/benefit analysis of 

different agro-industrial enterprise and agricultural production models (FARMOD). 

3.1.4 With regard to agro-industrial enterprises, a scenario is proposed on the basis of three 

(3) types of processing unit, i.e. small, medium and large enterprises with respective 

investments of USD 2, 5 and 11 million each in accordance with the average investment profiles 

for this type of model.  Under these conditions, annual turnover per enterprise is USD640,000, 

1.6 million and 3.52 million respectively for small, medium and large-sized units from the 5th 

year over an operating period of about 20 years. 

3.1.5 As regards agricultural crops on production sites for farmers and suppliers of agro-

industrial park enterprises, FARMOD type production models and a cost-benefit model 

(input/output, with or without programme implementation) will be applied over a 20-year 

operating period. 

3.1.6 The financial analysis results were: (i) a financial impact of over USD109 million per 

year from the 5th year of operation over a 20-year period in accordance with similar types of 

operation, depending on the investment life cycle. This implies that the financial impacts of the 

programme over the operational period exceed the cost of investments required to finance it ; 

(ii) a cost/benefit ratio of 2.27, where the benefits are higher than the cost of investments; 

(iii) an internal rate of return of 24.21 %, which is higher than the opportunity cost of capital 

(the cost of tying up financial resources for investments under the programme), estimated at 

12 %.  On the basis of these results, it may be concluded that the programme has a rate of return 

profile that financially justifies the cost of its investments. 

3.1.7 Economic Analysis: The economic analysis was carried out using the reference price 

method, i.e. prices under conditions of economic efficiency in accordance with the Pareto 

optimum. It was also carried out by comparing the ‘no programme’ and ‘with programme 

implementation’ situations of production models used in the financial analysis. In this model, 

tradeable goods are those likely to be the subject of commercial transactions outside the country 

(FOB port CIF to port of Marseille).  Under these conditions, the reference prices for these 

products (economic prices) are estimated on the basis of the ex-ante equilibrium of these crops 

that will give the export parity price at farm gate.  Labour was economically valued at 65 % of 

its financial value of USD3/day to factor in the inelasticity of demand for labour in the country 

in general and in the programme area, in particular. 

3.1.8 On the basis of realistically defined scenarios, the programme’s economic rate of return 

(ERR) was estimated at 26.97%, with a cost-benefit ratio of 2.38. As a result, the Programme’s 

overall rate of return may be considered to be satisfactory in light of these results.

IRR (baseline scenario) : 24.21% NPV amount :  USD109.17 million 

ERR (baseline scenario) : 26.97% NPV amount :  USD 123.03 million 

3.1.9 Sensitivity Analysis: The sensitivity tests on the basis of a reduction in production 

prices measured the stability of financial and economic performance indicators. The tests showed 

that it is necessary to lower prices to 39.17% (break-even point or switching value) to cancel out 

the additional benefits generated respectively at the economic and financial level, with IRR and 

ERR equal to the opportunity cost of capital, i.e. 12 %.  This test shows that the programme’s rate 

of return profile is robust, although it was not carried out on all the model’s endogenous values.  

However, the price variable is the most important and is the only one that is outside the 

Programme’s management and operation. A summary of the sensitivity analysis is presented in 

the technical annexes, page 72 of volume II of this report. 

3.2 Environmental and Social Impact 

3.2.1 Environment: The PDZTA has been classified in Category 1 and, at this stage of its 

formulation process, subjected to a Strategic Environmental and Social Assessment that was 

posted on the following link: https://esa.afdb.org/document/etudes-dimpact-environnemental-

et-social-21., on Monday, May 06, 2019.  Category 1 programmes are likely to have significant 

or irreversible environmental and/or social impacts or severely impact the environmental or 

social impacts considered by the Bank or borrowing country to be sensitive. Boké Department 

is located in the administrative region of Boké which, itself, is located in Maritime or Lower 

Guinea. With the presence of the Atlantic coast, Lower Guinea is the alluvial basin for major 

coastal rivers such as the Kogon, Fatala, Konkouré and Kolente Rivers. The area is also covered 

by mangrove swamps (Rizophora racemose and Avicennia nitida). This natural region of Lower 

Guinea is also home to the country’s main mining centres: the Guinean Bauxite Company 

(CBG) in Boké, ACG in Fria and the Kindia Bauxite Company (Débélé), etc. 

3.2.2 With regard to potential sites mainly for the PDZA-BK’s anchor programmes, in 

particular the irrigation schemes in Boké Prefecture, the Denken plains covering an area of 

almost 600 ha located in Kolaboui rural municipality and the Kapatchez plains covering about 

9,200 ha located in Kamsar rural community provide significant development opportunities. In 

the Boké Administrative Region, there are also the 9500 hectare Mankountan Plain, the 4,000 

hectare Monchon Plain and the 6,000 hectare Koba Plain. 

3.2.3 Kankan Department, the programme’s target area, is located in Upper Guinea. This 

natural region covers the entire north-east and centre of Guinea’s territory. It is a region of 

plains and savannah, located between 200 and 400 metres of altitude. The Niger River and its 

tributaries have cut moist terraced flatlands into it. 

3.2.4 In relation to the programme, large sedimentary plains in Upper Guinea border the 

main water courses and cover vast areas: the Niger plains in Faranah, Kouroussa, Siguiri, the 

Milo plains, the Fié plains and the Banié –Tinkisso plains. In Kankan prefecture, the following 

sites have significant irrigation potential:  the Bafèle plain with about 11,000 ha of irrigable 

land located in Moribaya rural municipality and the Samanka plain with 800 ha located in Tinti 

Oulen rural municipality. 

3.2.5 Climate Change: Guinea, at the gateway to the Sahel, is highly exposed to climate 

change. According to 2,100 climate projections, temperatures will rise throughout the country 

and, more specifically: (i) in Middle and Upper Guinea (north-east and north-west areas of the 

https://esa.afdb.org/document/etudes-dimpact-environnemental-et-social-21
https://esa.afdb.org/document/etudes-dimpact-environnemental-et-social-21


 

 

13 

 

country), by about 0.4 to 3.3°C, with a sensitivity of 2.5°C; (ii) in Lower Guinea and Forest 

Guinea (south-west and south-east areas of the country), from 0.3 to 2.7°C with a sensitivity of 

2.5°C. This rising temperature will be accompanied by changes in the distribution and volume 

of rainfall.  These changes could reach 36.4 % of the present norm from 2050 and 40.4 % in 

2100.  Forest resources are among the most vulnerable resources to climate change because of 

the impact of human activities on forest ecosystems (carbonisation, excessive tree felling, 

nomadic pastoralism, agricultural clearing, mining and uncontrolled food gathering, etc.). 

3.2.6 In terms of greenhouse gas emissions, Guinea remains a very low emitting country, 

with GHG emission per capita of 2.1 tCO2e/inhab. in 1994 and less than 0.1% of global 

emissions.  They have, however, increased fairly rapidly. Between 1994 and 2015, these 

emissions rose 21.5 times, that is, an average annual increase of almost 10 %. This means they 

doubled almost every 7.2 years. Guinea’s objective in this area is to reduce its greenhouse gas 

emissions by 13% by 2030, compared to the 1994 level. In the forestry sector, this commitment 

concerns the stabilisation by 2030 of the mangrove areas, the reforestation of 10,000 hectares 

per year and the preservation of classified forests and protected areas. 

3.2.7 Gender: On average, Guinean agriculture contributes an average of 17.5% to 23% to 

GDP and occupies 50% of the work force 75% of which is in rural areas (RGPH3, 2014). It is   

largely dominated by family-type farms.  Over half of those in work (52.6%) are employed in 

the ‘agriculture, livestock, forestry and fisheries’ sector, 50.9% of whom are male and 53.5% 

female. Guinea has a gender policy, dating back in January 2011.  This policy covers: (i) Access 

to basic social services: education - health - HIV/AIDS - water- hygiene and sanitation; 

(ii) compliance with human rights and the elimination of violence: fundamental rights - little 

girl - violence - human trafficking; (iii) access, control of resources and equitable income 

sharing: economy - poverty - environment; (iv) improving governance and equitable access to 

decision-making bodies: power - media - institutional mechanisms - armed conflicts - ICT; and 

(v) gender integration into macro-economic framing: national development policies and 

programmes. This policy helps to minimize gender inequalities. 

3.2.8 Women play a major role in the agricultural economy throughout the agricultural 

chain from production and processing to marketing. However, despite their impact in the 

agricultural production chain, they still face many difficulties, including: 

 Access to resources and factors of production, in particular land, inputs and 
fertilisers. Because of customs and traditions women are not usually the owners 

of farmed land;  

 In decision-making and conflict management in the agricultural sector, women 
have less influence;  

 In terms of financial resources: the lack of resources is a real problem both in 
the agricultural sector and in other areas (education, health etc.); and  

 Concerning training: this remains a real concern, especially regarding capacity 
building, entrepreneurship, management… The literacy level of some women is 

also a handicap. 

3.2.9 In order to alleviate these difficulties, the Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zones 

Development Programme proposes the following gender promotion and women’s 

empowerment actions throughout its implementation: i) entrepreneurship, job creation for 



 

 

14 

 

women and young people and access to markets; ii) agricultural production capacity building; 

iii) skill building in agricultural production and processing, starting and managing a business, 

marketing and market access; iv) sensitisation campaigns on behavioural changes regarding 

birth control and reproductive health, balanced nutrition, gender and the prevention of gender-

based violence, the prevention of early marriages, HIV/AIDS, lifestyle management and 

environmental sanitation.  

3.2.10  According to the Gender Classification System, the programme is classified in 

Category 2.  The detailed gender analysis and gender action plan are presented in the Technical 

Annex on gender.  The budget allocated to gender promotion and women’s empowerment 

actions is UA 2.883 million. 

3.3 Involuntary Resettlement 

3.3.1 Operational Safeguard 2 (OS 2): Involuntary resettlement: land acquisition, 

population displacement and compensation: the risk of physical displacement or resettlement 

of the population is minimal as well as the loss of major assets during the programme’s 

implementation.  However, the issues of land tenure and nomadic livestock breeding are two 

key challenges that should be taken into consideration. In the event of the physical displacement 

or resettlement of population, Resettlement Action Plans (RAP) will be prepared and 

implemented in accordance with the Bank’s procedures and in compliance with OS2. 

3.4 Cost of ESMP Measures 

3.4.1 The costs of some measures will be included in the BDs and others covered by the 

FESMP. Some measures such as the application of good practices, the reforestation 

programmes, erosion control and resettlement will be taken into account in the cost of works 

and included in the bidding documents (BDs) and contractors will be obliged to implement 

them under the supervision of the control office and Programme Implementation Unit (PIU). 

The cost of the additional gender and women’s empowerment programme to be formulated on 

a participatory basis will be included in the programme’s budget. 

3.4.2 The estimated costs of the FESMP activities will primarily concern environmental and 

social measures not taken into account in the BDs.  Control Mission services will be covered in 

its contract.  

3.4.3 The overall ESMP cost is estimated at USD 500,000. Details are provided in the 

following Table.

ESMP implementation will be the subject of periodic reports on monitoring and supervision 

but also on evaluation and supervision by the different actors or structures involved in its 

implementation. 

IV. IMPLEMENTATION 

4.1 Implementation Arrangements 

4.1.1 At national level, programme management will be placed under the oversight of the 

Authority for the Development and Administration of Special Economic and Industrial Zones 

(ADAZZ), attached to the Presidency of the Republic. This institutional arrangement is due to 

the multi-sector nature of the programme and the need for strong leadership to provide 

coordination among all the programme’s actors. For this purpose, ADAZZZ will be 

strengthened institutionally through the PDZTA Programme Management Unit (PMU). The 

PMU will be lightly structured and responsible mainly for coordination, financial management, 

procurement and programme monitoring and evaluation activities. It will comprise: (i) a 

national coordinator; (ii) a monitoring and evaluation officer; (iii) a procurement officer; (vi) 

an environmental specialist, (vii) an administrative and financial officer; and (ix) an 

accountant. 

                                                
6 The preparation of manuals on good environmental practices has been factored in to the programme

4.1.2 The PMU will also be supported by periodic technical assistance (international and 

national consultants). On the ground, it will be assisted by partner organisations, in particular, 

administration structures, the Guinean Institute for Agricultural Research (IRAG), the Private 

Investment Promotion Agency (APIP) as well as the Ministries and technical agencies involved 

in the programme. The signing of agreements with these partner structures, including IRAG, 

will be one of the loan and grant conditions under ‘other conditions’. The documentation on 

these agreements will have to be included as soon as possible and prior to effectiveness in order 

to facilitate the programme implementation no-objection process. 

4.1.3 A Strategic Orientation Committee (SCO) will be set up to provide strategic direct ion 

for the implementation of the programme.  It will be chaired by the Minister Secretary General 

for the Presidency of the Republic. The Vice-Presidency will be held by the Minister in charge 

of the Plan. The committee will be composed of Ministers in charge of Economy and Finance, 

Agriculture, Industry and SMEs, Investments and PPPs, Mines, and Trade, as well as the 

President of the National Chamber of Agriculture. The SCO will meet at least once a year, and 

its Secretariat will be provided by ADAZZ. 

4.1.4 A Program Steering Committee (PSC) will also be established. It will be chaired by 

the Secretary General of the Ministry of Agriculture or its representative. In addition to the 

representatives of the Ministries within the SCO, ADAZZ, the National Chamber of 

Agriculture, the PSC will be composed by representatives of the Regional Governors, the 

private sector and the Civil Society. The PSC Secretariat is provided by the representative of 

the Ministry of Industry and SMEs. The PSC will be responsible: (i) for reviewing and 

approving the annual work programme and budget (AWPB), (ii) for validating the results of 

the program's performance, and (iii) for framing innovations and ensuring the relevance of the 

major choices to be made at the implementation. It will meet at least twice a year. 

4.2 Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements 

4.2.1 Procurement Arrangements: The procurement of goods (including services other 

than consulting services), works and the acquisition of consulting services financed by the Bank 

under the programme will be carried out in accordance with the Procurement Framework for 

Bank Group-financed operations, 2015 edition, and in compliance with the provisions of the 

financing agreement. More specifically, procurements will be made in accordance with the 

Bank’s Procurement Methods and Procedures (BPP), on the basis of the relevant standard 

bidding documents (SBDs) for goods and works contracts as well as consulting services for 

which the BPP are considered to be the most appropriate. Indeed, following an analysis of the 

Guinean procurement system as presented in Technical Annex B5 of this report, the 

procurement risk was considered to be substantial. As a result, for the implementation of this 

programme, the Bank’s Procurement Methods and Procedures will be used, since a capacity 

building action plan will be the subject of dialogue with the Guinean Authorities in order to 

rapidly ensure use of the national procurement system following the reforms identified as 

necessary. 

4.2.2 Procurement Risks and Capacity Assessment (PRCA): The assessment of 

procurement risks at country, sector and programme level as well as the capacity of the 

executing agency (EA) was carried out and the results were used to influence the decision to 

choose the BPM for all activities planned under the programme. The appropriate risk mitigation 

measures were included in the PRCA action plan presented in Annex B5. 



 

 

17 

 

4.2.3 Organisation of Procurement Implementation: Programme procurement will be 

carried out by the Programme Executing Agency. In light of the conclusions of the assessment 

of the executing agency’s capacity, a management unit including a procurement expert will be 

recruited to implement the procurement process but also to build the capacities of the different 

actors involved in procurement. 

 

4.2.4 Advance Procurement Action (APA): The Government intends to submit to the Bank 

for approval a request for the use of APA in order to recruit consultants to conduct studies on 

agro-park infrastructure and irrigation schemes.  This request shall be submitted to the Bank 

prior to the programme’s presentation to the Bank’s Board of Directors. 

4.2.5 Disbursement: The disbursement methods to be used to mobilise the ADF loan 

financing are: (i) the direct payment method; (ii) the special fund/revolving fund method and 

(iii) the reimbursement method. Direct payments will be made in respect of contracts for works, 

goods and services signed between the Borrowers and suppliers, in accordance with the Bank’s 

procurement rules and procedures and national procurement legislation. The special account 

method will be used to settle operating expenditure, training costs, field mission costs etc. It 

will require the opening of a Special Account at the Central Bank of Guinea, which will, in 

turn, pay all the funds received from the ADF into the PMU bank account opened in a bank 

acceptable to AfDB. The opening of the Bank account will be a condition precedent to the first 

disbursement. The reimbursement method will be used when eligible expenditure on ADF loan 

resources are pre-financed with the Bank’s prior approval. These disbursements will be made 

in accordance with the list of goods and services and the Bank’s rules and procedures as 

described in the Disbursement Handbook. Details of the disbursement arrangements will be 

presented in the Technical Annexes (Volume II of the Programme Appraisal Report). 

4.3 Financial Management 

4.3.1 The Programme Management Unit (PMU) will be responsible for the programme’s 
overall coordination and financial management. Its financial management staff will comprise the 

programme coordinator, the administrative and financial officer, the accountant and cashier, all of 

whom will be recruited in accordance with the programme’s procurement arrangements. 

4.3.2 The financial management systems of the ADAZZ management unit whose structures 
will be used under the PDZTA are not satisfactory on the whole and the overall fiduciary risk is 

substantial because of the absence of: (i) a financial coordinator and personnel as mentioned above; 

(ii) an administrative, financial and accounting procedures manual; (iii) operational accounting and 

financial management software; and (iv) financial management tools and reference framework. 

4.3.3 As a result, the PMU should take the following measures: (i) as soon as the programme 
is launched, prepare a budget plan coupled with the indicative activities schedule; (ii) when the 

programme is launched, recruit a consultant to prepare the administrative, financial and accounting 

procedures manual (AFAPM), and another responsible for establishing the computerised 

accounting and financial management system (SIGCF) ; (iii) assign financial tasks as soon as the 

financial staff are recruited; (iv) establish the financial management framework and instruments in 

accordance with Annex B6 of Volume II of the Programme Appraisal Report. 

4.3.4 Audits: Once a year, a competent and independent firm of external auditors will verify 
the reliability of the consolidated financial statements prepared by the PMU and will assess the 

operation of the internal control system of the entire programme. It will be recruited in accordance 

with the terms of reference and bidding procedures recommended by the Bank.  Audit costs will be 

financed by the ADF loan. The audit reports must be forwarded to the Bank each year, no later than 



 

 

18 

 

six months after the closure of the audited period. Audits will be performed in accordance with 

SYSCOA international audit standards and the Bank’s comprehensive terms of reference which 

will be communicated to the programme. 

 

4.4 Monitoring 

Internal monitoring and evaluation will be carried out by the Programme Monitoring and 

Evaluation Unit, while external monitoring-evaluation will be the responsibility of the Ministry 

of Planning and the Ministry in charge of Finance. The objective of external monitoring and 

evaluation is to assess the efficacy and efficiency of the programme’s outputs and their 

contribution to the achievement of the development objectives which are the programme 

outcomes and impacts. It will be carried out with the involvement of the other stakeholders in 

addition to two annual supervision missions organised by the Bank. The mid-term review will 

be carried out in year 3. Following the programme’s closure, the Bank and Government will 

produce a completion report within the required timeframe. 

4.5 Governance 

4.5.1 The government authorities’ efforts to improve good governance during the past five 

years have made some positive progress especially in the area of procurement.  However, these 

efforts have not yet produced any tangible results, insofar as the corruption perceptions index 

in Guinea still averages 25 compared to a regional average of 34 with a ranking of 143rd out of 

180 countries, virtually unchanged over the 2012-2017 period. The political, economic and 

social governance indicators for Guinea are, therefore, mixed despite the progress made in 

recent years. This is mainly due to poor performances in the areas of governance and the fight 

against corruption, the consequence of repeated political crises that have weakened the 

government institutions that are required to ensure regular monitoring of the governance system 

in Guinea. 

4.5.2 In light of the foregoing, the PDZTA-BK design includes capacity building support 

for actors as well as institutional support to contribute to the reduction of governance-related 

risks to the programme’s implementation.  This support concerns the preparation and 

establishment of financial management and monitoring and evaluation tools as well as the use 

of recognised   transparency and competitive methods in the PMU staff recruitment process and 

the establishment of a system to reduce procurement delays, one of the main reasons for the 

shortcomings noted in the performance of the development portfolio in Guinea despite the 

alignment of the public procurement system with regional guidelines. These procurement-

related operational measures will resolve the shortcomings raised. 

4.6 Sustainability 

4.6.1 The Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zones Development Programme (PDZTA-

BK) was designed on the basis of a participatory process initiated following the APZ dialogue 

mission to Guinea and throughout all the programme formulation stages, i.e. the PPF 

preparation as well as the preparation and appraisal missions concerning this proposal. This 

approach has helped to raise awareness among the population and central government of the 

economic importance of agricultural transformation by promoting the processing of agricultural 

production (agro-industrial), in addition to the technological innovations disseminated to 

farmers.  Against this backdrop, the key actors in growth-bearing sub-sectors will be 

sufficiently strengthened to guarantee the regular supply of raw materials on the basis of a plan 

that will ensure the sustainability of their jobs and incomes.  This system should ensure the 

autonomy of this development model whereby the agro-industrial enterprises established in the 



 

 

19 

 

parks operate with a guaranteed supply of raw materials and central government is assured of 

revenue from corporate taxes and dividends from the asset holding companies to be established 

to manage the agro-industrial parks.  

4.6.2 The agro-industrial park management system will be formalised through the 

establishment of an asset holding company with a clear legal status including land tenure.  The 

agro-industrial parks will be established, then managed in accordance with the existing 

investment code and the special status of the Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zones 

(SAIPZ). 

4.7 Risk Management  

4.7.1 Achievement of the PDZTA outcomes is subject to a number of risks for which it is 

necessary to find mitigation solutions in order to guarantee the programme’s success.  In 

addition to the risks already identified that are common to the entire portfolio, specific risks 

were identified and mitigation measures proposed:  

 

No. POTENTIAL RISKS MITIGATION MEASURES 

01 Lack of commitment of oversight authorities to 

support the coordination team and slippage on 

programme implementation 

The programme is one of central government’s 

priorities and was designed on the basis of the 

systematic consultation of stakeholders including 

representatives of the administration and 

municipalities concerned 

02 Risk of weak private sector mobilisation The programme was designed on the basis of a 

platform of exchange of information with the 

private sector whose concerns are taken into 

account in the programme’s final formulation, a 

guarantee of the SME involvement in, and 

ownership of, the programme 

03 Slow acceptance by certain stakeholders could 

delay the programme’s implementation 

The programme was designed on the basis of 

systematic sensitisation and consultation to ensure 

its gradual ownership by all stakeholders 

4.8 Knowledge Building  

4.8.1 The Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zones Development Programme (PDZTA-

BK) was designed to reflect the approach and principles of the Special Agro-Industrial 

Processing Zones (SAIPZ) Programme of the Bank’s 2016-2022 ‘Feed Africa’ Strategy.  The 

key to this programme’s success is the transformation of agriculture through the involvement 

of the private sector in a leadership role while central government will guarantee the conditions 

for its establishment and success.  To ensure its success, the PDZTA-BK was designed to build 

knowledge on how to work more effectively with the sector, either on the basis of a PPP formula 

or in the form of a non-sovereign operation (NSO), or a combination of the two formulae.  Its 

development will be guaranteed by private sector involvement on the basis of public sector 

financing. 

4.8.2 The other types of knowledge generated are: (i) a multi-sector approach involving the 

intervention of sectors such as transport, energy, water and sanitation, agribusiness, agriculture, 

communication (NICT), education, health and nutrition, employment and trade. At this level, it 

is necessary to generate a 2nd type of knowledge concerning the pooling of efforts in order to  

produce rapid results in the area of agricultural transformation (ii) a combination of: (a) two of 

the Bank’s strategies, namely ‘Feed Africa’  and ‘Jobs for Youth’, enhancing the skills of youth, 



 

 

20 

 

and (b) at least  four (04) flagship programmes, namely, the Special Agro-Industrial Processing 

Zones (SAPZs), Technologies for the African Agricultural Transformation (TAAT), 

Agricultural Value Chains (AVC), Post-Harvest Losses Reduction and ENABLE Youth 

Programmes. The combination of strategies and programmes is the third level of knowledge 

provided  by PDZTA-BK;  (iii) product processing, as a great challenge for which solutions 

will be sought under this programme is the third level of knowledge provided  by this operation; 

(iv) employment in general, and in the agricultural sector, in particular, as a solution proposed 

in the Programme is the fourth level of knowledge likely to be generated by this proposal; (v) a 

contribution to a reduction in the massive imports of agro-food products by the Continent, and 

by Guinea, in particular which offers a fifth level of knowledge  to be generated by the PDZTA-

BK. 

4.8.3 Lastly, this programme’s success will help to build a body of knowledge that could 

be replicated throughout the programme to develop ten (10) agricultural hubs in the country, 

including those of Boké and Kankan. 

V. Legal Framework 

5.1 Legal Instrument  

The legal framework for the PDZTA-BK will comprise two (2) Loan Agreements signed 

between the Republic of Guinea, on the one hand, and the African Development Bank and 

African Development Fund (collectively called ‘the Fund’), on the other, acting in their capacity 

as administrators of the Transition Support Fund (TSF).  

5.2 Conditions Associated with Bank’s Involvement 

5.2.1 Conditions precedent to effectiveness: effectiveness of the TSF Loan Agreement 

will be subject to fulfilment by the Borrower, to the Fund’s satisfaction, of the conditions set 

out in Section 12.01 of the General Conditions Applicable to the African Development Fund 

Loan Agreements and Guarantee Agreements (Sovereign Entities) of February 2009. 

5.2.2 Conditions precedent to the first loan disbursement: in addition to the respective 

effectiveness of the financing agreements, the first disbursements of the ADF loan, ADF Grant 

and TSF loan will be subject to fulfilment by the Borrower/Donee, to the Fund’s satisfaction, 

of the following conditions: 

(i) Providing the Bank with evidence of the establishment of the Programme 
Management Unit (PMU); 

(ii) Following a call for applications, providing the Bank with evidence of the 
recruitment of the Coordinator and Head of Administration and Finance, whose 

qualifications will be submitted for the Bank’s prior approval. 

5.2.3 Other Conditions: The Borrower shall, moreover, provide the Bank, no later than 

six (6) months after the first disbursement of Loan resources with: 

(i) Evidence of the establishment of the Steering and Monitoring Committee (COS), 
whose composition and operational provisions will have been submitted for the 

Bank’s prior approval; and 



 

 

21 

 

(ii) The Agreements with the Administration structures, the Guinean Institute for 

Agricultural Research (IRAG), the Private Investment Promotion Agency (APIP) 
and Ministries and Technical Agencies involved in the programme. 

 

5.3 Compliance with Bank Policies  

This programme complies with all the Bank’s applicable policies. The programme will be 

implemented as part of the Bank’s intervention strategy for Guinea defined in the CSP (2018-

2022).

POLITICAL, INSTITUTIONAL AND 

SECURITY FACTORS  

 

1. Legitimate Policies and Political Governance (legitimacy, inclusiveness, State-building and 

confidence in State Institutions 

Legitimacy: Guinea experienced recurrent contestation of its 

legitimacy from independence until the adoption of a new democratic 

and pluralistic constitution in 2010. The situation of political and 

institutional instability experienced until then improved following the 

holding of the first multiparty elections which elected the incumbent 

Head of State as the country’s leader and installed a National Assembly 

composed of several political parties.  The easing of political tension 

observed was bolstered by a series of structural reforms of the 

Republic’s institutions. Despite the recurrent protests of the opposition 

parties which are constantly challenging the neutrality of those 

institutions in charge of elections and the Constitution, any revision of 

the latter would probably increase the opposition’s distrust of the 

government and weaken the rediscovered social cohesion. The issue of 

a third term as well as the expiry of the current term of the National 

Assembly remain as pockets of institutional fragility and present a 

political risk that could reverse Guinea’s trend towards societal 

resilience.  

 

 The Boké and Kankan Special Agro-

Industrial Processing Zones 

Development Programme (PDZTA)  

will contribute indirectly to 

overcoming certain obstacles relating 

to political and spatial inclusion and 

reducing intercommunity tensions 

created by a feeling of exclusion. The 

type of actions promoted by the 

project are in keeping with the 

Government’s vision of consolidating 

its interventions throughout the 

country through development 

activities.

Partners (TFP) 

Measures by AfDB’s intervention 

under  PDZTA-BK  (2019-2022) 

Governance: In recent years Guinea has implemented a series of reforms 

aimed at improving its situation. The Government, supported by its 

technical and financial partners, has established an administrative 

modernisation programme. From 2014 it has carried out a biometric 

census of all civil servants. This led to the identification of almost 10.5% 

of fictitious civil servants and resulted in monthly savings of about 2.2 

million euros. Furthermore, additional management controls such as the 

recording of salaries, the crosschecking of civil service files with those of 

the National Social Security Fund and the physical control of employees 

with electronic time clocks helped to identify bottlenecks and remove civil 

servants with two jobs. The capacities of the Guinean Administration 

remain weakened at both the central and local levels in the areas of 

management and procurement but also in the preparation, implementation 

and monitoring and evaluation of development projects and programmes 

and assimilation of the principle of accountability. 

Transparency: Furthermore, despite reasonable progress, the perception 

of corruption remains high according to Transparency International’s 

Corruption Perceptions Index (105th ranking in 2018 compared to 148th 

ranking out of 180 countries in 2017) and the recent Governance 

Diagnosis for Guinea carried out by the National Institute of Statistics 

according to which 9 out of 10 Guineans surveyed consider corruption to 

be one of the most serious problems marking Guinean society at present. 

Public-private partnership (PPP) has no formal consultation framework 

and is sometimes misused to award direct contracts.  Other challenges 

include lack of transparency in the management and concession of natural 

resources, land tenure rights and, increasingly, central government’s 

inability to combat drug trafficking, organised crime and corruption. 

Indeed, the lack of transparency and good governance in the award of 

public contracts and large-scale allocation of land for agricultural, mining 

and forest resource exploitation through the abusive use of private use 

 The Boké and Kankan Special Agro-

Industrial Processing Zones 

Development Programme (PDZTA) 

will enhance the governance system in 

general and establish a legal and 

judicial framework for APZ which, 

when the programme closes, could be 

used as a model to consolidate the 

progress already made with regard to 

administrative governance.

permits are symptomatic of major unresolved problems and weaknesses 

in natural resource governance and persistent shortcomings of the land 

tenure framework. These issues continue to pose major challenges for 

peace and security in rural areas.   
2.      Issues of security and violence, capacity and performance of the security sector 

Security: While the security situation has considerably improved since the 

advent of democracy in 2010, incidents have continued to periodically occur 
that could potentially destabilise the situation, which justifies the continuing 

efforts to implement structural actions in the security sector. The first actions 

in this direction were encouraging, since over 4,000 soldiers were retired 
following the advent of democracy and the efforts made to professionalise 

the armed forces appear to be delivering results
7
 with support from the 

technical and financial partners. Indeed, the reform programme includes

action to build the capacities of the armed forces and key civil institutions 

such as the Ministries of Defence and Interior. The restructuring of the police 

and establishment of community policing to combat crime and violence, 

especially in urban centres, are also part of the reforms. It is, however, 
necessary to limit the systematic involvement of the Defence and Security 

Forces (DSF) in the country’s economic and political life and to provide them 

with sufficient resources to effectively perform their duties.  

The Boké and Kankan Special Agro-

Industrial Processing Zones 

Development Programme (PDZTA) 

does not contribute directly to the 

security factor but provides solutions 

to mitigate risks that could deteriorate 

the security situation in the 

programme area.  

3. Justice sector (inclusive access to justice, rule of law and judicial independence and countervailing 
mechanisms 

A weakened justice system: The previous and recurring crises in 

Guinea have had a negative impact on the judiciary. Already 

unstructured by the different causes of fragility, it was exploited for  

political ends by all the political actors and appears to be undermined 

by the lack of independence, corruption problems and lack of technical

and material resources. The Government and development partners 

consider justice reform to be a priority sector. An overall reform 

programme has been embarked upon.  One of its measures is to 

increase the number of judges, establish a Supreme Council of Judges 

and reform certain Codes in particular those pertaining to business. 

Despite the modest progress made, these bodies are gradually being 

restored. The system’s malfunctioning remains structural and long-

term efforts are necessary to improve the situation.

vulnerable segments of the 

population, especially women and 

young people. 

ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL FACTORS  

 

4.        Strengthening of economic and community resilience (equitable access to infrastructure and 

benefits of natural resources) 

Natural resources management: Management of Guinea’s 

considerable natural resources still falls far short of achieving the 

desired objectives of improving the living conditions of its population, 

which remains poor even though, paradoxically, the country is rich in 

natural resources. Guinea is relatively less rich with gross domestic 

product (GDP) of about USD 9.86 billion in 2018 for a population of 

12 million people. Guinea’s current growth trend is chiefly explained 

by income from a new extraction of natural resources. As long as 

strong collaborative measures are not taken to improve natural 

resources management, the country could find itself in a natural 

resource trap (‘natural resource curse’).  Furthermore, the type of 

growth generated by natural resources is characterised by wide income 

disparities that are isolationist and fragmented 

The Boké and Kankan Special Agro-

Industrial Processing Zones 

Development Programme also 

addresses the issue of natural 

resources, in particular, land and 

water. The Programme contains 

measures to support the renewal and 

building of the capacities  of 

institutions involved in the 

management of water as a means to 

improve the management of the 

resources in the programme area 

SOCIAL FACTORS: POVERTY AND 

INEQUALITY  

 

5. Increase resource mobilisation to create opportunities for jobs, income and inclusive access to social 

services, focused on the critical role of central government, enhancement of financial governance, and 

appropriate refocusing of government's role 

Inequalities: Regional disparities are glaring and rural areas are 

hardest hit by poverty. Population pressure, driven by a high birth rate, 

creates additional pressure on the country’s living standards which are

already greatly strained. Rapid and runaway urbanisation is another 

type of social pressure that does not spare urban communities and by 

extrapolation, empties rural areas of the work force required to tap into 

agricultural wealth and accelerates the deterioration of ageing and 

sometimes inadequate infrastructure in urban areas. Moreover, the 

majority of the population, in particular, women and young people are 

socially marginalised and lack economic and political opportunities. 

The restoration of social cohesion and inclusive growth, guarantees of 

stability and prosperity for all Guineans is essential. In addition, the 

population’s food security, the most common features of which are 

abundant rainfall for a successful crop year, the population’s access to 

basic social services, the availability of able-bodied labour for harvests, 

political stability and the absence of disasters such as natural calamities 

or epidemics.  Over 32 % of Guinean rural households were in a 

situation of food insecurity9 in 2015 and this relatively low rate before 

the Ebola virus disease crisis, could rise in the event of a new epidemic. 

The thorny issue of reconciliation between excellent land use for 

agriculture and mines arouses feelings of insecurity among the local 

population concerned by illegal occupancy and ownership of their 

land. Despite the law, therefore, land control remains a source of 

community and intergenerational tensions. This time bomb must be 

urgently defused politically, legally and urgently to prevent it 

becoming a source of conflict in the country. 

addresses spatial inequalities 

accumulated over several years and 

provides fresh momentum for 

balanced territorial development. The 

programme also aims to empower 

local communities to initiate 

transformative projects that will boost 

employment dynamics. 

Sources of income: Despite its significant potential resources, the 

Guinean economy remains very fragile and dependent on bauxite and 

agriculture. Bauxite is Guinea’s main economic resource and accounts 

for 14.42 % of overall production. Bauxite and agriculture contribute

13% and 20.2% respectively to GDP formation in terms of export 

revenue. Agriculture alone is a challenge for about 56% of Guinea’s 

work force. The sector provides employment for over half of the 

country’s work force, a large proportion of which is female, and 

remains one of the drivers of economic growth. Therefore, the 

volatility of world mining product prices remains likely to harm the 

country’s economy with serious social consequences. Many studies 

have found that "countries whose economies depend on the export of a 

limited number of primary commodities are more likely to be 

politically fragile and marked by conflicts”.  

industrialisation of the Guinean 

economy. The high potential agro-

industrial sub-sectors selected by the 

programme will be growth drivers 

through the processing of raw 

materials which will help to reduce 

the country’s dependency on the 

mining sector. 

Regulatory framework (central government’s role in the provision 

of services): Unfortunately, Guinea is disadvantaged by not having 

had high quality infrastructure assets since it gained independence. 

Investment in the development of priority infrastructure to improve the 

quality of service delivery by central government to the population is 

one of the government’s leitmotifs for its development programme in 

all sectors of activity likely to bring about a change in the population’s 

living standards and provide economic opportunities. Although 

progress has been noted in the energy sector despite persisting wide 

regional disparities, public utility-related sectors (water, waste, ICT 

and transport) are struggling to take off because of a lack of rapid and 

efficient actions and also because of funding delays. The uneven 

distribution of public services between the regions and segments of the 

population could in the longer term weaken the rediscovered social 

peace and cohesion unless corrective measures are taken to reverse the 

trend. 

The Boké and Kankan Special Agro-

Industrial Processing Zones 

Development Programme is part of a 

multi-sector approach whose 

completed activities will increase the 

number of socio-economic facilities 

in the programme area as well as the 

number of people or households with 

access to public utility easements in 

the areas of drinking water, electricity, 

transport, education, health and 

markets.

PROGRAMME SUMMARY 

Overview: Mali covers an area of 1,241,238 km² and the rural sector is the mainspring of its 

development, with agriculture accounting for 45% of GDP, providing employment for 80% of 

the total population and generating more than 75% of export earnings. However, it is constantly 

subject to climatic hazards, degradation of its natural resources (degradation of soil, water, air, 

vegetation, biodiversity, climate, etc.) and deterioration of terms of trade (steady drop in the 

prices of its agricultural export products), which limit the incomes of the rural population and 

expose them, particularly young people, to immigration. 

The degradation of natural resources results in land production loss of 6.5 T/ha/year, which 

corresponds to significant losses of soil nutrients, with a financial impact of up to CFAF 

90,000/ha/year (Strategic Investment Framework for Sustainable Land Management (SIF-

SLM)). All the environmental degradation-related factors (soil erosion, deforestation, air, 

quality of life, water and solid waste, wildlife heritage, mineral resources, etc.) have a 

significant impact on GDP which has declined from 26.5% to 20.9%. 

In addition, the value-added created by the agro-industry sector (biscuits, pasta, confectionery, 

canning industry, brewery, bakery, oil works, sugar refinery, dairy products, textile and 

tobacco) fell by 46.61% from XOF 1,465.64 billion in 2013 to XOF 782.48 billion in 2014. 

This trend is continuing, with annual agro-food imports for about EUR 597 million to fill the 

gap. The foreign exchange losses are enormous, and high enough to develop the entire 

programme of the country's twelve (12) agricultural growth poles (agropoles). 

The Development Programme for the Special Agro-industrial Processing Zone of Koulikoro 

and Semi-urban Bamako Regions (PDZSTA-KB) is a proposal to reverse the downward trend 

in agro-industry value added in Mali and disseminate agricultural development technologies 

that can slow down the degradation of natural resources, thereby creating conditions for 

sustainable agriculture, with the support of an additional contribution of the Italian Government 

to TSF Pilar I. The programme will include sustainable land management (SLM) at each stage 

of the proposed technical itineraries, within and outside irrigation areas, unlike extensive or 

intensive agricultural practices that foster the excessive use of agrochemicals. 

The Bank's intervention will help to develop two (2) major regions of Mali with an area of 

28,571.43 km² (2.30% of the country's total area), a population of 1.6 million inhabitants 

(8.63% of the total population in 2017) and an annual growth rate of 3.4%. The population 

density of 56 inhabitants/km² is well above the national average of 14 inhabitants/km². 

Consequently, there is heavy pressure on natural resources, which are rapidly deteriorating in 

the absence of any strong action to control, monitor and curb the trend. 

Needs Assessment: The programme area covers two (2) regions (Koulikoro and Semi-urban 

Bamako) whose irrigation and socio-economic development requires facilities for the 

production and processing of agricultural products that constitute the regions’ potential. The 

programme involves establishing an agro-industrial park to process products upstream and 

serve as an outlet for marketing agricultural products, thereby helping to reduce all-out import 

of agro-food products whose volume and incurred expenditure are becoming alarming.  

In accordance with the country's strategic guidelines, the programme will contribute to the 

processing of agricultural products, while improving the productivity and production of growth 

sectors. This will reduce imports of various agro-food products, with the main outcome of 

transforming Malian agriculture and improving food and nutrition security. 



 

 

 

v 

Added Value for the Bank: PDZSTA-KB seeks to support Mali in its agricultural 

transformation programme by promoting private investment, as well as creating conditions and 

providing incentives likely to attract the national and international private sector to establish in 

Bacoumana agro-industrial park (AIP). The conditions and measures include: (i) adopting 

measures that can create an enabling business environment for the establishment of agro-

industrial enterprises in the agro-industrial park; (ii) constructing physical and smart long-term 

infrastructure to facilitate the establishment of private companies, their operations, and 

transactions related to their activities; and (iii) improving the operation of growth sectors. This 

innovative approach was proposed as a flagship programme of the Bank's Feed Africa Strategy 

2016-2025, known as the Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zones (SAPZs) Flagship 

Programme. It proposes an approach to increase private investment in the agricultural sector, 

with the Government creating favourable conditions. Therefore, this is an area in which the 

Bank has experience and expertise. It can also raise internal financial resources, as well as 

additional resources from its technical and financial partners and private banks, relying on its 

“Triple A” rating. The Bank has also gained experience in developing this type of operation in 

Togo, Ethiopia, Guinea, DRC, Zambia and Tanzania. Hence, it can develop this operation with 

a high probability of success.  

Knowledge Building and Management: The implementation of the Development Programme 

for Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zones (PDZSTA-KB) will provide a wealth of 

knowledge that can be replicated throughout the country's twelve (12) agricultural development 

poles, including those in Koulikoro and Semi-urban Bamako Regions. The knowledge 

concerns: (i) the best way to work with the private sector, through a PPP approach or as a non-

sovereign operation (NSO), or a combination of both; (ii) the multi-sector approach, involving 

sectors such as transport, energy, water and sanitation, agro-industry, agriculture, 

communication (NICT), education, health and nutrition, employment and trade; (iii) a 

combination of: (a) two Bank Strategies, namely "Feed Africa" and Skills Development, 

especially for young people, and (b) at least four (4) flagship programmes, namely, Special 

Agro-Industrial Processing Zones (SAPZ), Technologies for African Agricultural 

Transformation (TAAT), Agricultural Value Chains (AVC), Post-Harvest Loss Reduction and 

Youth Employability (Enable Youth);  (iv) product processing, as a major development 

challenge for which solutions will be sought in this programme; (v) employment in general and 

in the agricultural sector in particular, as a solution proposed in the programme; and (vi) 

contribution to reducing massive agro-food imports from the continent, and from Mali, in 

particular.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION BY BANK GROUP MANAGEMENT TO THE 

BOARD OF DIRECTORS ON A DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME FOR SPECIAL 

AGRO-INDUSTRIAL PROCESSING ZONES IN BOKE AND KANKAN 

 
Management submits this report and its recommendation concerning a proposal for an ADF 

Grant of UA 1.42 million, a TSF Grant of UA 2.262 million (including an additional 

contribution of the Republic of Italy to  TSF Pillar I of EUR 1.38 million, i.e. UA 1.102 

million), and a TSF Loan of UA 10.50 million, from the ADF and TSF country allocation, to 

the Government of the Republic of Mali to finance the activities of PDZSTA-KB, which is the 

Pilot Phase of Mali’s Agropoles Development Programme. 

I. STRATEGIC THRUST AND RATIONALE 

Programme Linkages with Country Strategy and Objectives 

1.1.1. The programme is consistent with three (3) of the five (5) strategic pillars of the 

Strategic Framework for Economic Recovery and Sustainable Development (CREDD) 2019-

2023, namely: (i) Inclusive growth and structural transformation of the economy (Pillar 3); (ii) 

Environmental protection and building resilience to climate change; and (iii) Human capital 

development. CREDD serves as a framework for intervention by Mali's various Technical and 

Financial Partners. It is aligned with the MDGs and the objectives of the African Union's 

Agenda 2063, and aims at "A well-governed Mali, where harmonious coexistence of the various 

components of the society is restored, peace consolidated and collective and individual security 

ensured in unity, cohesion and diversity, where the wealth creation process is inclusive and 

environment-friendly, and where human capital is developed for the benefit of the population, 

particularly young people and women".  

1.1.2 At sector level, CREDD is implemented under Mali's Agricultural Development 

Policy (PDA) and includes the Development Programme for the Special Agro-Industrial 

Processing Zones of Koulikoro and Semi-urban Bamako (PDZSTA-KB). It is also implemented 

through its priority activities of developing agricultural products, protecting livelihoods and 

resilience to climate change, and enhancing human capital. The activities will, as a result of 

improved living conditions, promote sedentary lifestyles and reduce migration among the 

population. Therefore, PDZSTA-KB is a PDA operational programme which guides efforts 

towards achieving 6% growth in agricultural added value and allocating 15% of the State budget 

to the agricultural sector (10% in Maputo Commitment). Indeed, PDZSTA-KB is fully 

consistent with the country's strategic objectives. 

Programme Alignment with Bank Policy 

1.2.1 The Bank's intervention, through PDZSTA-KB which is the pilot phase of a 

programme for twelve (12) agropoles, is considered a priority by the Bank. Consequently, the 

Bank has made the strategic choice of transforming Malian agriculture, as reflected in Pillar II 

of CSP 2015-2019: "Infrastructure development to support economic recovery". The 

programme is also consistent with three (3) of the High 5s, namely: (i) Feed Africa (Strategy 

for Agricultural Transformation in Africa 2016-2025); (iii) Industrialise Africa; (iv) Integrate 

Africa; and (v) Improve the quality of life for the people of Africa. The programme’s alignment 

with Bank policy is further underscored by the fact that it will also help to enhance the 

transformation of Malian agriculture, boost industrialisation, and increase Mali's energy 

capacity. Specifically, it will help to promote smart agriculture, with product processing on all 

links of the priority value chains fostered under this programme.

Rationale for Bank Intervention 

1.3.1 The rural sector is the mainspring of Mali's development. It accounts for 45% of GDP, 

employs 80% of the total population, and generates more than 75% of export earnings. 

Therefore, agriculture is the main source of income for the rural population. However, 

agriculture is constantly subject to climatic hazards, degradation of natural resources 

(degradation of soil, water, air, vegetation, biodiversity, climate, etc.), and deterioration of 

terms of trade (steady drop in the prices of agricultural export products), which limit the 

incomes of the rural population. Indeed, the degradation of natural resources stems from 

inappropriate agricultural practices, and is the main cause of recurrent drought, leading to rapid 

destruction of livelihoods and threatening Mali's future, with negative effects on the country's 

food and nutrition security. All the environmental degradation-related factors (soil erosion, 

deforestation, air, quality of life, water and solid waste, wildlife heritage, mineral resources, 

etc.) have contributed to GDP decline from 26.5% to 20.9%. 

1.3.2 The deterioration of terms of trade is due to the low level of transformation of Mali's 

agriculture, and therefore of Mali’s economy. The value-added created by the agro-industry 

sector (biscuits, pasta, confectionery, canning industry, brewery, bakery, oil works, sugar 

refinery, dairy products, textile and tobacco) fell by 46.61% from XOF 1,465.64 billion in 2013 

to XOF 782.48 billion in 2014. This trend is continuing, and Mali is forced to import the 

equivalent of about EUR 597 million worth of agro-food products each year to fill the gap. The 

foreign exchange losses are enormous, and high enough to develop the entire programme of the 

country's twelve (12) agropoles. 

1.3.3 PDZSTA-KB is a proposal to reverse the downward trend in agro-industry value-

added in Mali and disseminate agricultural development technologies that can slow down the 

degradation of natural resources, thereby creating conditions for sustainable agriculture. The 

first principle of the programme is to group all the companies within an agro-industrial park 

(AIP) serviced to the required standards so as to avoid disorganised installations that breach 

environmental protection requirements. The second principle of PDZSTA-KB is that the AIP 

will be supplied with inputs from land developed in accordance with practices that include 

sustainable land management (SLM) at each stage of the proposed technical itineraries, within 

and outside irrigation areas, unlike the current inadequate agricultural practices in the area. The 

third principle is to upgrade the skills of young people and women in growth agricultural value 

chains and enable them to effectively benefit from future jobs that will be created within the 

AIPs. In the process, the programme will create conditions that promote sedentary lifestyles 

and reduce migration from the programme area to other countries or to hazardous gold panning 

activities. 

1.3.4 Since the programme incorporates the Bank's relevant strategies, it will effectively 

boost economic development by consolidating the role of the private sector and communities 

in rural development to ensure inclusiveness in Africa and in Mali, in particular. Furthermore, 

its design is based on complementarities with operations underway and/or being developed, 

particularly operations relating to women’s economic empowerment in the shea sector 

(PAEFEK). It also seeks to strengthen food and nutrition security in Koulikoro region 

(PRESAN-KL), as well as enhance food security by developing irrigated crops (PRESA-DCI). 

Such complementarity will contribute to the search for synergies in interventions. Therefore, 

this programme will strive to benefit from ongoing activities in Koulikoro and semi-urban 

Bamako regions, particularly the operations of the World Bank (PATAM, etc.) and IsDB, so as 

to ensure its relevance and effectiveness on the ground.

Aid Coordination 

1.4.1 Development assistance is coordinated by the Government of Mali, through the 

following three (3) consultation and coordination mechanisms: (i) At the general and policy 

level, a Troika; (ii) at the sector and thematic level, and (iii) at the sub-sector level. All TFPs 

align their interventions with the priorities of the Malian Government. In the rural development 

sector, the TFPs are organised around the Agricultural and Rural Economy Thematic Group 

(ARETG), which coordinates activities related to the sector. The group has two subgroups: 

"Livestock and Fisheries" and "Food and Nutrition Security ", as well as an "Irrigation" Focal 

Point replacing the Irrigation Sub-Group, which has been abolished. The AfDB, WB, IFAD, 

IsDB, GIZ, AFD, Netherlands and FAO are the main financial partners in the rural sector. As 

regards Mali’s external financing, the Bank comes second to the World Bank, with 13% of the 

financing. 

1.4.2 The Bank, through COML, is an active member of the CCC and some Thematic 

Groups (TG), particularly the Environment and Climate Change TG comprising UNDP, 

Sweden, Belgium, Norway, European Union, Canada, World Bank, UNCDF, France, Spain 

and Netherlands. The Bank works closely with the TFPs in this group in GEF activities. Such 

collaboration facilitates the exchange of best practice.

II. PROGRAMME DESCRIPTION 

Programme Components 

2.1.1 The Development Programme for the Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zone in 

Koulikoro and Semi-Urban Bamako Regions (PDZSTA-KB) is the Pilot Phase of a 

development programme for twelve (12) agro-industrial processing zones. It is intended to help 

reduce agro-food imports and improve food and nutrition security in Mali by establishing 

private sector-led agro-industrial development poles. The poles will address migration-related 

fragility factors in Koulikoro area by promoting sedentary lifestyles among the population, 

especially young people, who suffer from problems of deterioration of livelihoods (natural 

resources), climate change, "sahelisation" and extremely rapid desert encroachment. The 

programme will be implemented through the following four (4) components: (i) Establishment 

of Governance in the Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zones (SAPZs); (ii) Development of 



 

4 

 

Transformation and Access Infrastructure; (iii) Capacity Building for Key Stakeholders of 

Growth Sectors; and (iv) Programme Coordination and Management.  

2.1.2 The programme will be based on production activities, as well as the construction of 

access and marketing infrastructure for ongoing operations or operations under appraisal for 

2019, upstream Bancoumana agro-industrial park, for the supply of inputs for the pilot phase. 

The operations are the Bank's PRESAN-KL (UA 36.06 million), the Bank's Programme for 

Enhancing Food Security through Irrigated Crop Development (PRESA-DCI) (UA 36.00 

million), and the Bank's Women’s Economic Empowerment Project in the Shea Sector 

(PAEFFK (UA 5.63 million). This requires supplementary financing amounting to the 

equivalent of EUR 97.27 million. In addition to these Bank portfolio operations, other donors 

are very active in the programme area, particularly the World Bank, IsDB, European Union, 

etc. Under these conditions, the pilot phase of the programme will not be exposed to the risk of 

lack of input production and supplies to Bancoumana agro-park, if the activities are properly 

coordinated between the various operations mentioned above.

Technical Solutions Adopted and Alternatives Considered 

2.2.1 PDZSTA-KB seeks to address the central issue of the transformation of Malian 

agriculture in a way that puts the private sector in a leading role, while the public sector 

strives to create incentive conditions that will attract private investors to developed and 

serviced agro-industrial parks. It is an agricultural development approach that creates 

Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zones (SAPZs). The SAPZs are spatial development 

initiatives based on agriculture and designed to concentrate agricultural transformation 

activities in areas with high agricultural potential so as to boost productivity and integrate 

the production, processing and marketing of a number of agricultural inputs. The initiatives 

may or may not have Special Economic Zone status. They are, in some cases, also known 

as Agro-Industial Parks, Agribusiness Parks, Mega Food Parks, Agropoles, Agro-Clusters, 

etc. 

2.2.2 It is an integrated and pragmatic approach that has innovations, is inclusive on all 

links of agricultural value chains (AVCs) and creates wealth through the jobs it generates. 

It also creates wealth by reducing foreign exchange outflows as a result of cuts in agro-food 

imports. The approach also reduces emigration by promoting sedentary lifestyles among the 

population who now find huge employment opportunities and wealth creation at their 

doorstep. In addition, it pools the efforts of all other sectors that contribute to the success 

of agricultural development, particularly industry, transport, energy, water and NICT, even 

within the Bank. It also includes interventions by other development partners in the 

systematic search for complementarity to generate synergy. In the case of PDZSTA-KB, 

the development partners are the World Bank, IFAD, European Union, BCEAO, IsDB, etc. 

2.2.5 Therefore, SAPZ technical solutions break with the traditional approach of 

improving productivity, production and sales, without specifying their content .

Single-sector approach, 

based on agriculture 

Sector approach based exclusively on 

agricultural activities 

It does not include other development 

sectors that have an impact on agricultural 

development and therefore constitute 

success factors for this sector. 

Use of the Bank's public 

resources mainly 

The programmes are financed mainly from 

the resources of the Bank's public window and 

those of the Government 

AVC financing needs to go beyond the 

Bank's public resources, as they include 

private sector financing, co-financing from 

development partners, and non-sovereign 

operations. 

Dissemination of 

technological innovations 

according to the 

conventional method of 

training and visit to 

producers 

Approach based on regular visits to producers, 

according to a specific schedule and based on 

a control framework with tools such as 

contact group (CG), observation point (OP), 

and system study point (SSP) 

In addition to being cumbersome and costly, 

this method has shown its limitations in the 

past and is less effective than the client-

supplier system, which focuses on 

developing skills in all relevant fields of 

activity. 

Programme Type 

The Development Programme for Special Agro-industrial Processing Zones (PDZSTA-BK) is 

a programme that is facilitated by the public sector through major public investments to 

stimulate private sector interest in investing in growth by providing leadership to the 

programme, particularly in the processing of agricultural products, the supply of agricultural 

inputs and services, and marketing. It is a programme that will be implemented in several 

phases, depending on successive ADF allocations and mobilisation of additional resources from 

development partners. 

Programme Cost and Financing Arrangements  

2.1.1 Programme Cost: The overall cost of the twelve (12) agropoles programme is estimated 
at UA 660 million (about EUR 826.32 million), with the first phase estimated at UA 55.00 million 

(XOF 45.17 billion) which will start with a pilot operation estimated at UA 16.26 million (XOF 

13.36 billion), exclusive of tax and customs duty. This cost comprises UA 8.83 million (XOF 7.25 

billion) in foreign exchange and UA 7.44 million (XOF 6.11 billion) in local currency. It also 

includes provisions for physical contingencies and price escalation, which are estimated at an 

average of 3% and 4% respectively. The provision for price escalation was estimated on the basis 

of current and programmed levels of cost inflation rates in local and foreign currencies of 2.5% and 

1.8% respectively per year on average. The provision for physical contingencies is estimated at 

between 0 and 7%. A summary of the programme cost estimate by component and expenditure 

category is presented in the tables below.

Programme Area and Beneficiaries 

2.5.1 The programme area covers three districts, namely Kangaba, Kati and Koulikoro, in 

addition to Bamako District, with a population of 1.6 million inhabitants, of whom at least 79% 

are employed in agriculture. The site identified for the agro-industrial park is located in Kati 

District, Siby District, and Bancoumana rural municipality, 50 km from Bamako District. The 

area has Mali's most vulnerable communities due mainly to the alarming degradation of natural 

resources, climate change and the misperception of gold panning and migration as lucrative 

ventures. The entire programme area will cover 60,000 ha and will directly affect at least one-

third of the agricultural population, or about 421,000 people, and indirectly affect at least 1.2 

million people. The area is economically very dynamic, with the exploitation of precious 

minerals. Therefore, the programme area will include development works already financed by 

the Bank covering an area of about 2,921 ha, an agro-park of about 200 ha in Bancoumana, as 

well as areas outside the scope of this programme, i.e. more than 60,000 ha. 

2.5.2 The programme area’s population is young, with an average age of about 20 years. 

The population under 15 years of age accounts for 50.8% of the total population. On the other 

hand, the 15-59 age group accounts for 45.1% of the total population. Specifically, Bancoumana 

rural municipality has a population of 23,577 inhabitants (GPHC 2009), with 10,456 men and 

11,635 women, and 48 and 52% respectively of the population.  The young people tend to 

migrate to other economic sectors such as gold panning or very often to other countries in the 

sub-region and the West because of natural challenges and economic realities with very few 

alternatives. 

Participatory Approach to Programme Identification, Design and  Implementation  

2.6.1 The participatory approach, based on consultation, was the guiding principle for the 

programme design. The approach was adopted for discussions and consultations with officials 

of the relevant ministries (Agriculture, Industry, Transport, Energy, Trade, etc.), public 

administrations, the private sector, local authorities (Bancoumana, Kangaba and Kati), farmer 

organisations, civil society and TFPs (IsDB, BOAD, BCEAO, World Bank, European Union, 

and bilateral cooperation agencies). It was implemented in the following stages: (i) the country 

team prepared and proposed the terms of reference for the environmental and social 

assessments; (ii) the Bank team drafted a programme preparation report; (iii) the programme 

document was reviewed for approval by the Board of Directors; (iv) there were broad 

stakeholder consultations during the programme preparation in Bamako and Bancoumana, 

particularly in the assessment of environmental safeguard measures required for environmental 

categorisation and publication of the summary Strategic Environmental and Social Assessment

(SESA) report; (v) the consultations continued during the appraisal mission, field visits to 

Bancoumana, meetings with all stakeholders and key actors (civil society, public 

administration, private sector, and technical and financial partners) in Bamako. 

2.6.2 This proposal is also a response to strong demand from grassroots communities 

because despite the huge potential of the regions concerned, there was inadequate agricultural 

development in the areas. The participatory approach will continue during the programme 

implementation through: (i) a steering structure with representatives of all the parties; (ii) 

capacity building in participatory approach for the institutions and communities; and (iii) 

community involvement in the implementation of activities; and (iv) implementation of a 

monitoring and evaluation system focused on programme outcomes.  In addition, the Bank's 

Country Office in Mali will, on a permanent basis, ensure that the consultation platform is 

operational throughout the programme implementation. 

Bank Group Experience and Lessons reflected in Programme Design 

2.7.1 PDZSTA formulation incorporates lessons learned from the Bank's past and ongoing 

operations in Mali and across regional member countries, taking into account portfolio 

performance issues and the country's fragility. The lessons were included in the last review. 

The Bank's active portfolio in Mali has twenty-three (23) operations (with 3 regional and 3 

private sector) for an approved amount of UA 430.3 million. The gross disbursement rate for 

operations that have already started their activities is 35%. At the end of the review, the 

performance of the Bank's national public portfolio in Mali in 2018 was deemed satisfactory 

with a rating of 3 out of 4.  However, it noted that more efforts were needed to focus more on 

the following aspects: (i) the need for the baseline situation and measurable performance 

indicators; (ii) the importance of effective supervision and regular meetings with stakeholders; 

(iii) the need for an integrated approach that involves key stakeholders of the sector; (iv) the 

utility of a good communication plan; (v) the need for a good selection mechanism for 

contractors eligible for projects; (vi) the need to strengthen the technical and managerial 

capacities of social groups, particularly young people and women entrepreneurs, in addition to 

access to financing; and (vii) initiatives should not be limited to a percentage of women (30%). 

2.7.2 The Portfolio Performance Improvement Plan (PPIP 2018) also recommended specific 

measures to accelerate programme implementation. Incorporating the recommendations in this 

proposal has resulted in: (i) maintaining dialogue with stakeholders, and ensuring close 

monitoring by the Bank's Country Office (COML) to reduce risks of delays in timeframes and 

processes for PDZSTA-KB implementation and management in general, and for fulfilling the 

effectiveness conditions; (ii) improving the quality of projects at entry by resorting to advance 

contracting for the preparation of bidding documents and management tools (Accounting and 

Financial Procedures Manual, Computerised Accounting and Financial Management System, 

and monitoring and evaluation before programme start-up; and (iii) capacity building for project 

management teams in procurement and financial management. It should also be noted that the 

age of the current portfolio operations has significantly reduced over the past few years, with 

the average age reducing from 5.5 years in 2011 to 2.7 years in 2017, and there were no problem 

(PP) or potentially problematic (PPP) operations in 2017.  

2.7.3 Therefore, the PDZSTA design has reflected the lessons learned from previous 

operations by drawing on PPIP 2018 to meet design and implementation criteria as specified in 

the Bank’s Presidential Directive No. 002/2015.

III. PROGRAMME FEASIBILITY 

Economic and Financial Performance 

3.1.1 The programme is designed to mainly generate direct benefits in terms of the 

processing of crops promoted and developed through private investments to establish agro-

industries, i.e. about 35 units on Bancoumana agro-industrial park, for the programme period. 

In addition to the impact on private companies located in Bancoumana agro-industrial park, 

significant incomes will be generated by the beneficiaries of the agricultural sites also 

developed, from which companies will be supplied with the inputs already mentioned in Section 

2.2, namely: maize, shea butter, sesame, milk, rice, mango, groundnuts, livestock/meat, 



 

11 

 

tomatoes, poultry, and non-wood forest products such as honey, leaves, wild seeds and fruits, 

oils and resins, herbal tea, etc.). 

3.1.2 In addition to these benefits, the programme is designed to generate other benefits such 

as: (i) climate regulation functions by setting up a forest cover of 8.00 ha, thus creating the 

conditions for intelligent, and therefore sustainable agriculture; (ii) improving the well-being 

of populations by preventing drought and famine, improving food security, reducing the 

medical bill with the regulation of climatic conditions, reducing the hardship of women and 

vulnerable groups, improving people's life expectancy, better incomes to access health and 

education, etc.; (iii) improving all livestock and livestock production, due to the quality and 

abundance of pasture and water; (iv) improving the effects of carbon sequestration (carbon 

credit); and (v) the creation of temporary and permanent jobs, resulting from the programme's 

gains, resulting from the programme's estimated gains of 50 to 500 per processing unit (i.e. 

5,250, at the level of agribusiness units alone, for an average of 150 jobs per industrial unit) 

3.1.3 Financial Analysis: Many of the above impacts are not commercially tradable, or even 

tangible, and therefore do not lend themselves to financial performance analysis based on 

existing markets. In these circumstances, it was not considered appropriate to include them in 

a quantitative analysis based on production models or profit-making activities.  However, it was 

possible to carry out a benefit/cost analysis of agro-industrial business models and various 

agricultural production models (FARMOD). 

3.1.4 As regards agro-industrial enterprises, an assumption is proposed on the basis of three 

(3) types of processing units, namely small, medium and large enterprises with investments of 

USD 2 million, USD 5 million, and USD 11 million each respectively, in accordance with the 

average investment profile in such models.  Under these conditions, the annual turnover for 

each company will be USD 640,000, USD 1.6 million, and USD 3.52 million for the small, 

medium and large units respectively, as from the 5th year, over an operating period of about 20 

years. 

3.1.5 With respect to agricultural products of farmers who supply inputs to agro-industrial 

enterprises in the parks, FARMOD-type production models and benefit/cost models 

(Input/Output, With and Without Programme, over a 20-year operating period) have been used. 

3.1.6 Thus, the financial analysis gave: (i) a financial impact of more than XOF 53 billion 

per year from the 7th year of operation over 20 years, in line with operations of the same type, 

depending on the life of the investments. This implies that the financial impact of the 

programme over the operating period exceeds the cost of investments required to finance it; (ii) 

a benefit/cost ratio of 1.49, with the benefits higher than the investment costs; (iii) an internal 

rate of return of 25.21%, which is higher than the opportunity cost of the capital (cost of capital 

investments under the programme) estimated at 12%. In light of these results, it could be 

concluded that the programme has a profitability profile that financially justifies the cost of the 

programme's investments. 

3.1.7 Economic Analysis: The economic analysis was conducted using the benchmark price 

method, i.e. prices under conditions of economic efficiency, in accordance with the "Pareto" 

optimum. It was also based on a comparison between the "no programme" and "programme" 

situations of the production models presented in the financial analysis. In this model, tradable 

goods are goods that are likely to be commercially traded beyond the country (FOB in port and 

CIF in Marseille Port). Under these conditions, the benchmark prices of the products (economic 

prices) are evaluated on the basis of ex-ante equilibrium of the products, making it possible to 

obtain export parity prices at the borders of the programme (Export-parity price at Farmgate).

Labour was economically valued at 65% of its financial value of USD 3 per day, to take into 

account the inelasticity of labour demand in the country in general, and in the programme area 

in particular. 

3.1.8 On the basis of realistically defined assumptions, the programme's economic rate of 

return (ERR) was estimated at 26.07%, with a C/B ratio of 1.58. Consequently, the 

programme’s overall rate of return could be deemed satisfactory in light of the results. 

IRR (baseline scenario) : 25.21% Amount NPV:  XOF 201.572 billion 

ERR (baseline scenario) : 26.07% Amount NPV:  XOF 219.03 billion 

3.1.9 Sensitivity Analysis: Sensitivity tests conducted on the basis of production price 

reductions helped to measure the stability of financial and economic performance indicators. The 

tests show that prices need to be reduced to 39.17% (break-even point or "switching value") to 

cancel the additional benefits generated at the financial and economic levels, with IRRs and ERRs 

equivalent to the opportunity cost of capital, i.e. 12%. The tests also show that the programme’s 

cost-effectiveness profile is robust, although it was not conducted on all endogenous values of the 

model. However, the price variable is very important; it is the only factor that eludes programme 

management and therefore operation of the programme. The summary of the sensitivity analysis 

is presented in the Technical Annexes on page 72 of Volume II of this report. 

Environmental and Social Impact 

3.2.1 Categorisation: In accordance with the Bank's environmental and social safeguards 

policies and procedures, the Development Programme for the Special Agro-Industrial 

Processing Zone in Koulikoro and Semi-Urban Bamako (PDZSTA-KB) was classified in 

Category 2 on 22 August 2019, since the potential negative environmental and social impacts, 

as well as the related risks, are of low to medium level, and existing technologies for their 

management are easily accessible to the country. Indeed, the studies show that the type of agro-

industrial units that will be operated on the IAP are not likely to generate very heavy, toxic and 

dangerous polluting substances that are difficult to manage and may have irreversible effects. 

Furthermore, heavy industry farms will be excluded from the site. In addition, the 

characteristics of the site do not allow for fear of significant loss of biodiversity (savannah 

vegetation, very poor in wildlife, and no watercourses nearby); there will be no physical 

resettlement (the site is in an industrial zone according to the master plan of the host 

municipality), but very few economic displacements, according to the feasibility study. At this 

stage of the appraisal process, an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) 

was prepared for the programme and posted on the link: 

https://www.afdb.org/en/documents/mali-projet-de-renforcement-de-la-securite-alimentaire-

et-nutritionnelle-de-la-region-koulikoro-p-ml-aag-004-rapport-cges on Monday, 28 October 

2019. 

 

3.2.2 Required environmental and social assessments: The programme will be 

implemented on a site that is certainly known, but whose exact boundaries have not yet been 

determined. Therefore, in accordance with Mali's national legislation, an Environmental and 

Social Management Framework (ESMF/ESMFP) and a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) 

are required. Of course, the ESMF, which will be used for the environmental and social review 

of the various sub-projects to be implemented under this operation, will provide the specific 

ESIAs/ESMPs required for the implementation of sub-projects, such as site development and 

establishment of agro-food processing infrastructure. It provides guidelines for the preparation 

of specific ESIAs/ESMPs. Similarly, the RPF, which defines guidelines for formulating a 

Substances Restoration and Improvement Programme, provides for a specific RAP for the 

https://www.afdb.org/en/documents/


 

13 

 

development works. In addition, it should be noted that the requirement for ESIAs and RAPs 

should be included in the contractors’ bidding documents. 

 

3.2.3 Programme Impacts: Potential Negative Impacts : During the works, the 

development activities of the agro-industrial park will mainly result in: (i) deforestation with 

the cutting of sparse woods such as néré (Parkia biglobosa), shea (Vitellaria paradoxa), zaban 

(Saba senegalensis), tamarin (Tamarindus indica), and (Cola cordifolia); (ii) disruption of 

economic activities with the destruction of farms, settlement on private land, incursion into 

private plots for quarries and borrowing pits; (ii) social tensions due to land problems with 

landowners and underutilisation of local labour; and (iii) involuntary economic resettlement. 

 

3.2.4 During the operational phase of the agro-industrial park (AIP), the operation of the 

agro-industrial units may generate fear of: (i) pollution of watercourses by direct discharges of 

liquid waste containing pollutant loads or scouring of rainwater causing pollutants to enter 

watercourses; (ii) air pollution by dust and odour discharges; (iii) reduction of soil fertility due 

to discharges containing chemicals and harmful substances; and (iv) accumulation of solid 

waste in the natural environment as a result of agricultural and industrial activity. 

 

3.2.5 Finally, the potential negative impacts will be as follows: (i) discharge of untreated 

and stagnant wastewater into the vicinity of the AIP may cause diseases such as malaria and 

bilharzia; (ii) the presence of foreign labourers may increase the risk of the spread of 

STI/HIV/AIDS; and (iii) the risk of uncontrolled influx of people seeking employment in the 

AIP, which may increase the risk of insecurity in the area. 

3.2.6 Potential Positive Impacts: The positive impacts of this agropole programme mainly 

concern the human and socio-economic environments. The major positive impacts of the 

agropole lie in the programme objectives, which consist in promoting the agricultural sector in 

semi-urban Bamako and developing the region's agricultural production to contribute to food 

and nutrition security and combat poverty and vulnerability. The positive impacts include: (i) 

reinforcement of transformative structures to bring water over long distances and thereby 

increase the value of land not yet used, given the scarcity of land. This will generate new 

activities and contribute to job creation; (ii) modernisation of family farms for market-oriented 

production; (iii) intensification, diversification and creation of inter-sector synergies in 

agricultural production basins for the promotion of agricultural enterprises to develop an 

agropole connected to sub-regional, regional, national and international markets; (iv) broader 

access to agricultural investment opportunities; (v) increased wealth for all stakeholders and 

links in the value chain (farmers, processors, etc.); (vi) reduction in post-harvest losses; (vii) 

reduced production shortfalls; (viii) broadening of the range of products; (ix) improved 

marketing conditions; (x) value-added for products through processing; (xi) significant 

contribution to restoration of optimal conditions to boost agricultural production (plant and 

animal) in semi-urban Bamako, as well as increase it on a sustainable basis; and (xii) efficient 

management of plant and animal production in the various production areas in semi-urban 

Bamako. 

3.2.1 Mitigation Measures: Measures that could be recommended by the ESMFP to mitigate, 

minimise or eliminate the negative impacts include: 

At environmental level: 

(i) Compensatory reforestation will be undertaken under the supervision of forestry 

services during the deforestation works, with particularly the same wood species, 

some of which have been obtained through scientific research that has had 



 

14 

 

spectacular results in reducing the adolescent age of the species (e.g. shea tree 

which can now start producing as from the 7th year). The reforestation will take 

place in the agropole, borrowing pits, quarries and village forests bordering on 

the agropole. 

(ii)  The AIP will have a wastewater treatment plant for all processing units before 

discharge into a developed site for its reuse. In addition, each processing unit 

will have a mini individual wastewater treatment plant before transfer to the site's 

large wastewater treatment plant. Since the groundwater in the area is of 

particularly high quality, measures will also be taken to protect it through proper 

management of AIP industrial wastewater, as well as prohibition of any activity 

that causes pollution around boreholes intended for human consumption. 

(iii)  With regard to solid waste, the AIP will have a transit dump for solid waste, 

which will subsequently be transferred to a final landfill site provided for in the 

development plan of Bancoumana municipality in which the AIP is located. In 

addition, efforts will be made to establish units for processing by-products of 

slaughtered cattle, sheep and poultry so as to reduce solid waste and landfill only 

the final waste. Furthermore, industrial units that cause heavy pollution will not 

be allowed in the AIP. All selected companies will also be required to undergo 

ESIA/ESMP assessments prior to establishment. 

(iv)  At the social level, economic assets and potentially affected persons will be 

identified and assessed in a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) and the persons 

concerned will be compensated.  

3.2.8 ESMF Cost: The ESMFP cost is estimated at XOF 650 million and comprises: (i) 

preparation and implementation of specific ESIA/ESMPs; (ii) preparation and implementation 

of RAPs; (iii) capacity building; (iv) training of all key stakeholders of the programme's major 

sectors; (v) information and sensitisation of the local population and associations; (vi) 

environmental and social surveillance; (vii) environmental and social monitoring; (viii) mid-

term assessment of environmental and social performance; and (ix) pre-closing audit of 

environmental and social performance. 

3.2.9 Climate Change: Located at the gateway to the Sahel, Mali is highly exposed to 

climate change. According to climate projections for the Sahel zone, temperatures will continue 

to increase throughout the country as in other Sahel countries. The rise in temperature will be 

accompanied by changes in the distribution and amount of rainfall. Forest resources are among 

the most vulnerable to climate change due to the impacts of human activities on forest 

ecosystems (carbonisation, excessive logging, transhumant stockbreeding, land clearing 

for agriculture, mining, uncontrolled harvesting, etc.). 

3.2.10 As regards greenhouse gas emissions, Mali remains a very low-emitting country, with 

per capita GHG emissions of 2.1 tCO2 per capita in 1994 and a share in global emissions of 

less than 0.1%. However, the emissions have been increasing quite rapidly. Between 1994 and 

2015, they increased by a factor of 21.5, representing an average annual growth rate of nearly 

10%, or doubling every 7.2 years or so. Mali's objective is to reduce its greenhouse gas 

emissions by 13% by 2030, compared to the 1994 levels. In the forestry sector, this commitment 

focuses on stabilising mangrove surface area by 2030, reforesting 10,000 ha per year, and 

preserving classified forests and protected areas. 

3.2.11 Gender: The project targets women as a priority beneficiary group. Several project 

activities will have a positive impact on women in terms of: (i) reducing labour hardship and 



 

15 

 

wasted time, with the availability of nearby fuelwood and introduction of improved stoves; (ii) 

management capacity building through training, sensitisation and education of women; and (iii) 

improving health status through community health centres and other basic services (schools, 

primary health centres, and rural roads). In addition, the promotion of agricultural value chains 

will offer new opportunities, particularly in market gardening and non-timber forest products 

(shea, néré, honey and many other wild fruits and vegetables) that women can process, and 

thereby increase their incomes and improve their living conditions. 

3.2.12 Women play a key role in the agricultural economy and are found throughout the entire 

agricultural value chain: production, processing and marketing. However, despite women’s 

impact in the agricultural production chain, they still face many challenges, namely: 

• Access to resources and factors of production, particularly land, inputs, and 
fertilisers: due to customs and traditions, women generally do not own the land they 

cultivate;  

• Decision-making: Women are less influential in decision-making and conflict 

management in the agricultural sector; 

• Financial resources: Lack of resources is a serious problem in the agricultural 

and other sectors (education, health, etc.); 

• Training needs: Training remains a cause for concern, particularly as regards 

capacity building, entrepreneurship, management, etc. Here too, some women's 

literacy levels constitute a barrier. 

3.2.13 To meet these challenges, the Development Programme for Special Agro-industrial 

Processing Zones proposes activities to promote gender and empower women during its 

implementation, namely: (i) Entrepreneurship, job creation for women and young people, and 

access to markets through business incubators for young people (youth employability 

programme) and women (AFAWA); (ii) Increasing agricultural production and strengthening 

market access capacity through digitalisation of agriculture; (iii) regular and systematic 

consultations between the Government and private sector actors; (iv) promotion of domestic 

and local enterprises in agro-industrial parks; (v) support for SME financing through levies on 

other sectors, including mining; and (vi) sensitisation on behaviour change in family planning 

and reproductive health, balanced nutrition, gender and prevention of gender-based violence, 

prevention of early marriage, HIV/AIDS control, healthy living, and environmental sanitation.  

3.2.14 The programme is classified in Category 2, in accordance with the Gender 

Categorisation System. The detailed gender analysis and gender action plan are provided in the 

Technical Annex on gender. The budget allocated to gender promotion and women's 

empowerment activities stands at UA 0.88 million.  

Involuntary Resettlement 

3.3.1 Operational Safeguard 2 (OS 2): Involuntary resettlement: land acquisition, 

population displacement and compensation: The risk of physical displacement or resettlement 

of the population, as well as loss of major assets during programme implementation are 

minimal. However, land tenure and transhumance are major issues that need to be taken into 

account. In the event of physical displacement or resettlement of the population, Resettlement 

Action Plans (RAPs) will be prepared and implemented in accordance with Bank OS2 

procedures.

IV. IMPLEMENTATION  

Implementation Arrangements 

4.1.1 The programme will be managed by the Ministry of Agriculture (Project Owner), 

which will have a Project Management Unit (PMU) for the programme implementation. The 

PMU will be mainly responsible for coordination, infrastructure development, partnership with 

the private sector, financial management, procurement, and monitoring and evaluation of 

programme activities. It will comprise: (i) a Programme Coordinator; (ii) an Infrastructure 

Specialist; (iii) a Private Sector Specialist; (iv) a Procurement Specialist; (vi) a Monitoring and 

Evaluation Specialist; (vii) an Administrative and Financial Officer; (ix) an Accountant; and 

(x) support staff (drivers, secretaries, cashiers, and messengers). 

4.1.2 The PMU will also be supported by technical assistance (international and national 

consultants) on an ad hoc basis. It will also be supported in the field by partner organisations, 

particularly structures of the Administration, the Rural Economy Institute (IER), the Private 

Investment Promotion Agency (API Mali), Industrial Zone Planning and Management Agency 

(AZI-SA), National Directorate of Forestry and Water Resources (DNEF), Centre for The 

Development of the Food Sector (CDA-EPA), and Ministries and Technical Agencies to be 

involved in the programme. The signing of agreements with these partner structures, including 

IRD, will be part of the loan and grant conditions, under other conditions. Documents of these 

agreements should be prepared before programme implementation, to facilitate the “no-

objection opinion” process during implementation. 

 

4.1.3 A Programme Steering Committee (PSC) will also be established to provide strategic 

direction for the implementation of the program. It will be chaired by the Minister of 

Agriculture. The Committee will comprise the Ministers in charge of Economy and Finance, 

Agriculture, Industry and Trade, Investment and PPPs, as well as representatives of local 

authorities, the Chairperson of the Permanent Assembly of the Mali Chamber of Agriculture, the 

private sector, civil society, and the PMU. The PSC will meet at least twice every year to: (i) 

Review and approve the annual work programme and budget ((AWPB); (ii) validate the results 

of the program's performance, and (iii) frame innovations and ensure the relevance of the major 

choices to be made during implementation. The PMU will be secretariat of the PSC. 

4.1.4 It will be chaired by the Secretary General of the Ministry of Agriculture or his/her 

representative. In addition to the representatives of the ministries within the COS and the 

National Chamber of Agriculture, the PSC will include representatives of Local Authorities, 

the private sector, and civil society. PSC secretarial services will be provided by the 

representative of the Ministry of Industry and Trade. The PSC will be responsible for: (i) 

reviewing and approving the annual work programme (AWP) and budget, (ii) validating the 

results of the programme's performance, and (iii) monitoring innovations and ensuring the 

relevance of major choices to be made during programme implementation. It will meet at least 

twice every year. 

Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements 

 

4.2.1 Procurement Arrangements: Procurement of goods (including non-consultant 

services), work and procurement of Bank-funded consulting services will be carried out in 

accordance with the Bank procurement Policy for Bank Group-funded operations ("AfDB 

Procurement Policy"), October 2015 edition and in accordance with the provisions of the 

Financing Agreement. In line with the implementation of that policy, and as a outcome of 

various assessment conducted, it was agreed that: 



 

17 

 

 

(i) Procurement of Goods and Works listed in paragraph B.5.2.1(a) of Technical Annex 
B.5 will be acquired in accordance with the country's procurement system ("Country 

System"); 

 

(ii) All other procurement financed by the Bank's resources and not mentioned in point (a) 
above will be made in accordance with the Bank's procurement system ("AfDB 

System"). 

 

4.2.2 The use of the National System for a group of transactions was considered appropriate 

because of a level of risk assessed as low for their procurement through the so-called system. 

Such a proposal has the advantage of improving efficiency in the implementation of the project 

through the following factors: (i) better ownership of the contracting system to be used by the 

enforcement agency; (ii) a time saving with the absence of a second control (after that of 

national entities) represented by the Bank's prior review. However, the Bank reserves the option 

of asking the borrower to return to the Bank System for the transactions concerned if: (a) Mali's 

legal procurement framework was changing to a system that was unsatisfactory for the Bank; 

(b) the PMU did not comply with by the requirements; (c) the special safeguards related to the 

use of the national system and described in Paragraph B.5.7.1 of the Technical Appendix were 

not used. 

 

4.2.3. Organization of the implementation of Procurement: The Ministry of Agriculture 

(MA) will be the Project Implementing Agency. The project's contracting will be implemented 

through a project management unit (PMU) that will be created and attached to the MA Cabinet. 

The experts of this CGP, including the contracting specialist, will be recruited on a competitive 

basis. 

 

4.2.4 Procurement Risk and Capacity Assessment (ERCA): In order to take into account 

the specifics of the programme, the Bank assessed: (i) risks at the national, sectoral and project 

levels; and (ii) the capabilities of the enforcement agency. The results of these evaluations 

concluded that there was a "substantial" level of risk for contracting and was used to guide the 

decision on the choice of the contracting system (Borrower, Bank,) used for specific activities 

and identified appropriate mitigation measures proposed at the level of the action plan in 

paragraph B.5.9 of Appendix B5. The resources needed to carry out these measures are already 

available or have been secured at the loan level. 

 

4.2.5 The Bank's resources to finance the project's activities come from the TSF and the ADF. 

As a result, the eligibility rules specific to the ADF window are those that will apply. Following 

the assessment of contracting risks and capabilities, it was decided to use the National 

Contracting System for part of this project. As the rules for eligibility for public contracts under 

Malian law are not the same as those of the ADF window, any practical incompatibility should 

be prevented. It was observed that Decree No. 2015-0604/P-RM of 25 September 2015, bearing 

the Code of Public Procurement and Public Service Delegations and its amendment to Decree 

No. 2016-0920/P-RM of 6 December 2016 Code of Markets and its implementing texts do not 

provide for any specific restrictions on participation in a Tender, except for the qualification 

and absence of sanction from the Public Procurement and Public Service Delegations 

Regulatory Authority (ARMDS-DSP), as stipulated Article 18 of Act No.08-023/ of 23 July 

2008 relating to the Public Procurement and Public Service Delegations Regulatory Authority. 

 

4.2.6 Consequently, the eligibility rules applicable for all contracts concluded under this 

project under the Malian public procurement system will be the national eligibility rules. 

However, in the case of the use of the national system, if the borrower's decision leads to 



 

18 

 

awarding a contract to an entity under the Bank's sanction or under United Nations Chapter VII 

sanction, the Bank's loan resources could not be used to finance such a contract. The list of 

companies under sanctions is available at http://www.afdb.org/debarred. 

 

4.2.7  Disbursement: The Bank's resources will be disbursed in accordance with its rules and 

procedures, in particular the disbursement manual. These will be done through the following 

three methods: (i) the special account method; (ii) the direct payments method; and (iii) the 

repayment method. As for the resources of the national counterparty, they will be disbursed in 

accordance with the national procedures in force. 

Financial Management  

4.1.1 Responsibility for the administrative, financial and accounting management of the 
Project will fall to the Ministry of Agriculture (MA), which will set up a Project Management 

Unit (PGC) whose members will be recruited, by call for applications and following the Bank's 

rules and procedures in this area. The PMC, consisting of at least (i) a Coordinator; (ii) an 

Infrastructure specialist; (iii) a private sector specialist; (iv) an Procurement Specialist; (v) a 

follow-up-assessment specialist; (vi) an Administrative and Financial Officer (RAF); (vii) an 

accountant; and (viii) a support staff (drivers, secretaries, cashier, courier), will have the tools 

of accounting and financial management, including accounting and financial management 

software, adapted to development projects and a manual of procedures administrative, 

accounting and financial matters. 

 

4.1.2 As a general principle, accounts will be kept on the basis of private commitment 
accounting and integrated software adapted to the management of development 

projects/programs. The accounting plan will be developed on the basis of the accounting law 

standards of the Uniform Act of the Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law 

(OHADA) in Africa in Mali. In addition, PDZSTA-BK will produce an annual work program 

and budget (PTBA), as well as quarterly financial monitoring reports, based on the 

implementation of the PTBA, attached to the Bank's quarterly business reports, in which a clear 

analysis of the budget forecasts and the quarter's achievements must be clearly made. Any 

discrepancies will have to be analyzed and explained. 

 

4.1.3 Audit: Audit of project accounts will be carried out by an independent external audit 
firm. This firm must be recruited on the basis of terms of reference previously agreed with the 

Bank and according to its rules and procedures, no later than three months after the financing 

agreement comes into force. The audit contract will be three years non-renewable and the 

auditor will be required to file his report no later than six months after the end of the year 

audited. 

Monitoring 

Internal monitoring and evaluation will be conducted by the Programme's Monitoring-

Evaluation Unit, while external monitoring and evaluation will be conducted by the Ministry 

of Planning and the Ministry of Finance. External monitoring and evaluation aims to assess the 

effectiveness and efficiency of the programme's outputs and their contribution to the 

achievement of the programme's development outcomes, i.e. its effects and impacts. It will be 

conducted with the involvement of other stakeholders, in addition to the two annual supervision 

missions organised by the Bank. The mid-term review will be conducted in Year 3. At the end 

of the programme, the Bank and the Government will produce a completion report within the 

required timeframe. 

Governance  

4.5.1 The State Authorities’ efforts towards good governance over the past five years have 

been positive, particularly in procurement. However, the results of these efforts are not yet 



 

19 

 

visible, as Mali's Corruption Perception Index (CPI) still remains at an average of 32 out of 

100, compared to a regional average of 34, with a ranking of 182nd out of 188 countries in the 

2019 Human Development Index. Political, economic and social governance indicators for Mali 

are still a cause for concern, despite the progress made over the past few years. The indicators 

mainly concern poor performance in governance and the fight against corruption, as a result of 

repeated political crises that weaken State institutions responsible for regularly monitoring the 

governance system in Mali. 

4.5.2 In light of the foregoing, the PDZSTA-KB design provides for support for stakeholder 

capacity building at the institutional level, including reduction of governance risks through the 

programme implementation. The support includes the preparation and implementation of 

financial management and monitoring and evaluation tools, as well as the use of recognised 

transparency and competitive methods in the recruitment of PMU staff. Furthermore, support 

will also include the implementation of a system to reduce delays in the procurement process, 

which is one of the main reasons for shortcomings in the performance of the development 

programmes portfolio in Mali. Despite the alignment of the public procurement system with 

regional guidelines, support will also focus on operational procurement arrangements to address 

identified shortcomings. 

Sustainability 

4.6.1 The Development Programme for the Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zone 

(PDZSTA-KB) was designed on the basis of a participatory approach, which was adopted 

following the SAPZ dialogue mission to Mali in March 2018 and used during all stages of the 

programme formulation, preparation and appraisal. The approach has made the population and 

Government aware of the economic importance of agricultural transformation through the 

processing of agricultural products (agro-industry) and technology innovations disseminated to 

farmers. In this regard, the capacity of key stakeholders in growth sectors will be adequately 

strengthened to guarantee regular supply of inputs based on a mechanism for long-term 

sustainability of jobs and incomes. The mechanism is expected to lead to the autonomy of this 

development model in which agro-industrial companies on the AIP operate with guaranteed 

supply of inputs and the Government is assured of revenue from corporate royalties and 

dividends generated by the Holding Company that will be established to manage the agro-

industrial park.  

4.6.2 The agro-industrial park management system will be formalised through a Holding 

Company with a clear legal status, including land ownership.  The agro-industrial park will be 

created and serviced, and subsequently placed under management in accordance with the 

current Investment Code and the special status of Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zones 

(SAPZs). 

Risk Management 

4.7.1 The achievement of PDZSTA outcomes carries a number of risks for which mitigation 

solutions are required to ensure the success of the programme. In addition to the risks already 

identified for the entire portfolio, specific risks have been identified and mitigation measures 

proposed:  

 

 



 

20 

 

No. POTENTIAL RISKS MITIGATION MEASURES 

1 Lack of commitment from the supervisory 

authorities to support the coordination team and 

prevent delays in programme implementation 

The programme is one of the Government’s 

priorities, and its design was based on regular 

consultations with stakeholders, including 

representatives of the administration and 

municipalities concerned. 

2 Risk of low private sector engagement The programme’s design is based on consultations 

with the private sector whose concerns are taken 

into account in the final programme formulation, 

thereby guaranteeing SME involvement and 

ownership of the operation. 

3 Delays in engagement by some stakeholders 

could lead to delays in the programme 

implementation  

The programme is based on sensitisation and 

regular consultations for its gradual ownership by 

all stakeholders 

4 The programme is not being implemented in 

accordance with the proposed implementation 

plan and schedule, with delays in procurement 

A Procurement Expert will be recruited to assist in 

effective conduct of the procurement process. 

Knowledge Building 
 

4.8.1 The Development Programme for the Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zone 

(PDZSTA-KB) is designed to reflect the approach and principles of the flagship programme 

for Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zones of the Bank's Feed Africa Strategy 2016-2022.  

This programme postulates that agricultural transformation will succeed if the private sector is 

involved in a leadership role, while the Government creates conditions for its implementation 

and success. To succeed, PDZSTA-KB was designed to develop knowledge on how to better 

work with the private sector, as a PPP, a non-sovereign operation (NSO), or a combination of 

both. Private sector involvement, along with public sector funding, is the primary knowledge 

that PDZSTA-KB will develop. 

4.8.2 The other knowledge generated by the programme implementation concerns: (i) the 

multi-sector approach, involving the intervention of sectors such as transport, energy, water and 

sanitation, agro-industry, agriculture, communication (NICT), education, health and nutrition, 

employment and trade.  In this regard, knowledge will be generated through pooling of efforts 

to rapidly produce agricultural transformation outcomes; (ii) the combination of: (a) two Bank 

Strategies, namely "Feed Africa" and “Skills Development”, especially for young people, and 

(b) at least four (4) flagship programmes, namely, Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zones 

(SAPZs), Technologies for African Agricultural Transformation (TAAT), Agricultural Value 

Chains (AVC), and Post-Harvest Loss Reduction and Youth Employability (Enable Youth). 

The combination of strategies and programmes is the third level of knowledge generated by 

PDZSTA-KB; (iii) produce processing is a major development issue for which solutions will 

be sought in this programme; this is the fourth level of knowledge generated by this operation; 

(iv) employment in general, and in the agricultural sector in particular, as a solution proposed 

in the programme; this is the fifth level of knowledge likely to be generated by this proposal; 

and (v) contribution to reduction of massive agro-food imports from the continent and Mali, in 

particular; this is the sixth level of knowledge generated by PDZSTA-KB. 

4.8.3 Finally, the success of this programme will provide a body of knowledge that can be 

replicated in the development programme for all the country's twelve (12) agricultural 

development poles, including Koulikoro and semi-urban Bamako regions.

COUNTRY FRAGILITY SITUATION  
 

REPUBLIC OF MALI 

DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME FOR THE SPECIAL AGRO-INDUSTRIAL PROCESSING ZONES (PDZSTA-KB)   

Fragility Factors Mainstreaming Matrix 
 

Fragility Factors Situation, challenges and resilience measures supported by the General State Policy with the support of Technical 

and Financial Partners (TFPs) 

Measures supported by AfDB intervention 

under PDZSTA-KB (2020-2025) 

Political inclusion Since independence, Mali has experienced four major rebellions. The rebellions have left Mali in perpetual political, 

humanitarian and social conflict. The most recent conflict, which occurred in 2012, is continuing today although the 

international community is continuously striving to find solutions to problems preventing Mali from achieving lasting 

peace. Indeed, Mali became a democratic country in 1990, but the democratic transition seemed to be just a sham 

because, after two decades of peaceful elections, the democratic process was no longer justified given that it was 

marred by corruption and political influence instead of engaging in organising really democratic elections. Such a 

turn eventually created a sense of unfair political representation for Malians. In addition, the laws passed on 

electoral districts portray the political leaders’ intention to exclude some minority groups from political influence. 

PDZSTA-KB activities will not have a direct 

impact on political inclusion, but community 

resilience created by the programme will 

bring a new perspective on representation 

and participation in the political process.  

Security Despite hopes for security, it must be said that complete elimination of insecurity remains illusory. While the 

Government, UNMISMA and the signatory parties have made efforts to stop the fighting for several months, jihadist 

fighters have become stronger, with more capacity for nuisance. Following a series of attacks, ambushes, mines, 

mortar fire and other attacks, they have made their way right to the capital. Even heavily armed foreign and Malian 

camps are attacked by the raging terrorists. Inter-community tensions with land disputes, cattle rustling and clashes 

have also resulted in several deaths and injuries, and demonstrate the fragility of the social fabric. It should be noted 

that delays in implementing the Algiers Agreement justify the reluctance of the population of some localities to 

reject jihadist rhetoric and continue refraining from cooperating in efforts to eliminate them. All these actions by 

Malian stakeholders and the international community do not augur well for the restoration and consolidation of 

peace and security throughout Mali. Security standards assess peace-building success by determining whether 

violence in total armed conflict has persisted in a country; they also consider the chances of a country with a history 

of intra-State conflict will experience it again. The standards give priority to the maintenance of internal peace and 

order, as well as prevention of civil conflict. With the long and frequent history of violence in Mali, it is likely that in 

its current stage the country will return to full armed conflict. 

PDZSTA-KB does not contribute directly to 

the security factor, but it does have activities 

for food security while mitigating some risks 

that could worsen the security situation. 

Justice Mali has a relatively structured judicial system with 1 Supreme Court, 3 Courts of Appeal, 16 Courts of First Instance, 

3 Commercial Courts, 3 Administrative Courts, 42 Extended Courts of Justice, 11 Labour Courts, 8 Juvenile Courts, 

and 3 Military Courts. However, despite this organisational structure, some of the courts are not operational, or 

when they are operational, they do not have adequate human resources in quantity and quality to meet the 

expectations of Malian citizens. Furthermore, despite efforts by public authorities to reform and increase the 

number of judges, the judge-to-inhabitant ratio remains well below international standards, with Mali having only 

PDZSTA-KB does not contribute directly to 

the justice system but addresses the issue of 

social and spatial inclusion, which is a source 

of social injustice, taking into account the 

vulnerable groups, particularly women and 

young people, in the project activities.

one judge per 7,000 inhabitants. Such shortage of staff, combined with their precarious working conditions, 

significantly help to make procedures more cumbersome and lengthy and, as a result, create mistrust among the 

population towards the institution. Malians' lack of trust and the judicial system’s restrictive access make it one of 

the institutions to which people resort as little as possible in the event of conflict. 

Economic and social 

inclusiveness 

Although the country has recovered, economic activity and natural resources are largely concentrated in the south 

of the country. Therefore, it is possible that the projected growth path may have only a minimal impact on the 

particularly troubled northern regions. Agriculture and industry account for 36.8% and 23.4% respectively in Mali's 

GDP. The main agricultural crops are cotton, millet and rice. Industrial production consists mainly of gold as a raw 

material. The growth of agriculture and gold mining industry sectors can only benefit the North if the Government 

reinvests its increasing revenue in these regions. The North should also benefit from the return of aid flows and the 

activities of international, humanitarian and non-governmental organisations. However, these two sources of 

secondary benefits do not directly address the main grievances of the northern populations: the lack of economic 

opportunities and the high unemployment rate. 

The various sectors selected for PDZSTA-KB, 

such as infrastructure development, youth 

employment and food security, have far-

reaching activities that are economically and 

socially inclusive.  

 Social Cohesion In addition to the issue of equity in access to economic resources and opportunities, the poor quality of public goods 

and services, particularly in justice, education, health and security, has been widely cited as one of the obstacles to 

peace in Mali. Indeed, structural deficiencies in health, education, security and justice services, which should be 

accessible to all and of acceptable quality throughout Mali, fuel people's deep feelings of inequality, particularly 

between the northern and southern regions, and between the regions and the capital, Bamako. Indeed, each of the 

regions feels that the others are more privileged in development financing by the Government and Technical and 

Financial Partners (TFPs), construction of infrastructure and, more generally, consolidation of the Government’s 

presence. The delivery of public services remains highly unequal and in short supply despite efforts made by the 

public authorities. These structural shortages are both in quality and quantity, with significant imbalances between 

urban and rural areas, as well as between Bamako and the rest of the country. Poverty indicator trends vary 

considerably across the regions, with progress in the West and South regions against persistence or even 

deterioration in the North. These inequalities were exacerbated by the 2011 food crisis, which negatively and 

disproportionately affected households. In the North, for example, there was a 41% increase in the proportion of 

people living in food-poor households as a result of the 2011 price and production shocks. Even though budget 

spending in the education and health sectors is in line with the averages of other WAMU countries, it remains very 

uneven and unfair: it does not benefit the most disadvantaged segments of the population. In addition, public 

spending on social safety nets to support the poor remains very low and is not always well targeted (a significant 

proportion of the resources do not reach the poorest households). 

The geographical location of PDZSTA-KB is a 

first step towards addressing the imbalance 

in the delivery of services between urban 

and rural areas.  As regards the programme 

activities, a number of the proposed 

components will help to establish public 

servitude required to ensure the successful 

socioeconomic integration of communities. 

External effects / 

regional ripple effects 

With the political and military crisis, Mali's capacity to diversify its economy fell to its lowest level as its exports fell 

from 13.9% to 1.9% between 2009 and 2017. However, this shortcoming is offset by Mali's strong capacity for 

regional integration and economic cooperation. Given this imbalance in terms of capacity, Mali continues to face 

enormous pressure from its geographical position in the Sahel-Saharan region. Regional and international diplomatic 

interference in Sahel’s political transformation seeks to advance their agenda at the expense of their neighbours. In 

addition to this external interference, there is also interference by jihadists - originally external since AQIM 

historically originated in Algeria - who are combining with a purely Sahelian jihad. Another external factor concerns 

the influence of market economic resources (control of cross-border traffic) which has triggered and is perpetuating 

PDZSTA-KB's support has no direct impact on 

external effects, but various interventions by 

the Bank and other TFPs are aimed at 

creating an environment conducive to the 

diversification of the Malian economy, more 

than 45% of whose export earnings come 

from the agricultural sector alone. To 

mitigate the effect of exogenous shocks,

the rebellion. Trafficking interests are the main source of rebel financing; they exacerbate inter-community relations 

and atomise armed groups. Far from being the preserve of the rebels alone, trafficking also causes competition with 

State actors. This makes the search for peace complicated.  

there are emergency social activities in areas 

with displaced people; this is a new 

opportunity to discourage young people 

from embarking on dangerous adventures 

such as terrorism and illegal immigration. 

Climatic/environmental 

impacts 

Although Mali has experienced accelerated deterioration of its environmental policy over two years (2015-2017) to 

the point where its score is below the African average, it has been able to strengthen its capacity in environmental 

protection to prepare for emergencies with Government resources allocated to natural disaster prevention and food 

price volatility. The humanitarian crisis has been a major challenge for peace-building in Mali because it is also 

environmental due to severe recurring drought that has made farming difficult and created a food crisis. The local 

economy, which is highly dependent on stockbreeding and agriculture, has forced Malian northerners to migrate to 

other countries where economic and living conditions could be better, but many of them have returned quickly due 

to the deteriorating situation in these other countries. In addition, UN reports in 2011 indicate that there are nearly 

200,000 displaced people in Mali, not to mention the more than 200,000 people who have fled Mali to countries 

such as Burkina Faso, Mauritania and Niger. Worse still, at least 4.6 million people in Mali have experienced severe 

food insecurity, which has prompted the UN to help mitigate the deterioration in living conditions. By 2013, the 

number of internally and externally displaced persons had increased significantly from about 410,000 to 475,000. 

PDZSTA-KB activities will implement the 

ESMFP measures recommended to avoid 

creating negative impacts on environmental 

protection.

Executive Summary 
 

I.  General Project Overview  

1.1  This project will support the upstream and downstream agricultural production subsectors in the 
Brakna-Ouest region. Its purpose is to improve food security and the living conditions of target 
communities through the inclusive and sustainable development of crop sectors. The Agricultural 
Transformation Support Project in Mauritania (PATAM) is fully consistent with the Accelerated Growth 
and Shared Prosperity Strategy (SCAPP) intended, among others, to consolidate the role of the agro-
pastoral sector and transform it into a source of economic diversification and growth. It is fully aligned 
with the Bank’s: (i) High 5s; (ii) the Ten-Year Strategy (2013-2022); (iii) the Feed Africa Strategy (2016-
2025); (iv) CSP 2016-2020 for Mauritania (Pillar 1 - Support for agricultural transformation); and (v) the 
Bank's flagship initiatives: Technologies for African Agricultural Transformation (TAAT), Young 
Entrepreneurs (Enable Youth), Risk Sharing Facility (RSF), and Agro-industrial Processing Zones 
(APZ). The project will focus on the Brakna-Ouest region, considered a zone afflicted by extreme 
poverty (12 points higher than the national poverty rate), and will affect Trarza and Nouakchott 
regions when it is scaled up to promote: (a) value chains (support for the establishment of agro-
industrial processing zones; (b) youth1 and women's entrepreneurship (support for the establishment 
of an incubation structure): and (c) the establishment of guarantee funds for agricultural sector 
financing. 

1.2  The project will finance: (i) the establishment of the main irrigation infrastructure (vegetable 
farming areas for women on 200 ha and flood-recession farming areas on 3,300 ha); (ii) the promotion 
of value chains and of youth and women's entrepreneurship as well as the establishment of inclusive and 
innovative agricultural sector financing mechanisms (guarantee funds, agricultural insurance, etc.); and 
(iii) institutional capacity-building and project coordination. It will affect 6,700 households, with an 
estimated target population of 42,600 inhabitants (52% being women), with a predominance of 
smallholders considered to be the Bank's main target group. The project will cost MRU 743.37 million 
(i.e., new Ouguiya), equivalent to UA 14.67 million, over a five-year period (2019-2023) and will be 
financed by an ADF loan of UA 7 million and an NTF loan of UA 6 million. It is an excellent climate 
change adaptation project and constitutes support for the transition to inclusive and sustainable growth. 

II. Needs Assessment 

Efficient natural resource management has become an imperative in Mauritania, given the country’s 
severe exposure to the effects of climate change. Consequently, economic diversification is necessary to: 
(i) get the country out of its undiversified and relatively fragile economy, which is dependent on 
extractive industries (particularly iron) that account for four-fifths of total exports on average and 30% 
of total budget revenue; and (ii) mitigate the risks associated with the reduction in iron prices and boost 
the competitiveness of the agro-pastoral sector through inclusive and sustainable development. The 
project was initiated based on the conclusions of the high-level “Feed Africa” conference held in Dakar 
in October 2015, which recommended that particular attention be paid to supporting agricultural 
transformation in African countries. The needs stem from the logic of consolidating and building on the 
significant achievements recorded by the West Brakna Irrigation Scheme Project (PAHABO) and 
strengthening the transformative dimension (promotion of value chains by focusing on two key sectors: 
rice cultivation and market gardening). It was designed through a concerted systemic method that 
involves stakeholders and emphasises a participatory and integrated approach (PIA). 

  

                                                
1  The National Youth Policy defines youth as the population of men and women aged 12 to 30 years. The beneficiaries are young people - 

(women and men aged 12 to 30 years), as well as women of any age.

III. Bank Value-added  

Cognisant of the successful results of PAHABO,1 the Government considers the African 
Development Bank Group as a multilateral donor capable of addressing sector issues related to the 
development of irrigation and agricultural production, value chain promotion, and advancement of 
youth and women's entrepreneurship, in addition to assisting the country to rally other development 
partners. This project is an extension of PAHABO. Moreover, it builds on the reforms initiated under 
Phases 1 and 2 of the Economic Reform and Diversification Support Programme (PAREDE-1 & 2) and 
complements the PAFEJ and PAMPEJ projects. Lastly, PAHABO was awarded the High-5 Award (Feed 
Africa) at the Bank's annual meetings held in India in May 2017. The best practice developed under this 
programme will be replicated and the lessons learned have been factored into PATAM’s design. 

IV. Knowledge Management  

The project will help to strengthen the Bank's innovative operations in the agricultural and rural sector. 
It will help to modernise irrigation systems, promote agricultural transformation and value chains, 
develop youth and women's entrepreneurship, set up innovative and inclusive financing, and disseminate 
the requisite technical and organisational knowledge (use of the various information systems to be set up, 
agricultural advisory, etc.) to its stakeholders. Hence, the contribution through the TAAT initiative will 
be highly useful. The dissemination of smart agricultural technologies and practices to adapt to climate 
change and the guidance of farmers to improve market access will equally be relevant. These operations 
will build the capacity of institutional stakeholders such as administrative entities as well as inter-
professional and beneficiary organisations (water users' associations, rice cooperatives, women's 
vegetable farming cooperatives, EIGs, etc.). The knowledge generated will be disseminated to Mauritania 
and Bank structures through their respective websites, monitoring/evaluation, supervision, midterm 
review and completion reports, etc. Interactions with the African Digital Financial Inclusion (ADFI) have 
also been initiated to achieve innovative solutions aimed at promoting smart agriculture. 

                                                
1  The return of more than 1500 households to the project area is one of the key indicators of the project's success.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF MANAGEMENT OF THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK 
GROUP TO THE BOARDS OF DIRECTORS REGARDING A PROPOSAL TO GRANT AN ADF LOAN AND AN 

NTF LOAN TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF MAURITANIA  
TO FUND THE AGRICULTURAL TRANSFORMATION SUPPORT PROJECT (PATAM) 

 

Management hereby submits this report and recommendations concerning a proposal to grant an ADF loan 
of UA 7 million and an NTF loan of UA 6 million to the Islamic Republic of Mauritania to finance the 
Agricultural Transformation Support Project (PATAM). 

I. Strategic Thrust and Rationale 

1.1 Project Linkage with Country Strategy and Objectives 

1.1.1 PATAM reflects efforts by Mauritanian authorities to move from a rent economy to a 
diversified one driven by promising productive sectors, excluding extractive industries.1 In recent 
years and with a view to diversifying the national economy, the Mauritanian Government has taken 
measures to promote an institutional framework conducive to agricultural sector development. Thus in 
2012, it adopted a Rural Sector Development Strategy (SDSR), accompanied by a Framework Law on 
Agriculture (LOA), an Institutional Review of the Agricultural and Livestock Sector (RISAP) and a 
National Livestock and Agriculture Development Plan (PNDEA). Furthermore, the Government adopted 
an investment code and an Accelerated Growth of Shared Prosperity Strategy by 2030 (SCAPP). The 
intention is to ensure that agricultural development, poverty reduction, food security and the improvement 
of community living conditions become top priorities. Hence, a National Agricultural Development Plan 
(PNDA) was drawn up based on the SDSR and the initial PNDEA. Approved by the Council of Ministers 
in October 2016, this PNDA is the main operational reference framework and reflects Government's desire 
to ensure better coordination of agricultural sector actions to promote modern, resilient and competitive 
agriculture by 2025 (see strategic framework in Annex 1). 

1.1.2 To optimise the potential for agricultural and rural development, the Ministry of Agricultural and 
Rural Development defined its development policy in 2012, through the design and adoption of a Rural 
Sector Development Strategy (SDSR) and an Agro-pastoral Framework Law (LOA), in harmony with the 
Poverty Reduction Strategic Framework (PRSF 2011-2015) and the National Food Security Strategy 
(SNSA - 2012). Five strategic areas have been defined by the SDSR, namely: (i) infrastructure; (ii) 
research; (iii) rural advisory services; (iv) funding; and (v) trade. SCAPP (2016-2030), which is the 
reference framework for Mauritania as regards development, poverty reduction and job creation, thus 
confirmed these orientations and adopted the following three pillars: (i) promotion of robust, inclusive and 
sustainable economic growth; (ii) human capital formation and access to basic services; and (iii) 
strengthening of governance in all its dimensions. The “Produire en Mauritanie” (“Made in Mauritania”) 
Initiative (IPM), adopted by the Council of Ministers in October 2016, has consolidated the instruments 
established to diversify the Mauritanian economy, and reflects Government's desire to capture value added 
locally and to promote value chains. All these strategies highlight the considerable potential of the 
agricultural sector to reduce poverty, improve food security and create sustainable jobs. 

1.1.3 The project is well aligned with the strategic guidelines presented above and is underpinned by 
the pillars and priorities set by the Government of Mauritania (see 1.1.2). It is an attempt to combine 
production support (support for the upstream agricultural subsector) with the enhancement of production 
value (support for the downstream agricultural subsector). The focus is on: (i) consolidating the significant 
impact of PAHABO; (ii) replicability and extension of recorded achievements; and (iii) targeted support 

                                                
1  These efforts are reflected in the country’s new strategic vision for development, which are intended to be sustainable, inclusive and fair, and which 

seek to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 2015-2030). 



 

 2 

to the transformative dimension that is compatible with available financing resources. The project as 
designed provides an opportunity to consolidate, extend and support transformation with a view to 
enhancing the linkages and continuity with PAHABO, and scaling up the pilot action. Therefore, it 
prepares a solid foundation for innovative and high value-added transformative agriculture in the second 
part of Mauritania's CSP that is consistent and fully compatible with the reform programme aimed at 
diversifying the economy and advocating support for the agro-pastoral sector. By adopting an inter-sector 
approach, the project strives to achieve complementarity and synergy with other sector strategies and 
initiatives, such as the Produire en Mauritanie Initiative (IPM); the National Employment Strategy; the 
Industrial Sector Development Strategy (2015-2019), especially for the agri-food and agro-industry 
component; the National Strategy for the Promotion of Micro- and Small-sized Enterprises (2015-2019), 
particularly the pillar relating to the integration of MSEs in sectors with high potential for value added and 
job creation; and the National Microfinance Strategy (2015-2019), with its fourth pillar related to the 
development of an inclusive supply of products. 

1.1.4 The agro-pastoral sector is strategic in Mauritania and contributed 23.4% to national GDP 
formation in 2017. Agriculture has considerable potential: nearly 500,000 ha of arable land, including 
about: (i) 365,000 ha for rain-fed crops; (ii) 135,000 ha for irrigated crops; (iii) 19,700 ha planted with 
palm trees; and (iv) 22,500 ha under dam-irrigated farming. There is also an undervalued irrigable potential 
along the Senegal River, with 46,100 ha of developed land. Livestock is another strategic sector. It 
contributed on average 20% of GDP over the 2014-2017 period, and accounted for 85% of rural value-
added and 78% of the national value added in the agricultural sector. Mauritania’s livestock population is 
significant and estimated at 21.05 million sheep and goats, 1.95 million cattle and 1.47 million camels 
(ONS, 2016). The agro-pastoral sector is the largest employer, despite the many obstacles that limit its 
development (access to finance, vocational training, new technologies, etc.). It has great potential that 
remains untapped in terms of mobilisation (intensification, productivity improvement, preservation, etc.) 
and enhancement to promote agricultural sector value chains. The institutional development of agricultural 
research, advisory and service structures, the reorganisation of professional structures, the structuring of 
strategic sectors and the upgrading of value chains are all challenges to overcome. 

1.1.5 The agro-pastoral sector is also a major employer in the country and accounts for 30% of 
the labour force. It provides income to approximately one (1) million inhabitants and plays a key role in 
food security and resilience. However, according to the latest ONS report on the poverty situation in 
Mauritania, households headed by persons working in the agriculture and livestock sectors are the poorest, 
with an incidence of 59.6% and 41.8%, respectively (2014). 

1.1.6 The lack of value-added in the agro-pastoral sector limits the country's prospects for 
diversification and job creation. The sector has great potential that remains untapped in terms of 
mobilisation (intensification, productivity improvement, preservation, etc.) and enhancement to promote 
agricultural sector value chains. Hence, the institutional development of agricultural research, advisory 
and service structures, the reorganisation of professional structures, the structuring of strategic sectors and 
the upgrading of value chains are all constraints to be addressed to ensure that Mauritania fully enjoys the 
economic potential of its agro-pastoral sector.  

1.2 Rationale for Bank Involvement 

1.2.1 The project needs stem from the logic of consolidating and extending the significant 
achievements of PAHABO and strengthening the transformative dimension (promotion of value chains by 
focusing on two key sectors that are crucial to the economy and to inclusive development, namely: rice 
farming and vegetable gardening). The project is consistent with the Bank's strategic guidelines and High 
5s, including the priorities “Feed Africa” and “Improve quality of life for the people of Africa”, food 
security enhancement and climate change adaptation measures. It is fully consistent with the Bank’s: (i) 
Ten-Year Strategy 2013-2022 (objectives of inclusive growth and transition to green growth); (ii) Pillar I 



 

 3 

of CSP 2016-2020 for Mauritania related to “Support for agricultural transformation”; (iii) agricultural 
strategy (Feed Africa [2016-2025]; (iv) Jobs for Youth in Africa Strategy (2016-2025) and (v) Investing 
in Gender Equality for Africa's Transformation (2014-2018), including Pillar II on “Economic 
Empowerment”. PATAM’s implementation requires significant investments and consistent technical 
support. Only the main multilateral donors, including the Bank, are considered by Mauritanian authorities 
as catalysts capable of helping to address such sector issues, and of involving other partners through their 
operations. The Bank has supported the agro-pastoral sector in the past and accumulated significant 
experience in the areas requested. In addition to its earlier funding of two agro-pastoral operations (PADEL 
and PAHABO) for UA 7.67 million and two phases of the Reform Support Programme (PAREDE), the 
Bank is currently engaged in a multinational agro-pastoral operation (P2RS), for which UA 11.5 million 
has already been allocated to Mauritania. It is also worth noting that Mauritania is engaged in transforming 
its economic model, which has so far been based on mining sector exports, into a sustainable dynamic 
economy characterised by diversification and job creation. In this regard, PATAM complements the 
reforms recommended by the PAREDE programme (1 & 2). 

Box 1: Towards a holistic, participatory and integrated approach oriented towards value chains 
The project is an attempt to adopt a holistic, participatory and integrated approach oriented towards the promotion of value chains. 
It is aimed at two levels of intervention: (i) upstream agricultural production to rationalise the use of natural resources (in particular 
water and soil), rehabilitate the natural environment and consolidate the socio-territorial unit; and (ii) downstream agricultural 
production to enhance the value of agricultural products (from farm to market) with particular emphasis on the promotion of public 
investments, improvement of the business environment, increase of the attractiveness of the private sector, promotion of PPPs , co-
responsibility of stakeholders and complementary synergy with other partners. The project also attempts to leverage the Bank's 
flagship initiatives: TAAT, Enable Youth, RSF, ZTAI, etc.  

 

1.2.2 Particular attention is paid to the synergy between various instruments adopted by the Bank in 
Mauritania, namely: investment support (PAHABO, PATAM), reform support (PAREDE 1 & 2) and 
technical support (PPF-PAHABO-2) to back reforms and investments, and increase their sustainability. In 
terms of comparative advantages, there are five basic arguments in favour of the AfDB Group's 
intervention in this project: (i) the Bank Group plays a strategic role in infrastructure development in 
Mauritania; (ii) the project builds on PAHABO and is in synergy with reform support (PAREDE-1 
completed and PAREDE-2 in progress), thus contributing to the establishment of an institutional and 
regulatory framework for economic diversification and support for the agro-pastoral sector; (iii) the project

II. Project Description 

2.1 Project Objectives: The project aims to achieve the inclusive and sustainable development of 
the agricultural sector. It will contribute to the improvement of food security and the living conditions of 
target communities. More specifically, it will support agricultural transformation in Mauritania by 
increasing the output and value of agricultural products.  

2.2 Project Components: To achieve its objectives, the project has identified the following three 
components: (i) transformative irrigation schemes; (ii) promotion of value chains, youth and women's 
entrepreneurship; and (iii) capacity building and project coordination. The first component, reserved for 
the development of transformative infrastructure, accounts for more than 65% of the total project cost.

2.2.1 Transformative Irrigation Schemes: The main achievements and activities planned under this 
component are: (i) Consolidation and rehabilitation of the dike track over a distance of 62 km: This will 
open up access to existing villages and farming areas, and speed up the development and operation of new 
areas included under the project. The dike will be consolidated by upgrading the technical characteristics 
of its dimensions (including structures) based on new hydraulic, geotechnical, pedological and 
topographical studies. The dike will also increase protection against floods and ensure steady water supply 
to the flood-recession areas to be developed (basins). Installation of equipment to regulate the N'Diorol 
backwaters and weir for the introduction of fish farming; (ii) Development of seven basins (3300 ha): 
recalibration of the backwaters and supply channels of the seven basins to ensure and develop flood-
recession farming; (iii) Development of 200 ha of vegetable farms for women: Development and equipment 
of 200 ha of irrigated vegetable farming areas for women along the river; (iv) Implementation of 
environmental and social actions: environmental and social works (reforestation, dune fixation, etc.) to be 
undertaken to ensure the sustainability of the transformative structures to be built: (v) Technical assistance: 
all works on the transformative irrigation infrastructure will be executed by a contractor, and controlled 
and supervised by a consultancy firm and a works quality control laboratory. All the technical studies on 
the irrigation project carried out by the PPF are available.  

2.2.2 Promotion of value chains and of youth and women’s entrepreneurship: The main activities 
planned under this component are: (i) the promotion of value chains, mainly through equipment of the 
market gardening product packaging centre, support for the Rural Producers' Training Centre (CFPR), 
support to IPM (support to the market gardening and rice clusters, and support for the establishment of 
agro-industrial processing areas in Rosso), promotion of PPP initiatives and agricultural marketing, etc.; 
(ii) the promotion of agricultural and women’s entrepreneurship, in particular through support for 
ANAPEJ to champion youth and women's entrepreneurship, and the establishment of start-ups to 
complement PAFEJ and PAMPEJ. In this regard, a regional ANAPEJ agency will be opened at Boghé to 
promote local services. (iii) the development of inclusive financing through support to BCM for the 
establishment of a Guarantee Fund, promotion of agricultural insurance and support for the certification 
and entrepreneurship mechanism, with the mobilisation and backing of CAM, NBM and the SNIM 
Foundation. 

2.2.3 Capacity-Building and Project Coordination: The project will support capacity building for 
its staff (DSCSE, DDFCA, CNRADA, PCU, etc.) and beneficiaries as well as the establishment of a 
Servicing and Maintenance Fund (SMF) for irrigation infrastructure.

2.3 Technical Solution Adopted and Alternatives Explored 

2.3.1 PATAM follows an integrated approach that links the upstream and downstream farming sectors 
to enhance value and promote value chains. It builds on PAHABO (2005-2014), which generated 
undeniable physical, human and institutional achievements that need to be consolidated and extended to 
surrounding areas. Consultation with stakeholders during project design missions made it possible to adopt 
the same technical solution implemented by PAHABO for transformative irrigation schemes. This 
technical solution has the advantage of: (i) setting up infrastructure to ensure adequate water collection 
and better use; (ii) opening up access to the area; and (iii) ensuring better optimisation of investment costs. 
The project will fund water supply right down to individual plots (farms). With regard to the promotion of 
value chains, two key sectors have been identified, namely rice cultivation and vegetable farming, which 
have tangible value margins and are aimed at differentiated target groups (male cooperatives for rice 
cultivation and female cooperatives for vegetable farming). Hence, PATAM seeks to build on these 
achievements by capturing value added at the local level and creating employment opportunities. It is also 
an appropriate solution for mitigating the effects of climate change. 

2.3.2 The technical design of the project took into account: (i) lessons from PAHABO; (ii) the 
availability of water and soil resources; (iii) consultation with irrigation water users and their approval of 
technical solutions for the choice of proposed works; and (iv) farmers’ capacity to master the techniques. 

Table 2.3: Project Alternatives Explored and Reasons for their Rejection1 
ALTERNATIVE 

EXPLORED 
BRIEF DESCRIPTION REASONS FOR REJECTION 

 Development and 
irrigation of the basins  

This entails building the necessary equipment 
to collect water for irrigation of the basins as 
well as land development to ensure sustainable 
irrigation. 

High cost of the investments and the transition 
towards flood-recession farming. 

 Regulation of the 
channels supplying 
water to the basins 

Regulation of the channels supplying water to 
the basins makes it possible to ensure flood-
recession farming. The solution considered is 
to carry out such regulation naturally without 
acting on the system. 

This option was abandoned because it does not 
guarantee proper regulation of flood recession. 
There are plans to install control structures to 
regulate the water level in the basin according to the 
flow rate of the backwaters that feed each basin. 

 Development of roads 
and bridges to open up 
access to the project 
area 

To ensure access, it is proposed that access 
roads be developed in the project area. 

Very high cost. Only the bridges for crossing the 
main backwaters have been retained and will be 
funded through an additional NTF loan.  

2.4 Type of Project 

This is a sector investment project that has the particularity of adopting a participatory and integrated 
approach to target investments and link up the upstream and downstream agricultural subsectors (see 
details in Technical Annex B.3, Volume 2). 

2.5 Project Cost and Financing Mechanisms 

2.5.1 The overall project cost, net of taxes and customs duties, is estimated at UA 14.67 million, 
equivalent to MRU 743.37 million. The foreign exchange share constitutes 73% of the total project cost. 
Customs duties and taxes will be defrayed by the State. Physical and financial contingencies, which total 
11% of the base cost, have been calculated based on detailed estimates presented by the Borrower. The 
Government contributes UA 1.67 million, equivalent to MRU 81.56 million, representing about 11.3% of 
the total project cost. The detailed project costs are presented in the technical annexes (C9). The ADF and 
NTF loans are valued at UA 7 million and UA 6 million, respectively.

2.6 Project Area and Beneficiaries  

2.6.1 The planned investments target historically poorly endowed areas where a large number of 
farmers are exposed to droughts and poverty and insecurity because they lack the resources to develop 
the existing potential (water and soil). These investments will promote shared prosperity and build the 
resilience of these target communities to future shocks, including those relating to climate change. 
The project will benefit a population of 42,600 (20,448 men, i.e. 48%, and 22,152 women, or 52%) 
from 6,700 households. The region is qualified because it is exposed to extreme poverty and is reputed 
for seasonal immigration; mainly men seeking informal employment.1 The main activities practised 
by the population and which constitute livelihoods within their local economy are (in descending

order): agriculture (43%), livestock (14.14%), trade (10.42%) and fishing (3.48%). Women are 
engaged in many activities: mainly agriculture (crops, vegetables), small livestock production, petty 
trading and handicraft. The project's support for job creation will be provided through ANAPEJ 
(promotion of YAE and innovative start-ups). Farmers in the rice and vegetable farming sectors and 
clusters are the main beneficiaries of IPM support. 

2.7 Participatory Approach to Project Design and Implementation 

2.7.1 PATAM was designed with the sustained involvement of the stakeholders concerned 
(various administrative entities, grassroots organisations, socio-professional structures, private 
operators, beneficiaries and development partners). The participatory approach was adopted prior to 
project design, from technical studies carried out under the PPF where the findings were submitted 
and validated with the relevant technical departments and representatives of the target communities. 
The process is fully participatory since the Local Consultation Council (LCC), the women's Economic 
Interest Group (EIG), representatives of women's cooperatives and user associations established since 
the implementation of PAHABO were involved in all the stages. As was the case in PAHABO-1, 
women's organisations, users' associations, the LCC and the EIG will also be involved in 
implementing this project. 

2.7.2 Furthermore, the Bank's various design missions also held numerous consultation meetings 
with the administrative entities concerned, professional structures, private operators likely to be 
involved in the project and beneficiary representatives (cooperatives, etc.). Moreover, the 
implementation of various proposed activities will be based on a participatory approach actively 
involving the LCC, the CNP and the organisations, to improve their governance and increase their 
accountability.  

2.8 Bank Group Experience and Lessons Reflected in Project Design 

2.8.1 The Bank’s portfolio in Mauritania (mid-November 2018) comprises 15 operations worth 
UA 239 million (see details in Annex 3). While the overall quality of the portfolio is deemed 
satisfactory, there are still some implementation problems, including: (i) start-up delays due to lack 
of project ownership on the Mauritanian side; (ii) procurement delays; and (iii) weak project 
implementation capacity. The measures designed to address these challenges include: (a) quality 
improvement at entry by setting up project management bodies prior to approval; (b) establishment 
of more rigorous procurement plans; and (c) assessment of implementation capacity problems and 
substantial capacity building. All these recommendations have been factored into PATAM. In 
particular, lessons from PAHABO are strategic guidelines that can further strengthen PATAM’s 
design and implementation. These include the need to: (1) ensure the availability of implementation 
studies and the finalisation of project BDs prior to project approval; (2) ensure geographic 
concentration and a particular interest in development to maximise value added at the local level and 
ensure better stakeholder mobilisation and beneficiary ownership; (3) strengthen the project 
monitoring, evaluation and coordination function, which are crucial to project implementation quality; 
(4) appoint a procurement manager and support procurement and disbursement procedures (provide 
capacity-building measures); (5) raise awareness among the client and target population on the role 
of servicing and maintenance to ensure better operation and sustainability of the facilities; and (6) 
improve the environment and business climate to ensure better private sector involvement.  

2.8.2 Based on these factors, project design focused on: (i) the availability of technical studies 
carried out under PPF-PAHABO-2 and which are highly useful for mobilising co-financing (IsDB, 
GCF, GEF, SF, EIB, etc.); (ii) the consolidation of results achieved, extension of PAHABO's 



 

 9 

outcomes to other areas and consideration of an entire component for the promotion of value chains 
as well as women's and youth entrepreneurship that are central to the project’s design and underpinned 
by a participatory and integrated process; (iii) measures to strengthen project monitoring, evaluation, 
steering and coordination have been planned to consolidate the quality of project implementation; (iv) 
crucial measures are planned to accelerate procurement: the appointment of a procurement officer 
from among the PCU staff, the use of advance contracting and the national system according to 
recommended thresholds, the implementation of capacity-building and support measures (support to 
the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority-ARMP), the conduct of procurement audits, the 
preparation of a procedures manual, the establishment of an accounting system for procurement, and 
the improvement of disbursements; (v) support for the establishment of a Servicing and Maintenance 
Fund (FEM), which will be provisioned from 2021 with a start-up allocation for more sustainable 
development; and (vi) innovative actions to strengthen the sustainability of the activities executed and 
private sector mobilisation: support for the establishment of a guarantee fund and a risk-sharing 
system, promotion of agricultural insurance, support for the establishment of an integrated logistics 
platform (agro-industrial processing area in Rosso in support of the “Produire en Mauritanie” 
Initiative (IPM), promotion of new concepts allowing the involvement of the private sector and the 
development of PPP initiatives (certification concept, agricultural entrepreneurship oriented towards 
high value-added services, supported and sponsored by the private sector: NBM, CAM, SNIM 
Foundation, etc. that have expressed interest in joining and backing these concepts). The Bank will 
seek technical support, through trust funds, to promote and ensure the implementation of these 
initiatives. 

2.8.3 PATAM has also benefited more from sector budget support (PAREDE-1 & 2) and technical 
support under PPF-PAHABO-2, which is still being implemented. One of the recorded achievements 
concerns the complementarity and synergy adopted between the Bank's three financing instruments 
(reform support, investment support and technical support) and the complementarity linkages with 
operations in a logic of convergence: 

 Bank Group: (i) PAREDE 1 & 2 (including support for PPPs and land reforms - 
agricultural and rural land is at the heart of this reform process and after significant 
progress in the Rosso region, agricultural and rural land regularisation is expected to 
start in the Brakna region; support for the establishment of a service and maintenance 
fund for agricultural infrastructure and structures, support for the establishment of 
innovative and inclusive mechanisms for financing the agro-pastoral sector); (ii) 
PAFEJ (technical and institutional support for ANAPEJ, support for the opening of 
local offices, support for the integration of young people); (iii) PAMPEJ ( 
establishment of the microfinance refinancing mechanism via the FOREMI fund 
hosted at the CDD); (iv) P2RS which intervenes partly in Brakna. 

 TFPs in Mauritania: The concentration on the agricultural sector is justified by the 
principle of complementarity with the operations of the World Bank (focused on core 
livestock sector projects such as the Regional Support Project for Pastoralism in the 
Sahel-PRAPS, USD 45 million), the EU (RIMRAP, RIMDIR and RIMFIL), GIZ 
(Promotion of Employment and Professional Integration in Rural Areas - PELIMIR) 
and AFD (CAP-Insertion).  

2.9 Key Performance Indicators  

The key project performance indicators are: (i) the total length (in km) of track dikes constructed or 
consolidated; (ii) the surface area (in ha) of basins developed; (ii) the surface area (in ha) of vegetable 



 

 10 

farming areas developed for women (FAW); (iii) the average yields obtained in basins and FAWs; 
(iv) additional agricultural output; (v) the number of farmers benefiting from the basins developed 
and the number of women farmers benefiting from FAWs; and (vi) the number of operational rice-
farming cooperatives for men and vegetable farming cooperatives for women as well as the respective 
memberships of both. The main impact indicators are: (a) improvement of the agricultural income of 
target communities; (b) contribution to poverty reduction; (c) contribution to the improvement of the 
nutritional status; (d) contribution to the reduction of food imports (in tons of cereals and vegetables); 
and (e) contribution to the creation of decent and sustainable jobs. The main data sources for 
monitoring these indicators are the PCU, DSCSE, ONS, CSA, BCM and ASYCUDA. This data will 
be supplemented by field surveys and targeted analyses, with occasional support from technical 
assistance, if necessary. The relevant data will be collected, processed and the results disseminated 
through the results-based monitoring and evaluation system set up by the project. 

III. Project Feasibility 

3.1 Economic and Financial Performance 

3.1.1 The transformative infrastructure to be constructed (irrigation schemes, access roads), the 
structures to be built in the basins (recalibration, cleaning) and women's vegetable farming areas will 
provide the population with newly cleared plots of irrigated good soil conducive to the development 
of the available potential (water, soil and labour force). This new situation, long awaited by the target 
communities, will stimulate the execution of vital activities that will help them to achieve poverty 
reduction, self-reliance, permanent employment, decent income and self-development. This will help 
to increase the added value of the irrigated areas concerned and to generate positive impacts that would 
be social (creation of local jobs, poverty reduction, improved nutritional status, reduction of rural 
exodus, etc.), economic (increased agricultural output, better use of irrigation water, enhanced 
regional balance, etc.), environmental (mitigation of the negative effects of climate change, rational 
exploitation of river water, substitution of water pumping by flood spreading and use of renewable 
energies vegetable-farming areas, which will lead to a reduction in energy demand, etc.) and 
institutional (consolidation of cooperatives, EIGs and water users' associations, institutional capacity 
building, organisation of farmers to improve market access, funding and service provision, etc.). The 
main benefits generated by the project are assessed through the following key indicators:

3.1.2 Financial profitability analysis yielded a FIRR of 18.8% and the sensitivity tests showed that 
profitability remains around the threshold of the opportunity cost of capital, even when there is a 10% 
decrease in output value and a concurrent 20% increase in investment costs, with the FIRR then being 
13%. Economic analysis was done based on the benchmark price method and comparison of the "no-
project" and "project" situations. The economic and financial performance was assessed based on an 



 

 11 

investment life of 30 years. The project costs relate to the investments made, including physical 
contingencies, repair and maintenance costs, production and renewal costs. The analysis focused on 
the seven basins (Afnia, Balla, Moi - Moi, Diayolé- Djoulé, Nevga, Regba), thanks to which the six 
creeks can be exploited (Lougué, Sidi Youkel, Koundi, Ngaleng, Ballabour, Regba) and a cluster of 
small vegetable farming areas developed along the river bank that will subsequently be allocated to 
women's cooperatives. The operation of this infrastructure will increase the average net income per 
farm in the flood-recession farming areas from MRU 18,923 in the current situation to nearly MRU 
70,409 in future, representing an increase of more than 3.5 times (3.62).  This income will directly 
benefit fragile rural households and contribute to poverty reduction among vulnerable groups 
(especially women and the youth).  

3.1.3 The project’s economic benefits stem from the increase in agricultural output during normal 
operation, with an additional annual output of 107,530 quintals of cereals produced from flood-
recession farming (sorghum and maize), 8,320 tons of rice, 4,000 tons of vegetable products, 5,100 
tons of fodder to be valued in terms of milk and meat, and value chain development for certain 
vegetable products (vegetable recycling and drying). Other project impacts such as opening up access 
to villages, facilitating access to farms, transporting products, developing marketing channels and 
improving access between farming areas, local (Boghé, Dar El Baraka, Ouled Biram, Dar El Avia, 
Aleg) and national markets (development of certification contracts and PPP initiatives) were not 
factored into the analysis.  

ERR (base-case scenario): 18.4 %  NPV (10%): MRU 462,125 

3.1.4 The sensitivity tests conducted show the profitability of the project: a 10% increase in 
investment costs reduces the ERR to 16.9%; a 10% decrease in production reduces the ERR to 15.0%; 
a 10% increase in investment costs combined with a 10% reduction in production yields an ERR of 
13.7%. 

3.2 Environmental and Social Impact 

Environment 

3.2.1 Based on the Bank's Environmental and Social Assessment Procedures (ESAPs), the project 
was classified under Category 2 due to the limited scale of the irrigation schemes that only concern 
200 ha, and the local and temporary scope of the expected impacts following the rehabilitation of the 
existing dike track. Decree No. 2007.105, which defines the content and procedure for conducting 
environmental impact assessment (EIA) and monitoring their implementation, classifies the project 
under the category of operations subject to an EIA. On this basis, an environmental impact assessment 
with an environmental and social management plan was prepared in accordance with the Bank's 
Integrated Safeguards System (ISS) and the national system. The study was validated and its summary 
submitted for publication for a period of 30 days prior to the Board of Directors' meeting. In 
accordance with Decree No. 2007.105, the consultation was organised with the target groups. The 
Decree stipulates and requires that any decision should be preceded by a public inquiry to seek public 
input and comment on the likely impacts of the project and the acceptability of alternative solutions 
or mitigation measures under consideration. 

3.2.2 From an environmental standpoint, the project will mainly lead to: (i) better management of 
water and soil resources, and development of the irrigation potential; (ii) a better understanding of 
rational water use for agricultural purposes; (iii) water and soil conservation; and (iii) the creation of 
favourable conditions for restoring the biodiversity in the backwaters. The positive impacts of project 



 

 12 

activities from the social standpoint essentially relate to: (i) improvement of agricultural production 
techniques and systems; (ii) improvement of income and marketing conditions; (iii) broadening of the 
product range and enhancement of output value through processing; and (iv) strengthening of the 
skills of the various agricultural sector stakeholders. In terms of impact on the community living 
environment, it will: contribute to food and nutritional security; famine control; and job creation. 
During the construction phase, the negative impacts will essentially be limited to the works area and 
generally be of low intensity. The ESMP prepared under this project includes a series of measures 
during the construction and operational phases aimed at mitigating negative impacts and ensuring the 
project's sustainability. In terms of job creation, the project provides technical guidance as well as 
innovative and inclusive financial support to the agricultural sector. Furthermore, with a view to 
promoting women's and youth entrepreneurship, the project seeks to combat women’s and youth 
marginalisation by setting up an inclusion mechanism to reduce cultural barriers that negatively affect 
these groups, and support financing for granting specific microcredit to this category of investors. 

Social 

3.2.3 The “Systematic Country Diagnostic” report prepared by the World Bank in May 2017, 
concludes that “the main driver of poverty reduction in rural areas has been the increase in the welfare 
of agricultural and livestock producers”. It also concludes that despite significant improvements, 
social indicators remain among the lowest in the world. Mauritania was ranked 153rd out of 186 
countries in the Human Development Index in 2014. Despite the progress made in reducing poverty, 
it remains a widespread phenomenon, mainly in rural areas, and is associated with unequal access to 
social services and productive capital. The qualitative data in this report indicates that land is unevenly 
distributed, particularly in the fertile Senegal River Valley, where the majority of poor agro-pastoral 
producers operate. Women are particularly affected; only 18.7% of them have land in the country. 
The highest poverty rates are recorded in households headed by persons who are illiterate or have not 
completed primary education. The “40 per cent poorest” have the lowest access to other basic services, 
such as health, water and sanitation. Limited access to land in rural areas and high food prices in urban 
areas prevent the poorest from accumulating assets. Very few poor small farmers hold formal land 
rights in the Senegal River Valley, while most of them depend on informal customary rights. This 
situation has caused land insecurity for land users and investors as well as social tensions.  The project 
responds to expressed needs and has taken into consideration the lessons from the previous PAHABO 
project. It addresses food shortages and malnutrition, inadequate access to agricultural inputs leading 
to low production, limited access to financial support and high youth (male and female) 
unemployment rates. All said, despite the relative socioeconomic progress, poverty remains high in 
Mauritania at 31% (EPCV, 2014) compared to 42% and 51% in 2008 and 2000, respectively. Poverty 
remains rural in nature (about one in two people in the rural areas is poor - 44.4%).  Brakna is among 
the four willayas with a worrying poverty rate that exceeds the national poverty threshold (43.3% in 
Brakna compared to 31% at the national level, i.e. 12.3 points above the average). The illiteracy rate 
is 52.5% (59% for women). With regard to income, the data indicates that the average annual income 
is estimated at MRU 224,800 for a “typical” well-off household and MRU 159,000 for an average 
household, while poor to very poor households have MRU 89,000 and MRU 51,400, respectively. 

3.2.4 The 2016 ONS data indicate that Brakna’s population is relatively young (the 15 to 39 
age group represents 35.2% of the total population). On the social level, the foreseeable negative 
impacts would affect farmers who are not project beneficiaries and whose competitiveness on the 
market would be relatively low, as well as rural women whose participation in project benefits remains 
limited due to cultural barriers. However, these impacts will be significantly reduced by the mitigation 
measures provided for in the ESMP, in particular the strengthening of women's participation in 



 

 13 

cooperatives and associations, and measures to support and finance income-generating activities for 
women and the youth who constitute the vulnerable segment of the population. 

Adaptation to Climate Change 

3.2.5 In terms of vulnerability to climate change risks, the project is classified in Category 2, which 
reflects medium vulnerability that requires the implementation of climate adaptation measures and 
their integration into the design of facilities planned. The following measures were considered to 
strengthen ecosystem and community resilience: (i) development of irrigated areas and reduction of 
extensive farming; (ii) introduction of innovative technologies for the optimal management of natural 
resources, particularly water; (iii) promotion of climate-friendly smart farming practices; (iv) 
promotion of small livestock farming, in particular goats and sheep, which also helps to fertilise the 
soil, etc.; and (v) programming of reforestation actions that reduce bank erosion and have a beneficial 
effect on carbon sequestration. An entire component is reserved for climate financing, on which a 
concept note has been submitted by the Bank to the Green Fund. 

Gender 

3.2.6 In Mauritania, efforts must be made to promote gender-sensitive human development. 
Women are among the prominent development stakeholders in rural areas (representing over 52% of 
the rural population in Mauritania). Agriculture is also the main economic activity of rural women 
and employs more than 90% of working women. About 90% of vegetable farmers are women. Indeed, 
almost the entire female labour force is engaged in this activity.  Apart from agricultural activities, 
rural women are involved in agricultural product processing and handicrafts, which is a key domain 
(weaving, wool processing, etc.). Furthermore, the agricultural model in Mauritania is based on cash 
crops and food crops farmed by men and women, respectively. Hence, farmers are organised into rice 
cooperatives (mainly men, with 30% women) and food crop cooperatives (mainly women). Two 
major challenges arise from this mode of organisation: access to land and financial assistance. 
Women's cooperatives specializing in food crops need small-sized farms and, consequently, the 
women cannot access financial assistance to increase their production. Furthermore, women have 
limited access to agricultural inputs because of their low level education and limited access to 
information. Since women also perform a triple function (childbearing, production and social 
responsibility), solutions must be found to reduce their workload. 

3.2.7 The project is intended to support women's cooperatives through: (i) improvement of 200 
hectares and expansion of the irrigation system of 90 women's cooperatives; (ii) increased access to 
financial support for women's cooperatives through the establishment of a gender-sensitive 
agricultural insurance guarantee fund (to reach 50% of women); (iii) development of a comprehensive 
training centre (incubation) equipped with the necessary demonstration equipment and a teaching 
model to improve agricultural products and agro-industry. Moreover, (iv) the operation of storage 
rooms and improved market access are expected to increase with the construction of the two bridges 
and the organisation of extension services.1

Forced Resettlement 

3.2.8 The Project does not involve the displacement or resettlement of people from the project area. 

IV. Project Implementation 

4.1 Implementation Arrangements 

4.1.1 Executing Agency: The project is placed under the technical supervision of the Directorate 
for Strategy, Cooperation and Monitoring/Evaluation (DSCSE) in the Ministry of Rural Development, 
which will entrust its management and coordination to an autonomous unit based in Boghé within the 
SONADER Regional Directorate. This will promote local supervision, the benefits of which were 
confirmed by PAHABO. The Project Coordination Unit (PCU) will comprise eight experienced 
managers,1 capable of executing the main project tasks:  (i) construction of infrastructure and 
development of flood-recession farmlands, land enhancement, farmers’ advisory, training, 
agricultural extension services, and support for project activities; (ii) project planning, programming, 
and administrative and financial management; and (iii) project coordination, monitoring/evaluation 
and control. Specifically, it will be responsible for the following tasks: (a) preparation and 
implementation of project work programmes and annual budgets (PTBAs); (b) preparation and 
monitoring of bidding documents, works execution, goods and services contracts and disbursement 
requests; (c) internal monitoring of the project; and (d) preparation of financial statements and 
progress reports. The PCU, the DSCSE and the SONADER regional management will work closely 
together to ensure the smooth implementation of project activities. Targeted technical assist ance 
missions (monitoring/evaluation, environmental monitoring) and certain technical departments 
(DDFCA, CNRADA, ENFVA-CFPR, DAR, ANAPEJ, IPM, DPN-MEDD, etc.) will periodically 
support the PCU. 

4.1.2 Institutional Arrangements: Based on the recommendations of the Paris Declaration and the 
conclusive lessons from PAHABO, particularly in terms of institutional arrangements, the project 
will recommend a light coordination and management structure, and will build on the State's 
sustainable structures through the signing of a coordination charter (between Ministry of Rural 
Development stakeholders) and specific partnership agreements with partners involved in its 
implementation (apart from the Ministry of Rural Development:  ANAPEJ, DPN-MEDD, etc.). (i) A 
National Steering Committee (CNP) will be set up at the start of the project to guide, orient and 
supervise its implementation. This committee will be chaired by the Secretary General of the Ministry 
of Agriculture and comprise representatives of stakeholders involved in the project: (MEF, DSCSE, 
DPN-MEDD, ANAPEJ), the PATAM Coordinator (Secretary) and two beneficiary representatives 
(including one woman). It will meet at least twice yearly to review the annual work and budget 
programme (AWBP), and assess project progress. (ii) A Local Consultation Committee (LCC), 
responsible for monitoring and organising activities within the area, will also be set up at project 
commencement. It will be chaired by the Hakem of Boghé, comprising representatives of NGOs and 
two representatives of beneficiaries per area (including one woman), and will meet at least four times 
a year. This Committee may be expanded as necessary to include other persons from the decentralised 
technical services and other structures present in the area (e.g. civil society, representatives of local 
authorities and beneficiaries). The project provides for the signing of a Project Coordination Charter 
(PCC), specific partnership agreements and performance contracts with members of the PCU team to 
ensure results-based management and promote a culture of performance.

administrative and financial officer (AFO), accountant (see organisation chart and job profiles in Annex C1). 



 

 15 

4.1.3 To preserve institutional integration, coherence and continuity, it was agreed to entrust the 
management of PATAM (ADF & NTF funding), the PATAM Project (IsDB funding) and the Climate 
Change Resilience Development Project (Green Fund financing) to the same coordination unit (PCU) 
by adopting the same implementation mechanism.  

Procurement Arrangements (Works, Goods and Services)  

4.1.4  Applicable Procurement Policy and Framework: All goods, works and services funded with 
Bank resources shall be procured in accordance with the Procurement Policy for Bank Group-funded 
Operations (“AfDB Procurement Policy”) October 2015 edition, and the provisions set out in the 
financing agreement. Pursuant to this policy and following various assessments conducted, it was 
agreed that all works, with the exception of irrigation works, and all goods shall be procured in 
accordance with the Borrower's procurement system ("National System") embodied in Law No. 2010-
044 of 22/07/2010 on the Public Procurement Code, its implementing decree No. 2017-216 and other 
statutory texts governing procurement in Mauritania, using national standard bidding documents as 
amended during the project negotiations.   

4.1.5 Irrigation works and all consultancy services will be procured in accordance with the Bank's 
procurement system ("AfDB System") and the Bank's relevant standard bidding documents (BD). The 
Borrower is expected to submit to the Bank a request to use advance contracting (AC), as defined in 
Article 11.2 of the Bank's Procurement Policy of October 2015. The activities targeted by such ACs 
are essentially those related to irrigation scheme works and ancillary control services. 

Special Conditions Stemming from Usage of the National System. 

4.1.6. Eligibility: The Bank's resources for financing project activities come from the joint ADF 
and NTF financing. Procurement financed by the NTF resources administered by AfDB is subject to 
compliance with the rule of origin. Following the assessment of procurement risks and capacities, it 
was decided that the National Procurement System be used for part of this project. All activities of 
this project, whose implementation is planned according to the national public procurement system,  
are financed exclusively from ADF resources. Therefore, no restrictions on the rule of origin will be 
applied to these activities. The only procurement co-financed by the NTF and the ADF, namely the 
consolidation of the track dyke and the development of 7 basins, will be subject to the Bank's 
procurement system and the Bank's rule of origin will be applied. 

4.1.7 Assessment of Procurement Risks and Capacity: Procurement provisions, including risk 
assessment, appropriate risk mitigation measures, procurement capabilities as well as procurement 
implementation details and associated control mechanisms are detailed in Annex B5.  

4.1.8 Advance Contracting: Considering the scheduling constraints related to the Borrower's 
agenda, a number of procurements may, at the Borrower's request, be implemented through advance 
contracting in accordance with the provisions of Article 11.2 of the AfDB Policy. The procedures and 
methods used for such advance contracting shall be identical to those adopted for the project. A 
reasoned request listing the procurements concerned together with a procurement plan shall be 
submitted to and accepted by the Bank.  

4.1.9 Financial Management: The financial management arrangements below are based on an 
assessment of the Executing Agency's financial management capabilities and fiduciary risks detailed 
in the technical annex. They will be redefined during the training to be provided when the project is 
launched. Responsibility for financial management shall rest with the Project Coordination Unit 



 

 16 

(PCU). The PCU will be created by the Ministry of Rural Development and placed under the technical 
supervision of the Directorate for Strategy, Planning and Monitoring/Evaluation (DSPSE). The 
financial management staff will include: a Coordinator, an administrative and financial officer, and 
an accountant. Their recruitment and performance contracts shall be subject to the Bank’s prior 
agreement. Before the beginning of each budget year, the PCU shall prepare an annual work 
programme and budget (AWPB) to be submitted to the Ministry of Rural Development for validation 
through the DSPSE, the Steering Committee and the Bank. It will produce the AWPB implementation 
reports that will serve as the basis for the analysis of variances between projections and actual figures 
(costs and timeframes), supplemented by corrective measures considered in the event of an 
unfavourable variance. These financial performance monitoring reports shall be annexed to the 
quarterly progress reports sent to the Bank latest 45 days after the end of the quarter. Although an 
administrative, financial and accounting procedures manual was prepared under the PPF, it will have 
to be revised and adapted to the final organisation chart of the PCU with a view to its harmonious 
integration within the Ministry of Rural Development, where it will collaborate with certain services. 
The internal control of the project will be based on this manual. 

Project accounting will be kept using the “Success” software procured with an advance from the 
Project Preparation Fund (PPF). The accounting will include all project sources of financing (ADF 
loan, NTF loan and counterpart contributions). The “Success” software will be configured to cover 
all project components and expenditure categories. It should be able to produce quarterly financial 
reports and annual financial statements. 

4.1.10 Disbursement Arrangements: The ADF and NTF loans will be disbursed in accordance with 
the rules and procedures of the Bank's Disbursement Manual, using the direct payment methods (ADF 
loan and NTF ) and the special account method (ADF loan for expenses related to recurrent activities 
and operations). A special account will be opened for this purpose in a bank acceptable to AfDB. 

4.1.11 Account Audit: project financial statements will be audited by an independent external auditor 
annually and at project completion in accordance with the terms of reference (TORs) for the audit of 
AfDB-funded projects. The first audit of the project will include an audit of the use of the Project 
Preparation Fund (PPF) advance in accordance with the Letter of Agreement. Project audit reports 
shall reach the Bank latest six months following the end of the audited fiscal year.  

4.2 Monitoring and Evaluation 

4.2.1 The project will adopt a results-based approach and impact-oriented monitoring (IOM). In 
this regard, a performance measurement framework (PMF) was prepared during the appraisal in 
consultation with the project team (see details in Appendix C.3 Volume 2). As regards this PMF, 
internal monitoring will be carried out by the M/E officer at the PCU level and will serve as a basis 
for evaluating project performance. Monitoring at the central level will be carried out jointly by the 
Directorate for Strategy, Cooperation and Monitoring/Evaluation (DSCSE) in the Ministry of 
Agriculture and MEF's General Directorate for Public Investments and Economic Cooperation 
(DG/IPCE). 

4.2.2 Activities scheduled under the project are summed up in the table below. These activities 
will be conducted following the project implementation schedule presented on Page (vi).

4.3 Governance 

4.3.1 The Mauritanian Government has made efforts over the past five years to increase 
transparency in public affairs management, adopt good governance practices and streamline 
public spending. Hence, it created the Monitoring Committee responsible for implementing the 
National Anti-Corruption Strategy (SNLC) to strengthen the powers and effectiveness of the 
supervisory authorities and the judiciary, and to enhance the key role of Parliament as an entity tasked 
with public expenditure control. This strategy gives civil society the opportunity to express itself, 
formulate opinions and take action with the authorities and the judiciary. The Government has also 
directed macroeconomic policy towards the elimination of extra-budgetary expenditure and budgetary 
financing by the Central Bank of Mauritania, as well as the reduction of recurrent expenditure. 
However, despite these efforts, governance reforms remain insufficient. In 2017, Mauritania was 
ranked 41st out of 54 African countries by the Ibrahim Index of African Governance (IIAG). 
According to the same report, the country's ranking deteriorated over the 2012-2016 period. Under 
Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI), Mauritania's score also deteriorated 
from 31/100 in 2015 to 28/100 in 2017, dropping 31 spots in world ranking (143rd in 2017 compared 
to 112th in 2015). Also, the 2016 Global Competitiveness Index identifies corruption as the third most 
problematic obstacle to doing business in Mauritania. 

4.3.2 In recent years, the Mauritanian Government, with the support of its technical and financial 
partners (TFPs), has initiated a sustained reform programme to improve the national public 
procurement system. This resulted in the adoption of Public Procurement Code 2010-040, which 
incorporates best practice in transparency and competition. To build on this regulatory environment 
for implementation of the provisions of the Paris Declaration on the use of national procedures for the 
execution of AfDB-funded projects, the Bank conducted a detailed review of Mauritania's 
procurement system in 2017. The review, which is currently being validated, concluded that the 
criteria of economy, equity, transparency and integrity are generally met by Mauritania's country 
procurement system. In terms of reforms, and with a view to improving the fiduciary framework for 
public expenditure and procurement efficiency, Mauritania adopted a new decree (No. 126-2017) in 
November 2017 repealing all the implementing decrees of Public Procurement Code 2010-040. This 
new implementing instrument ensures better consistency between the regulations and the public 
procurement code. In the area of financial management, the Government recently introduced a public 
budgetary and accounting management system, called Rashad. State expenditure on projects is 
executed through this system. 



 

 18 

4.4. Sustainability  

4.4.1 In view of the high priority given by the Mauritanian authorities to the agricultural sector 
with a view to diversifying the national economy, major public expenditure has been planned to 
support the construction of the irrigation schemes. Therefore, this project will enjoy total ownership 
by government structures (MEF, Ministry of Rural Development, MEDD, etc.) that have the required 
qualifications in the field, and will receive adequate counterpart funding. Recurrent (additional) 
expenditure due to the project will be budgeted and borne by the (regular) operating budget of the 
Ministry of Rural Development, to which the Servicing and Maintenance Fund to be established will 
make a significant contribution mainly to cover the maintenance and servicing costs of the 
transformative irrigation schemes.  

4.4.2 The project seeks to revive flood-recession farming in seven basins totalling 3,300 ha, 
develop vegetable farming areas totalling 200 ha for women, guarantee and ensure the availability of 
water for flood-recession farming, protect against floods and open up access to these areas. Thus, 
through the activities planned, PATAM will have a strong impact to stimulate the social and economic 
development of the project area. It will be recalled that one of the significant impacts of PAHABO is 
the reverse exodus phenomenon that has resulted in the resettlement of more than 1,500 households 
in the project area from the big cities (Nouakchott, Rosso, Nouadhibou, etc). Thus, farmers’ 
involvement in ensuring project ownership and their participation in financing and executing works 
to rehabilitate the farming areas, as well as measures taken to train and organise beneficiaries to ensure 
proper infrastructure management and maintenance will increase project viability and sustainability. 

4.5. Risk Management 

4.5.1 The main risk factors that could compromise project implementation are: (i) insufficient 
interdepartmental coordination; (ii) climate hazards; (iii) limited stakeholder institutional capacity; 
(iv) lack of financial inclusion and insufficient access to finance and credit; (v) poor maintenance and 
servicing of the irrigation schemes that affects the sustainability of the system, crop production and 
profitability; and (vi) procurement delays and their impact on the disbursement rate. 

4.5.2 The main risk factors and appropriate mitigation measures are summarised in the table below: 

Potential Risks Mitigation Measures Level 
Insufficient capacity for inter-sector 
coordination at the national level and 
consultation at the local level 

Establishment of an inter-sector National Steering Committee and a 
Local Consultative Committee. ++ 

Recurrent climatic hazards/droughts Dissemination of resilient technology and seeds. ++ 
Limited stakeholder institutional capacity The programme provides for stakeholder capacity building. ++ 

Problem of financial inclusion and access to 
funding and credit 

The project provides for: (i) a guarantee fund to improve financial 
inclusion; (ii) a partnership convention with Crédit Agricole de 
Mauritanie (CAM); (iii) assistance in the organisation of the 
beneficiaries to facilitate access to credit; and (iv) promotion of 
agricultural insurance. 

+++ 

Poor servicing and maintenance of irrigation 
schemes 

Support for the organisation of water usage, socio-professional 
associations (SPAs) and the establishment of a Servicing and 
Maintenance Fund. 

+++ 

Procurement delays and impact on bid 
invitations and on the disbursement rate 

(i) Use of the national system (ref. applied thresholds); (ii) application 
of advance contracting (APA); (iii) development and implementation of 
necessary tools and capacity building: technical support in procurement, 
development and implementation of public procurement to improve 
upstream (procurement monitoring) and downstream expenditure 
(disbursement planning and monitoring).

4.6 Knowledge Building 

4.6.1 PATAM’s implementation will help to develop knowledge on new irrigation techniques, 
yield enhancement, promotion of the rice and market gardening sectors, farming of high value-added 
crops, management and saving of water resources, and mitigation of the effects of climate change. 
The TAAT initiative will provide support and contribute to: (i) the optimal exploitation of water 
resources; (ii) the adoption of participatory management of the irrigation scheme; and (iii) the use of 
various information systems established (monitoring/evaluation, mapping, agricultural insurance, 
guarantee system, etc.). The training and information sessions envisaged by the project for the 
provision of agricultural advice on irrigation techniques and farming practices to beneficiaries and 
technicians will provide another channel for enhancing and disseminating knowledge. The project 
will also run the Research and Development Programme sub-component, in addition to supporting 
Young Agricultural Entrepreneurs and their involvement in the priority subsector value chains 
retained. The main knowledge gained and lessons learned will be reflected in the project's periodic 
reports and completion report, filed in the Bank's archiving system and published on the websites of 
the ministries concerned (MEF, Ministry of Rural Development, MEDD and ANAPEJ, etc.); (iv) 
design production value models, value chain development in project areas and market access; and (v) 
promote a contractual framework between the stakeholders involved in project implementation. The 
training and information sessions envisaged by the project to promote research and development, and 
support farmers to master irrigation techniques and farming practices constitutes an ideal channel for 
knowledge dissemination. Furthermore, the institution building provided to grassroots organisations 
(rice cooperatives, women's vegetable-farming cooperatives, EIGs, water users' organisations, etc.) 
will give these structures the necessary capacity to serve more effectively as an interface with the 
Ministry of Rural Development. This knowledge will be systematically captured and documented in 
best practice manuals, monitoring and evaluation reports, supervision missions and periodic reports 
that will be shared at country and Bank level. The main knowledge gained and lessons learned will be 
reflected in the project's periodic reports and completion report, filed in the Bank's archiving system 
and published on the websites of the Ministries and stakeholders concerned (MEF, Ministry of 
Agriculture, MEDD, ANAPEJ, IPM, BCM, CAM and NBM). The “African Digital Financial 
Inclusion (ADFI) initiative will be promoted for innovative solutions targeting smart agriculture.

Bank Portfolio in Mauritania Major Constraints and Measures Considered 
2.8.1 The Bank’s portfolio in Mauritania at mid November 2018 comprised 15 operations worth UA 239 million; 
72.5% of Bank commitments are operations without a sovereign guarantee. There are 11 public sector operations, two 
of which are multinational (Programme to Build Resilience to Food and Nutrition Insecurity in the Sahel (P2RS - UA 
11.5 million) and the Rosso Bridge Construction Project (UA 25 million)), for a total UA 66.4 million. The portfolio 
covers seven sectors of intervention: industry and mining (67%), transport (11%), water and sanitation (6%), finance 
(5%), agriculture (5%), governance (4%) and social (2%). The configuration of the active portfolio reflects a 
preponderance of the mining and transport sectors, which represent 77% of the Bank's commitment in Mauritania. 
Overall, the performance of the Bank's portfolio in Mauritania is deemed satisfactory. The overall score of the portfolio 
based on the most recent supervision ratings is 3 on a scale of 4, the average score for progress indicators is 3 and the 
average score for development objectives (DO) is 3, which means that the portfolio's performance is satisfactory 
overall. The detailed status of the portfolio is shown in the table above. 

However, although the overall quality of the portfolio is deemed satisfactory, 
implementation problems persist: (i) start-up delays due to a lack of project 
ownership by the Mauritanian side; (ii) procurement delays; and (iii) weak project 
implementation capacity. Measures designed to address these challenges include: (i) 
quality improvement at entry by setting up project management bodies prior to 
approval; (ii) the establishment of more rigorous procurement plans; and (iii) the 
assessment of implementation capacity issues and substantial capacity building. All 
these recommendations were factored into PATAM.

Executive Summary 

A. Project Overview  

A1. The South Agro-Industrial Processing Zone Project (PZTA-Sud, or Agropole Sud) is among 

the flagship projects of Senegal’s Vision 2035 Emerging Senegal Plan (PSE), which raises the number 

of growth drivers from two (telecommunications and services) to six, the four new ones being 

agriculture and agribusiness, housing, mining and tourism. It forms part of Pillar I of the PSE on 

“Structural transformation of the economy and growth” and is an integral part of the industrial PSE 

component that provides for the establishment of three “integrated and competitive agricultural hubs”. 

Furthermore, PZTA-Sud is in line with the priorities of the Country Strategy Paper (CSP) for the 2016-

2020 period and the Bank's Ten-Year Strategy 2013-2022 through its High 5s “Feed Africa”, 

“Industrialise Africa” and “Improve the quality of life for the people of Africa”. 

A2. PZTA-Sud is a pilot project to be implemented over five years for a total cost (net of taxes) 

of approximately EUR 87.75 million, broken down as follows: (i) ADB loan: EUR 43.1 million; (ii) 

IsDB loan: EUR 27.85 million, and (iii) the State: EUR 16.8 million. The project comprises 3 

components: (a) Support for the establishment of a business ecosystem conducive to private investment 

in agribusiness; (b) Sustainable improvement of the capacity of agro-industrial producers; (c) 

Coordination, management and monitoring/evaluation. A Project Implementation Unit (PIU), attached 

to the Ministry of Industry (Executing Agency), will be responsible for: (i) coordinating investments 

in the agricultural hub; and (ii) implementing public sub-projects. It will be complemented by the 

Sovereign Fund for Strategic Investment (FONSIS), for the implementation of PPP sub-projects 

through a Construction and Operation Company (SCE). Lastly, private companies will be responsible 

for private sub-projects, in partnership with local financial institutions.  

A3. The project area is the natural region of Casamance, which has real agro-industrial potential 

in its three administrative districts of Ziguinchor, Sedhiou and Kolda. Thus, the project aims to 

contribute to the revival of this region’s economic activities to support the current peace and 

reconstruction momentum. In this regard, the project will have to mitigate the adverse effects of the 

independence crisis of these last decades through the establishment of an ecosystem conducive to 

private investment in the agro-industrial sectors with high nutritional and market (national and export) 

potential. The key expected outputs of the project are: (i) increase in the share of locally processed 

agricultural production from 2% to 20% for mango and from 5% to 30% for cashew nuts; (ii) reach a 

cumulative amount of catalysed private investment of more than USD 200 million (of which 20% for 

SMEs/SMIs); (iii) increase by at least 40% the agricultural production of key sectors (mango, cashew 

and maize); and (iv) create jobs and wealth, including for youth and women. The project was the subject 

of a comprehensive state-funded feasibility study conducted by a private firm and supported by the 

United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO).  

A4. The project will enable the creation and consolidation of about 14,500 direct jobs (of which 

50% women and 60% youth) and 35,000 indirect jobs (of which 50% women and 60% youth). The 

number of households that will be affected is estimated at 65,000, or about 365,000 people (of which 

50% women and 60% youth). The number of people who will be indirectly affected corresponds to the 

population of the natural region of Casamance estimated at 2 million in 2018. The expected outcomes 

concern improving the food and nutritional security of beneficiaries as well as their income through 

improved access to markets, agricultural inputs, and services. To this end, the project provides for (i) 

the increase in private investment thanks to the facilities provided (more favourable business 

ecosystem, construction of a central agro-industrial module (Adéane), three (3) regional modules 

(Bignona, Sédhiou and Kolda) and five (5) aggregation and service platforms; and (ii) capacity building 

of value chain actors in agro-industrial sectors (structuring/organisation of value chains, training, ease 

of access to finance, production by researching in-vitro mango, cashew, maize seedlings, etc.).  

 



vi 

B. Needs Assessment 

B.1  Despite efforts by the State, food security remains a challenge and food importation continues 

to weigh on the trade balance. Thus, imports of cereals and fruits/by-products amounted respectively 

to CFAF 329.7 billion and CFAF 37 billion in 2017. This is due to the limited private investment as a 

result of the unfavourable business environment (land, taxation, etc.), inadequate infrastructure 

(energy, transport, water, ICT, etc.) and poor structuring/organisation of agricultural value chains 

(which employ about 60% of the working population). Furthermore, there is a low level of processing 

of agricultural products based on quality industrial processes (barely 13% at national level), low 

agricultural productivity and high vulnerability to climate change. This situation is more pronounced 

in the project area where barely 2% and 5% of the mango and cashew nut productions are processed, 

respectively. Thus, the project aims to facilitate the mobilisation of private investment especially in the 

processing and marketing of key sectors (mango, cashew, corn, etc.).  

C. Bank’s Value-Added  

C.1  Through its initiative to support the development of Agro-Industrial Processing Zones 

(AIPZs), the Bank aims to increase private investment in the agro-industrial sector for a sustainable 

transformation of the rural economy particularly by providing quality basic infrastructure and a more 

attractive business environment in the agricultural production basins. The Bank has the requisite 

experience to support the preparation and implementation of this type of project (including in Togo, 

Ethiopia, Guinea, Côte d'Ivoire, etc.), which calls for an integrated approach encompassing the entire 

value chain. Lastly, lessons from similar projects supported by the Bank militate for such an 

intervention that will mobilise the public component (with ADB and IsDB public windows), PPP (with 

FONSIS) and private (with FONSIS and financial institutions).  

D. Knowledge Building 

D.1  As PZTA-Sud is a pilot operation under the PSE, a mechanism will be put in place for 

monitoring/evaluation (M & E) of outcomes and impacts. The project will set up a suitable internal 

monitoring system for project performance led by the Steering Committee, on the one hand, and 

external evaluation, on the other hand, supervised by the Operational and Monitoring Office (BOS) of 

the PSE under the oversight of the Presidency of the Republic. The project will support BOS to carry 

out baseline and end-of-project surveys and, if necessary, specific studies (incentives, private 

financing, public-private partnership, etc.).  Lastly, the results of the M&E mechanism will be 

leveraged and shared through the BOS e-platform, the analytical reports, the consultation and 

experience sharing meetings organised at the regional, national and international level.

BANK GROUP MANAGEMENT’S REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION TO THE BOARD OF 

DIRECTORS CONCERNING A LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL TO FINANCE THE 

SOUTH AGRO-INDUSTRIAL PROCESSING ZONE PROJECT (PZTA-SUD) 
 

Management hereby submits this report and its recommendation concerning a proposal to grant a loan of 

EUR 43,100,000 to the Republic of Senegal to finance the activities of the PZTA-Sud project, commonly 

known as “Agropole Sud”. 

I. STRATEGIC THRUST AND RATIONALE 

1.1 Project Linkages with Country Strategy and Objectives  

 

1.1.1 In 2014, the Government embarked on the implementation of the Emerging Senegal Plan (PSE), 

which aims to have “an emerging Senegal in 2035 with a society of solidarity in a nation of laws” through 

the structural transformation of the economic and social system. The strategic thrusts guiding the PSE are as 

follows: (i) Thrust 1: Structural transformation of the economy and Growth; (ii) Thrust 2: Human Capital, 
Social Protection and Sustainable Development; and (iii) Thrust 3: Governance, Institutions, Peace and 

Security. Thus, PZTA-Sud or ‘Agropole Sud’ falls within the framework of the PSE’s Thrust 1 and forms an 

integral part of the second Priority Action Plan (PAP) of PSE spanning the period 2019-2023. 

 

1.1.2 PZTA-Sud (or Agropole Sud) is one of PSE's three agro-processing hubs (or integrated agricultural 

hubs) through private investments in agribusiness. Thus, it is consistent with the Industrial Sector 

Development Policy Letter (LPSDI), which seeks to raise the industrial sector’s contribution to the GDP 

from 12 to 25% over the period 2014-35, by targeting the agricultural value chains with high potential (fruits 

and vegetables, oils, dairy products, cereals, and poultry). This will benefit the domestic market (import 

substitution) and the international market (fruits and vegetables, fishery products, etc.) as well. It is part of 

the guidelines of the Agricultural, Sylvicultural and Pastoral Policy Law (LOASP) 2004-24 aimed at 

reducing poverty and food security in rural areas. It also aligns with multisector strategies including the 

National Strategy for Food Security and Resilience (SNSAR 2015-35), the National Strategy for Social 

Protection (SNPS 2016-35) and the National Strategy for Equity and Gender Equality (SNEEG 2015-25).   

 Emerging Senegal Plan (PSE) 
  
PSE is the economic policy framework aimed at steering Senegal on the path of emergence by 2035. Pursuing the 
vision of "an emerging Senegal in 2035 with a society of solidarity in a nation of laws", it is structured around 3 thrusts 
targeting 6 priority sectors, 17 key reforms and 27 flagship projects. Thrust 1 aims at the structural transformation of the 
economy by strengthening the current drivers of growth and developing new sectors that create wealth and jobs. Thrust 2 
"Human Capital, Social Protection and Sustainable Development" aims to improve living conditions for the people while 
promoting the emergence of viable territories. Thrust 3 aims to modernise public administration and strengthen security, 
stability, governance, and consolidate the rule of law. 

The first priority action plan (PAP 1) over the 2014-2018 period has raised the GDP growth rate from an average of 
3.3% in 2009-2013 to more than 6% since 2015. Substantial progress has been made in key projects such as the Diass 
International Airport, the extension of the Dakar-Diamniadio motorway, the Thiès-Touba motorway, the Regional Express 
Train, the Diamniadio Industrial Park and the rehabilitation of the Dakar-Bamako railroad line. The agricultural sector has 
been strongly revitalised with the tripling of onion and groundnut production, the tenfold increase in potato production and 
the 141% increase in rice production. As regards energy, progress has been achieved in the installed capacity from 573 to 
1130 megawatts, but also in the generation of renewable energy (solar and wind) with 144 megawatts newly installed. The 
number of electrified villages over the period has increased from 1648 to 3864. The second Phase 2019-2023 (PAP II) 
seeks to remove or mitigate the potential constraints to this growth momentum, while promoting a better articulation 
between the development objectives (SDGs) and those of PSE. It emphasises improving the structuring and maturation of 
projects, and accelerating the implementation of reforms. 

Lastly, the PSE monitoring/evaluation system was strengthened with the implementation of the Harmonised 
Monitoring and Evaluation Framework (CASE) for Public Policy in 2015, comprising the Operational Monitoring Bureau 
(BOS), the Ministry of Economy and Planning and the Organisation and Methods Bureau (BOM). Thus, placed under the 
authority of the Minister in charge of monitoring the PSE, the role of BOS is to provide decision-making tools to the country’s 
highest authority on a weekly basis. It is also responsible for the organisation, coordination and management of 
maturation/structuring processes of projects or flagship reforms.

1.2 Rationale for the Bank’s Intervention 

 

1.2.1 Senegal’s economy continues to perform well, with average annual GDP growth of around 6.7% over 

the 2016-2018 period. This performance is attributable particularly to the dynamism of agriculture, 

construction, tourism, transport as well as financial and insurance service sectors. However, food imports 

continue to weigh on the trade balance and food security remains a challenge. Reasons identified include the 

low level of processing of agricultural products according to quality and competitive industrial processes, 

the low productivity of the agricultural sector and its high vulnerability to climate change. These constraints 

result from the limited private investment due to the business environment that remains unfavourable - 

despite jumping 18 spots in the Doing Business 2020 ranking, the poor quality of basic infrastructure (energy, 

transport, water, telecommunications, etc.) and the poor organisation of agricultural value chains (which 

employ about 60% of the labour force). 

1.2.2 The South Agro-Industrial Processing Zone Project (PZTA-Sud) aligns well with the priorities of 

the Bank's Country Strategy Paper 2016-2020 for Senegal, notably Pillar I on support for agricultural 

processing. Furthermore, it forms part of the Bank’s Regional Integration Strategy for West Africa (RISP 

2016-17, extended to 2019). It is in consonance with three (3) of the five (5) operational priorities of the 

Bank's Ten-Year Strategy 2013-2022, namely (i) the Feed Africa Strategy 2016-2025; (ii) the 

Industrialisation Strategy for Africa 2016-25; and (iii) the Strategy for Improving the Quality of Life for the 

People of Africa 2016-25. Furthermore, the project is in line with the Bank's Second Climate Change Action 

Plan (CCAP II 2016-2020). Lastly, the Bank's intervention forms part of the initiative launched in recent 

years for the development of "agro-industrial processing zones" in agricultural basins with high market 

(domestic and export) potential. Accordingly, Senegal has forged a strategic partnership with the Bank for 

the implementation of the three (3) "Competitive Integrated Agricultural Hubs" of the PSE. Therefore, the 

project will benefit from lessons learned from similar initiatives around the world, and from the Bank’s 

experience garnered in Africa (particularly in Togo, Ethiopia and Guinea), hence its comparative advantage. 

1.3 Donor Coordination  

 

1.3.1 Development assistance is coordinated by the Government through the Economic and Financial 

Cooperation Department (DCEF) of the Ministry of Economy, Planning and Cooperation (MEPC). 

Coordination is carried out by the Consultative Committee of Technical and Financial Partners (TFPs) 

through a three-tier consultation mechanism to which the Bank belongs: the G50, the G15 including a 15-

member Executive Committee (COMEX) and thematic groups. In the dialogues between the TFPs and the 

Government, the main issues addressed concern implementing the key PSE reforms, including land, portfolio 

performance, monitoring/evaluation of outcomes, strengthening of the road maintenance fund and resource 

mobilisation (including domestic resources) under the Ministry of Finance and the Budget (MFB). It is worth 

noting that for the "integrated competitive agro-industrial hubs" project, the agricultural sector TFPs 

participate in the meetings of the National Technical Working Group chaired by MDIPMI. 

1.3.2 Therefore, PZTA-Sud will make use of the results expected from the interventions of projects 

supporting increased agricultural productivity and the development of rural entrepreneurship, namely the 

Water Valorisation for Value Chains Development Project (PROVALE-CV), the Project to Open Up 

Production Areas in Support of the Local Development Programme (PDZP/PNDL-AfDB), the Support 

Project for Skills Development and Youth Entrepreneurship in Growth Sectors (PDCEJ-AfDB), the 

Multinational Programme to Build Resilience to Food and Nutrition Insecurity in the Sahel (P2RS-AfDB), 

and the Project to Develop Resilience to Recurrent Food Insecurity in Senegal (DRIARS-IsDB). 

1.3.3 Specifically, the project will work with the professional organisations engaged in these sub-sectors 

(producer organisations, aggregators/logisticians, agro-processing entities, and exporters) and synergize with 

similar ongoing projects, including Shelter for Life funded by the United States Development Agency

(USAID) and the Project to Support Investment and Competitiveness of Agribusiness in Senegal, focusing 

particularly on the mango industry in Casamance (also USAID-funded). Lastly, the following table shows

II. PROJECT DESCRIPTION    

2.0 Project Intervention Overview  

2.0.0  The project’s overall objective is to contribute towards improving living conditions for the people 

(including youth and women) through the creation of value-added on agricultural products and the 

sustainable increase of productivity of the priority agro-industrial subsectors (mango and cashew nut). The 

specific objectives of the project are (i) to create conditions conducive to private investment in the industrial 

processing of agricultural products, as well as in the provision of inputs and services; and (ii) enhance the 

capacity of priority sector actors to sustainably increase agricultural productivity. 

2.0.1 In terms of concept: the project was designed based on a feasibility study financed by the 

government with UNIDO support, as per the following principles: (i) the targeting of sectors with a domestic 

or international market potential, which led to the choice of two priority subsectors (mango and cashew) and 

three complementary subsectors (maize, banana and non-timber forest products); (ii) the presence of a high-

potential agricultural production basin; and (iii) private sector interest in investing, as confirmed during the 

consultation days (Labs) and with the creation of SOCAAS (Cooperative Society of Actors of the South 

Agricultural hub). The key expected results of mango processing are puree, nectar, dried mango and vinegar. 

For cashew, expected products are cashew nuts and cashew juice. 

2.0.2 At the physical level: PZTA-Sud (or Agropole Sud) will finance : (i) a central module for the 

industrial transformation of productions from the targeted sectors, their packaging and marketing, for a Phase 

1 surface area of 40 ha expandable to 85 ha; (ii) three regional modules for secondary packaging and primary 

processing (local and regional market) covering an area of 5 ha to be serviced, expandable to 10 ha; (iii) five 

division-level platforms for aggregation, cleaning, sorting and primary packaging with a unit area of 3 to 5 

ha; and (iv) collection points in villages (primary storage facilities). Furthermore, resources are earmarked to 

ensure access of modules and platforms to regional networks (roads, electricity, ICT, etc.). The land of the 

agricultural hub, which has been secured according to the requirements of national procedures and the Bank, 

will be registered in the name of SCE. 



 

4 

2.0.2 At the operational level:  three categories of sub-projects (SP) were deemed necessary to implement 

to ensure the success of the agricultural processing area (or Agricultural Hub), namely: 

 Public sub-projects (financed from AfDB and IsDB public windows) will be set up by the Project 
Executing Agency to facilitate private investment. These public sub-projects mainly concern the 

infrastructure of the central module (located in Adéane), regional modules (Kolda, Bignona and Kolda) 

and aggregation and service platforms for which the preliminary design studies (PDS) are in progress 

and those of detailed design (DD) are planned before end-2019. Thus, the project will finance the 

preparation of bidding documents (BD) as well as construction work. Capacity building of institutional 

structures (ministries, research centres, technical services, etc.) and actors of value chains (Banks/MFIs, 

POs, etc.) will be financed by the project to for performance enhancement. Partnership agreements, if 

needed, will be signed with the said structures. 

 

 The public-private sub-projects will be financed via the Sovereign Fund for Strategic Investments 
(FONSIS) to which this responsibility is entrusted under a MDIPMI-FONSIS-BOS tripartite agreement. 

Thus, FONSIS will set up a Construction and Operation Company (SCE), a public limited company 

whose majority capital will be held by the private sector (tenant companies, financial investors and 

members of inter-professional sectors), but will include public investors (FONSIS, local governments 

and the Central State). Alongside the relevant State entities, the SCE will be responsible for: (i) 

developing public-private sub-projects (about 5); (ii) promoting the arrival of private investors in the 

hub; and (iii) managing, recovering and maintaining the hub. SCE’s income will consist mainly of 

rentals, royalties and business services (see box 
 

South Agricultural Hub (Agropole Sud) Construction and Operation Company (SCE) 
 

The mobilisation of private investment is crucial for the success of Agropole Sud. The criteria influencing the investment 

decision include the country’s quality of life and stability, market size, existence of developed and competitive land for industrial units, 

quality of infrastructure (water, energy, wastewater treatment, etc.), connection to domestic and export markets, availability of 

qualified and affordable labour, and the existence of tax/non-tax incentives for targeted activities. 
 

In this regard, Agropole Sud has several strengths, among which: (i) the participatory structuring of the project, which has 

helped to obtain the commitment of producers of the targeted sectors and potential private sector interest; (ii) the upgrading of 

infrastructure thanks to the infrastructure provided for under the project (core module, regional modules, and aggregation and 

service platforms) and those planned by other actors (existence of the Trans-Gambia bridge, dredging of the Casamance River 

enabling the arrival of boats of 5500 tonnes, planned rehabilitation of the Senoba-Ziguinchor road, upgrading of the Ziguinchor 

airport, revival of tourism, etc.); and (iii) the facilitation of investments through the establishment by APIX of an Investment Platform 

in Ziguinchor and the future Agropole du Sud one-stop-shop, as well as the future implementation by FONSIS (Sovereign Fund for 

Strategic Investments) of the Agropole du Sud Construction and Operation Company (SCE). 
 

Thus, on the recommendation of the LAB (5-week participatory workshop organised by BOS, which brought together 96 structures 

for a total 10,500 working hours), a tripartite agreement (BOS-MDIPMI-FONSIS) was signed to entrust FONSIS with the creation 

of the SCE, as a founding shareholder. SCE will be a private company, majority owned by private companies including strategic 

investors (including tenant and inter-professional companies) and financial investors. The State (including FONSIS) and local 

authorities figure among the public shareholders. FONSIS will be responsible for developing and supporting the implementation of 

the future SCE business plan, with the possible involvement of a world-class strategic partner with expertise in the development, 

operation and promotion of private investments in the agricultural hub. The SCE will develop convincing business cases 

concerning specific investments expected in the modules (central and regional) and divisional -level platforms. In these efforts, SCE 

will synergize with the actors involved in investment promotion, including BOS, MDIPMI, APIX, and ASEPEX.

 Private sub-projects will be implemented by the interested companies that will be shareholders of the 
SCE. Among these are five (5) large companies and about 15 SMEs/SMIs. In this regard, this project 

will finance the intervention of the Upgrading Bureau (BMN) to provide non-financial support to about 

35 micro-enterprises and 15 SMEs. Access to financial services will be facilitated through local financial 

institutions (notably Banque Agricole, PAMECAS and ACEP), which have instruments tailored to the 

needs of short- and medium-term credit (“warrantage”, leasing, etc.). They will be supported by the 

Bank through a private sector-window operation under preparation (with PITD) to improve access to 

long-term resources, which is essential for the development of SMEs/ SMIs of the agricultural hub (see 

box). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 Facilitating Access to Financial Services for SMEs/SMIs 

The country's financial system comprises 29 credit institutions, but its banking penetration rate is 19%. Access to 
financial services remains a challenge, especially for SMEs/SMIs, which account for around 80% of enterprises, contribute 30% 
of GDP formation, and employ nearly 60% of the workforce. Furthermore, there is limited access to credit for the agricultural 
sector, perceived as risky by the banks and the SFDs (insufficient financial standing, weak organisational and management 
structures, unreliable financial information, lack of guarantees, and climatic and edaphic hazards) with total or partial crop losses: 
climate, price volatility, markets, health hazards, locust invasions, etc.). They have put in place various types of credit, mainly 
short-term, including: (i) credits for agricultural production; (ii) marketing credits for agricultural products; (iii) credits to breeders' 
organisations for fattening and marketing; (iv) working capital loans, notably through "warrantage"; and (v) medium-long-term 
agricultural equipment credits (tractors, tillers, motor pumps, etc.) via collateral. 

Thus, the project will provide support in the form of: (i) an upgrade of SMEs/SMIs operating in the targeted sectors through 
a technical assistance agreement to SME/SMI support structures (such as the Upgrading Bureau); (ii) a medium-to-long term 
line of credit (from the ADB's private window) to be set up with one or two well-established financial institutions; (iii) strengthening 

the capacity of FS/banks networks (based on a call for proposals) to help them develop financial products adapted to the 
needs of the agro-industrial sector (warrantage, leasing, etc.), staff training and equipment purchase.

2.2 Technical Solutions Adopted and Alternatives Explored 

2.2.1 PZTA-Sud aims to contribute to the transformation of the agro-industrial sector, with a view to 

inclusive agricultural growth reducing poverty and food imports and generating employment. Accordingly, 

PSE provides for the establishment of three "integrated competitive agro-industrial hubs or agricultural 

hubs", in public-private partnership. For Agropole Sud, the physical agro-industrial architecture planned for 

the targeted sectors (mango, cashew, corn, etc.) will include i) a centralised serviced module (external works, 

electricity, sanitation, one-stop shop, etc.) to accommodate the key industrial units and related services 

(logistics, services, etc.); ii) three serviced regional modules that will serve as storage, secondary packaging 

and primary processing areas for agricultural products; and iii) serviced aggregation and service platforms 

to facilitate interaction between value chain actors and to ease producers’ access to services, inputs and 

markets. With the support of the State services, this system will be complemented by improving the access 

of SMEs/SMIs and POs to technologies (quality plant material, inputs, etc.), knowledge (technical, 

organisational, management, etc.), physical infrastructure (access roads, shops, etc.) and soft infrastructure 

(ICT, digital platform, etc.). The system will be complemented by the establishment of the Construction and 

Operations Company by FONSIS. The company established will be in charge of agricultural hub construction 

and management, implementation of the PPP sub-projects (5) and support for private sector mobilisation (60 

enterprises of which 35 micro, 15 SMEs, 5 large), in conjunction with the other relevant State agencies 

(APIX, MDIPMI, ASEPEX, etc.).

2.3 Project Type    

2.3.1 PZTA-Sud is a public investment project that aims to create the conditions for increased private 

investment in targeted value chains, particularly in the areas of agricultural processing, input supply and food 

services.  

2.4 Project Cost and Financing Arrangement 

2.4. Project Cost: The project’s overall cost is estimated at EUR 87.75 million (~ CFAF 57.6 billion), 

net of taxes and customs duties. This cost is broken down as follows: a portion in foreign exchange estimated 

at EUR 59.1 million (~ CFAF 38.8 billion) and a portion in local currency amounting to EUR 28.65 million 

(~ CFAF 18.8 billion). This cost includes provisions for physical and financial contingencies estimated at 

approximately 3% each. The estimate of the financial contingencies was made based on the current and 

projected annual rates of inflation of the local currency and foreign exchange estimated on average 

respectively at 2.5% and 1.5% per year. A summary of the estimated project cost by component and 

expenditure category is shown in Tables 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5 below, while the detailed tables are given as an

Senegal for the respective amounts of EUR 43.1 million (49%), EUR 27.85 million (32%), and EUR 16.8 

million (19%). Thus, it should be noted that the combined amount of the counterpart and IDB financing 

represents nearly 51% of the total, which indicates the Government's significant commitment. The 

government counterpart funding contribution, amounting to EUR 16.8 million, includes the seed money 

provided by FONSIS for implementing public-private sub-projects amounting to CFAF 1 billion, the 

compensation of affected persons, rehabilitation of some of the roads connecting the platforms/modules to 

the production areas and the social spending of the PIU. Details of expenditures by source of financing and

2.5. Project Area and Targeted Beneficiaries 

2.5.1 The project impact area covers the regions of Ziguinchor, Kolda and Sedhiou which constitute the 
natural region of Casamance and had a population of about 1,947,967 in 2018. The agricultural and socio-

economic environment of the rural population is characterised by a low access rate to rural roads, storage, 

processing and agricultural production infrastructure, particularly for youth and women. The area has the 

distinction of being among the country’s most productive in agriculture thanks to its good rainfall and soil 

quality. However, a large part of agricultural production is difficult to market owing to low value-added for 

agricultural products. 

2.5.2 The area of intervention has been the focus of attention by the State following the armed conflict of 
the 1980s and 1990s, thanks to the inclusive dialogue for peace and the implementation of multisector 

projects (PPDC, PACM, PARCES, PUDC, etc.), some financed by AfDB (PPDC, P2RS, PROVALE) and 

IsDB (DRIARS, PROMISE, RRVCP etc.). To date, Ziguinchor port and airport are functional, the bridge 

over the Gambia River was completed in 2019 and the road network expanded with the rehabilitation of the 

Sénoba-Ziguinchor road. Therefore, the project comes to consolidate these gains by financing the requisite 

actions to attract private investment in agribusiness. The project will create 14,500 direct jobs and 35,000 

indirect jobs. It will benefit approximately 65,000 households, or about 365,000 people (51% women). It 

will target farmers and the private sector (including SMEs/SMIs) that can invest in agricultural processing 

and service delivery. Specific actions will target the youth and women to integrate them into the agricultural 

value chains. The construction of the agricultural hub infrastructure will be based on local labour. Enterprises 

will receive advisory support to provide decent jobs with basic social security. 

2.6 Participatory Approach to Project Identification, Design and Implementation 

2.6.1 The project design is based on a participatory and inclusive approach involving all stakeholders: 

technical services, producer organisations, women/youth groups, civil society, private sector, TFPs and 

projects. These broad-based consultations took place at all stages, including pre-feasibility and feasibility 

studies, sub-project or 'LAB' structuring workshops, and project preparation and appraisal missions. Under 

the supervision of BOS, the PEMANDU Big Fast Results method (the equivalent of BOS in Malaysia) was 

applied to allow full stakeholder participation through the LAB, which brought 150 participants from 96 



 

11 

structures (private sector, financial institutions, public sector, civil society, etc.) for a total of 10,500 hours 

of work. 

2.6.2  The process helped to (i) delimit the Agropole Sud scheme, with a focus on the priority sectors (mango 

and cashew); (ii) structure the priority sub-projects (public, PPP, and private) to be retained in the agricultural 

hub; (iii) decide on the creation of a Construction and Operations Company (SCE) of the hub in the form of 

a company under private law, in particular to implement the PPP sub-projects; iv) adopt the principle of 

mandating FONSIS to create the SCE, through a tripartite protocol agreement duly signed by FONSIS, BOS 

and MDIPMI. Furthermore, the involvement of various stakeholders has served to identify private investment 

opportunities to be mobilised, with a view to generating wealth, employment & youth entrepreneurship. 

2.6.3 At the project area level, working sessions brought together the territorial administration, local 

elected officials, technical services (agriculture, livestock, water and forestry, etc.), research institutes (ISRA, 

ITA, etc.), financial institutions (Banque Agricole, PAMECAS, ACEP), representatives of producers, civil 

society and certain projects. These working sessions served to (i) present the project's intervention strategy; 

(ii) share the technical choices and channels chosen; (iii) discuss the role of the project actors, gather the 

opinions of the actors and measure the interest of the beneficiaries and their level of accountability in project 

formulation, implementation and sustainability. This participatory approach will be continued during project 

implementation. 

2.7 Bank Group Experience and Lessons Reflected in Project Design 

2.7.1 As of 30 September 2019, the Bank's portfolio comprised twenty-nine operations for a total net 

commitment of UA 1,030 million. This amount is broken down as follows: UA 864.29 million for the public 

sector and UA167.14 million for the private sector. The sector breakdown of national public sector projects 

is as follows: transport (54.0%); water and sanitation (15.1%); rural (17.5%); ICT (6.0%); social (2.1%); 

energy (3.5%) and governance (1.8%). The portfolio performance of national public sector projects remains 

satisfactory with 3 out of 4. The project effectiveness has decreased on average from 9.4 months to 5 months 

between 2011 and 2019 and the average time from approval to meeting the conditions precedent to first 

disbursement has improved from 9.6 months in 2013 to 7 months in 2019. The disbursement rate is 26% for 

an average portfolio age of 3.5 years. Lastly, the public sector portfolio comprises 4 regional operations for 

UA 83.52 million (Senegal) and a disbursement rate of around 35%. 

2.7.2 The mid-term review of the CSP 2016-2020, combined with the portfolio review provided lessons and 

recommendations as follows: (a) For the Bank : i) strengthen Bank support to the private sector to enhance its 

competitiveness and contribution to growth (including through PZTA); ii) improve the project preparation 

quality by using the Project Preparation Fund (PPF); iii) increase the role of the Bank's country office in 

Senegal in project supervision and assistance to reduce file processing times; iv) support agricultural hub 

development projects; vi) improve the country's absorptive capacity by removing bottlenecks during project 

implementation (procurement, disbursement, M&E, etc.); (b) For the Government : i) strengthen project 

monitoring (Ministries of Economy, Finance, Industry); and ii) raise the level of domestic resource 

mobilisation in a context where 50% of AfDB public project financing must be sourced from counterpart 

funding.  

2.8 Key Performance Indicators  

2.8.1 The key performance indicators of the project's logical framework are: Impact Indicators: (i) the 

rural poverty rate; (ii) the per capita value of food imports and exports; (iii) the share of the agro-industrial 

sector in GDP; Outcome Indicators: (i) modern installed capacity of agricultural product processing; (ii) the 

proportion of agricultural products processed according to the required standards (mango, cashew, maize, 

and banana); (iii) the cumulative amount in USD million of private investments catalysed by agribusiness 



 

12 

(including SMEs/SMIs); (iv) additional decent direct/indirect jobs created/consolidated (of which 50% 

women and 60% youth); (v) change in the average annual income level of agricultural households (headed 

by women); (vi) agricultural production of key sectors; (vii) the number of jobs created/reinforced in the 

agricultural sector (of which 50% women and 60% youth). 

III. PROJECT FEASIBILITY  

3.1 Economic and Financial Performance  

3.1.1 The project is designed to generate direct spin-offs in the processing of targeted crops, through 
private agribusiness investments in Agropole Sud (i.e. about 60 units), which can reach 90 by the end of ten 

(10) years. Besides the spin-offs on the private companies established in the agricultural hub, the farms will 

reap substantial income by supplying companies with raw materials for the targeted crops, namely: cashew 

(over 10,000 ha), mango (over 5,500 ha), maize (over 5,000 ha) and banana (over 1,500 ha). In addition 

to these benefits generated by the project and reflected in the economic and financial analysis, there will be 

several others in terms of: (i) creation of temporary and permanent jobs estimated at around 180 per 

processing unit (about 14,500 in total); (ii) improving and increasing the production of non-timber forest 

products (such as baobab, honey, seeds and wild fruits, oils and resins, infusions , etc.); (iii) improving 

the quality of nutrition as a result of capacity building in food fortification and hygiene; (iv) improving access 

to index insurance; and (v) improving the quality of natural resource management through the application of 

smart agriculture, climate change adaptation, biogas energy production and forest cover restoration.   

3.1.2 Financial analysis: the bulk of the above benefits are not tradable or even tangible items, and thus 
do not lend themselves to a financial performance analysis based on existing markets.  As a result, it has not 

been considered appropriate to include them in quantitative analysis, based on a production model or profit-

making activities approach. However, it has been possible to perform a cost/benefit analysis of agribusiness 

and other agricultural production models (FARMOD), as indicated above. 

3.1.3 For agribusiness enterprises, an assumption is proposed based on four (4) types of processing units, 
namely micro, small, medium and large enterprises, with respective investments of CFAF 7 million, 15 

million, 1.345 billion and 15 billion each, according to the average of investment profiles in these kinds of 

models. In this case, the annual turnover per company is CFAF 3.95 million, 11.48 million, 782.10 million 

and 8.88 billion, respectively, for micro, small, medium and large units, from the fifth year, on an operating 

life of approximately 20 years. For agricultural crops from farms and suppliers of agribusiness companies in 

the parks, FARMOD-type production cost/benefit models (Input/Output, Project and No Project) over a 20-

year operating life were used. 

3.1.4 Thus, the financial analysis gave: (i) a financial impact of over CFAF 70.54 billion per year from 
the fifth year of operations expected over 20 years, according to the same type of operations, according the 

life of the investments. This implies that the financial benefits of the project over the period of operation 

exceed the cost of the investments needed to finance it; (ii) a cost/benefit ratio of 1.60, which means that the 

benefits are higher than the cost of the investments; (iii) an internal rate of return of 19.44 %, which is higher 

than the opportunity cost of capital (the capital cost of financial resources for investments in the project) is 

estimated at 12%. Based on these results, it can be concluded that the project presents a profitability profile 

justifying the cost of the investments financially. 

3.1.5 Economic analysis: the economic analysis was carried out using the reference price method, 
namely the prices under conditions of economic efficiency, according to the "Pareto" optimum. It was 

conducted based on the comparison between the "no project" and "project" situation of the production models 

presented in the financial analysis. In this model, tradable goods, i.e. goods likely to be the subject of 

commercial transactions beyond the country (FOB at the port and CIF at the Port of Marseille), are 



 

13 

considered. In this case, the reference prices of these products (economic prices) are evaluated based on the 

ex-ante balance of these crops enabling to obtain export parity prices at farm gate. The labour force was 

economically valued at 65% of its financial value of CFAF 1,800/day, to take into account the inelasticity of 

the labour demand in the country in general and in the project in particular. Based on realistic assumptions, 

the economic rate of return (ERR) of the programme was estimated at 20.14%, with a B/C ratio of 1.62. In light 

of these results, the overall project profitability is deemed satisfactory. 

IRR (baseline scenario) : 19.44% NPV Amount:  CFAF 301.39 billion  

ERR (baseline scenario) : 20.14% NPV Amount:  CFAF 298.21 billion 

3.1.6 Sensitivity analysis: the sensitivity tests conducted based on the reduction in production prices were 
used to measure the stability of the financial and economic performance indicators. Thus, the tests show that 

prices should be lowered to 54.17% (break-even or " switching value") to cancel out the additional benefits 

generated respectively at the financial and economic level, with IRR and ERR equal to the opportunity cost of 

capital, i.e. 12 %. This test shows that the programme profitability profile is robust, although it has not been 

performed on all endogenous values of the model. However, the price variable is of paramount importance since 

it is the only one that is beyond the control of programme management and operation. The summary of the 

sensitivity analysis is presented in the Technical Annexes (Volume II). 

3.2 Environmental and Social Impact 

3.2.1 Environment  

3.2.1.1 PZTA-Sud (Agropole Sud) is classified in Category I. Its classification is justified by the activities 

likely to cause major environmental and social impacts to the natural and human environment conceived as 

an agro-industrial development hub. This approach led to the separation of the agricultural hub infrastructure 

on sites covering the three regions and networking actors of the targeted value chains (producers, processing 

firms, aggregators, etc.). This classification is also justified by the fact that it could trigger all five operational 

safeguards. The documents presented are the Strategic Environmental and Social Assessment (SESA) and 

the SESA summary, which were finalised and posted on 1 August 2019.  

3.2.1.2 Negative impacts: The key negative impacts expected from the project are: (i) risks of 

deforestation; (ii) disfigurement of the landscape; (iii) proliferation of disease vectors (malaria); (iv) 

degradation of ecosystems (soil, wildlife and water resources); (v) waste generation; (vi) dust and smoke 

emission; and (vii) traffic accidents, etc. The planned mitigation measures include: (a) tree planting; (b) 

application of appropriate pesticide management measures; (c) strict control of the pesticides used; (d) 

elimination of expired pesticides; (e) training in integrated pesticide management; (f) producer awareness 

and training; and (g) watering the site, waste collection, etc. The estimated cost of the measures to be 
included in the Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) and entirely financed by the Bank is 

about CFAF 665,000,000.  

3.2.1.3 Positive impacts: The key positive impacts are: (i) business development; (ii) improved mango, 

cashew and maize cultivation; (iii) linking farmers to processing industries; (iv) direct and indirect 

employment for youth; and (vi) increased municipal revenue. The cost of enhancing environmental benefits 

is included in the cost of environmental and social measures. 

3.2.2 Social 

3.2.2.1 PZTA-Sud will have a positive social impact in the construction phase in terms of increasing the 

people's income through the use of local materials (stone, sand, gravel, laterite) and the purchase of materials 

on the local market (cement, wood, iron, etc.). The work will inject fresh money into local markets, which 

will contribute to the development of socio-economic activities. The work will also lead to the development 

of retail trade around construction sites. The supply of construction equipment and materials should boost 



 

14 

transactions in the villages. In the operations phase, there will be a partnership between the agricultural hub 

and the farmers. The agricultural hub operation should generate around 14,500 direct jobs and 35,000 indirect 

jobs by 2024. The agricultural hub could be a means of creating jobs in agribusiness, transport, logistics and 

services (accommodation, catering, etc.), which will improve market access and farmers' income. Therefore, 

strengthening the skills of actors involved in the cashew and mango sectors (producers, traders, transporters, 

etc.) should facilitate access to salaried jobs and the creation of self-employment, thus contributing to the 

fight against poverty, rural exodus and illegal emigration.  

3.2.3 Environmental and Social Management Framework Plan (ESMFP)  

3.2.3.1 The following mitigation measures are included in the ESMFP: (i) development and reforestation 

of the agricultural hub module sites; (ii) application of adequate pesticide management measures; (iii) strict 

control of pesticides used by farmers; (iv) disposal of expired pesticides; (v) training in integrated pesticide 

management; (vi) sensitisation and training of producers; and (vii) application of the Laws on the Protection 

of Wildlife and Soil Degradation, etc. The SESA recommends conducting an Environmental and Social 

Impact Assessment (ESIA) that will: (a) describe the biophysical characteristics of the environment in which 

the project activities will take place, and highlight the major constraints that need to be taken into account 

when preparing the land, building, installing equipment, and operating; (b) assess the potential environmental 

and social impacts of project activities and recommend appropriate mitigation measures including cost 

estimates; (c) evaluate needs regarding the collection of solid and liquid wastes, their disposal and 

management, and make recommendations; (d) conduct a review of national environmental policies, 

legislation, and administrative and institutional frameworks and donor safeguard policies, indicate which of 

these policies are applicable to project activities, identify any gaps that could exist and make 

recommendations to fill them. 

3.2.4 Involuntary Resettlement 

3.2.4.1 Regarding involuntary resettlement, there are legal safeguards to protect the rights of potential 

project-affected persons. Section 31 of Law No. 64-46 of 17 June 1964 on National Land provides that: 

"After the declaration of public utility, the compensation to be paid to affected persons is evaluated on 

specified bases by a commission chaired by the prefect or his/her representative and composed of local 

representatives of the ministries in charge of public works, economy, lands, and those of the communities 

and associations including the mayor of the municipality. The compensations are established taking into 

account exclusively the existing constructions, developments, plantations and crops in the affected area 

undertaken by the affected persons (Section. 32). Displaced persons will be assisted and supported in their 

efforts to improve and rebuild their livelihoods and standard of living. The standard of living of resettlement 

populations will be more favourable than the original situation. Although not a tool offered by the AfDB 

ISS, the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) is required as a precaution, to clarify the process whereby land not 

currently concerned by the project will be developed subsequently. The projected amount to cover the 

displacement and resettlement of affected persons is CFAF 1 300 million (from the counterpart funding).   

3.2.5 Climate Change 

3.2.5.1 Senegal, in its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), agreed to unconditionally reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions by 3%, 4% and 5% respectively in 2020, 2025 and 2030, compared to “business 

as usual” (BAU) emissions for those years. The project will contribute to Senegal's climate change policies, 

particularly for the agricultural sector, with a view to adapting it and achieving the mitigation objectives set 

out in its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), particularly at regional level (Ziguinchor, Kolda and 

Sedhiou).  



 

15 

3.2.5.2  The project is vulnerable to climate risk (classified as Category 2). For this reason, risk 

management and adaptation options have been incorporated into the project design. The sizing of the 

structures will be done taking into account the geotechnical and climatic conditions specific to each site. This 

involves adaptation and mitigation measures in the agriculture, forestry and other land use sectors. In this 

way, the project will support measures that will enable farmers to mitigate and increase their climate change 

adaptation and resilience through, among others: (i) capacity building of state services (ISRA) to produce 

resilient and high-yielding varieties (cashew, mango and maize); (ii) supporting farmer organisations for 

better access to efficient and resilient technologies; (iii) strengthening the quality of advisory support services 

to farmers (climate information, digital platform, etc.); (iv) facilitating access to index insurance for farmers; 

(iv) improvement and adaptation of plant and forest production techniques; (v) changes in agroforestry 

practices to sustainably improve the production, yields and income of agro-foresters; (vi) addition of quality 

and value to agricultural production through post-harvest operations (storage and primary processing 

facilities); and (vii) access to more profitable markets through investment provided for in the agricultural 

processing modules (central and regional).  

3.2.6 Gender  

3.2.6.1 The project is classified under Category 3 according to the Bank's Gender Marker System. It will 

be implemented in a social environment where gender inequalities persist and are exacerbated by the 

migration of men. This situation reinforces the triple role of women with its corollaries of work overload and 

poverty. Thus, the project will take into account the specific needs of women and men as well as youths of 

both sexes. The aim is to reduce the inequalities of access for women and men of all social categories to the 

opportunities offered by the agricultural hub. Actions to be taken include: (i) promoting a gender-sensitive 

regulatory and institutional framework; (ii) equity in implementing project activities, including a quota of 

50% of agricultural project aggregation/primary processing of women-run cooperatives and SMEs (project 

selection, training, financing, etc.); (iii) development of gender-sensitive infrastructure (childcare facilities, 

separate showers and toilets, secure and equipped with water, etc.); (iv) support for women's cooperatives 

and SMEs through the structuring of their businesses and adapted training (including functional literacy, 

financial inclusion, processing, storage and conservation of agricultural products, leadership, natural resource 

management, etc.); (v) promoting women’s inclusion and leadership in the committees set up/consolidated 

under the project (50% women); (v) a campaign/sensitisation to fight and prevent malnutrition; and (v) the 

recruitment of a social development and gender specialist based on the South Branch. The budget allocated 
for specific and gender-sensitive activities is EUR 6.3 million, or about 14% of the total amount. 

3.2.7 Nutrition and Health  

3.2.7.1 The Rural Survey of Food Security and Nutrition (ERASAN 2014) shows that households in food-

insecure rural areas account for 30% of the total (153,728 households), of which 12% are in a severe 

situation and 18% in a moderate situation. The rate of food insecurity is higher for female-headed households 

at 40.4% compared to 29.4% for men-headed households. The regions of Ziguinchor (63%), Sédhiou (52%) 

and Kolda (52%) have the highest rates of households with food insecurity. The project will ensure that the 

modules and platforms take into account the establishment of medical services to support the safety of users. 

The agreements to be signed with the research institutes, particularly the ITA for the Centre of Excellence, 

will ensure that the nutritional quality of the processed products are acceptable to the local population and 

the market. At community level, to ensure resilience, awareness and communication sessions for behavioural 

change in nutrition, health and hygiene will be supported by the project. For vulnerable groups such as 

women, activities to support processing for the local or divisional (“département”) market will be funded, 

which will increase their income. For better social inclusion, the youth and women who will be selected for 

the labour-intensive works during the constructions on the agricultural hub sites will come largely from the 

poorest households. To this end, the project will use the single national registry targeting community-based 

activities. These activities will be supported by partners already on site such, for instance the Malnutrition 



 

16 

Control Unit. To ensure greater inclusion, the labour-intensive works will target the most vulnerable youth 

and women. Index insurance for producers is also a social protection measure for inclusion purposes. 

3.2.8 Youth Training and Employment 

3.2.8.1 The mapping of vocational training institutions in the project area indicates the existence of several 

Vocational and Technical Training and Handicraft (FPTA) structures, of which thirteen (13) in Ziguinchor, 

seven (7) in Kolda and three (3) in Sedhiou (one of the structures is being established). The project will work 

with these centres to ensure that agribusinesses moving into the region will have on-site skilled labour for 

the different trades. The project will help create around 1,400 direct and 35,000 indirect jobs for youth and 

women in the region, during the construction phase (which will use labour-intensive techniques) and in the 

operation phase by the 60 companies expected on the different sites. The project will also address the key 

challenges related to youth entrepreneurship, namely access to land and finance and the acquisition of 

technical skills for managing agro-industrial enterprises. At the agricultural hub, there are plans to build four 

training halls which will facilitate the upgrading of the salaried and self-employed workforce. Close 

collaboration will be established with at least three vocational training centres in the region, such as 

Goudomp, which is being developed, particularly for the processing of cashew nuts and fruits. The business 

incubator to be established at the Adéane central module will enable the incubation of youth-initiated 

projects. As regards access to finance for SMEs, the project will carry out capacity building of at least three 

financial institutions to develop services tailored to the needs of agro-industrial enterprises, particularly those 

of youth. Furthermore, the project will collaborate with the Mastercard Foundation, which supports the 

vocational training institutes in the project area as well as SMEs to strengthen youth employability. 

3.2.9 Fragility and Resilience  

3.2.9.1. The Casamance Natural Region, the project's impact area, experienced an armed conflict in the early 

1980s, whose victims lived mainly in Sedhiou and Ziguinchor regions. The induced fragility endured over 

nearly four decades slowed public and private investment in the region and has increased the social divide 

and the feeling of social and spatial exclusion. However, the State has made substantial efforts to develop 

infrastructure in the transport, energy and social sectors (drinking water, health, education, etc.), and this has 

contributed significantly towards strengthening social cohesion at inter-regional and national level. That 

notwithstanding, much effort remains to be made to mitigate the effects of regional disparity, gender 

inequality and youth underemployment. This peculiarity of the region has been reflected in the project design 

by taking into account existing resilience capacity in communities to address drivers of fragility. To reinforce 

this fragile cohesion, the project will support the agricultural potential of each region and organise the 

targeted sectors to provide economic opportunities for women, youth and vulnerable segments of the 

population. The sensitive land issue for this region of the country was also considered through the 

participatory approach undertaken for the project in terms of land tenure security. Areas with high production 

cashew and mango plantations located along the border strip south of Casamance pose a risk for producers 

due to the presence of mines in some places. This threat, already covered by the government’s partners 

specialising in this aspect, will be regularly monitored by the project at the National Demining Centre, to 

ensure that producers operating in the above-mentioned area are protected from this risk (see Annex).

IV. IMPLEMENTATION  

4.1. Implementation Arrangements  

4.1.1 Institutional Arrangements 

4.1.1.1 The Project Executing Agency (AGEX) will be the Ministry of Industry through a Project 

Implementation Unit (PIU). A Steering Committee (COPIL) chaired by AGEX will be set up to: (i) formulate 

the strategic thrusts of the agricultural hub programme; (ii) review and approve the AWPB; and (iii) analyse 

and adopt activity reports (including financial reports) and audit reports. It will include representatives of the 

ministries in charge of the following portfolios: Planning and Cooperation, Finance, Agriculture, Trade, 

Gender and Social Affairs, Environment, Regional Planning, Health and Nutrition; as well as representatives 

of the Private Sector, the Sovereign Fund for Strategic Investments (FONSIS), Federations of Farmers' 

Organisations, Local Authorities, Consular Chambers and BOS/PSE. The PIU Coordinator will provide 

secretarial support to COPIL. 

4.1.1.2 The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) will be responsible for project coordination, implementation 

and monitoring. The PIU will be based in Dakar and will ultimately be in charge of the 3 agricultural hub 

(PZTA) projects (it will have 3 regional agencies corresponding to the three (3) agricultural hubs (South, 

Centre and North). However, only the Agropole Sud agency will be set up under this project. Specifically, 

the composition of the PIU includes the following staff: (i) a national coordinator; (ii) an agribusiness 

engineer ; (iii) a monitoring/evaluation specialist; (iv) a procurement specialist; (v) an administrative and 

financial officer; (vi) an investment and finance specialist ; (vii) a regional coordinator; (viii) an infrastructure 

engineer (regional); (ix) an agronomist specialised in agricultural sectors (regional); (x) and environmental 

safeguards specialist; (xi) a social safeguards specialist; (xii) 3 accountants (including one regional); (xiii) 3 

assistants (procurement, administration, monitoring/evaluation); and (xiv) support staff. The baseline survey, 

midterm surveys and the final evaluation of project outcomes and impacts will be conducted by consultants 

to be recruited (in conjunction with MEPC, BOS and ANSD). 

4.1.2  Procurement Arrangements 

4.1.2.1 All Bank-financed procurement of works, goods and consultants services under this project shall be 

carried out in accordance with the Procurement Policy for Bank Group-Funded Operations ("AfDB 

Procurement Policy"), October 2015 edition, and the provisions of the financing agreement. Pursuant to this 

policy and following the various evaluations conducted, all procurement listed in paragraph B.6.3.1 will be 

carried out  in accordance with the country's procurement system ("National System") enshrined in Decree 

No. 2014-1212 of 22 September 2014 on the Public Procurement Code (CMP), while all other procurement 

listed in paragraph B.6.3.2 will be carried out in accordance with the Bank Procurement Methods and 

Procedures (BPM), October 2015 edition, using the Bank's bidding documents (BDs). The use of the National 

System improves efficiency through the following actions, among others: i) better ownership of the 

procurement system to be used by the executing agency; ii) time saving with the absence of a second audit 

(after that of the national entities), namely the Bank’s ex-ante review. However, the Bank reserves the right 

to request the Borrower to revert to the use of the Bank System if: a) the legal framework of Senegalese public 

procurement system changes and becomes unsatisfactory to the Bank; b) the provisions in force were not 

respected by the Executing Agency; or c) the appropriate risk mitigation measures featuring in the Risk 

Assessment Action Plan were not observed. 

4.1.2.3 Advance contracting (AC): during the appraisal mission, the Government informed the Bank of 

its intention to request authorisation to use advance contracting for the selection of: (i) a firm specialised in 

human resources to be charged with recruiting the project team staff; and (ii) a technical assistance firm to 

support PIU. A request accompanied with a procurement plan shall be submitted to the Bank for opinion 



 

18 

before the project is presented to the Bank’s Board of Directors. 

4.1.2.4 Procurement Risk and Capacity Assessment (PRCA): to take project specificities into account, the 

Bank assessed: (i) risks at the national, sector and project level; and (ii) the capacity of the executing agencies. 

The findings of these assessments led to the conclusion that the procurement risk level was moderate and 

determined, subject to the application of the mitigation measures proposed in paragraph 5.9 of Annex B.6, 

the group of procurement to be carried out according to the Bank’s system and that likely to be carried out, 

without major risk, according to the National System. The planned contracts for works amount to 

approximately UA 27.307 million, for the various goods UA 5.162 million, and for consultancy services UA 

8.355 million. Details of these procurement arrangements are available in Annex B.3 of the appraisal report.  

4.1.3  Financial Management Arrangements  

4.1.3.1  In accordance with the provisions of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, the Bank, like most 

other TFPs, has agreed to maximise the use of country systems for project and programme management as 

far as possible. An assessment of the existing country financial and accounting management system was 

made during the appraisal mission and the required mechanism specified for the project. Thus, the financial 

management of the project will be carried out by the Project Implementation Unit (PIU), to be put in place by 

the MDIMPI in its capacity as the Project Executing Agency. The PIU personnel, which will be recruited on 

a competitive basis, will include among others a coordinator, an administrative and financial manager, an 

accountant and an accounting assistant. The current accounting system is accrual accounting on software 

enabling the recording of project operations. The software has the potential to handle multiple projects with 

budgeting, analytics and general modules, up to the production of financial statements. The project’s internal 

control will be formalised in an administrative, financial and accounting procedures manual to be drawn up 

once the project is put into effect by a consultant. PZTA-Sud will produce quarterly project monitoring and 

annual financial statements and submit them to the Bank after approval by the Project Steering Committee. 

The project financial and accounting audit will be conducted by an independent firm registered on the role 

of a national or regional order of Bank member countries. The audit firm will be recruited by Project 

Coordination for three years based on terms of reference approved by the Bank, and paid out of AfDB funds.   

 

4.1.4 Disbursement Arrangements  

4.1.3.1 Disbursements will be made in accordance with Bank rules and procedures. A special account will 

be opened in the books of a commercial bank to keep a portion of the loan resources. Three disbursement 

methods will be used: (i) the special account method for training, operating and other minor project expenses; 

(ii) the direct payment method for settling contracts and agreements for goods, works and services; and (iii) 

the reimbursement method for expenses chargeable to AfDB but settled with the resources from counterpart 

funding, with the Bank’s prior approval. Bank advances in the Special Account will be made based on the 

Annual Work Programme and Budget (AWPB) previously approved by the Bank. The State’s counterpart 

funding will be provided for in the State budget. 

4.2 Project Monitoring/Evaluation  

4.2.1 Technical and financial monitoring: the PIU will be responsible for collecting, analysing and 

compiling information on physical achievements and financial execution. To this end, it will have a scorecard 

with technical and financial indicators on the progress of the project. Such monitoring will serve to obtain 

the following information for each activity and with a half-yearly periodicity: physical target, level of 

achievement, expected costs, actual costs, gaps and explanations of any gaps. This information will be used 

for preparing the half-yearly project progress reports. Furthermore, in addition to the review work of the 

Steering Committee, the Bank will field two supervision missions per year, to which should be added a mid-

term review mission. 



 

19 

 

4.2.2  Impact assessment: the project impact assessment will be conducted through participatory surveys 

under the supervision of BOS/PSE. The baseline survey will determine the level of the following indicators 

in project year zero: (i) current average household income; (ii) annual production of key crops; (iv) industrial 

processing rate; (v) access to inputs, agricultural services and farmer financing; (vi) marketing performance; 

and (vii) volume of financing mobilised by SMEs/SMIs. The same survey will be conducted at project 

completion. 

4.3  Governance  

4.3.1  Senegal has enjoyed long-standing political stability supported by solid democratic institutions and 

demonstrated by the three peaceful democratic regime changes. Senegal ranks 66th out of 180 countries on 

Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index 2018 and 8th in Africa in the indicators "Safety and Rule 

of Law", "Participation and Human Rights" and "Transparency and Accountability" of the Mo Ibrahim Index of 

African Governance (IIAG) 2017. This good performance reflects the efforts of the various regimes towards 

establishing or strengthening key institutions such as the Court of Auditors, the State General Inspectorate (IGIE), the 

National Financial Information Processing Unit (CENTIF), the National Bureau for the Fight against Fraud and 

Corruption (OFNAC) and the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (ARMP), and the introduction of a 

requirement that senior officials must declare assets (2014). The business environment has improved significantly as 

reflected by its 18-place jump in the Doing Business 2020 rankings. However, progress is needed in terms of 

registering property, paying taxes, trading across borders and ease of access to these facilities outside of the capital.  

4.3.2  In view of the project area’s sensitivity and the project’s complexity, the governance of the South Agricultural 

Hub is of special interest to the Bank and the Senegalese authorities, both in its design/ development and operation 

phases. While promoting private sector interest in the area, such sensitivity to the low-intensity conflict that has affected 

Casamance1 is important. Therefore, the project design adopted a highly participatory process in line with the strategic 

thrusts of PSE. Applying the Big Fast Results (BFR) methodology enabled the involvement of all project stakeholders, 

including private companies, financing institutions, research centres, civil society and the administration, to agree on 

partnership arrangements for successful its implementation. 

4.3.3  This process resulted in the selection of the following options (technical annex): 

 The management of the agricultural hub is entrusted to a dedicated company. After an in-depth analysis of different 

PPP approaches, it was decided that a mandate will be granted to FONSIS to create a Construction and Operation 

Company (SCE). The composition of the capital of SCE will unify the stakeholders’ commitment and will include 

a public sector minority (FONSIS, regional authorities, etc.), and a private sector majority (strategic and financial 

investors, including major agribusinesses and producer federations).  

 The establishment of an ecosystem enabling the agricultural hub to have access to all the administrative and 

facilitation services in the South zone. In this regard, the project will establish close collaboration with the 

Ziguinchor Regional Investment Platform (PRI) so that its services can meet the needs of the hub’s investors. The 

Adeane central module will also include a specific one-stop shop for the agricultural hub, offering high-end 

services, complementary to those of the South PRI.   

4.4  Sustainability  

4.4.1 The project was designed in a participatory and integrated manner to ensure sustainability, thanks 

to the active involvement of the relevant State services in project implementation (ISRA, ITA, ANCAR, 

DRDR, FNDASP, etc.). Besides, the sectors identified by an analysis of the market potential were confirmed 

during stakeholder consultations (surveys, missions, workshops, Labs, etc.) among which, the private sector, 

producer organisations (POs) and the technical services of the State. In addition, the project was designed to 

                                                 
1  Rather than exacerbating the underlying causes of conflict, this should contribute towards consolidating the factors that foster peace and the economic and 

social inclusion of all parties. 



 

20 

consolidate the State in its facilitation role, the private sector in investment and POs in sustainably increasing 

agricultural productivity. Lastly, the project’s design takes into account the requisite conditions to ensure its 

sustainability, through the following measures : (i) inclusion of measures to improve the agro-industrial 

sector’s business ecosystem at the project area level (one-stop shop, support services, quality control services, 

financial services, agricultural insurance, etc.); (ii) establishment of basic infrastructure (site development, 

administrative buildings, social services, common areas, etc.) in the central module (acting as an agro-

industrial park), the three (3) regional modules and the five (5) aggregation platforms and services; (iii) the 

involvement of the private sector (leader) once the project is formulated, thus ensuring easier access to 

markets (domestic, regional and international), technologies and financing (particularly for POs and SMEs); 

(iv) support for the structuring and professionalisation of agro-industrial sectors by strengthening the 

technical and business management capacity of beneficiary groups (including those run by women and 

youth); (v) facilitating access to efficient plant material for the sustainable increase in productivity and 

agricultural production of the main sectors (mango, cashew and maize). 

4.5  Risk Management  

4.5.1 Potential risks and mitigation measures have been identified and taken into consideration (see table 

and logical framework). They will be refined and finalised during the appraisal mission. 

Risks Risk Level Mitigation Measures/Actions  

Risk 1: Lack of interest by the 

private sector could limit 

investment  

  

High Mitigation 1: (i) the private sector will be regularly consulted; 

(ii) the PIU will put in place basic infrastructure (including one-

stop shop); (iii) SCE will facilitate the implementation of 

private sub-projects; (iv) access to credit facilities will be put 

in place; and (v) non-tariff barriers will be applied as needed.  

Risk 2: Climate change, discharges 

from industrial units and harmful 

practices of the population may 

degrade natural resources  

Moderate Mitigation 2: The use of resilient technologies, planned 

environmental and social safeguards, access to markets and 

agricultural insurance will mitigate climate change impacts and 

industrial risks. 

Risk 3: The expected benefits 

(including land) could be hijacked 

by a minority 

Moderate Mitigation 3: The measures included in the SESA (including 

the ESFMP), the ESFMP/RAP, and the project’s IEC 

programme should mitigate this risk. 

Risk 4: Delays in project 

implementation due to inadequate 

understanding of Bank procedures 

High Mitigation 4: Institutional support and regular training will be 

provided to the PIU, AGEX, and the Borrower (Ministries of 

Finance, Economy)  

 

4.6  Knowledge Building  

4.6.1 PZTA-Sud differs from the value chain projects usually financed by the Bank in the country, mainly 

in view of the following innovations: the targeting of value chains with market potential, the promotion of 

private investment in agribusiness (facilities, incentives, etc.), and support to actors in targeted sectors. These 

innovations will be subject to documented monitoring/evaluation and leveraged to determine the lessons 

learned by the State, the private sector and other priority sector actors. The State and the Bank will take into 

account the lessons learned during the exchange of experiences with regional member countries. The lessons 

learned will be consolidated in the project completion report.

Inclusive Policy Senegal has always enjoyed political stability since its independence in 1960, but in 1982 this 

was undermined by secessionist political demands in the country’s southern region, marked by 

a feeling of exclusion of the Casamance region from the national development programmes. 

The first two post-independence Presidents of Senegal did strive towards building one nation, 

making the use of the Wolof language the entry point of national identity. This political will for 

national unification was unfortunately met with resistance from the Casamance region given 

that the egalitarian set-up of the Diola ethnic group differs from that of the other ethnic groups 

in Senegal which are hierarchical in nature. These policies of unification of the people were 

perceived by the Casamance people as discriminating against their traditional customs which 

reject any conventional chieftaincy. Other sources of resentment of marginalisation and 

exclusion were the issuance of the 1964 Land Law relating to National Land, as supplemented 

by the 1972 reform of territorial administration excluding the recognition of customary land 

law. Additionally, the immigration of people from north to south in search of arable land was 

perceived by indigenous local communities as grabbing their land. In Diola culture, land is 

sacred and handed down from generation to generation. The Diola in particular have on multiple 

occasions been dispossessed and their lands allocated as migrant settlements, land for the 

construction of tourism infrastructure and agricultural land for orchard planting. The 

underinvestment and underdevelopment of Casamance also formed part of the problems that 

generated frustration among the Casamance people who for years often accused the central 

government of neglecting or even abandoning the country’s south. The lack of investment in 

Casamance has led to a slowdown in the South’s development and exacerbated the labour 

market problems of the local population. Faced with this challenge of an inclusive peace-

seeking policy, the governments of the third and fourth Presidents of Senegal have worked to 

restore national and regional stability and peace through inclusive dialogue with the people and 

the secessionists and there has been visible progress towards building more inclusive resilience 

for all sectors. 

Through the implementation of 

PZTA-Sud activities, the 

community resilience thus built will 

not have a direct impact on political 

inclusion but will usher in new 

prospects for political 

representativeness and participation 

in political activities.

Measures supported by the AfDB 

intervention under PZTA-Sud (2020-

2024) 

Security Due to the low prevalence of violent crime and armed conflict, Senegal has maintained a high 

capacity for law enforcement and defence institutions. With the acceptable military spending 

relative to GDP, the security institutions are well capacitated and helping to ensure the nation’s 

stability. While there is moderate pressure from violence and conflict, the public   remains 

highly confident in its defence institutions and has always relied on its security institutions to 

contain a moderately weak attack. However, the presence of anti-personnel mines remains a 

reality along the southern border strip of Casamance. 

PZTA-Sud does not directly 

contribute to the security factor, but 

it provides solutions to food security 

while mitigating the risks that could 

cause the security situation to 

deteriorate. 
 

Justice Senegal has a tradition of justice with renowned members of the judiciary even if between 2010 

and 2011 this renown was tainted by challenges pertaining to the independence of the judiciary, 

the transparency of the judicial process, more equitable access to justice and property rights. 

Since 2013, this situation has gradually improved and trust in the Senegalese justice system 

remains a reality. The independence of the judiciary, which was challenged in the recent past 

by certain magistrates who were using it to serve illegitimate interests, has returned to its good 

standards, namely to continue serving the citizens and the State including in the anti-corruption 

fight, even in its highest instances. The slowdown in of anti-corruption drive in some state 

structures could nevertheless pose a risk for investment and jeopardise the implementation of 

the Emerging Senegal Plan (PSE) given that legal and judicial security constitute two 

determining factors in wooing investors. 

The PZTA-Sud does not directly 

contribute to the justice system but 

it addresses the issue of social and 

spatial inclusion, a source of social 

injustice, taking into account the 

vulnerable groups, particularly 

women and youth in the project 

activities to be implemented. 
 

Economic and 

Social Inclusivity  

Senegal has often experienced periods of stable and moderate economic growth, driven both by 

political stability and the implementation of policies aimed at efficient management of the 

economy. Despite the country’s economic and social progress, the natural region of Casamance 

has always felt neglected by the central government compared to the rest of the national 

territory. One sticking point of the Casamance crisis was the issue of public services distribution 

and access thereto for local populations. This regional, economic and social disparity has 

generated income inequalities that have steadily widened over time. Furthermore, the increased 

and uncontrolled urbanisation of the regional capital has impacted rural populations and their 

ability to access public services, creating an economic and social gap between rural and urban 

areas marked by increased continuous poverty exerting great pressure on the Casamance and 

Various sectors selected under the 

PZTA-Sud such as access to roads/ 

tracks, rural electrification (health 

and training centres), technologies 

as well as the establishment of an e-

platform for access to services 

(inputs, finance, markets, etc.) are 

far-reaching inclusive social and 

economic actions.

Senegalese social fabric. The problem of unemployment of youth in Casamance and the rest of 

the country pushes them towards illegal immigration which could empty the regions of the 

workforce seeking decent jobs. 

 Social Cohesion   With an extremely high freedom of expression index, Senegal has a relatively high capacity to 

facilitate the creation of associations without government interference. However, the requisite 

infrastructure for the region’s development remains inadequate in Casamance. Despite the 

visible progress made in transport infrastructure linking the three regions of Casamance to one 

another, and between the Casamance and Dakar by sea and land, gender- and age-based 

inequality mean that women and youth are under-represented in the political, economic and 

social sphere in the Casamance region due to regional marginalisation given the centralisation 

of activities in Dakar and the other regions of the country. 

  

The geographical location of  

PZTA-Sud constitutes an initial 

response to the imbalance noted in 

the provision of services between 

urban and rural areas and 

Casamance compared to the rest of 

Senegal. Through the 

implementation of all project 

activities, a number of the planned 

components will contribute towards 

establishing the public utility 

easements required to initiate proper 

socio-economic integration of 

communities. 

External 

Outcomes/ 

Regional 

Multiplier Effects  

 

Casamance lies at the centre of the West African sub-regional area and constitutes a natural link 

between Senegal and Gambia and Guinea Bissau. Ziguinchor, this region’s main city is less 

than 150 km from two West African capitals, Banjul and Bissau. The geographical, agro-

ecological and socio-cultural continuity of Casamance also opens a corridor towards Kolda and 

Tambacounda towards Mali. Casamance is thus positioned to become an economic hub and a 

link between the Gambia, Senegal and Guinea Bissau. The implementation of development 

projects, particularly within the framework of the development hub launched by the State, will 

have to take into account the dynamics of sub-regional integration in West Africa as well as all 

the policies already adopted or in progress at the level of ECOWAS. Through a balanced 

development strategy between the national and the regional, Ziguinchor could become a 

regional city where Gambians, Bissau-Guineans and Senegalese will organise their commercial 

PZTA-Sud support does not have a 

direct impact on the external 

outcomes, but various interventions 

of the Bank and other TFPs are 

tending to contribute towards 

creating an environment conducive 

to the diversification of the local 

economy through agricultural sector 

development. To mitigate the effect 

of exogenous shocks, the 

establishment of AHs and the

and financial transactions capable of boosting the regional economy. Casamance's regional 

potential is facing cross-border challenges such as illicit trafficking of forest wood and drugs to 

neighbouring countries, cross-border crime, insecurity along borders and the challenge of 

management of water resources as a shared heritage. 

professionalisation of the 

agricultural sector offer new 

opportunities for the private sector, 

an engine of economic growth. 

Climatic / 

Environmental 

Impacts 

Senegal has a great capacity for environmental conservation and emergency preparedness 

thanks to government resources allocated to the prevention of natural disasters. Despite this 

capacity, the rainy seasons in Casamance most often leave the arable land flooded or without 

water thus worsening the vulnerability of the local populations as well as their social 

vulnerability to the volatility of food prices, agricultural inputs and producer prices. However, 

Senegal's vulnerability to food insecurity and natural disasters is mitigated by an efficient 

national environmental and social policy aimed at the sustainable use of available resources. 

By focusing on the development of 

regional and central platforms, 

PZTA-Sud plans to mitigate climate 

and environmental impacts as part 

of the implementation of all project 

activities. All these aspects are 

reflected in the project formulation.

Annex VII: General Presentation Plan of  the South Agricultural Hub (Agropole du Sud or PZTA-Sud) 
 

BACKGROUND 
 

The agro-industrial sectors are among the priority sectors 
of the Emerging Senegal Plan (PSE). Improving the 
performance of these sectors through the processing of 
agricultural products has been a strong decision of the 
State of Senegal. To this end, he has taken steps to : 

o Curb food dependency  
o Boost exports for sustained and sustainable 

growth 
o Control rural exodus for job creation  
o Stimulate the rural economy 

 

REGIONAL OCCUPANCY PLAN 
 

The SouthAgricultural Hub site is split in 3 regions according to 

the following regional occupancy plan: 

 1 central module (Adéane) 
 3 regional modules (Bignona, Sédhiou and Kolda) 
 5 divisional ("département") platforms  
 Collection points: number, locations and areas to be 

defined for: (i) Central Module; (ii) Each Regional 
Module; and (iii) divisional ("départment") aggregation 
and services platforms     

 
 

 

 Module Type  Region/ Division 
("Département") 

Municipality   Area   

GOALS 
 

To provide a viable and lasting solution to these issues, 

the decision was taken to create 3 AHs (or AIPZ). To 

each are assigned specific objectives relating to 

agricultural, pastoral or fisheries activities existing in the 

corresponding regions. 

- The North Agricultural Hub will cover the regions of 
Saint-Louis, Matam and Louga      

- The Centre Agricultural Hub will cover the regions of 
Kaolack, Fatick, Kaffrine, Diourbel      

- The South Agricultural Hub will cover the regions of 
Ziguinchor, Sedhiou, Kolda      

- The South zone was chosen as pilot for the 
establishment of the first agricultural hub in view off its 
under-tapped high potential      

  

Each agricultural hub is composed of :  

-  a Central module           
- Regional modules           
- Divisional (“Département”) platforms           
- Collection points          

Central Module   Ziguinchor Region Adeane 85 ha CENTRAL MODULE SITE 
 

The site of Agropole Sud is located in 

Adeane municipality, Bignona division 

("département"). It is in a heavily 

wooded area, but has no dwellings. Its 

landholding measures 85 ha made 

available to the project by the 

municipality and the people. It is 

relatively rectangular in shape. It is 

close to a high-voltage line, a paved 

road (less than 3 kilometres from the 

site) and agricultural production sites.

Project Executive Summary 

Overview: the Project to Develop and Promote Agricultural Sub-sectors (PDPFA) will be 

implemented in the Zaghouan Governorate, which covers a surface area of 282 000 hectares 

and has a population of 186 210 (INS, 2018). This region has an average poverty rate of 20% 

(15.2% nationwide), an illiteracy rate of 26.4% (18.8% nationwide) and a rural poverty rate of 

34.2%. The unemployment rate is 16.9% compared with 14.8% nationwide. Women are more 

vulnerable as they lack access to resources and formal employment. 

After the 2011 revolution, Tunisia adopted a Strategic Development Plan (PSD 2016-2020) to 

revive and enhance the attractiveness of its economy and incorporate it into global value chains 

in order to address the challenge of achieving sustainable and inclusive development. This 

vision is reflected in the country’s resolve to increase investments (25% of GDP by 2020) in 

specific niches with competitive advantages and where there is a growing international market 

that offers more opportunities for the generation of value-added. In this regard, agricultural 

subsectors have been identified according to agro-ecological zones and their potential to 

increase high value-added agricultural exports. The Project to Develop and Promote 

Agricultural Sub-sectors in Zaghouan Governorate (PDPFA-GZ) falls within this framework. 

It seeks to promote agricultural subsectors whose development requires significant public and 

private investments to enhance production and productivity, and increase opportunities in terms 

of product development (processing, packaging, certification, etc.). Besides improving their 

competitiveness, the subsectors selected will have an overall impact on economic recovery and 

the reduction of unemployment, poverty and inequalities. 

PDPFA-GZ was prepared under a UA 412 000 Middle-Income Countries Technical Assistance 

Fund (MIC-TAF) grant awarded by the Bank in 2014. The grant resources were used to design 

the related technical studies and evaluate the Integrated Agricultural Development Project 

(PDAI) in Tunisia. It complements the first phase of the Integrated Agricultural Development 

Programme in Zaghouan Governorate financed by the International Fund for Agricultural 

Development (IFAD) to the tune of USD 16.05 million. PDPFA-GZ, whose total estimated cost 

is EUR 43.86 million, of which EUR 25.21 million provided the African Development Bank 

(AfDB), aims to develop priority agricultural subsectors (olive oil, tomato, dairy and other local 

organic products) selected in conjunction with regional authorities based on their economic, 

social and environmental impact. The project comprising three components will be 

implemented over five years. The components are: (i) Rural Infrastructure Support; (ii) 

Sustainable Agricultural Development and Promotion of Agricultural Value Chains; and (iii) 

Project Coordination and Management. It will benefit more than 90 650 people (12 500 

directly), 50.2% of them women, in the project impact area (PIA). 

Needs Assessment: the financing needs of the agricultural sector in Tunisia for the 2016-2020 

period are estimated at about TND 9 000 million or UA 2 000 million (Strategic Development 

Plan 2016-2020). This investment will contribute to achieving the objectives of the Strategic 

Development Plan (SDP) in terms of reducing unemployment and social/regional inequalities. 

Agricultural investments during the first three years of the Plan amounted to TND 4 400 million 

(TND 1 870 million in public investments), representing a financing gap of more than TND 2 

500 million. AfDB resources of about TND 86.24 million will help to reduce the financing gap 

in Zaghouan Governorate. 

Value-added for the African Development Bank: the agricultural sector plays a vital role in 

the national economy and the Bank contributes to its development within the framework of the 

Country Strategy. The Bank’s active portfolio comprises seven operations (UA 69.804 million), 

representing 6% of the portfolio whose performance is deemed satisfactory with a score of 3.5 



 

vi 

 

on 4 (2017/2018 Country Portfolio Performance Review). The Bank has also acquired 

considerable experience in financing integrated agricultural development projects (IADPs) in 

similar areas such as Gafsa and Kairouan. The evaluation of IADPs conducted within the 

framework of the Middle-Income Countries Technical Assistance Fund (MIC-TAF) grant 

confirmed that the Bank has a strong comparative advantage by participating in financing the 

Project to Develop and Promote Agricultural Sub-sectors in Zaghouan Governorate (PDPFA-

GZ). It has developed skills and technical expertise in the design and formulation of agricultural 

projects, particularly the development of irrigation schemes and catchment ponds, the proper 

targeting of vulnerable areas and environmental and social protection. It has also acquired 

experience in Tunisia and other countries by promoting subsectors and value chains, youth and 

women’s entrepreneurship, and building national capacity for more effective official 

development aid  (ODA) in terms of alignment and ownership. 

Knowledge Management: a baseline situation based on field surveys (including value chains) 

was established during project preparation. The project will provide the agricultural map of 

Tunisia with geo-referenced data on the sites of the schemes and infrastructure developed. It 

will also support training and strengthen the knowledge of various local actors, particularly 

farmers in irrigation schemes and women involved in agri-food product marketing. The project 

will disseminate best practice, particularly in organic agricultural product certification and the 

development of local expertise. The same will apply to the socio-economic and environmental 

impacts of the organic production system (OPS) to be promoted by the project by ensuring that 

producers (upstream and downstream of subsectors) introduce and adopt good agricultural 

practices.

TUNISIA 

PROJECT TO DEVELOP AND PROMOTE AGRICULTURAL SUBSECTORS IN 

ZAGHOUAN GOVERNORATE  

APPRAISAL REPORT 

Management hereby submits the following appraisal report and recommendation concerning a proposal 

to grant a EUR 25.21 million AfDB loan to the Republic of Tunisia to finance the Project to Develop 

and Promote Agricultural Sub-sectors in Zaghouan Governorate (PDPFA-GZ). 

I. Strategic Thrust and Rationale 

1.1. Project Linkages with Country Strategy and Objectives 

1.1.1 The project is consistent with Tunisia’s Strategic Development Plan (PSD) 2016-2020, which 

hinges on five pillars: (i) public administrative reform and fight against corruption for improved 

governance; (ii) human development and social inclusion; (iii) higher value-added activities; (iv) reduction 

of regional disparities; and (v) development of a green economy. The PSD seeks to achieve a 5% growth 

rate to reduce the unemployment rate to 12.2% in 2020. In this regard, the strategy envisages an increase 

in the investment rate to 25% of GDP, driven by a significant growth in public investment and a build-up 

of public-private partnerships (PPPs). The overall objectives of the PSD in the agricultural sector are to 

promote competitive and sustainable farming by creating value added, ensuring the judicious and 

sustainable exploitation of natural resources, and securing decent income for farmers. 

1.1.2 The project will also contribute to the implementation of the Zaghouan Governorate Planning 

and Development Master Plan 2030. Besides making substantial investments in the development of 

irrigation and water-saving infrastructure, it will help to promote and enhance the competitiveness of 

priority agricultural subsectors (olive oil, tomato, milk and other local organic products). The project will 

promote the conservation and development of natural resources by ensuring their sustainability and 

minimising the effects of climate change; improving land tenure entities, combating the fragmentation of 

landholdings and developing farmlands; develop a regional green economy and promote gender-based 

human development and social inclusion by strengthening women’s empowerment. The project will help 

Tunisia to honour its low-carbon sustainable development commitments (nationally determined 

contribution target of reducing carbon intensity by 41% by 2030 compared with 2010) by launching a 

large-scale tree planting operation, water and soil conservation (WSC) works, and to achieve the 

sustainable development goals (SDOs), particularly poverty reduction, the elimination of inequalities, the 

promotion of gender equality, the empowerment of women, and the creation of decent jobs. 

1.2. Rationale for Bank Involvement 

1.2.1 The agricultural sector plays a major role in Tunisia’s economy. Over the last decade, the 

Tunisian olive oil sub-sector has been one of the country’s leading foreign exchange earners, generating 

TND 2 billion, i.e. 10% of all exports in 2017-2018 (ONH, 2018). Consequently, the country is the 

second olive oil producer after Spain and the world’s leading exporter of olive oil, with about 200 000 

tonnes of olive oil in 2017. Similarly, it ranks among the world’s ten largest tomato processing countries 

and is Africa’s leading exporter of organic products. Agriculture accounts for 10% of GDP, 16.9% of 

employment and about 10% of export earnings. Despite the progress made, the overall performance of 

the agricultural sector remains inadequate in view of its potential. Agricultural productivity remains low 

and the high inter-annual variability of production greatly impedes steady supply. Agricultural products 

are not sufficiently competitive and developed. Consequently, investment in the agricultural sector has 

dropped. The outcome has been a decline in farmers’ income, which does not exceed 50% of the national 

average income. As a result, the sector is increasingly less attractive to youths (43% of farmers are aged 

above 60).

1.2.2 The Bank’s intervention targets disadvantaged areas in Zaghouan Governorate, a region with a 

high agricultural potential and one eligible for various government investment incentives. In this region, 

the project will contribute to developing irrigation and water-saving infrastructure, promoting transition 

to organic agriculture and expanding agricultural entrepreneurship in order to boost the value chains of 

promising agricultural subsectors. Therefore, the Bank’s intervention will help to render the regional 

and national economy more attractive, thus contributing towards achieving inclusive growth, reducing 

unemployment, poverty and inequalities. It will also build the resilience of agro-ecological systems and 

improve the region’s agri-food positioning in local and global value chains.  

1.2.3 The subsectors targeted by the Bank’s intervention (see detailed analysis in Annex C3) were 

selected given their strategic importance in terms of food security, their potential to generate more value 

added and the constraints identified. In Tunisia, olive growing is the main agricultural activity and plays 

a key socio-economic role in terms of the area under cultivation (1.8 million hectares) and the number 

of farmers (309 000 farmers) employed in the different olive oil subsector chains (mechanisation, 

pruning, harvesting, transportation, crushing, storage, marketing, etc.). It is a source of direct or indirect 

income for more than one million people and generates 34 million days of work per annum, which is 

equivalent to more than 20% of employability in the agricultural sector. However, olive oil production 

fluctuates significantly from year to year due to the alternate bearing of olive trees and very irregular 

climatic conditions. In addition, 90% of olive oil exports consist of bulk oil, 70% of which is extra-

virgin olive oil. This provides the country with a significant head room in the packaging value chain to 

create more value added and ensure product traceability. In the tomato subsector, the dried product 

constitutes a growth niche in terms of employment and exports, and can generate foreign exchange 

earnings for the country. Exports could be better leveraged by shifting from the current stage of supplier 

of semi-finished bulk products to another stage as supplier of finished products delivered directly to the 

final consumer. In the dairy sub-sector, there is a deficit in the feed balance with limited quantity and 

quality of feed resources and a partial and inadequate use of agricultural and agro-industrial by-products 

upstream. There is a shortage of collection centres and chillers, as well as inadequate promotion of 

traditional dairy products downstream. Organic farming is now the engine of regional development in 

view of its linkages with agri-food industries, environmental tourism, handicrafts and renewable energy. 

However, the cumbersome process of converting and certifying organic products continues to impede 

its full development. 

1.2.4 The project plugs into the Bank’s Ten-year Strategy (2013-2022) by aligning with the High 5s. 

It is consistent with the Bank’s Strategy to Address Fragility and Build Resilience in Africa (2014-2019) 

since it strengthens the role of communities in building resilience and raising awareness among all 

stakeholders on inequality and fragility issues. It is in keeping with the main thrusts of the Bank’s 

Climate Change Action Plan and Gender Strategy for 2014-2018 (extended to 2019), by promoting 

women’s right to land and resources (in irrigation schemes) and economic empowerment through 

income-generating activities, management and entrepreneurship capacity building. At the national level, 

the project is consistent with Tunisia’s Country Strategy Paper (CSP) 2017-2021, particularly Pillar 2 

“Improve the quality of life for the people of the priority regions”. In this respect, the project will ensure 

the qualitative and quantitative transformation of regional agriculture by developing irrigation schemes 

(PIP); supporting targeted agricultural subsectors and certifying organic products to promote their 

export; supporting agricultural entrepreneurship (MSME), especially for women and youths; developing 

a regional green economy; and building local capacity and governance in land tenure and water resource 

management. By addressing the critical feeder road link under Pillar 1 “Industrialisation and local value 

chains development”, the project will ease the movement of people and goods in this region, which is a 

transitional space between the country’s coast and hinterland. 

1.3. Aid Coordination 

1.3.1 In Tunisia, official development aid reached USD 5.5 billion during the 2011-2017 period, 

representing an increase of 128% compared with the pre-revolution period (2004-2010) (WB, 2019;

oecd.org/dac/stats/idsonline). The Ministry of Development, Investment and International Cooperation 

(MDICI) is responsible for coordination. The African Development Bank is contributing to this process 

through the country dialogue spearheaded by its North Africa Regional Development and Business 

Delivery Office (RDGN). Therefore, the Bank harmonises its operations with the World Bank and the 

European Union within the framework of budget support based on the same matrix of measures and 

identical disbursement conditions. It has also concluded mutual trust and confidence agreements, 

particularly with the European Investment Bank, to use the procurement procedures of a single donor 

during co-financing. Lastly, it participates in the Agricultural Sector Working Group set up by Tunisia’s 

technical and financial partners. At State level, the Ministry of Agriculture, Water Resources and 

Fisheries (MARHP) is responsible for the technical coordination of agricultural projects. Similarly, the 

Ministry of Development, Investment and International Cooperation (MDICI) coordinates and monitors 

the activities of development partners. The table below presents the main amounts by source of financing

II. Project Description 

2.1 Project Components 

2.1.1 The overall objective of PDPFA-GZ is to contribute to reducing poverty, unemployment 

and inequalities (gender, socio-economic and rural/urban) in Zaghouan Governorate. The project’s 

specific objective is to create more value added by promoting priority1 agricultural sub-sectors such 

as “olive oil”, “tomato”, “dairy” and “other local organic products”, which are niches with a high 

potential in terms of employment, revenue generation and foreign exchange earnings for the 

country. In this regard, the project will carry out major irrigation, water resource mobilisation 

(boreholes, shallow wells and catchment ponds), and natural resource protection works (water, soil 

and forests) in order to improve production and productivity as part of efforts to accelerate transition 

to organic farming. An “agricultural value chains (AVCs)” approach will be used as guideline for 

the project to address the challenges of linking various chains in the targeted agricultural subsectors, 

                                                 
1 Priority subsectors were defined in a concerted manner based on environmental (soil conservation, water use and biodiversity), social (local job 

creation and improvement of the status of rural women) and economic criteria (level of value added, stability of income and adaptability to 

growth markets).

creating value added and building resilience of the people’s agro-ecological and socio-economic 

systems. The “aggregation2” model will be adopted to remove constraints on MSME financing, 

promote agricultural entrepreneurship especially for women and youths, and open access to markets 

at remunerative prices, while complying with new requirements regarding hygiene, food safety, the 

environment, and social equity. 

2.1.2 The project will be implemented over five years and will comprise three components: (A) 

Rural Infrastructure Support; (B) Sustainable Agricultural Development and Promotion of 

Agricultural Value Chains; and (C) Project Coordination and Management. The project activities 

are summarised in the table below.

2.2 Technical Solutions Adopted and Alternatives Explored 

2.2.1  The technical solutions adopted are based on lessons from the Bank and IFAD’s 

experience, particularly in financing integrated agricultural projects (IAPs) in Tunisia. The region’s 

technical services, local businesses and communities have acquired experience in the development 

of irrigation, water and soil conservation facilities that are easy to design. The subsectors to be 

supported were selected in consultation with the regional authorities and communities based on 

their potential to create more value added and ensure the sustainability of investments as well as 

agro-ecological considerations. Thus, the promotion of a watermelon sub-sector, which was 

initially envisaged, was abandoned because of its negative impact on water resources. Similarly, in 

the tomato subsector already established in the region, the project will ensure water saving on the 

parcels of land under cultivation in order to economise water, while intensifying production in a 

bid to improve the downstream production sub-sector, particularly tomato drying, packaging and 

export. Resilience measures are based on vulnerability analysis and strategies to reduce factors of 

fragility. Lastly, the “aggregator” approach has yielded positive results in other public-private 

partnership (PPP) operations, opening up access to financing and guaranteeing higher producer 

prices. 

Table 2.2: Alternatives Explored and Reasons for their Rejection 

Alternative Brief Description Reasons for Rejection 

Extension of the 

areas devoted to 

tomato cultivation 

and promotion of a 

watermelon 

subsector 

The option considered was 

to increase the areas 

devoted to tomato 

cultivation and to promote 

a watermelon subsector. 

The project will not promote a watermelon subsector in the 

region because of the high water consumption of these two 

plants. Concerning the tomato subsector already established and 

for which the regional authorities are requesting support, project 

activities will focus on measures to save water and improve the 

downstream sub-sector, particularly the drying, packaging and 

export of tomatoes. 

2.3 Project Type 

2.3.1. PDPFA-GZ is an investment project in a key sector of the Tunisian economy. Its approach 
guarantees the achievement of outcomes and the efficient use of the resources allocated. 

2.4 Project Cost and Financing Arrangements 

2.4.1 Project cost: the total project cost, taxes included, is estimated at TND 153.38 million 
(EUR 44.84 million). The cost was estimated based on the prices prevailing in April 2019. This 

cost includes the cost of land that will be occupied by the project for the construction of facilities 

planned. Provisions equivalent to 5% and 7% of the base cost have been made respectively for 

physical contingencies and price escalation, based on local and global inflation trends. Tables 2.3, 

2.4 and 2.5 below present a summary of the estimated project cost by component, expenditure 

category and year, while details are presented in Technical Annex B2 of the project appraisal report. 

 

Furthermore, the cost sharing (borne 56.2% by AfDB, 5.3% by the beneficiaries and 38.5% by the 

State) is in line with the financing parametres for Tunisia as approved by the Board in 2017, 

according to which the Bank could finance 60% of the cost of social projects (education, health, 

employment, gender, etc.), with limited and/or gradual economic benefits. The social nature of 

PDPFA is reflected in: (1) the importance of activities dedicated to women, especially the 

development of women’s entrepreneurship; and (2) the emphasis on the development of 

employment and self-employment in the project area by targeting youths and smallholders. 

Moreover, the gradual profitability of the project resides in the the very nature of tree cultivation 

(mostly olive trees), which requires nearly ten years to reach maturity.

2.5 Project Target Area and Beneficiaries 

2.5.1 The project impact area (PIA) covers Zaghouan Governorate, particularly the vulnerable 

areas of the 6 delegations (Zaghouan, Zriba, Saouef, Nadhour, El Fahs and Bir Mchargua), which 

make up 44 out of the 47 administrative sectors of the Governorate. Despite its enormous 

agricultural potential (272 000 hectares of arable land), the region’s agro-ecological systems are 

highly vulnerable to climate change: water resources are decreasing and soil erosion is severe, 

affecting nearly 52 000 hectares of arable land and taking various forms ranging from topsoil 

stripping to gullying of varying intensity. In addition, extreme weather events such as floods and 

droughts are increasing, resulting in an average poverty rate of 20% and an unemployment rate of 

16.9% compared with the national rate of 14.8%. Women are more affected by illiteracy (37% of 

rural women) and generally by precariousness since only 19% of them own resources. The 

Governorate is among the regions eligible for various investment incentives intended to reduce the 

factors of environmental and social fragility as well as intra-regional inequalities. Despite the 

fragility of its specific mountain ecosystems, this Governorate has a multitude of major agro-

environmental functions and a considerable ecotourism, cultural and local product production 

potential. 

2.5.2 PDPFA-GZ will benefit more than 90 650 people (12 500 directly), 50.2% of them women. 

The people will be supported to improve production and productivity through successful land 

consolidation and conversion to organic farming. Special attention will be paid to women 

(particularly women heads of households) and youths who constitute the bulk of vulnerable groups. 

They will benefit from about 40% to 45% of newly developed PIPs and 75% of actions related to 

product processing and marketing, particularly organic products. Direct beneficiaries will be 

selected in close collaboration with the CRDA, SMSAs, GDAs and UTAP through a participatory, 

inclusive and collaborative approach. Financing in the form of subsidies to agricultural cooperatives 

(SMSAs) will be based on eligibility criteria set out in the project procedures manual and validated 

by the National Coordination Committee (CNC). 

2.6 Participatory Approach for Project Identification, Design and Implementation 

2.6.1  The Bank adopted a participatory, inclusive and collaborative approach throughout the 

project preparation process, which helped to involve all stakeholders in the identification of major 

issues and appropriate solutions. The stakeholders are representatives of the population, the 



 

9 

 

decentralised technical services of the CRDA, other public institutions, producer organisations and 

civil society, including gender-focused organisations, the private sector and TFPs. This approach 

also made helped to achieve a broad consensus on the “agricultural value chains (AVCs)” approach 

to address the challenge of incorporating the different links of the subsectors selected. Furthermore, 

the “aggregation” model has been adopted to remove constraints on local financing, promote 

agricultural entrepreneurship and open access to remunerative markets amid increasingly strict 

quality, environmental, social, hygiene and food safety requirements. Against this backdrop, 

farmers underscored the need for them to switch to organic farming and for land consolidation with 

the issuance of titles for their plots. One of the challenges to be addressed is the improvement of 

access to land and financing by rural women and youths. This will promote their settlement as 

agripreneurs targeting growth markets. During project implementation, this participatory approach 

will be maintained to enable stakeholders to own project activities and ensure the sustainability of 

investments. For the various development and WSC works, the participatory development plans 

(PDPs) that are being prepared will underpin all project interventions in each territorial unit. 

2.7 Bank Group Experience and Lessons Reflected in Project Design 

2.7.1 In April 2019, the Bank’s portfolio in Tunisia comprised 43 operations, of which 19 loans 

and 24 grants totalling UA 1 057 million (EUR 1 148 million). The agricultural sector has seven 

(7) operations (UA 69.804 million or EUR 82.251 million), representing 6.8% of the portfolio, 

implemented in similar regions such as Gafsa and Gabès. The performance of the national public 

portfolio is deemed satisfactory with a score of 3.4 (3.5 for agriculture) on 4 (CPPR 2017/2018). 

However, specific weaknesses were noted in procurement, late submission of audit reports and 

difficulties in evaluating the impact of projects. In addition, the Bank has had a rich experience in 

financing integrated agricultural development projects (IADPs). The evaluation of this experience 

conducted in 2018 (January 2019 Summary Report) within the framework of the MIC-TAF grant 

highlighted the following points: (i) the need to better organise agricultural sub-sectors, particularly 

the downstream subsector; (ii) the need to build the institutional capacity of CRDAs and clarify 

partnerships; (iii) the need to define an exit strategy; and (iv) the need to strengthen ADPs and 

establish a baseline situation. In addition, there is lack of innovative mechanisms for financing 

agricultural entrepreneurship, particularly for rural women. 

2.7.2 PDAPF-GZ design took into account lessons from the Bank’s experiences and those of its 

key partners such as IFAD, IBRD, SFD and FAO. A Project Management Unit (PMU) set up within 

the Zaghouan CRDA will oversee the implementation of project activities. PMU staff will be 

selected from the CRDA and will be trained “in situ” by Bank experts on allotments to reduce the 

number of contracts and cut transaction and financial management costs, in order to accelerate the 

preparation of financial statements. The CRDA and the PMU will be provided with equipment, 

logistics and other teaching aids for technical training, agricultural advisory schemes and extension 

services. Similarly, clear agreements will be concluded with its key partners (AVFA, OEP, CTAB, 

INRAT, Mograne School, the Chott Mariem Horticulture and Organic Agriculture Research Centre 

- CRHAB). The project will promote agricultural subsectors that constitute important niches. It will 

finance training, stakeholder organisation, and product processing, packaging and marketing 

activities, thus helping to incorporate various subsector links, generate value added and create the 

desired jobs. The MIC grant mobilised by the Bank was tapped to conduct engineering studies (APS 

and APD), particularly those on irrigation schemes, collection ponds and rural roads, establish the 

project’s baseline situation and guarantee project quality at entry assessment. Support for the 

development of SMEs and income-generating activities as well as pursuit of the “aggregator” 

approach will help to fund training and incubation programmes in support of financial resource 

mobilisation for the development of agricultural entrepreneurship.

2.8 Key Performance Indicators 

2.8.1 The key performance indicators monitored based on the baseline situation are presented in 

the results-based logical framework. In terms of facilities, monitoring will concern the number and 

areas of PIPs developed or rehabilitated (and property owned by men and women, to track the 

gender gap), boreholes and collection ponds developed, acreage planted with fruit trees, fodder 

species, water and soil conservation works. The main production and marketing indicators relate to 

additional production (tonnes), yields (t/ha), the number of farmers by type of gender-disaggregated 

development works, increase in income, including those of men and women in order to monitor 

gender gaps, the number and quality of jobs for youths and women created through entrepreneurial 

initiatives, the number of producers, processors and traders trained and organised, as well as the 

number of producers who have adopted best agricultural and production practice that comply with 

environmental, hygienic and food safety rules and standards. The project will also monitor the level 

of women’s participation in decision-making bodies and access to land after development, the 

amount of rural financing mobilised and the rate of increase in gender-disaggregated gross margins. 

III. Project Feasibility 

3.1 Economic and Financial Performance 

3.1.1 Project financial and economic outcomes were determined based on an analysis of 

expected project costs and benefits over a 20-year investment lifespan using the reference pricing 

method, comparing the project and no project situations from the financial standpoint (impact on 

farmers and the various project direct beneficiaries) and from the community standpoint by 

considering socio-economic benefits generated by the project. The expected project benefits will 

stem from improved productivity of existing farm areas and additional production of crops, 

livestock, fodder and income-generating activities. At full development, the project will enable the 

production of 18 000 tonnes of olives, 4 000 tonnes of peaches, 6 000 tonnes of citrus fruits, 26 600 

tonnes of tomatoes, 1 000 tonnes of market garden products, 1 800 000 litres of milk, 21 000 bales 

of fodder, and the establishment of 200 micro and small projects. Profitability analysis was 

conducted based on investment costs plus physical contingencies, and covered irrigation facilities, 

boreholes, plantations, water and soil conservation (WSC) measures, value chains promotion, a 5-

year project implementation period and a 20-year service life. It took into account periodic 

replacement and regular maintenance of equipment. Calculation assumptions took into account 

recent agricultural product prices, yields and production costs. Financial profitability analysis was 

carried out for all types of farms and for each agricultural subsector and income-generating activity. 

Economic profitability was calculated using the elements of financial profitability after deducting 

financial transfers and assessing costs and benefits in relation to their economic value. Based on 

these assumptions, the financial and economic rates of return presented in detail as annex are 

summarised in Table 3.1 below. 

Table 3.1: Key Economic and Financial Data 

NPV (baseline scenario) TND 30.6 million 

IRR (baseline scenario) 15.6 % 

Economic NPV (baseline scenario) TND 47.9 million 

ERR (baseline scenario) 18.8 % 

3.1.2  Financial performance:  the financial rate of return is higher than project financing costs, 

which justifies the implementation of operations in various subsectors selected with variable 

margins according to the type of farm. Additional project income broken down by type of farm and 

activity will mainly come from improved yield of existing olive plantations, new plantations and 

other crops, livestock production and income-generating activities. Additional income in a peak 



 

11 

 

year are estimated by subsector and in TND million as follows: olive (22.9); peach (1.037); citrus 

fruit (1.170); tomato (1.29); dairy (0.486); market gardening (2.36); fodder (0.85); and income-

generating activities (1.00).  

3.1.3 Economic performance: based on a 12% opportunity cost of capital, the economic rate of 

return and the net present value stand at 18.8% and TND 47.9 million, respectively. These values 

would be higher if it were possible to quantify benefits such as improved standard and quality of 

life of the beneficiary population, impact on women and their integration into the development 

process, job creation, reduction of rural exodus, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions through 

new plantations, development of organic farming and building of the capacity of the units and 

bodies involved at various stages of project implementation and operation.    

3.1.4 Sensitivity analysis: an analysis of project sensitivity to potential risks of variation in 

yields, production costs and farm prices was carried out. Simulations based on a 10% increase in 

investment costs reduced the ERR to 17.2% and the NPV to TND 39.5 million. A 10% decrease in 

income reduced the ERR to 16.3% and the NPV to TND 29.4 million. A combination of the two 

events reduced the ERR to 14.2% and the NPV to TND 16.3 million. The outcomes of the financial 

and economic analysis show that the PDPFA-GZ is financially justified, and is viable socio-

economically and environmentally. 

3.2 Environmental and Social Impact 

3.2.1. Environment:  based on the Bank's Integrated Safeguards System (ISS), the PDPFA-GZ 
is classified under Environmental Category 2 because the negative environmental and social 

impacts were deemed moderate to low. Therefore, in accordance with national and Bank 

procedures, the Regional Office for Agricultural Development (CRDA) prepared and submitted an 

Environmental and Social Impact Notice (ESIN). The Environmental and Social Management Plan 

(ESMP) prepared in 2014 was also updated and submitted. The summary of the ESMP has been 

posted on the Bank's website.  

3.2.2. The main project positive environmental and social impacts identified include: (i) land 
consolidation in several irrigation schemes, which will allow for better agricultural development; 

(ii) promotion of income-generating activities (IGAs), which will diversify income sources and 

support small farms, especially those run by women and youths. This will also raise the income of 

rural dwellers, increase job supply and reduce rural exodus; (iii) facilitation of access to micro-

project financing through the assistance that the project will provide to beneficiaries (studying their 

projects, monitoring project implementation and training in the activities to be promoted); (iv) 

development of organic farming, which reduces the use of fertilisers compared with conventional 

farming techniques. Chemical pollution that affects the quality of groundwater will be mitigated 

through the implementation of organic farming projects; (v) study on sylvicultural and pastoral 

development, which will aim to improve the profitability of the livestock sub-sector, while ensuring 

better management of resources and preventing their degradation: (vi) enhancement of the role of 

the Zaghouan National Park in the dissemination and entrenchment of the environmental culture 

among the population and improvement of the living environment; and (vii) improvement of the 

service quality of the soil laboratory, which will contribute to preventing soil degradation to allow 

for optimal use of the soil.  

3.2.3. The negative impacts on biophysical environments are of various forms, including: (i) 
natural and anthropogenic degradation of irrigation schemes and their infrastructure; (ii) upsurge in 

the loss of water distributed in the canals; (iii) reduced fertility of farmland and agricultural 

production; (iv) sharp drop in groundwater level leading to reduced availability of irrigation water; 

(v) land degradation and erosion with silting, gullying and glacis formation, and appearance of crust 



 

12 

 

soils; (vi) gully slopes, shoreline erosion and silting of temporary streams and wadis; and (vii) 

relative pressure of livestock on crops, in the absence of open spaces and pasture areas. 

3.2.4. The ESMP submitted includes: (i) a waste management plan; (ii) a risk management 
programme; (iii) an environmental surveillance and monitoring programme; and (iv) an institution-

building plan. 

3.2.5. The main mitigation measures recommended for implementation by works contractors 
under the responsibility of CRDA are: (i) protection of soil and groundwater resources; (ii) 

preservation of soil stability, prevention of uncontrolled rainwater run-offs and protection of 

drainage networks; (iii) protection and restoration of existing infrastructure; (iv) protection of 

dwellings and other personal property; (v) protection of the archaeological heritage; (vi) solid waste 

management; (vii) prevention and reduction of atmospheric emissions of gaseous pollutants and 

dusts; (viii) prevention and reduction of sound levels and vibrations; and (ix) reduction of 

vegetation destruction areas and restoration of the landscape after works. The estimated overall cost 

of the ESMP (excluding the resettlement action plan) is USD 355 000. It will be fully funded by 

the project. 

3.2.6. The project will also protect and sustain water resources by: (i) mobilizing surface water 
through catchment ponds and the cleaning of river beds; (ii) ensuring the integrated recharge and 

management of groundwater; (iii) improving the water cycle through soil stabilization; and (iv) 

providing support for water saving through the development of drip irrigation and the improvement 

of on-farm management. In addition, it should be noted that the Bank, through the ongoing Water 

2050 Project, is involved in the improvement of water governance in Tunisia. This project will help 

to prepare a national strategy by 2020, the thrusts of which will be taken into account during the 

implementation of PDPFA-GZ activities.  

3.2.7. The environmental and social surveillance and monitoring programme will focus 
respectively on: (i) the monitoring of construction site activities during the construction phase by 

the Consulting Engineer; (ii) environmental monitoring, which will notably concern ambient air 

quality, groundwater and receiving environment water quality, as well as noise and vibration. 

Monitoring will cover the construction and operation phases.  

3.2.8. The recommendations and measures ensuing from the environmental and social 
assessment should be set out and inserted: (i) for contractors, in the bidding documents (BDs) 

through environmental clauses, obligations, responsibilities and penalties, in the Climate Change 

Action Plan (CCAP) as well as in the price schedule (PS) and the bill of quantities (BoQ); (ii) for 

the Consulting Engineer, who shall ensure the presence of two environmental and social/gender 

development experts. 

3.2.9. Climate change: the project is classified under Environmental Category 2 following the 
assessment of the Climate Safeguards System (CSS), in accordance with the Adaptation Review 

and Evaluation Procedures (AREP). In Zaghouan region, climate parameters are highly variable in 

time and space. Rainfall is moderate and very irregular (245 to 625 mm/year). Owing to torrential 

rains, exacerbated by extensive overgrazing, deforestation and poor conduct of agricultural works, 

water erosion is one of the major factors of soil degradation that has reached worrying levels. 

Climate change results in increased average annual temperature and a decrease in average rainfall, 

which affect water resources, ecosystems, agriculture, infrastructure and the occurrence of extreme 

weather events such as floods, snow and hailstorm. Thanks to its activities, PDPFA-GZ is a project 

for climate change adaptation and risk mitigation. It will enhance the climate change resilience of 

vulnerable groups, especially women and youths, as well as production systems. The project will 

significantly reduce water erosion, improve land production capacity and preserve biodiversity. It 

will confine farmers to the irrigation schemes developed, thus reducing their relocation from 



 

13 

 

farming areas in the south to the north of the Governorate. The PMU and CRDA will work to 

incorporate climate information into participatory development plans (PDPs) and encourage 

farmers to take into account climate information in the agricultural calendar. 

3.2.10. Gender issues: the project is classified under Category II of the Gender Marker (existence 
of gender effects and need for an action plan and budget to ensure gender action). In Zaghouan 

Governorate, women are massively involved in agricultural activities. They represent 46% to 51% 

of the family farm labour force, 25% of the permanent paid labour force and 51% of the casual paid 

labour force. They play a particularly important role in livestock production-related activities, 

especially milk production which employs 43% of working women. However, there are gender 

inequalities regarding decent and sustainable jobs, access to land and credit, and differences in 

wages. Women are also poorly represented in professional organisations and rarely access decision-

making bodies. The project will implement special measures for women (and other vulnerable 

groups) to ensure that they benefit from the positive impacts of the project in terms of developing 

their economic activities, creating jobs, reducing the workload and economic empowerment. Thus, 

the project will promote rural activities for which women have proven expertise (olive oil, market 

gardening, aromatic and medicinal plants, organic and local products, etc.) and from which they 

can earn decent income.  

3.2.11. Specifically, the project will ensure that women have access to 40% - 45% of plots with 
land titles in the new public irrigation schemes (PIPs), against 10% -15% currently. The training 

and coaching programme for agricultural entrepreneurship, viable business incubation and support 

for settlement in the new PIPs will concern at least 200 women entrepreneurs who will benefit from 

funding worth about TND 1.5 million set up. It will target women-owned micro-, small- and 

medium-size enterprises (MSMEs) with high growth potential organised within mutual agricultural 

service companies (SMSAs) and agricultural development groups (GDAs). In addition, there will 

be intermediation with local financing entities to enable the greatest number of women (at least 

60%) and vulnerable people to benefit from credit facilities to develop a business. Furthermore, the 

project will support the marketing and commercialisation of women’s products through the 

development of product sales points. In addition to this specific support, the project will closely 

monitor the inclusive and equitable participation of women and youths in implementing all 

activities, sharing the benefits and enhancing their economic empowerment and decision-making 

power. This will give women better social visibility and strengthen their socio-economic status. 

3.2.12. Social issues: one of the objectives of PDPFA-GZ is to reduce inequalities within 
Zaghouan Governorate and raise the region to align with the level of national economic and social 

development indicators. As a result, it will promote social cohesion in the Governorate. The 

strengthening of associations (GDAs) and cooperatives (SMSAs) promotes consultation and the 

development of a solidarity-based economy. There will be a remarkable impact on food and 

nutrition security. The expected outcomes in terms of employment are significant. The project will 

strengthen the employability of women and young people through vocational training. The 

combination of irrigation facility development works, technical training, access to means of 

production for the poorest, financing of IGAs and entrepreneurship, WSC works, promotion of 

local organic subsectors and products will generate additional income for the population (estimated 

to be at least 50% of current income). This will encourage the consumption of social services such 

as education and health, and thus enhance the value of social capital. 

3.2.13. Youth employment and promotion of agricultural entrepreneurship: access to credit 
is one of the major constraints facing rural MSMEs in the region. Investment in agriculture is a 

risky activity that requires risk sharing by all stakeholders in the value chain. The project will 

promote agricultural entrepreneurship among young people (men and women) and initiators of 

innovative projects by providing more flexible financing adapted to the constraints of each operator 



 

14 

 

involved in the value chain through the establishment of a strategic partnership with financial 

institutions. In this connection, 300 young people (girls and boys) will be trained in agricultural 

entrepreneurship and set up in all the lin ks of the value chain, namely: production in the developed 

PIPs, processing, trade and services. This initiative ultimately seeks to reach nearly 1500 people 

through its multiplier effect. In terms of support and to optimise project sustainability and the 

conquest of new markets, the project will build the capacity of promoters and enhance aspects 

related to the improvement of development and sales techniques, marketing conditions, required 

quality standards, facilitation of the “organic” certification process, visibility and access to 

profitable markets. Incubation centres (Mograne School Nursery, the Zaghouan Business Centre, 

etc.) will also be solicited for training in entrepreneurship and development of business plans to 

foster easy access to available financial resources. Lastly, the project will support the constitution 

of potential aggregators (SMSAs, private companies, etc.).  

3.2.14. Involuntary resettlement: considering that the engineering studies carried out with Bank 

financial support did not take into account the aspects related to the freeing of the rights-of-way for 

the execution of works planned and the possible risks of expropriation, the Bank requires the review 

of the said studies to take these aspects and risk mitigation into account (selecting the appropriate 

variant and clearly defining the indemnification/compensation measures envisaged in such a case). 

Meanwhile, the CRDA has with Bank assistance submitted a Comprehensive Resettlement Action 

Plan (CRAP) outlining the general principles that will guide all expropriation operations under 

PDPFA-GZ. It defines the procedures to be followed for prior recognition of expropriation and 

indemnification/compensation rights. It specifies the indemnification/compensation mechanism 

and the redress mechanism, and identifies the institutional arrangement and capacity building for 

the implementation of expropriation and complaint processing procedures. CRAP is a contractual 

document by which the Tunisian Government, in collaboration with the local authorities and in 

accordance with SO2 requirements and procedures, formally undertakes to respect the 

indemnification/compensation rights of any potential project affected person or entity. The cost of 

implementing CRAP (RAP implementation, indemnification/compensation, operation, capacity 

building, implementation monitoring, etc.) will be fully funded by the Borrower. 

3.2.15. CRAP will be set out as a resettlement action plan (RAP) latest prior to project launching, 
for implementation by the CRDA. The submission of the final RAP will be the subject of a specific 

disbursement condition precedent to financing the specified works. 

IV. Project Implementation 

4.1. Implementation Arrangements 

4.1.1. Implementation arrangements: the Zaghouan Regional Office for Agricultural 
Development (CRDA) will manage and coordinate the project. It will set up a Project Management 

Unit (PMU) comprising a Project Coordinator, an Administrative and Financial Officer assisted by 

an Accountant, a Procurement Specialist, a Monitoring and Evaluation Officer and a team of 

consultant facilitators. The PMU will be responsible for coordination and planning, monitoring and 

evaluation, preparation of annual programmes and budgets, financial management, procurement 

and preparation of project progress and audit reports. It will rely on the various technical 

directorates and sub-departments of the CRDA for technical supervision, extension services, works 

control/monitoring, and regular evaluation of ESMP implementation. It will also rely on dedicated 

facilitators to be deployed routinely at the local level closest to beneficiaries (GDAs, farmers, 

women and youths). In addition to equipment and logistics, the PMU will benefit from technical 

support, training and capacity building in environmental and social management and monitoring as 

provided for in the ESMP. 



 

15 

 

4.1.2. Based on agreements to be concluded for some activities, the PMU will use specialised 
institutions and NGOs, notably the Chott-Mariem Organic Agriculture Centre (CTAB) for organic 

agricultural support, the Chott-Mariem Horticulture and Organic Agriculture Research Centre 

(CRRHAB) for the development of rosehip cultivation, the Office of Livestock and Pasture (OEP) 

for the development of the dairy sub-sector, genetic improvement, creation of an insemination 

circuit, training and supervision of stock breeders, the National Institute of Agronomic Research, 

Tunis (INRAT) for the development of fodder crops and improvement of nutritive value, and the 

Mograne School and AVFA for the supervision of farmers, CRDA technicians and business 

incubation.  

4.1.3. The project will be coordinated at the national level by the National Projects Coordination 
Committee (CNC) chaired by the Minister of Agriculture, Water and Fishery Resources or his/her 

representative and comprising representatives of the general directorates of the Ministry of 

Agriculture, representatives of the Ministry of Development, Investment and International 

Cooperation, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Equipment and Housing, and the Ministry 

of Local Affairs and Environment, among others. Project activities will be coordinated at the 

regional level by the Regional Development Board (CRD) chaired by the Governor and comprising 

elected representatives of the region as well as regional government representatives.  

4.1.4. Procurement arrangements: all procurement of Bank-financed works, goods and 
consultancy services will be in accordance with the Procurement Framework for Bank Group-

Funded Operations (“AfDB Procurement Policy”), October 2015 edition, and with the provisions 

set forth in the Financing Agreement. Pursuant to this policy and considering the various 

assessments conducted, the following groups of transactions have been identified for 

implementation using the various systems below: 

(a) Bank Procurement Methods and Procedures (BPMPs): all selections of consultants will be 
in accordance with the Bank’s procurement system (AfDB System) using Bank bidding 

documents (BDs). The use of the Bank system for such procurement is attributable to the 

weaknesses identified in the national system, including the inappropriate mechanism for 

opening consultants’ bids, the absence of a minimum technical qualification score in some 

methods, etc. 

(b) Tunisia’s Procurement System (TPS):  the procurement of works and goods will be done in 
accordance with Tunisia’s procurement system (National System) embodied by Decree No. 

2014-1039 of 13 March 2014 regulating public procurement ("DMP"), via bidding 

documents (BDs) commonly used in Tunisia.  

4.1.5. Details on this procurement and related control mechanisms are presented in Annex B.5 

4.1.6. Procurement risk and capacity assessment: the country, sector and project procurement 
risks were assessed and the outcomes used to guide the selection of the procurement system 

(Borrower or Bank) to be used for specific activities or group of similar activities under the project. 

The assessment of the Executing Agency’s procurement capacity was carried out. Appropriate risk 

mitigation measures have been included in the action plan presented in paragraph B5.9 of Annex 

B5. 

4.1.7. Advance contracting:  considering the Borrower's tight schedule, and to address the issue 
of accelerating project implementation pursuant to PD 02/2015, studies prior to the procurement of 

works planned for the first year of the project may, at Government’s request, be implemented 

through advance contracting, in accordance with the provisions of Article 11.2 of the AfDB 

Procurement Policy. The procedures and methods to be used for these advance actions will be the 

same as those chosen for the project. In this regard, a request stating the reasons (indicating the 



 

16 

 

procurement concerned), together with a procurement plan, will be submitted to the Bank. In turn, 

the Bank will analyse the reasons mentioned and take a decision. 

4.1.8. Specific conditions arising from the use of the National Procurement System - Additional 
Waiver on Eligibility: 

(i) Eligibility-related waiver: the Bank’s resources for financing the project will come from the 
AfDB window. As a result, the eligibility rules specific to the window are a priori 

applicable. Following the assessment of procurement risks and capacity, it was decided that 

the National Procurement System will be used for part of this project. Given that the 

eligibility rules for public procurement under Tunisian law are not the same as those of the 

AfDB window, it is necessary to avoid any practical incompatibility. To this end, and for 

the component implemented using the national public procurement system, PDPFA-GZ will 

benefit from a partial waiver (only contracts of a specified size are concerned) granted by 

the Bank's Board of Directors (“the Board”) in March 2017 (see Document 

AfDB/BD/WP/2016/184/ Rev.(2) for the non-application of the rule of origin of the AfDB 

window (as provided for in Article 17.1.d: “Operational Principles” of the Agreement 

Establishing the African Development Bank (so-called Rule of Origin) for all goods 

contracts of up to UA 1 million, all consultancy contracts up to UA 300 000 and all works 

contracts below or equal to UA 6 million financed by AfDB window resources and 

concluded in accordance with a national procurement system. Given that no contract 

exceeding the above thresholds is provided for under PDPFA-GZ, no additional waiver will 

be required. Thus, the eligibility rules applicable to all contracts concluded under this project 

according to the Tunisian public procurement system will be the national eligibility rules, 

in addition to the provisions of paragraphs 5.2 to 5.10 of the AfDB Eligibility Policy. 

Consequently and for information purposes, even if the national system is used, Bank loan 

resources would not be used to finance a contract awarded to a bidder under AfDB Group 

sanctions. In the event where, these provisions notwithstanding, a contract is concluded with 

a bidder under Bank Group sanction, the contract will not be financed by AfDB loan 

resources. The list of companies under sanction can be consulted at 

http://www.afdb.org/debarred. 

(ii) Other specific conditions proposed: to be able to perform its fiduciary obligations in 
connection with the use of the National System, the Bank has agreed with the Borrower on 

a series of measures the reasons, objectives and details of which are presented in paragraph 

B.5.7.2 of Annex B5.  

4.1.9. Financial management:  the Zaghouan CRDA will ensure project financial management 
through the Project Management Unit (PMU) to be created within it. Financial execution will be 

based on the budgetary system, the public expenditure execution and control system in force at the 

CRDA governed by the Code of Public Accounts, and the circulars on public fund management. In 

this regard, the PMU will benefit from the technical support of the subdivisions of the 

Administrative and Financial Division, the collaboration of the subdivisions of CRDA’s Technical 

Divisions, the Pay Accountant (Comptable Payeur) under the authority of the Regional Treasurer, 

and the Regional Controller of Public Expenditure under the supervision of the Head of 

Government. The project's financial management staff will comprise a Project Manager and an 

Administrative and Financial Officer assisted by an Accountant, all appointed from among CRDA 

staff. The PMU will be responsible for preparing annual work programmes and budgets (AWPBs), 

implementing the AWPB and preparing interim financial reports and annual financial statements. 

To better incorporate the PMU into the CRDA management system, the duties of its members 

should be clearly defined. 



 

17 

 

4.1.10. Disbursements:  the loan will be disbursed in accordance with Bank rules and procedures. 
The special account method and the direct payment method defined in the disbursement manual 

will be used to withdraw loan funds. The use of the special account method will be subject to the 

opening of a special account in the name of the project at the Central Bank of Tunisia (BCT). This 

account will only receive loan resources. During negotiations, a draft disbursement letter will be 

presented and agreed upon by the Bank and the Borrower. It will be sent to the Borrower’s 

representative upon loan approval by the Bank’s Board of Directors. In accordance with the 

provisions of the disbursement manual, and subject to prior Bank approval, it is possible, during 

project implementation, to change the disbursement methods adopted.  

4.1.11.  Auditing: the General Finance Control (CGF) will conduct the external audit based on the 

terms of reference approved by the Bank. The Borrower will transmit the audit report to the Bank 

within six (6) months following the end of the financial year audited. The PMU will be responsible 

for implementing audit recommendations aimed at improving sound project financial execution. 

An annual procurement audit will be conducted for contracts awarded in accordance with the 

national system. 

4.2. Monitoring 

4.2.1. Monitoring mechanisms: the project monitoring and evaluation mechanism will be 
designed taking into consideration the specific project objectives and the expected outcomes of the 

Strategic Development Plan (SDP) for the agricultural sector, and aligned with the public projects 

monitoring system (“INJEZ”) currently used by the Ministry of Agriculture, Water Resources and 

Fishery (MARHP). A participatory monitoring and citizen control mechanism provided by the 

SMSA and GDA will also be set up in line with the principle of accountability now recommended 

within the context of results-based management.  

4.2.2. Internal monitoring and evaluation will be carried out by the PMU and will cover project 
physical (overall and component implementation rate) and financial (commitment rate and 

disbursement rate) monitoring, gender mainstreaming in activities and inputs, and their adequacy 

with projections.  The project monitoring/evaluation officer will collect and compile information 

on the physical and financial outcomes. This information will be used to prepare the project 

progress reports. The key reports that will be prepared during the project implementation phase 

are indicated in Table 4.1 below.

4.2.3. External monitoring and evaluation seeks to measure the effectiveness and efficiency of 
project outputs, and their contribution to achieving development outcomes (i.e. project outputs and 

impacts). It will be carried out by the National Coordination Committee (CNC) and the Regional 

Development Board (CRD), in addition to the two annual supervision missions fielded by the 

Bank. The mid-term review will be conducted in Year 3. At project closure, the Bank and the 

Government will produce a completion report within the prescribed deadline. The main project 

implementation phases are summarised below.

4.3. Governance 

4.3.1. Tunisia is making significant progress in governance. With a score of 63.5 against an 
African average of 49.9, the country occupies the 9th position out of 54 countries in the Mo Ibrahim 

Index of African Governance (IIAG-2018). Similarly, with Bank assistance, the country embarked 

on the implementation of a public procurement reform action plan that resulted in the adoption in 

2014 of a new decree on the regulation of more transparent public procurement. The country 

fiduciary risk assessment (CFRA) carried out showed that the internal public finance management 

control system is appropriate. Generally, economic governance has improved and competition 

enhanced. Under the PDPFA-GZ specifically, land tenure governance will be promoted through 

land consolidation support and the issuance of land titles to farmers (both men and women) in the 

new public irrigation schemes. Transparency measures will also be applied in the selection of 

beneficiaries with the full participation of farmers’ representatives. Likewise, a participatory 

monitoring and citizen control mechanism will be set up in line with the principle of accountability 

recommended within the context of results-based management. 

4.4. Sustainability  

4.4.1. The project has adopted the participatory approach, which enables greater ownership of 
development activities by project beneficiaries who will contribute significantly (about 30%) to 

infrastructure financing and management (PIPs, boreholes, catchment ponds, product development 

units, etc.). Sustainability also relies on water and soil conservation (WSC) and water-saving 

measures, including groundwater recharge, sealing of the entire water transport and drip irrigation 

system to save water and control flow rates recorded. The PMU will conclude collaboration 

agreements with specialised institutions for organic agricultural support, rosehip research and 

development, development of the diary sub-sector and genetic improvement, fodder crop 

development and supervision of farmers and CRDA technicians. To enable these entities to play 

their role fully, they will be supported through specific training in agricultural advisory schemes, 

farmers’ organisation, management, monitoring and evaluation. The use of the “value chain” 

approach with the mainstreaming of product processing, storage and marketing aspects will help to 

incorporate all subsector links and further connect production to markets. Thus, setting up small 

economically, financially and ecologically viable product processing units will guarantee the 

sustainability of project achievements. Furthermore, the project will ensure crosscutting integration 

and mainstreaming of environmental and social aspects, hygiene and food safety, in line with the 

Bank's environmental and social safeguards, and the standards and requirements of profitable 

markets. The sustainability of project operations will also be guaranteed through the effective 

involvement of the local private sector, financial institutions and enterprises in the “aggregation” 



 

19 

 

model to ensure the sustainable establishment of young agricultural entrepreneurs and their access 

to financing and markets. 

4.5. Risk Management 

Table 4.3: Risks and Mitigation Measures 

Risks Level Mitigation Measure 

Unclarified land and public property issues can 

create difficulties in improving the PIPs to be 

developed and compromise project objectives   

Moderate Improving local land governance through land 

consolidation, settlement of land tenure issues 

and the issuance of land titles, following an 

inclusive process, will mitigate this risk.  

Climatic hazards that can worsen the degradation 

of ecosystems and property, increase natural 

disasters and render the population more 

vulnerable 

Moderate Drip irrigation, protection of vulnerable areas, 

opening up of roads and incorporation of climate 

information into the design of facilities will 

mitigate this risk.  

Lack of transparency in the selection of 

beneficiaries, weak monitoring of technological 

innovations by the communities and weak 

capacity of technical services and companies 

Low The definition of beneficiary selection criteria 

with the active participation of farmers’ 

representatives, the adoption of a participatory, 

inclusive and collaborative approach, and the 

building of the capacity of all stakeholders will 

mitigate this risk 

Limited access of farmers to financial resources 

that can annihilate project efforts to create 

sustainable jobs and generate decent income 

Moderate Training in agricultural entrepreneurship and 

forging of partnerships with MFIs for rural 

financing will mitigate this risk. 

4.6. Knowledge Building  

4.6.1. The project will finance a study to update groundwater balances. It will support the 
strengthening of the piezometric measuring network for groundwater level monitoring and control. 

The findings of these studies and measurements will feed a database at the CRDA to enable 

appropriate programming of future agricultural development operations, especially irrigation. The 

project will also build CRDA's capacity to make an optimal use of all the knowledge acquired 

mainly from experts, and finance stakeholder exchange sessions for better sharing of information 

collected. The PMU and CRDA will work to incorporate climate information into participatory 

development plans (PDPs) and encourage farmers to include climate information in the agricultural 

calendar. Such information will also be shared with the weather monitoring networks to identify 

risks of natural disasters and contribute to the rational and predictive management of such risks. In 

addition, gender-based monitoring and evaluation will contribute to the development of knowledge 

in this sector and help to advance gender considerations in other bank operations in the agricultural 

sector. Lastly, the project will establish an integrated system for managing and sharing knowledge 

on project activities through regular dissemination on MARHP’s website, in order to build on and 

manage the knowledge and experience acquired. 

V. LEGAL FRAMEWORK

(a) Output 1: development of climate and disaster resilient community 
infrastructure subprojects, such as village access or farm roads, small 
bridges, water supply, electric grid connections and multipurpose 
centers, identified through the VDP process, based on selection criteria 
and funded through block grants;

(b) Output 2: development of resilient livelihood activities for poor men and 
women in the lowest four deciles of poor and vulnerable households in 
their villages, through livelihood subprojects identified through the VDP 
process, funded through block grants, such as new or improved climate­
smart agriculture, livestock, fisheries activities, among others; provision 
of access to vocational training particular for women and youth; and 
provision of training to poor households above the lowest four deciles to
