1 Introduction 
 

1.1 General 
The Government of Suriname has requested the Bank’s technical support in the preparation of an 
investment loan to finance a Sustainable Agricultural Productivity Program (SU-L1052). The goal of SU-
L1052 is to increase agricultural productivity in Surinam through investments in infrastructure and 
management of irrigation and drainage (I&D) systems; and by improving the quality of available 
agriculture statistics. The expected results of the I&D component of the Program are: (i) increased 
agricultural productivity in I&D areas; (ii) improved water management within I&D areas; (iii) operating 
WB effectively contributing to the operation and management (O&M) of I&D infrastructure.  
 
The objective of the Irrigation and Drainage component is to improve the functioning and management of 
I&D systems in Suriname, particularly in Nickerie District, by addressing current failings in infrastructure 
and transferring key management and maintenance responsibilities to Water Boards (WB). The program 
will finance: (i) rehabilitation/modernization of primary and secondary I&D infrastructure selected to 
benefit small- and medium-size farmers; (ii) support for developing and strengthening WB capacity to 
take over the O&M of I&D systems; (iii) capacity building of government bodies in charge of water 
resource administration for irrigation; and (iv) design and implementation of one-time incentives 
mechanisms limited in time and scope and aimed at improving efficiency in farmers’ water use and 
increasing their willingness to cover O&M costs. This component will include measures to improve the 
water resource sustainable management for its different uses, particularly by taking into account climate 
change impacts (i.e., in regard to water supply and demand) and considering adaptation measures. 
 
During the first stage of the project preparation activities, the Irrigation and Drainage consultancy and the 
Government indicated during the IDB mission that took place in November 2017 that, to improve the 
efficiency of the Nickerie I&D system and to reduce the likelihood of flooding in irrigated areas two 
structures needed to be built: Nanni Weir and the Maratakka Spillway. These structures need to be 
analyzed as part of project preparation. 
 
 
 

1.2 This study 
 
The concerned study is to review existing information and prepare preliminary designs and cost estimates 
of the two structures as well as the additional works required in the restructuring of the inlets to the main 
irrigation canals (Van Wouw, Stondansi, HA and Lateral canal). 
 
This study is part of a series of consultancies that will take place simultaneously as part of the SU-L1052 
Program preparation plan agreed between the government and the IDB, which includes: economic 
analysis, institutional capacity analysis, environmental and social analysis and a study on the hydrology 
of the Nickerie water resource base. 
 
This document presents the Intermediate Report, for the consultancy assignment to address the activities 
and planning for the feasibility assessment of the Nanni Weir and Maratakka Spillway. 
 

1.3 Objective and approach of this Study 
 
The specific objective of this consultancy is to carry out a:(i) feasibility study of the Nanni Weir and 
related structures, including preliminary or basic design and estimates of the investment costs required; 
and (ii) feasibility study of the Maratakka spillway and link canal to the Maratakka River, including 
preliminary or basic design and estimates of the investment costs required. 
 
The following approach is used to achieve this objective: 



   

Intermediate Report- Feasibility Nanni Weir and Maratakka Spillway- v2- May 28th, 2018 Page 4 of 24 

- Conduct site visits and review existing data/reports on the structures 
- Consult with relevant stakeholders, including the OWMCP, LVV, OWT&C and others 
- Conduct field surveys and inspections  
- Review and propose solutions and alternative options 
- Discuss and agree on selected infrastructure works 
- Prepare preliminary designs and cost estimates 
- Assess technical and financial feasibility 
- Propose implementation schemes and procurement procedures 

 
It is noted that the Inter-Ministerial Irrigation and Drainage Coordination Working Group (IMIDCWG) 
consists of members of amongst others LVV, OWT&C and OWMCP. They are regularly consulted 
during the course of this assignment. 
 
Furthermore, discussions are held with the IDB team and other consultants participating in this project. 
This ensures that relevant available information and data is shared and cross-checked. 

2 Background 
 
Appendix I presents an overview map of existing infrastructure and (inlet and outlet) structures. Appendix 
II presents proposed improvement and new infrastructure in the EU OWMCP Masterplan (2010). 
 
The Nanni Weir 

The Multipurpose Corantijn Project initiated in 1981 was never completed due to shortage of funds.  
The construction of the Nanni Weir and related structures was the major and essential hydraulic structure 
never completed, resulting in considerable losses of expensive pumped water. 
 
The absence of a weir at the outflow of the Corantijn canal causes the water from the Corantijn canal to 
spill directly into the Nanni swamp. As a result the water level in the whole Nanni swamp needs to be 
raised before irrigation water can flow into the irrigation canals. Substantial losses in evaporation occur in 
the large Nanni swamp estimated at 30% and the whole irrigation supply becomes very inefficient and 
difficult to manage, in particular when irrigation supply is interrupted.  
 
The construction of the Nanni weir at the outlet of the Corantijn canal requires a regulating structure in 
the weir that will allow the inflow of irrigation water from the Nanni swamp into the irrigation system as 
well the outflow of excess water of the Nanni swamp into the Nanni creek through the existing Nanni 
spillway. 
 
Additional structures need to be considered and include the reconstruction of the Nanni Inlet structure 
into the Van Wouw and the Stondansi canals, the extension of the Stondansi canal, reconstruction of two 
intakes from the Stondansi canal into the HA and Lateral canals and strengthening of the swamp retention 
embankment and deepening of the Suriname canal. 
 
The master plan of the EU-financed study on the Irrigation supply of the Nickerie system identified the 
Nanni weir and related structures (estimated at 10 million USD in 2009) as the first priority for an 
improved and efficient irrigation supply with a direct impact on the areas to be irrigated and a reduction 
of pumping costs. 
 
 
The Maratakka Spillway 

The Maratakka Spillway and related link canal to the Maratakka River was one of two major and essential 
water control structures that were never completed. Implementation of the Spillway will connect the 
Suriname canal and allow the evacuation of floodwaters from the Nanni swamp and alleviate importantly 
the present flood hazards and increase fresh water supply to the Nickerie River. 



   

Intermediate Report- Feasibility Nanni Weir and Maratakka Spillway- v2- May 28th, 2018 Page 5 of 24 

The main outflow of floodwaters from the Nanni swamp is presently through the Nanni spillway into the 
Nanni Creek on the west side of the swamp close to the outflow of the Corantijn canal. The outflow on 
the eastern side of the swamp retention dike was to be realized through the Maratakka spillway that was 
however never constructed. Excessive rainfall in the Nanni catchment area causes frequently serious 
flooding, as the capacity of the Nanni spillway is insufficient for the evacuation of floodwaters.  
 
Construction of the Maratakka spillway and related connection canal from the Suriname canal into the 
Maratakka River would importantly reduce flooding problems and loss of production due to inundations 
in several polders, while the inflow of fresh water from the Maratakka into the Nickerie River would 
make additional water available for irrigation and push back saltwater intrusion. Cost estimates of the 
Maratakka spillway from the EU Masterplan did amount in 2009 to USD 750,000. 

3 Review studies and available information 

3.1 General 
 
Key reports relevant to this study are: 

• Irrigation Master Plan OWMCP (EU funded, 2010). 
• Designs of the “DOL” structures (original and “reduced” version) (Sunecon/ILACO, 1989) 

 
Abovementioned and other available literature were reviewed to understand the overall set up of the 
proposed MCP works and the hydraulic/water management aspects of the concerned Nanni Weir and 
Maratakka Spillway. 
 
The following sources / stakeholders have been contacted to obtain available data: 

• Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Fisheries (LVV) (head office and District 
Nickerie office) 

• Ministry of Public Works, Transportation and Communication (OWT&C) (Drainage 
department as well as District Nickerie office) 

• (Overlaying) Water board MCP (OWMCP) 
• District agencies (District Commissioner, and others) 
• Anton de Kom University (Adek) 
• Contractors, consultants and others who have worked in the MCP area. 

 
The discussions have provided valuable data to understand the recent changes and current status of the 
structures in the Project area.

3.2 Initial Site Visit and discussions 
 
A meeting was held with Mr. Van der Kooye (LVV Nickerie) on 4th March 2018. He explained the 
reasons behind the several proposed Nanni Weir and Maratakka 
Spillway including related structures and works. The key points 
are listed as: 

- Nanni Weir is needed to allow more intake of water 
from the Nanni Swamp and divert this water towards the 
north/east via the Suriname Canal. This is to feed the 
northern agricultural areas, including the remote 
Autonoom area, with sufficient fresh water. 

- There is a need for other structures to be taken into 
account for rehabilitation and construction. This 
includes Van Wouw Intake, which is in poor condition (see picture) and experience substantial 
water losses. Furthermore, some other structures need rehabilitation such as Nanni Spillway, 
IKUGH Intake (see picture) and Swamp Retention dam 
along the Suriname Canal. 

- An alternative may be considered by abandoning the Van 
Wouw Intake and making a new intake in the Suriname 
Canal close to the new Nanni Weir. 

- The Nanni Weir is needed to reduce losses from Corantijn 
Canal through flowing back into the Nanni swamp. 

- Maratakka Spillway is to have a controlled discharge of 
water during high water levels in the swamp, as the existing 
Nanni spillway does not have sufficient capacity. As such, flooding occurs regularly after heavy 
rainfall periods. 

- The Maratakka Spillway is also to discharge about 5 m3/s of fresh water during dry seasons into 
the Maratakka River. This is to push back and control the salt intrusion in the Nickerie River. 

  
An initial site visit was conducted on 9th March 2018 to the Van Wouw Intake area and IKUGH area. The 
site visit provided valuable information about the status of the several existing infrastructure and 
structures. It further provided a good overview of the possible interventions proposed in the 1977 and 
2010 studies. The visit to the proposed Maratakka Spillway location could not be undertaken during this 
visit due to unavailability of airboats. The Suriname Canal, between IKUGH and Maratakka, is not 
accessible by normal boat due to floating grass/weed. 

 
Van Wouw intake and Nanni spillway   IKUGH and HA intake 
 
 
A meeting was held with Mr. August Lila, Director of OWMCP on 9th March at his office. He confirmed 
more or less the same as Mr. Van der Kooye. In addition, it was discussed that the need for alternatives to 
supply more water is direly needed for the northern/Autonoom Area. The operation of the Wakay pumps 
is affected due to insufficient available fuel. The use of larger storage volumes of fresh water from the 
Nanni Swamp should be considered as much as possible. 



   

Intermediate Report- Feasibility Nanni Weir and Maratakka Spillway- v2- May 28th, 2018 Page 7 of 24 

Mr. Lila also indicated that there were alternatives designed for the Nanni Weir in the so called “DOL 
Werken (klein)” from 1989. These were the simplified works for Distribution, intake and retention as 
compared to the original DOL works.  
Furthermore, discussions in the past were also to increase the pump capacity at Wakay from 30 to 50 
m3/s. 
 
It was discussed with Mr Lila to provide the following data (if possible within 2 weeks): Historical (long 
range) water levels (swamp, rivers, canals), rain fall data, flow discharge measurements, levels of dams 
and canals (measured in the recent past) and copies / scans of relevant reports.  
OWMCP is in charge and maintains the Corantijn Canal, Wakay pumps and inlet/outlet structures along 
the Corantijn Canal.  They furthermore conduct water level measurements and other management tasks as 
provided in the state decree for OWMCP. All levels (divers) are regularly checked to see if the NSP 
levels are correct. 
 
Mr. Sanjay Triloki, from OWT&C drainage department in Nickerie, joined the site visit and provided 
valuable information about the operation of the several structures. OWT&C is in charge of operating and 
maintaining all main inlets and outlets, such as Van Wouw, Nanni and IKUGH. The swamp retention 
dam was rehabilitated in 2016/2017 and is now in most sections at sufficient height. Only smaller parts, 
e.g. along Corantijn Canal, may not be at sufficient height (info from Mr. Lila).  
Mr. Tiloki emphasized to look at structures that would be able to work under different water level 
conditions. The current inlet and outlet main structures are more than 40 years old and need some proper 
rehabilitation.  
His view is that it may be cheaper to construct an inlet 
near halfway Suriname Canal (after the Lateral Canal) 
than to reinforce the Swamp Retention Dam over a 
length of over 30 km. He noted that the Suriname Canal 
is linked with Nanni Swamp through several 
channels/drains. This was confirmed during the site 
visit (see picture). 
Also the Nanni Swamp has always water, but due to 
low water levels during dry seasons, intake for 
irrigation can not be done under gravity. Farmers in the 
north of the swamp often use their own pumps to take water from the Suriname Canal for irrigation. 
 
Mr. Triloki mentioned that it takes lots of efforts to keep the lengthy canals clean. The Suriname Canal 
between IKUGH and Maratakka is only partially clean.  
He also indicated that regular maintenance in the far past was conducted by a pontoon with an excavator 
or draglines on it. This pontoon was operated continuously for all canals, including Nanni Creek up to the 
Nanni lake/reservoir further south. This way sufficient water was released through the Nanni Creek, even 
in dry periods. At the moment, the Nanni Creek is not maintained due to lack of accessibility and high 
costs for special swamp excavator equipment. The creek has a reduced discharge capacity. 
 
A meeting was held on 14th March 2018 with Mr. Martin Smith, another consultant in this project. The 
site visit data and initial findings until date were exchanged with him. Furthermore, the overall objectives 
and base set up of this project were discussed. It was understood that Mr. Smith would focus on the Water 
Board rehabilitation works and other related activities to improve the efficiency of water use and 
management.

4 Assessment of Existing structures 
 
The following existing structures or areas have been visited for inspection and assessment of current 
condition.  

1) Nanni Spillway 
2) Van Wouw Intake structure 
3) HA Intake Structure 
4) IKUGH Inlet structure 
5) Swamp Retention dam (Stondansi canal, Lateral canal) 
6) Surinam Canal 
7) Corantijn Canal/dam (only section near Nanni Weir location) 
8) Maratakka Spillway area (end of Surinam  Canal/link to Maratakka River) 

 
Field topographic surveys and measurements have been conducted as and where possible. 
 

4.1 Existing structures near Nanni Weir and IKUGH 
 
The existing structures: Nanni Spillway, Van Wouw Intake, HA Inlet and IKUGH inlet have been 
inspected and their conditions have been checked. This general assessment was to understand if the 
existing structures would fit within the main infrastructure system for water supply and if rehabilitation 
would suffice to be included in the main system or new structures would be needed. The results are 
presented in a separate report in Appendix III.  
 
Note: the further detailed investigation and related rehabilitation works and costs are conducted through a 
separate consultancy activity of the IDB and are not part of the scope of this Report. 
 
Also, the report includes some cross sections of the Swamp Retention dam (between Stondansi and 
Surinam Canal) and Surinam Canal with levels. It appears that the Swamp Retention dam has an average 
crest level of about NSP +4.0 m. This implies that the further increase to the required NSP +4.45 m would 
only need a clay backfill of average 55-60 cm (considering some settlements) and hence would probably 
not involve a major risk of instability (sliding of slopes) of the dam. Also the dam has already been 
constructed for over 30 years, so the sub-soil is most probably stabilized over time. 
 
The Swamp Retention dam along Lateral Canal could not be measured due to inaccessibility (canal was 
overgrown).  However, from field check near IKUGH it was observed that the crest level of this dam is 
more or less at similar elevation as the dam along Stondansi Canal. 
 
The embankment dam between the Surinam Canal and Nanni Swamp is at approx. NSP +2.20 m in the 
section along the Stondansi Canal. It is assumed that the level of the swamp embankment in the section 
along the Lateral Canal is more or less the same. This embankment would be prone to instability if the 
dam needs to be raised with 1 to 2 meters. 
 

4.2 Corantijn Canal swamp retention dam 
The Corantijn Canal, including side embankments, has been rehabilitated about 10 years ago. The crest 
level of the swamp retention dam is reportedly at sufficient elevation. Some spots show settlements and 
may require some maintenance. OWMCP carries out regular inspections and repairs when possible. 
 
The Corantijn Canal flows uncontrolled into the swamp area and Surinam Canal near the Nanni Spillway. 
This open section is about 350 m long. The swamp retention dam needs to be continued along this section 
with a crest level at NSP +4.45 m, in order to have a controlled conveyance of water from the Corantijn 
Canal to the agricultural areas. The existing open water area near Nanni Spillway and the future Nanni 
Weir can be further excavated to create a pond area from where water can be distributed to different 
directions.  



   

Intermediate Report- Feasibility Nanni Weir and Maratakka Spillway- v2- May 28th, 2018 Page 9 of 24 

The dam can be constructed on the existing embankment with the Nanni Swamp using clay from the 
canal and pond. 
 

4.3 Area near Maratakka Spillway 
 
The proposed Maratakka Spillway location was difficult to access. It is located at the end of Surinam 
Canal and the beginning of the linkage to the Maratakka River and the access from the Surinam Canal 
was practically impossible due to the heavy overgrown canal. The linkage canal was partially (1.5 km) 
accessible by boat. Further travel had to be by walking on the old northern dam along this canal. 
There are no known benchmark levels nearby, so the water level at IKUGH (30 km distance) was used to 
estimate the approximate levels in NSP (National chart datum) in the Surinam Canal at Maratakka. The 
elevation levels at this location may therefore have a +/- 15 to 20% deviation.  
 
The cross section measurements are shown in Appendix IV. 

Surinam Canal end part near Maratakka  
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Link canal to Maratakka River (overgrown)  View from end dam Surinam Canal 
 
The crest level of the Swamp Retention dam (north) along Surinam Canal and at the end is about NSP 
+4.0 m. This means that the spillway structure will require some excavation of the end dam to lower the 
level. 
It is expected that a sand ridge (also referred to as Cupido ridge) goes further to the south and parallel to 
the Surinam Canal. The top of this sand ridge is unknown, but from previous estimates (Environmental 
studies 2007 and hydrological studies 1977) it is assumed that the top varies between NSP +3 and +4 m. 
It is likely that the end dam at Surinam Canal is connected to the sand ridge, and thus blocking or 
reducing free flows from the swamp to the link canal (towards Maratakka River).

5 Alternatives for water distribution from Corantijn Canal 
 
This section contains an assessment of two alternatives to distribute the water from Corantijn Canal to the 
agricultural areas. During dry seasons water levels in the Nanni Swamp gets below the required level of 
NSP + 2.50 m to distribute water under gravity into the agricultural areas. At this level, the pumps at 
Wakay start operating and fill up the Corantijn Canal (source: OWMCP). 
 
There are two options to distribute the Corantijn Canal water to the agricultural areas in Eastern and 
Western polders (up to Lateral Canal 1). See Appendix V. 

1) Option 1: the water is distributed through the Stondansi Canal (about 3.75 km) and via a new 
connection (850 m) to the Lateral Canal 1 (about 7 km). 

2) Option 2: the water is distributed through the Surinam Canal (total 11.5 km) 
 

 
In both options it is assumed that the distribution of water will primarily focus on supply to the Eastern 
and Western Polders. The Autonomous Area will only receive water from Corantijn Canal if there is 
sufficient available. That means that a hydraulic structure (end control gate) is required in both options. 
 
Both options also require that the new Swamp Retention dam (approx. 350 m) between the existing dam 
of Corantijn Canal and the existing Swamp Retention dam at Stondansi / Surinam Canal.  
 
The Swamp Retention dam between Stondansi and Surinam Canal is about 4.5 km long and the Swamp 
Retention dam between Lateral and Surinam Canal has a length of about 7 km.

USD 500,000 

Total extra costs per option USD 2.13 M USD 2.09 M 
 
The costs for extra works in Option 1 are slightly higher than in Option 2. Given the level of costs 
assessment, this difference is considered negligible. 
 
However, Option 2 carries more risks than Option 1. In particular, the risks lie with the instable soil that 
is expected in the swamp area. The embankment between Surinam Canal and the Nanni Swamp will 
require a balanced work method to increase the crest level in small steps. Also, special swamp equipment 
will need to be used, as access over land is very limited. With the longer expected execution of works and 
input of special equipment, extra costs are likely to be faced.  
 
Another advantage of Option 1 is that all water flows (pumped and gravity) will be conveyed and 
controlled through one main supply canal. This may have benefits when measuring and control devices 
will be linked together for improved and efficient operation. 
 
 
It is recommended to continue with Option 1 for further implementation. This option is also the same as 
recommended in previous studies.

6 Rationale for Nanni Weir and Maratakka Spillway 
 
 
Improved main infrastructure for Irrigation: the Nanni Weir 

The Multipurpose Corantijn Project (MCP) initiated in 1981 was never completed due to shortage of 
funds. The construction of the Nanni Weir and related structures was the major and essential hydraulic 
structure never completed. 
 
The proposed Nanni Weir structure consists of several works combined: 

1) Construction of the Nanni Sluice/weir structure: this is a sluice concrete structure with 2 gates, 
adjacent steel sheet piles as retaining structures, inlet weed control mechanism and mechanical 
hinges to lift the doors. 

2) Embankment Swamp retention dam between Corantijn Canal and Stondansi Canal. This is to 
close the gap between Corantijn Canal and Nanni Swamp, and at the same time create a basin to 
distribute the water from Nanni swamp properly. 

3) Connect Stondansi Canal to Lateral Canal (Eastern area) and construction of an end/control 
structure. 

 
The Nanni Weir including closing dam and structure is primarily meant to ensure sufficient water supply 
to the polders during dry seasons, when the water level in the Nanni Swamp gets lower than NSP +2.5 m 
and gravity supply is not possible anymore. 
 
In addition to these works, other related works are required: increase crest level (to NSP +4.45 m) of the 
Swamp Retention dam along Stondansi and Lateral Canal, rehabilitation of the Nanni Spill Way, 
rehabilitation of Nanni Creek, rehabilitation of the Van Wouw Intake, construction of a new Intake at HA 
and rehabilitation of IKUGH inlet. 
 
It is noted that more structures have been proposed in the original MCP, but these aimed at full water 
supply for a larger projected irrigation area. These other structures will be needed when those areas are to 
be developed for rice cultivation in the future. 
 
The key advantages for the Nanni Weir structure are: 

1) The pumped water from Wakay through Corantijn Canal will be conveyed directly to the Western 
and Eastern Polders. Having such a closed circuit of transport of pumped irrigation water is much 
better to control and to avoid waste of water resources. The flows and water levels can be 
controlled for all agricultural areas linked to the main system, i.e. MCP, Western Polder, Easter 
Polder and Autonomous Area. 

2) Currently, the pumped water is dispersed into the Nanni Swamp through the open connection at 
the proposed Nanni Weir. This means that the pumped water first fills up the swamp area along 
the Surinam Canal, and only is usable when the level reaches to a sufficient level (NSP +2.50 m) 
for gravity supply into the irrigation canals of the Western and Easter Polder areas and 
Autonomous area. The small scale farmers do not have own pumping systems, and need to wait 
some time before they are supplied with water. During this delayed availability of water, they are 
faced with the risks of loss of crops and income: too long time waiting or weed on field, getting 
less water due to forced abstraction by large farmers (e.g. Autonomous area) and less yield/ha. 

3) The pumped water from Corantijn River (Wakay) is expensive as compared to the water in the 
Nanni Swamp. It requires fuel and expensive annual maintenance of pumps. Furthermore, at the 
current stage pumping has to be continued until sufficient water level is reached in Nanni to 
ensure gravity flow. That means often more pumping then strictly is needed for the irrigation 
capacity. Surplus of pumped water not used for irrigation is then discharged through the Nanni 
Spillway to the Corantijn River. This means relative expensive water (per m3 or per ha) is 
wasted.  

4) It is expected that less pumped water will be needed to supply the area with the required amount 
under the current demand. The areas with less than 2 crops per years may be able to increase their 
crops and yields as well. 



   

Intermediate Report- Feasibility Nanni Weir and Maratakka Spillway- v2- May 28th, 2018 Page 14 of 24 

5) A controlled distribution of water will also enable the OWMCP to release water as needed in 
each section/area. They intend to introduce a “water calendar” to distribute water as scheduled. 
This will minimize the pumping requirements due to much lesser losses. 

6) The controlled discharge or release of water per section will also make it easier to introduce 
properly measured water fees for each area separately. At this moment, it is understood that 
payment of fees for O&M of the main structure is not introduced due to lack of trust by the 
farmers that they get what they pay for. 

 
The Maratakka Spillway 
 
The Maratakka Spillway and related link canal to the Maratakka River was one of two major and essential 
water control structures that were never completed. Currently, the emergency spills are only located in the 
western part of the Nanni Swamp, with Nanni Spillway (about 25 m3/s) as the main release structure. The 
capacity of the Nanni Spillway is often reduced to about 11 m3/s due to small discharge capacity of the 
Nanni Creek, encroachment on the creek banks with low dam level and high tide in Corantijn River. 
Two small (inlet) structures are located in the southern parts of the Corantijn Canal and can function also 
as spill. 
 
The Maratakka Spillway is located in the north-eastern part of the Swamp at the end of the Suriname 
canal and will allow the accelerated evacuation of floodwaters (during rainy seasons) from the northern 
part of the Nanni swamp. 
The proposed structure is a concrete broad crested weir at fixed top level (NSP +3.65 m), with an 
estimated capacity of at least 15 m3/s. At this stage, it is recommended to only construct the emergency 
spillway. In the future, the spillway structure may be extended with a sluice to release a minimum of 5 
m3/s during dry weather conditions. 
 
The key advantages for the Maratakka Spillway structure are: 

1) The Maratakka Spillway alleviates greatly the present potential flood hazards during rainy 
seasons. Any flooding of the agricultural areas will directly result in loss of crops and income. 

2) The risks are reduced not due to extra spill capacity but also by locating the spillway at the 
opposite site of the Nanni spillway. Both structures can work independently, just in case of non-
functioning of either structure. 

3) The costs for the Maratakka Spillway are much less then to improve the Nanni Creek to its full 
capacity (if deemed feasible under the current conditions). The measures for Nanni Creek 
upgrading may be costly or not be feasible to the full extend, e.g. due to land ownership issues 
and regular siltation of the creek bottom and outflow area at the river. 

4) The Maratakka Spillway will increase fresh water supply to the Nickerie River through the 
Maratakka River, and contribute to pushing back the salt water intrusion. This will enable more 
production due to increased irrigation at the right bank of the Nickerie River. It is noted that the 
pumping station at Wageningen is currently under rehabilitation. This will allow pumping more 
fresh water during high tide (when salt water intrusion is expected to reach furthest in the river). 
However, further studies for the salt water intrusion assessment, including hydrologic modeling, 
is required to justify large investments in just adding extra fresh water flows into the Nickerie 
River. 

5) The extra spill way, together with the new Nanni Weir and dam, will enable OWMCP to keep the 
water levels in the northern part of the swamp more controlled and evenly distributed over the 
east-west section. This is expected to be better for the flora and fauna.

7 Preliminary designs and cost estimates 
 
This section contains the schematic designs and cost estimates for the Nanni Weir and related structures, 
as well as the Maratakka Spillway. It is noted that the designs are at schematic/ preliminary level, which 
entails certain margins for unknown conditions such as geotechnical properties of the soil and 
topographic levels. Further assessments are being conducted to fine tune the designs and costs where 
possible. 
It is noted that detailed designs and engineers cost estimate are to be carried out during the 
implementation of the Program. 
 
The following key data for designs have been abstracted from the previous studies and reports. No major 
changes are foreseen at this stage, as most of the starting points used in the earlier designs are still 
applicable. Some of the capacities are higher than actually required at this stage of development in the 
polders. However, the structures are for a design life of at least 30-35 years and may need the capacity in 
the near future. 
It is noted that certain water use efficiency is envisaged at the individual farmers. This can be by grading 
the terrains, using different crop techniques using less water and re-using water where possible.  
 
Water supply: 
Wakay pump:   30 m3/s. 
Capacity Nanni Weir: 17 m3/s, between NSP +2.5 and NSP +3.30 m. Concrete wall and crest level at 

sides at NSP +4.45 m. 
Stondansi Canal: 31 m3/s (increase capacity, reduce hydraulic losses) 
Van Wouw Intake: maintain capacity; Crest of concrete walls and side dams to be increased to NSP 

+4.45 m. 
Optional: demolish existing intake and build new inlet (12.5 m3/s) further 
upstream in Van Wouw Canal. This option is  

IKUGH Intake: maintain capacity. Crest of concrete walls and side dams to be increased to NSP 
+4.45 m.  

HA Inlet:  new inlet with 2.5 m3/s capacity. 
 
 
Spillways and flood control: 
Swamp Retention dam: raise to NSP +4.45 m (along Stondansi and Lateral 1 Canal) 
Nanni Spillway:  maintain at 20-25 m3/s. Increase crest level at sides to NSP +4.45 m. 
Maratakka Spillway: 15 m3/s. Crest level at NSP +3.65 m.  Crest level at side dams to NSP +4.45 m. 
 
 
Schematic designs for the key structures have been presented in the EU OWMCP Masterplan. See 
Appendix VI for overview of the schematic designs. 
 
In principle these designs can be maintained. For these structures some recommend improvements have 
been included in this report. Reference is made to the Appendix III.

Cost estimates: 
 
Cost estimates for the works have been prepared using Bills of Quantities and unit rates of existing 
similar infrastructure works or prices from other sources (like contractors, suppliers, etc). An attempt has 
been made to determine costs within a margin of 10-15%.  
It is noted that the cost estimates depends on assumptions of soil/geotechnical conditions, availability of 
source of material and accessibility for equipment. Furthermore, it is assumed that works will be 
combined as much as practically possible in one contract, so that contractor’s overhead and other costs 
can be minimized. 
 
The total estimated costs for the new main infrastructure works are about USD 5.1 Million, excluding 
turn over taxes. 

 
 
In addition to the costs of the Works, 10-15% has to be added for Project/Contract Management, detailed 
topographic surveys, soil investigations, detailed designs and Construction supervision. 
 
It is noted that rehabilitation of important existing main structures, Nanni Spillway, Nanni Creek, Van 
Wouw Intake and IKUGH Intake, are direly needed for an improved overall main water supply 
infrastructure. The costs for rehabilitation of these structures are not part of this document, and are 
assumed to be covered by other means.

1.  General/ Project area 

The project area consists of four hydraulic structures, namely the Van Wouw Intake, Nani Spillway, 
IKUGH (Integraal Kunstwerk Groot Henar) and HA Inlet Structure.  Field survey occurred in March 
and April 2018.  The structures have been assessed if they could be rehabilitated and used again as 
main structure. In addition some surveys and cross-sections have been carried out to assess the main 
dam and canal levels.

2. Van Wouw Intake Structure 

2.1 Structure assessment 
 
The Van Wouw Intake Structure consists of two gates of steel with a lifting tower and two hinged 
trash racks. The inflow side is at the Corantijn Canal whereas the outflow side of this structure is at 
the Van Wouw Canal.  

Steel sheet piles 
 
Several steel sheet piles at both the inflow and outflow side 
of the Van Wouw Intake Structure are heavily corroded.  
 
Proposed works: 
- Replace only steel sheet piles that are corroded, and give 
the piles the necessary coating 
- Replace all steel sheet piles, and give the piles the 
necessary coating 
 

Concrete 
 
At several locations both on the inflow and outflow side of the structure, steel reinforcement is shown 
due to concrete decay. 
 
Proposed works: 
- Replace pile cap at the inflow side 

 

Wooden sheet piles 
 
At the outflow side of the structure wooden sheet piles are anchored to land. Several of these piles are 
rotten and broken. There is also heavy erosion seen. Geo-textile is placed between wooden piles and 
land to prevent further erosion.   
Proposed works: 
- Replace wooden piles with new one 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 



 
Assessment Hydraulic Works OWMCP- April 2018   4 

 

Trash racks 
 
There are two trash racks. At some sections the racks are also 
corroded. The racks are hinged, but there is no control system.   
 
Proposed works: 
- Replace current trash racks with new ones of aluminum  
- New control system for trash racks 
- Equipment to clean racks 
 

Steel gates 
 
There are two sliding gates that show corrosion at several locations. Both of the gates are being 
operated manually with a hoisting system. Each gate has two pulley systems, yet only one gate has a 
hoisting system that is connected.  
 
Proposed works: 
- Replace current steel gates with new ones made of lighter material (e.g. aluminum)   
- Give the gates the necessary coating  
- Replacing current rebates (grooves) with new ones including Teflon 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

Hoisting mechanism 
 
There are currently 4 systems with a maximum of 5 ton. Only 1 mechanism is connected to a gate, 
two of the mechanisms are not connected and 1 hoisting system has no mechanism. 
 
Proposed works: 
- Replace the complete hoisting system with new system  
- Give the gates the necessary coating 
 
The structure should be adapted to the reservoir level of NSP 4.45 
 
The structure should be passable for floating maintenance equipment and boats.  
 
 
  



 
Assessment Hydraulic Works OWMCP- April 2018   5 

3. Nanni Spillway 
 
The main function of this structure is the need to regulate the water level in the Nani-reservoir.  

3.1 Structure assessment 
 
Inflow/outflow side 
 
At both outflow and inflow side of the spillway steel sheet piles show heavily corrosion.  
 
Proposed works: 
- Replace current steel piles with new ones (Incl. necessary coating) 
- Instead of replacing the steel sheet piles, fill the area with rip rap  
 

 
 

Sliding gates 
 
The Nani Spillway consists of three wooden gates. These gates are manually opened without any 
hoisting mechanism. Steel profiles are used to keep the gates open. The gates are in rabbets made of 
steel.  
 
Proposed works: 
- Replace current sliding gates with aluminum doors 
- Control mechanism with complete new pulley system  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Erosion 
 
At some locations there is also erosion seen.  
 
Proposed works: 
- Fill erosion areas with ripe clay 

 Concrete structure 
This structure has minimal concrete decay.  
 



 
Assessment Hydraulic Works OWMCP- April 2018   6 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
Proposed works: 
- Applying concrete spray techniques to rectify concrete elements 
 
The spillway has to be adapted to embankment levels of NSP 4.45 and width of 4 m to allow 
equipment to drive up to the structure by the Corantijn Canal embankments. 
 
Currently there are no trash racks, these should be implemented.

Recommendation for approval

The Executive Board is invited to approve the recommendation for the proposed
financing to the Kingdom of Tonga for the Tonga Rural Innovation Project – Phase
II, as contained in paragraph 50.

Proposed loan and grant to the Kingdom of Tonga for the
Tonga Rural Innovation Project – Phase II (TRIP II)

I. Strategic context and rationale
A. Country and rural development and poverty context
1. The Kingdom of Tonga is a small Pacific Island country with a population of 103,036.

It covers a land area of 718 km2 comprising 170 islands spread over 700 km2 of
ocean. Both the severity and depth of poverty have increased significantly in the last
decade. The outer islands have experienced the sharpest increase in hardship. About
half of Tonga’s poor live in the rural areas of Tongatapu, the main island.

2. Some 85 per cent of the population resides in rural areas, with agriculture and
fisheries being the main livelihood activities. Rural communities rely on traditional
subsistence production systems of root crops for food security, employment and
income generation. Despite underlying resilience, there are a number of factors
seriously increasing rural peoples’ vulnerability, such as climate change and endemic
non-communicable disease from poor nutrition and diets. Rural populations are
declining. Outmigration and a lack of incentives for young people to remain in rural
areas are leading to farm labour shortages, an aging farmer population and vacant
land tax allotments. This has implications for staple food self-sufficiency in the longer
term and an imbalance in favour of imports.

3. Agriculture accounts for 18 per cent of GDP, 90 per cent of total exports (fisheries
and agriculture) and about 35 per cent of employment. In 2015, 86 per cent of
households were engaged in agriculture and about 70 per cent in fishing. Yet both
sectors have been stagnant since 2011. Much of Tonga’s productive agricultural land
is left uncultivated owing to limited interest in investing in the more isolated areas
due to low profitability. The formal private sector is dominated by services largely
determined by remittance levels, with limited growth potential and purchasing
power. Consequently, the underlying structural constraints on Tonga’s economic
performance, as well as recent global economic developments, have resulted in a
decline in real incomes for many households.

4. The country is heavily reliant on external finance (primarily development assistance)
and is one of the most remittance-dependent countries in the world. Remittance
inflows were equivalent to US$114 million in 2014 (World Bank 2014) and were sent
by about 30,000 migrants living abroad (United Nations Department of Economic
and Social Affairs [UN DESA] 2015). Almost all Tongan households rely on
remittances from overseas members for a significant proportion of their incomes.

5. Tonga has the world’s third highest level of risk from disasters, with the effects of
climate change increasing their frequency and intensity. Successive economic shocks
and continued outward migration, along with growing urbanization, continue to place
pressure on traditional and informal social protection systems and to increase the
vulnerability of poor people. Although remittances have reduced poverty, they have
also increased dependency and raised expectations for living standards that are now
difficult to satisfy within traditional Tongan communities.



EB 2017/LOT/P.7

B. Rationale and alignment with government priorities and
RB-COSOP

6. The Tonga Rural Innovation Project II (TRIP II) builds on the success of a first-phase
investment implemented from 2012 to 2017. TRIP I achieved significant results and
policy impact by improving the livelihoods of remote outer island communities
through enhanced community planning and delivery of improved public and private
goods and services. The second phase will scale up this approach nationally and
focus on building resilience to the effects of climate change and extreme weather
events.

7. TRIP II is aligned with the 2015-2025 Tonga Strategic Development Framework
(TSDF), the current Climate Change Policy, and the Tonga Agriculture-Sector Plan
(TASP). The project supports the TSDF’s outcome B – “a more inclusive, sustainable
and balanced urban and rural development across island groups.” The TSDF
recognizes that: (i) population dispersion across small islands presents challenges
for inclusive development through access to infrastructure and services; and
(ii) there is a need for an improved balance, and thus resource allocation, between
urban and rural development across the island groups. TRIP II will contribute to the
TASP’s goal of maximizing agriculture’s contribution to Tonga’s economic growth and
to food security and nutrition in the face of a changing global economy, climate
change and increased natural disasters.

8. TRIP II is fully aligned with the IFAD Strategic Framework 2016-2025, the Fund’s
strategy for Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and its Pacific Partnership
Approach, which aims to enable rural people on Pacific Islands to achieve food
security and sustainable, resilient livelihoods. TRIP II is also aligned with IFAD’s
country strategy note for Tonga.

II. Project description
A. Project area and target group
9. Project area. While TRIP I focused on the outer islands, TRIP II will have a national

focus, excluding only large urban communities and those with very few households.

10. Target group. The project targets poor women, men and youth living in rural
communities. TRIP II’s targeting strategy combines self-targeting with specific
operational measures that ensure inclusive and equitable processes. It has an
estimated target of 28,650 people in 5,190 households in 122 communities.

B. Project development objective
11. TRIP II aims to contribute to improved and resilient livelihoods for Tonga’s rural

population. Its development objective is to enable communities to plan and manage
resilient infrastructure and livelihood activities (including addressing food security
and nutrition).

C. Components/outcomes
12. Component 1. Community development aims to increase the resilience of

community infrastructure built to required standards. This is a continuation of TRIP
I’s component 1 (also community development), with the objective of covering the
whole country by the end of TRIP II. Subcomponent 1.1 will support preparation of
community development plans (CDPs) in target communities as the basis for
subcomponent 1.2. This second subcomponent will support development of resilient
community infrastructure based on CDPs, with activities focused on the construction,
operation and maintenance of priority small-scale economic infrastructure.

13. Component 2. Sustainable economic livelihoods aims to increase the resilience
of economic livelihoods through climate-smart, nutrition-sensitive agricultural
production systems. Subcomponent 2.1 will support the development of community
agricultural development plans (CADPs), which will include activities to address



EB 2017/LOT/P.7

3

climate change and the expressed wish of communities for support in improving
their economic livelihoods. Subcomponent 2.2 will support farmers engaged in
sustainable economic livelihoods through improved climate-resilient practices to:
(i) improve agroforestry-based food production systems on tax allotments1 and
demonstration farms; (ii) manage more productive homestead gardens; (iii) support
agroforestry production of raw materials for crafts; and (iv) construct weaving halls
for women.

14. Component 3. Project management and coordination aims to enhance project
management capacity for implementation and monitoring of project activities, with
the component’s key output being effective project management.

III. Project implementation
ApproachA.

15. The TRIP II theory of change is that enhanced community capacity for sustainable
infrastructure planning and development, when linked with investment in resilient
agricultural production systems, will contribute to improved, sustainable livelihoods
for vulnerable households. Building resilience to the effects of climate change and
improving household nutrition are implicit in this approach. The project pursues a
community development approach to expand economic livelihood opportunities
through a combination of empowerment and technical inputs, such as sustainable
resource management and targeted technical services. Project activities are
complementary and, when implemented by target communities, are sequenced to
create synergies for improved, sustainable and climate-smart economic livelihoods.
Building cohesive and united rural communities through component 1 activities
(planning and constructing resilient community infrastructure) will form a platform
on which to design and implement component 2 (sustainable economic livelihoods).

16. TRIP II builds on lessons learned during TRIP I, including: (i) avoiding complexity by
focusing on a few core constraints on agriculture and rural development;
(ii) enhancing component complementarity by focusing on common income-
generating activities combined with the use of targeting mechanisms;
(iii) strengthening and empowering rural communities for a greater influence on
policy, and for engagement with government planning and sector support processes
conducive to sustained community livelihood development; (iv) ensuring that
addressing vulnerability to climate change and to over- and undernutrition is
mainstreamed in all project activities; and (v) minimizing risk by adopting well
proven approaches.

B. Organizational framework
17. The project will adopt the same implementation arrangements that functioned

effectively under TRIP I, with some adjustments in targeting and approach based on
learning. The Ministry of Finance and National Planning (MFNP) will be the
representative of the borrower/recipient. The Mainstreaming of Rural Development
Innovation Tonga Trust (MORDI TT), a locally registered NGO that has been
implementing TRIP I through a memorandum of understanding with MFNP, will be
the lead project agency. It will report to MFNP, and a project advisory committee
(PAC) will be established to guide project implementation in areas of governance,
policy, networking with other organizations and the strategic project overview.
MORDI TT will establish a dedicated project management unit (PMU) to support
project implementation.

18. This arrangement is based on an assessment of MORDI TT’s implementation capacity
and an institutional review done in the design phase. The Trust’s implementation of
TRIP I has: (i) been cost-effective and cost-efficient; (ii) developed a credible
reputation with non-governmental and government agencies (mainstreaming of the

CDP planning process in national government planning processes) – evidenced by
the interest expressed by development partners in funding the priorities identified in
the CDPs; (iii) been instrumental in introducing the concept of CDPs;
(iv) spearheaded the use of town officers as local development agents; and
(v) demonstrated strong results after introducing a systematic process for
community-level planning and development implementation.

C. Planning, monitoring and evaluation, and learning and
knowledge management

19. Planning. Planning processes within TRIP II will be harmonized with the
government planning process and guided by the CDPs and CADPs developed at the
community level. The project manager, in consultation with town officers, will
prepare a draft annual workplan and budget (AWP/B), submit it to the MORDI TT
board for review and endorsement, and to the PAC for review. Draft AWP/Bs will
then be shared with MFNP and the Ministry of Agriculture, Food, Forests and
Fisheries (MAFFF), and finally submitted to IFAD for “no objection”.

20. Monitoring and evaluation (M&E). The M&E system will monitor physical and
financial progress, as well as progress towards project objectives, and will serve as a
key management tool. Inputs, outputs, process and outcomes will be monitored in
accordance with logical framework indicators based on the financial management
system, staff reports and surveys. Special studies will complement this information
through in-depth analysis of topics such as: (i) success factors in mobilizing and
motivating youth; and (ii) strategies for investing remittances in productive local
business opportunities. The PMU will collect baseline data in each targeted
community, in accordance with the guidelines of IFAD’s Results and Impact
Management System (RIMS). All data will be disaggregated by sex and age.

21. Knowledge management. Knowledge management includes: (i) ensuring
engagement with target communities and implementation partners; (ii) establishing
an M&E framework that provides information and analysis for management decision-
making against logical framework indicators and AWP/Bs; (iii) ensuring that
knowledge and results are documented and shared with all stakeholders; and
(iv) continuing the close relationship between MORDI TT and IFAD on a broad range
of knowledge management activities. An addition to TRIP II is the focus on building
partnerships with the objective of providing complete and timely information to key
stakeholders and partners.

D. Financial management, procurement and governance
22. Financial management. MFNP will be the representative of the borrower/recipient,

with responsibility for approving the AWP/B after endorsement by the PAC, and will
have overall accountability for the project, including fiduciary aspects. MORDI TT will
be responsible for day-to-day financial management activities, including accounting,
reporting and coordinating audit processes.

23. The inherent fiduciary risk is considered medium in Tonga. Project fiduciary risk was
also assessed as medium during design. Financial management performance was
judged to be moderately satisfactory by the latest supervision mission to TRIP I,
suggesting room for improvement. Financial audits during TRIP I implementation
have been consistently unqualified. However, some weaknesses were observed
during supervision regarding staff turnover, adherence to IFAD's requirements for
disbursement requests and procurement processes.

24. Measures to mitigate fiduciary risk in TRIP II will include: (i) retention of TRIP I
finance staff, subject to performance assessment; (ii) hiring of additional dedicated
finance and procurement staff; (iii) improvement of the existing TRIP I finance and
administration manual, with detailed accounting, procurement and documentation
management processes; (iv) an automated accounting system and associated
training (the current software used for TRIP I will be retained, subject to IFAD



EB 2017/LOT/P.7

assessment; alternatively, a new system may be procured at start-up); (v) interim
financial reporting submitted to MFNP and IFAD; (vi) periodic compliance audits by
the Office of the Auditor General, reported to MFNP and IFAD, and focused on
reviews of internal controls and procurement documentation; (vii) audit reports
provided to MFNP and IFAD; and (viii) quarterly internal audits by the Internal Audit
Office of MFNP.

25. The financial statements for TRIP II will be prepared by MORDI TT on a cash
accounting basis, supplemented as necessary by additional data so as to provide
minimum disclosures under international accounting standards.

26. Audit. Independent annual audits will be conducted by the Office of the Auditor
General or a private auditor in line with international auditing standards. The choice
of auditor will be determined within six months of effectiveness. IFAD's prior
experience regarding the quality and timeliness of audits by private auditors during
the implementation of TRIP I has been satisfactory.

27. Flow of funds. A designated account in United States dollars will be opened by
MFNP to receive the loan and grant funding from IFAD. A project account in local
currency will also be opened by MORDI TT to cover day-to-day transactions.

28. Procurement will be undertaken in accordance with national procurement rules and
regulations to the extent that these are consistent with IFAD’s Project Procurement
Guidelines. The Government of Tonga updated its public procurement regulations in
2015. As procurement capacity has been identified as a risk, additional specialist
human resources will be allocated to support efficient and effective procurement
execution.

29. Governance. Tonga has taken steps to improve the qualities of good governance,
accountability, transparency, anticorruption, security and rule of law. As a sign of
commitment, the Government is continuing with reform efforts made under the
Economic Public-Sector Reform Programme to improve the effective provision of
government services by focusing on three areas of public-sector management –
public administration, financial management and enterprise reform. To ensure
effective governance, the project will incorporate the following measures, to be
monitored through a good governance framework: (i) information transparency;
(ii) training and capacity-building; (iii) a complaint mechanism for community
members; (iv) enhanced supervision and monitoring; and (v) zero tolerance towards
fraud and corruption.

E. Supervision
30. TRIP II will be supervised by IFAD on a biannual basis to coincide with the

preparation of AWP/Bs and approval of withdrawal applications. A midterm review
will be undertaken at the end of the third project year. IFAD has strengthened its
presence in the Pacific Islands with a subregional coordinator based at UNDP in
Suva, Fiji. In addition, an IFAD country office has been established in Jakarta,
Indonesia, managed by an outposted country director with responsibility for the
Pacific Islands, allowing for more continuous follow-up and support.

IV. Project costs, financing and benefits
31. The financing gap of US$3.76 million may be sourced by subsequent performance-

based allocation system (PBAS) cycles (under financing terms to be determined and
subject to internal procedures and subsequent Executive Board approval) or through
cofinancing identified during implementation.

A. Project costs
32. The total project cost is estimated at US$10.91 million over a five-year

implementation period. Indicative component costs are detailed in table 1. Indicative
project costs by expenditure category and financier are provided in table 2. The total



EB 2017/LOT/P.7

6

cost includes physical and price contingencies, which amount to 4 per cent and
3 per cent of base costs, respectively.

33. Project costs have been calculated in prices current in Tonga as of June 2016. The
allowance for price contingencies (3 per cent) is related to projected international
and domestic inflation rates over the implementation period. It is based on projected
inflation for Tonga (Asian Development Bank, mid-2016) and internationally (World
Bank, Manufactures Unit Index (MUI) for G5 countries). Costs have been calculated
in Tongan pa’anga (T$) and United States dollars at an exchange rate of US$1.0 =
T$2.2.

34. Approximately 21 per cent of the total base cost has been allocated to component 1,
community development. Most of this is dedicated to CDPs and resilient community
infrastructure. Component 2, sustainable economic livelihoods, has been allocated
36 per cent of base costs, with most being allocated to supporting economic
livelihoods in the form of grants. Component 3, project management and
coordination, is estimated at 43 per cent of base costs and includes provision for
technical and policy support, monitoring, evaluation and knowledge activities, and
project staffing, with a significant government contribution for local government staff
assigned to the project. The IFAD loan and grant will collectively finance
25.2 per cent of component 3. To expedite early implementation, IFAD will finance
eligible start-up costs up to a limit of US$125,000.

B. Project financing
35. Tonga is classified as “yellow” under the Debt Sustainability Framework (DSF).

Accordingly, IFAD funding will be provided at 50 per cent in the form of a loan and
50 per cent in the form of a DSF grant. The total project cost of about
US$10.91 million will be financed by: IFAD, for a total amount of some US$3 million
(27.5 per cent of total cost), beneficiary contributions of US$1.43 million
(13 per cent of total cost) and a government contribution of US$2.73 million
(25 per cent of total cost). A financing gap of US$3.76 million may be funded by
subsequent PBAS cycles (under financing terms to be determined and subject to
internal procedures and subsequent Executive Board approval) or through
cofinancing identified during implementation.

C. Summary benefit and economic analysis
36. Benefits will derive from: (i) reduced loss of life, repair costs, and transport and

communication costs associated with new and improved climate-resilient
infrastructure; (ii) increased household incomes from agricultural (annual and
perennial crops) and craft production; (iii) improved community organization,
empowerment and quality of life in remote communities; and (iv) improved food
security and nutrition. The project benefits a total of 6,349 households or 35,538
beneficiaries.

37. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the project is 20 per cent and the net
present value at a discount rate of 12 per cent is US$8 million. Sensitivity analyses
were completed based on changes in costs and benefits (marginal change and
accrual of benefits over time). An increase in costs of up to 30 per cent decreases
the EIRR to 16 per cent – the same impact as delaying benefits by two years. An
increase in benefits of 20 per cent changes the EIRR to 22 per cent, while a decrease
in benefits of 20 per cent changes the EIRR to 17 per cent.

D. Sustainability
38. Sustainability of project benefits for TRIP I households was high. TRIP II will further

scale up improved and sustainable livelihoods of vulnerable rural communities by:
(i) assisting beneficiaries in community and household planning and prioritization
processes; (ii) involving beneficiaries in development, financing, operation and
maintenance of community economic infrastructure, and sustainable livelihood
investments; (iii) linking beneficiaries with markets, microfinance services and
improved farmer field schools and agricultural extension services; and
(iv) embedding participating and learning methods in CDPs, CADPs and government
processes and systems.

39. MORDI TT is an independent NGO that has acquired significant experience and
recognition through successful implementation of the first phase of the TRIP. The
fact that the Government has agreed to partner with civil society (and vice versa) to
deliver TRIP II remains innovative in the Tongan context. The project will ensure
that this relationship is developed further, so that, by completion, the capacity to
further support and develop Tonga’s rural sector is enhanced and embedded in
national systems.

E. Risk identification and mitigation
40. TRIP II is considered a relatively low-risk investment, as the design scales up a

proven approach to supporting the development of remote rural communities. Main
risks include: (i) remoteness, and transport and communication obstacles; (ii) lack
of finance for community economic infrastructure and sustainable livelihoods; (iii) a
declining population and migration of youth and able-bodied people; (iv) non-
conducive land tenure systems under which land and tax allotments are allocated to
elder male heirs and are often abandoned and unproductive; (v) climate change
impact, including extreme weather events; (vi) MORDI TT staff retention;
(vii) fiduciary risk relating to adherence to financial management and procurement
processes; and (viii) inability of MAFFF to fulfil its role of providing extension officers
for farmer field schools and related extension activities. Mitigation strategies have
been developed during the design and include: (i) realistically designed activities and
targets; (ii) specific targeting of income-generating activities; (iii) capacity-building
and awareness-raising; (iv) strengthened project management and collaboration
with relevant government agencies; and (v) financial management and procurement
arrangements to mitigate fiduciary risk.

V. Corporate considerations
Compliance with IFAD policiesA.

41. TRIP is fully aligned with the goals and objectives of the IFAD Strategic Framework
2016-2025, IFAD’s strategy for SIDS, and other relevant policies and strategies,
including those for targeting, gender equality and women’s empowerment, the
environment and natural resource management, and climate change. In addition,
TRIP II has developed an explicit scaling up pathway – an area of strategic
importance to IFAD.

Alignment and harmonizationB.
42. The project is aligned with a number of key policies and contributes to Government

priorities. Strategic partnerships between MORDI TT and various partners and
external service providers were integral to the success of TRIP I and will thus form
an integral part of TRIP II implementation, for example with: (i) the Pacific Risk
Resilience Programme, for support to introducing climate change and disaster risk
concepts into infrastructure planning; (ii) the private sector, for development and
testing of extension approaches; and (iii) the Food and Agriculture Organization of
the United Nations, to increase awareness of the impacts of climate change and
natural disasters on farming practices.

43. MORDI TT has also built strategic partnerships with a number of agencies and
organizations in Tonga, particularly with MFNP, which is responsible for development
planning, coordination and financing. TRIP II will promote partnerships with:
(i) MAFFF and the Ministries of Education and Women’s Affairs; Labour, Commerce,
Trade and Industries; and Training, Sports, Youth and Employment;
(ii) representatives of development partners (e.g. the Asian Development Bank and
World Bank; Australia and the New Zealand Aid Programme); and (iii)
representatives of the private sector (e.g. commercial vanilla and vegetable growers
and exporters) that work in rural development in Tonga. A feature of TRIP II will be
a strengthened and more formal partnership with MAFFF for the provision of farmer
extension services and tree seedlings, with the objective of developing extension
packages and good practice modules for national adoption and use by MAFFF and
others beyond the project. A close and ongoing partnership with the Ministry of
Internal Affairs, which employs cooperating town and district officers, will be
essential. These strategic partnerships, particularly those with the Ministries of
Education and Women’s Affairs and of Training, Sports, Youth and Employment will
ensure that TRIP II receives continuous strategic support and monitoring to further
social, economic and gender inclusion objectives.



EB 2017/LOT/P.7

Innovations and scaling upC.
44. The design of TRIP II promotes innovation in rural empowerment and livelihood

development, including: (i) impact on policy and local governance through
collaboration with the Ministry of Internal Affairs; (ii) identifying and implementing
strategic partnerships with, for example: (a) NGOs (Live & Learn Environmental
Education), the Pacific Risk Resilience Programme and the Tonga Business Enterprise
Centre; (iii) the negotiated partnership between the Government, IFAD and
MORDI TT, which has proven to be one of the most effective in the country; and
(iv) responding to challenges encountered in TRIP I’s component 2 with an
innovative smallholder package of: (a) farmer field schools for training and learning;
(b) short value-chain analysis to define local and import replacement markets;
(c) appropriately timed microfinance support from South Pacific Business
Development; (d) provision of farming inputs; and, importantly, (e) ensuring that
the designs of community infrastructure and livelihood development activities
contain interventions and responses that address the looming impact of climate
change and increased natural disasters.

45. Once TRIP II is completed, it is expected that 122 rural communities in Tonga will be
empowered with CDPs, which will be the basis of community development across all
island groups. In addition, about 60 rural communities will develop CADPs. These
powerful and community-embedded plans should thus form the basis for a further
scaling up of the TRIP II economic livelihoods initiative. A scaling up pathway has
been developed as part of project design.

Policy engagementD.
46. TRIP I achieved significant policy impact. TRIP II will continue to promote an

enabling environment for rural communities by addressing procedural and policy
issues that affect inclusive development, including through: (i) working with public
partners to integrate the development planning process into formal government
processes; (ii) establishing partnerships that support inclusion objectives (e.g. for
rural finance, nurseries and materials); (iii) piloting approaches tailored to the
specific constraints and resources of the Tongan community (e.g. using social media,
digital extension services and capture of remittance investment); and (iv) seeking
practical solutions to policy constraints, such as land legislation that reduces the
access of both women and younger siblings.

VI. Legal instruments and authority
47. A project financing agreement between the Kingdom of Tonga and IFAD will

constitute the legal instrument for extending the proposed financing to the
borrower/recipient. A copy of the negotiated financing agreement is attached as
appendix I.

48. The Kingdom of Tonga is empowered under its laws to receive financing from IFAD.

49. I am satisfied that the proposed financing will comply with the Agreement
Establishing IFAD and the Policies and Criteria for IFAD Financing.
