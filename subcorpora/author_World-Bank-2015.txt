Appraisal Review Decision 
(from Decision Note)

I. Project Context
Country Context
Economic growth and poverty reduction gains achieved over the last decade in Moldova have been 
fueled by strong remittance flows that triggered increased, import-served consumption. The decade-
long growth has not been accompanied by an increase in employment. On the contrary, total 
employment in Moldova declined by 27 percent over the period 2000-2010. Agriculture released 
most of the labor that found jobs through internal and external outward migration. Another 
macroeconomic negative resulting from a consumption-led growth model was the buildup of an 
alarming trade deficit. With the value of imports more than triple to that of exports, the trade gap 
has reached over 50 percent of GDP in 2008. The fallout from the global crisis of 2008, as well as 
the lingering crisis in Europe and the Russian Federation in 2014 (key migration labor destinations), 
exposed the fragility of this growth model. As remittances declined, domestic demand fell by 10 % 
and the real economy contracted by 6% in 2009. Moldova’s quick recovery from the crisis in 2010 
and 2011 has been again largely based on the restored supply of remitances, but also on increased

agricultural prices and growing exports. Remittance flows have not grown much in 2014, and are 
expected to stall in 2015 primarily due to the marked depreciation of the Russian Ruble, tighter 
labor migration controls and a slowing economy in the Russian Federation.  
 
The lessons from Moldova’s development pattern over the past decade, have underlined the critical 
need for a second engine of growth – the revival of exports. As Moldova’s working population 
declines, export-led growth needs to come from investment and improvements in productivity and 
competitiveness. The Government of Moldova recognizes the need for an investment- and export-
led engine of the growth based on on increased capital investments, innovation and 
competitiveness.  The National Development Strategy “Moldova 2020”, reinforces the 
Government's commitment to a development paradigm based on a dynamic model driven by 
domestic and foreign investment and export-oriented sectors. In addition, the Government's reforms 
in 2011-2014 focused on achieving closer trade integration with the European Union, which 
culminated in the conclusion of an Association Agreement between the Republic of Moldova and 
the European Union, complemented by a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement which 
came into effect on August 1, 2014. The latter, has brought about new and exciting opportunities 
for market diversification of the country's agro-food exports.

  

Sectoral and institutional Context
Recently, the country's shift to an export-led growth model has suffered a number of setbacks due 
to uncertainties with supply to the Russian market. Moldovan agricultural and food exports to the 
Russian Federation have been subject to various trade restrictions through 2013 and 2014 - starting 
with a ban on wines, followed by ban on meat and a nearly complete ban on fruits and vegetables, 
and canned goods. The most affected export items were wine, apples and plums. In 2013, prior to 
the bans, approximately thirty percent of the country's wine exports (valued at US$350 million), 
ninety three percent of apple exports (valued at US$43.7 million) and eighty percent of plum 
exports (valued at US$21.1) went to Russia.  The loss of the Russian Federation market represented 
a significant blow to horticulture in Moldova as there are few alternative markets for the agro-food 
produce, especially for apples and plums. There is very limited potential for meaningful import 
substitution. Moldovan imports of apples were only about 1,500 tons in 2013 (valued at US$1.34 
million) and imports of plums are negligible. Un-utilized processing capacity for apples and plums 
in the country is limited and has only absorbed additionally approximately 60,000 tons of apples 
and 40,000 tons of plums in 2014 (15% and 35% of output respectively). The resulting supply glut 
of apples and plums, compounded by an existing large stock of processed products has led to a 50% 
drop in the domestic market price for apples and plums. Similarly, as a result of the wine ban, and 
accumulating stocks in 2014, grapes are traded at 40% of the 2013 price.   
 
In recent years there have been significant productivity gains in the Moldovan horticulture sector 
due to significant investments and, these gains could easily be lost because of the impact of the 
Russian embargoes.  Productivity gains have contributed to a steady  increase in output and are 
likely to have come from stricter application of growing technologies, and/or replacement of old 
orchard/vineyards, more intensive production and use of modern technologies. This is a result of 
increased investment in the sector, which is a very positive development given Moldova’s 
comparative advantage in high value agriculture.  This transformation has been the result of a fairly 
long-drawn struggle, which is finally showing results. The embargos have the potential to have a 
major negative impact on fruit growers’ competitiveness by stalling, if not reversing, 
modernization, as a result of deteriorating financial standing and de-capitalization.   



Page 3 of 6

 
The majority of fruit growers is represented by small peasant farmers (66% for apples, 69% for 
plums, 70% for vineyards) and provides significant rural employment and incomes, for an 
estimated 350,000 people. A large share of these jobs now are either at risk or are yielding 
significantly lower pay due to the impact of the embargo. The resulting social consequences could 
be severe, as the highest poverty rates are already registered among the agriculture-related 
population: 21.7 percent of farmers and 31.3 percent of agricultural workers have been found poor 
in 2013, these two categories accounting for 31 percent of country's poor.

II. Proposed Development Objectives
A. Current Project Development Objectives – Parent
The Project Development Objective is to enhance the competitiveness of the agro-food sector by 
supporting the modernization of the food safety management system, facilitating market access for 
farmers, and mainstreaming agro-environmental and sustainable land management practices.

III. Project Description
Component Name
Compensatory Sales Support Grants
Comments (optional)
The new component will finance targeted support to farmers with farms of less than or equal to 15 
hectares, who sold apple, plums and grapes domestically for processing in 2014. The grants will 
compensate the difference between the potential non-embargo price and the domestic sales price, 
with an aim of avoiding possible de-capitalization and collapse of the horticulture sector, thus giving 
it a much needed respite for reorientation to new markets and/or amortization of the financial losses.

V. Implementation
The parent - Agriculture Competitiveness Project (ACP) was approved by the Board on May 1, 
2012. It is financed by (i) an IDA credit in the amount of US$18.0 million; (ii) a fully-blended GEF 
grant of US$4.4 million; and (iii) a SIDA grant of US$3.0 million. The PDO is: to enhance the 
competitiveness of the country's agro-food sector by supporting the modernization of the food safety 
management system, facilitating market access for farmers, and mainstreaming agro-environmental 
and sustainable land management practices. The ACP has the following components: Component 1: 
Enhancing Food Safety Management; Component 2: Enhancing market access potential; 
Component 3: Enhancing land productivity through sustainable land management. The project 



Page 4 of 6

became effective on September 24, 2012. The closing date for the ACP is June 30, 2017. 
 
The project was designed to contribute to the realization of the economic growth model described in 
the 2011-2014 Government Program aimed at enhancing export competitiveness, attracting 
investment and achieving closer trade integration with the EU. More specifically, the ACP is 
supporting the Government's ambitious efforts in reforming the food safety management system, 
efforts to improve farmers’ market opportunities through investment support (to bring about 
upgrades in post-harvesting infrastructure) and institutional development support (creation and 
strengthening of productive partnerships), and efforts to mainstream the use of good agricultural 
practices and sustainable land management.  
 
Project performance is currently rated “moderately satisfactory” for Implementation Progress (IP), 
“satisfactory” for the PDO, and “satisfactory” for procurement and financial management . Current 
commitments for the IDA credit stand at 70% , and generally progress continues to be solid across 
the project's three components at this phase of implementation.  Currently, disbursement under the 
IDA Credit is at US$3.6 million (20%), under the GEF grant at US$2.1 million (48%), and the 
SIDA grant at US$0.25 (8%). Disbursement rates under the IDA Credit are expected to reach 45% 
by the end of FY15. Procurement of goods, works and consulting services has considerably picked 
up in pace in 2014; calls for proposals for matching investment grants supporting the emergence of 
productive partnerships have been carried out and awards were made; capacity building activities 
have been increasing in scope and complexity. 
 
Component 1: Enhancing food safety management. There is solid progress in the implementation of 
this component. The country's Food Safety Agency, is a relatively new institution (established in 
2012) which has largely become functional due to the support of the project. Two major civil works 
activities are under way - the rehabilitation of the Food Safety Agency (FSA) building and the 
construction of the Border Inspection Point in Tudora on the country's Southern-Eastern border with 
Ukraine. Procurement of civil works for another three border inspection points - Leuseni (West), 
Giurgiulesti (South) and Criva (North) has been completed and works are expected to commence in 
the spring of 2015. Procurement of works for the construction of the country's national reference 
laboratory for safety of products of vegetable origin (Balti) has been completed. Capacity 
strengthening activities at the national reference laboratory for safety of products of animal origin 
and animal health aimed at future international accreditation are in full swing. Additionally, the FSA 
continues to receive support for legislative and regulatory improvements, capacity building 
activities, training and knowledge sharing with various European food safety institutions. 
 
Component 2: Enhancing market access potential. Progress in the implementation of this component 
has been very strong. One call for proposals for matching investment grants from emerging 
productive partnerships has been completed in the summer of 2014, and 8 producer groups received 
matching investment grant awards in an amount of US$2.1 million for a variety of investments in 
post-harvest processing of apples, table grapes and berries. A second call for proposals is currently 
under way until January 30, 2015. In parallel, outreach activities are under way to raise awareness 
about the project's opportunities for fruit and vegetable growers especially in light of on-going 
difficulties Moldovan agro-food exports have on the traditional Russian market, and a stringent need 
for reorientation of trade flows to different, more stable markets. 
 
Component 3: Enhancing land productivity through sustainable land management.  
Implementation of this component is progressing well. All activities related to the rehabilitation of 



Page 5 of 6

protective shelter-belts are on schedule, and the equipment which was procured for these purposes is 
being utilized efficiently by two mobile mechanized agro-forestry squads. The component's 
sustainable land managed grant scheme has been launched and a first call for proposals yielded 
more than 80 applications that are currently under review. It is expected that about 30 awards will be 
made in the next few weeks, for an amount of approximately US$0.6 million.

I. Project Context
Country Context
Lake Victoria, with a surface area of about 68,800 km2, is the second largest freshwater body in the 
world. It is a transboundary resource shared by Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. Rwanda and Burundi 
are a part of the upper watershed that drains into Lake Victoria through the Kagera river. Its 
catchment area of 194,000 km2 is shared by five countries: Burundi (7 percent), Kenya (22 
percent), Rwanda (11 percent), Tanzania (44 percent), and Uganda (16 percent). The Lake is also 
part of the Nile River basin system, shared by ten countries: Burundi, the Democratic Republic of 
Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Kenya, Rwanda, Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda. The population of

the Lake Victoria Basin (LVB) is about 35 million people, and it represents approximately 30 
percent of the total inhabitants of the East African Community (EAC) Partner States – Burundi, 
Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Kenya. 
 
Lake Victoria is a major population and poverty center in AFR, and a trans-boundary natural asset 
of global importance. The Basin is home to around a third of those below the poverty line in the 
East African Community, living on around a ninth of its land surface.  The Lake supports the 
world’s largest freshwater fishery, with a total annual landed catch value estimated at around US
$0.5 billion, supporting the livelihoods of 3 million people, providing roughly 0.5 million tons of 
fish to local markets and generating US$0.25 billion in export revenues. The establishment of the 
Nile Perch fishery in the 1980s and 1990s provided a resource boom that drew in poor and 
disadvantaged people from the neighboring countries. Large rural poor populations are also 
dependent on the degraded lands in the upper basin, particularly in Burundi, Rwanda and the Kenya 
highlands. In addition, the waters of the Lake and its catchment provide 90% of Uganda’s hydro 
power, most of the hydro power for Rwanda and Burundi, and the water supply to major urban 
centers including Kampala and Entebbe.  Protected areas cover 25% of the Basin’s land area and 
include some of the most renowned wildlife attractions in Africa – Serengeti and Volcanoes 
National Parks. 
 
The Lake Victoria Basin has also become a global example of environmental degradation. 
Historically, the introduction of the Nile Perch was associated with a mass extinction of native fish 
species, but Perch stocks have now themselves declined to probably less than half of their peak 
levels due to increased fishing efforts and other environmental stresses. Environmental degradation 
within the Basin increasingly poses broader threats to livelihoods and welfare. Erosion of soils has 
chronic impacts on agricultural productivity as well as acute impacts where gullies destroy land, 
property and even lives. The flow of sediments and other pollutants into the Basin’s rivers and 
ultimately the Lake reduces the supply of potable water, and causes algal blooms that are 
unpleasant for lakeshore communities and limit the tourism potential of the region. One of the most 
striking indicators of poor ecological health is the rapid colonization of the Lake by water hyacinth. 
Infestations of this invasive floating plant periodically block access to kilometers of lakeshore, 
preventing use of the Lake for transport and fishing, as well as posing serious health and safety 
risks to local inhabitants.  
 
LVEMP aims to tackle the environmental challenges of the Lake Victoria Basin over the long-term 
and basin-wide, to improve the welfare of its inhabitants. It was designed as a regional Series of 
Projects (formerly APL) with three envisioned phases and informed by the studies and lessons 
generated from the original Lake Victoria Environmental Management Project (LVEMP I), 
financed by the GEF and implemented from 1996 to 2005. APL-1 (now SOP-1), covering the three 
riparian states (Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda) as well as a regional coordination and policy 
component (through the EAC’s Lake Victoria Basin Commission, LVBC), is due to close at the end 
of FY15, having already received a 2-year extension. APL-2 (SOP-2), covering Rwanda and 
Burundi, started later and is due to close at the end of FY17. APL-3 (SOP-3) was envisaged to 
extend the program beyond the end of the first project of the series. 
 
The Additional Financing of the LVEMP is for implementation of additional or expanded activities 
that scale up the project’s impact, i.e. additional watershed management subprojects in existing 
focal areas, construction of sanitation and sewerage facilities that were designed but not 
implemented under the original project due to funding constraints, and expansion and deepening of 



Page 3 of 6

cleaner production programs. The additional Additional financing Financing represents roughly 
20% of the original project financing, but is expected to increase most of the key quantitative 
results by around 30-40%. Under the Additional Financing Kenya and Tanzania will each receive 
US$10 million IDA credits, and a US$2 million IDA grant for regional activities under LVBC: 
Credit Nos 4530-TZ, 4531-UG, 4532-KE; GEF grant TF-94205, SIDA grant TF-95196). Pending 
donor approval, an additional grant of US$ 0.5 million from the Cooperation in International 
Waters in Africa trust fund is anticipated, of a total Additional Financing amount of US$ 22.5 
million.

  

Sectoral and institutional Context
The Lake Victoria and its ecosystems support a number of sectors important for economic and 
livelihood development in the Lake Victoria Basin: Fisheries - the Lake fishery contributes to the 
GDP of the riparian countries and provides employment for about 197,000 fishers and 
approximately 600,000 fish traders; Transport - the marine transport provided by the Lake is very 
important for supporting the trade and economic development of the LVB countries; Energy - the 
Lake is the source of hydropower in Uganda generating power exceeding a value of US$350 
million per annum; Water - Approximately five million people living in the major cities and towns 
around the Lake, depend on Lake Victoria for their domestic and industrial water supply.  
 
Governance of the Lake occurs at the regional scale through the East African Community and Lake 
Victoria Basin Commission (LVBC) under the auspices of the Protocol on Sustainable 
Development of the Lake Victoria Basin, and at the national scale by the country governments of 
the LVB through implementation of respective national strategies. Accordingly, the project 
implementation arrangements are based on a two-prong institutional set up provided in the Protocol 
on the Sustainable Development of the LVB, i.e. at the EAC/regional and at national levels. 
 
The Regional Policy Steering Committee (RPSC) - comprising permanent secretaries of various 
line ministries - serves as the EAC coordination committee for LVEMP II (and other regional 
projects in the Basin), and the LVBC serves as the secretariat for the RPSC. National Policy 
Steering Committees (NPSCs) are responsible for the sectoral coordination at the national level and 
for providing operational policy guidance in each country. National Focal Point Ministries 
(NFPMs) in each of the LVB countries serve as the secretariat for the NPSCs. NFPMs are 
accountable for the overall project implementation, which is carried out by National Project 
Coordination Teams in partnership with multiple key ministries and local government authorities.

II. Proposed Development Objectives
A. Current Project Development Objectives – Parent
The objectives of the Project are to contribute to: (i) the improvement of the collaborative 
management of the trans-boundarynatural resources of the LVB among the Partner States; and (ii) 
the improvement of environmental management of targeted pollutionhotspots and selected degraded 
sub-catchments for the benefit of communities who depend on the natural resources of LVB.

III. Project Description
Component Name



Page 4 of 6

Strengthening institutional capacity for managing shared water and fisheries resources
Comments (optional)
Activities under this component will focus on strengthening the existing institutions to improve the 
cooperative management of shared transboundary natural resources of the LVB. Its objectives are 
to: (i) improve the effectiveness of key regional and national institutions through harmonization of 
national policies, legislation, and standards; (ii) develop options for sustainable financing of the 
natural resources management interventions; and (iii) develop regional frameworks for the 
management of key transboundary natural resources – water and fisheries. The focus here is on 
capacity building of the regional, national, and local institutions responsible for coordination, 
research, management of resources, and enforcement of environmental standards.

Component Name
Point source pollution control and prevention
Comments (optional)
The main objective of this component is to reduce environmental stresses within the Lake and 
littoral zone, through the implementation of mitigation and prevention measures. It will finance 
investments aimed at reducing point sources of pollution in priority hotspots, identified during 
LVEMP I. These investments will complement on-going activities supported by other Bank-funded 
projects in water and sanitation. Major activities include (i) rehabilitation and improvement of 
wastewater treatment facilities; (ii) promotion of cleaner production technologies; and (iii) pollution 
risk management and safety of navigation.

Component Name
Watershed management
Comments (optional)
This component seeks to reduce environmental stresses from the Lake basin, through the 
implementation of non-point sources pollution mitigation and prevention measures. The reduction of 
the non-point sources of pollution (sediment loads, nutrients, and agro-chemicals) by scaling up 
successful models of watershed management practices piloted under LVEMP I and other related 
national projects will improve water-use efficiency, and generate positive downstream externalities. 
Watershed management is being implemented through community-driven investments as a means of 
scaling up management efforts, and also building capacity and ownership at the local level for 
watershed management.

Component Name
Project coordination and management
Comments (optional)
This component will provide resources necessary for the effective coordination and communication, 
and monitoring and evaluation of the project activities. At the regional level, these tasks will be 
carried out by the RPCT mainstreamed in the LVBC, while at the national level they will be the 
responsibility of the National Project Coordination Teams (NPCTs). Activities under this 
component are divided into (i) project coordination and communication; and (ii) monitoring and 
evaluation.

I. Introduction and Context
Country Context
1. Burundi is a post-conflict, landlocked, small country with an estimated population in 2013 
of nearly 10.20 million increasing at a rate of 3 percent annually. After more than 13 years of 
conflict, Burundi is now showing positive signs of economic recovery. Over the last 5 years, the 
annual GDP growth in Burundi has consistently remained around 4%. Despite these positive signs, 
the country is unlikely to meet the Millennium Development Goals 2015: (a) the human capital base 
is weak due to limited access to social services; (b) a large majority of youths are under-employed 
because of lack of opportunities; (c) less than 3 percent of the population has access to electricity; 
(d) 52 per cent of children under five are chronically malnourished; and (e) 67 percent of 
Burundians are living below the poverty line. Poverty is overwhelmingly rural and most of the

country’s poor are small-scale farmers. These data explain why Burundi finds itself at the bottom of 
the list of countries for most development indicators. According to the Human Development Index, 
Burundi is ranked 178 out of 186 countries . 
 
2. Following substantial improvement in security and peace consolidation, the Government 
focused its resources to expand basic social services in the country and initiated the modernization 
of existing economic infrastructure and institutions. The Government launched also key reforms 
addressing improved governance, public finance management system, business environment and 
investment climate, etc., which led to the country achieving considerable progress towards macro-
economic stabilization. These efforts have been recognized by the World Bank which in its reports 
“Ease of Doing Business”, ranked Burundi as one of the world’s top economic reformers for 
streamlining business and attracting foreign investment. Nonetheless, Burundi has still to address 
major challenges in terms of good governance, vulnerability to external shocks, diversifying the 
economy, and generating productive employment for its largely young population. 
 
3. The Government of Burundi’s second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP II, 
2012-2015) and the joint International Finance Corporation (IFC)-World Bank Business Plan have 
identified potential growth sectors. The focus is rightly put on modernizing the agricultural sector 
since it accounts for nearly 41 percent of the GDP and about 90 percent of current labor force. 
Burundi’s main traditional export crop - coffee has been identified as a key sub-sector with high 
growth potential which can contribute to achieving the results of the PRSP - Pillar II “Transforming 
Burundi’s economy to generate sustainable, job-creating growth”. Other sub-sectors with potential 
growth identified are tea, cotton and cinchona. Furthermore, as part of it PRSP, the Government 
plans to support corps diversification by promoting nontraditional agricultural exports, including 
horticultural products, essential oils, medicinal plants, avocados, and macadamia nuts.

Sectoral and Institutional Context
4. Burundi has all of the factors which make agricultural investment essential. The sector 
plays a key role in economic growth, poverty reduction, food security and employment. It 
contributes most to gross domestic product, using 90 per cent of Burundi’s labor force and earning 
90 percent of export revenues - primarily from coffee production, which constitutes the key source 
of income for more than 600,000 rural households (about 30 percent of the population).  Despite the 
country's dependence on the primary sector, agriculture has not been modernized and continues to 
depend essentially on subsistence agriculture (1.2 million rural households) using unreliable and 
inefficient technology. Over the past decade the growth rate of agricultural production (2 percent) 
has been less than the growth rate of the population (3.0 percent); which aggravates the country’s 
food security situation. 
 
5. The farms in Burundi are highly fragmented with an average size of less than 0.5 hectare 
and the pressure on the land is increasing due to demographic pressure . The farming systems are 
determined by weather cycles and organized around multiple crops to reduce risk. A comparison of 
crop yields in the country with those in neighboring regions shows that Burundi’s agriculture faces 
major productivity challenges. For example, over the period last years the growth rate in cereal 
productivity in the East African Community (EAC region) increased by 3.13 percent while it 
declined by 0.08 in Burundi. Various interlinked factors contribute to the low agriculture 
productivity in Burundi, for instance: degradation of natural ecosystems and declining soil fertility, 
low use of improved inputs (quality seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, etc.), low use of modern 
technologies, inadequate access to agriculture extension services, poor physical infrastructure

affecting market access and access to improved inputs, limited access to credit, marketing 
constraints and post-harvest losses among others. With the continued fragmentation and scarcity of 
agricultural land, future growth in agricultural production can only be generated from intensification 
and productivity gains. In addition, only market-oriented agriculture will allow rural households an 
adequate livelihood from their small plots, abundant labor, and relatively ample water resources. 
 
6. Burundi’s agricultural sector policy is articulated in its national agricultural strategy 
document adopted in 2008. The latter is based on the priorities identified in the country’s basic 
strategic documents, primarily Outlook 2025 and the Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs). 
Furthermore, with the support of the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program 
(CAADP), the Government of Burundi put forward a National Agricultural Investment Plan 
(NAIP), covering the period 2012-2017, which was fully integrated with the PRSP II. A top priority 
sub-sector identified within the NAIP for investment is coffee which plays a strategic role in the 
national economy as a source of foreign exchange earnings and incomes for a large number of rural 
households. The Burundi coffee value chain presents considerable potential for growth. Its impact 
extends to several other sectors through backward and forward linkages (inputs, processing, 
transport, financial services, and taxes) and therefore plays a key role in the country for jobs 
creation, food security and poverty reduction. 
 
7. The NAIP main focus are on: (a) the increase in crop and livestock production by raising 
productivity and ensuring optimal management of soil and water resources; and (b) the 
strengthening of human resources capacities of national institutions and farmers organizations. 
Other important elements of the NAIP address common issues such as land tenure and natural 
resources preservation, the development of infrastructure and measures related to agribusiness 
promotion and market access, including an improved investment climate and access to rural finance. 
For the coffee sub-sector, the focus is on increasing productivity associated with actions to promote 
quality, such as rejuvenating orchards, periodic field maintenance, farmers’ organization and 
restructuring and/or modernizing washing facilities through privatization and a niche marketing 
strategy. 
 
8. The NAIP is structured around four major programs as follows: (a) Sustainable growth in 
production and food security; (b) Professional training of farmers and promotion of innovation; (c) 
Development of value chains and agribusiness; and (d) Institution-building for public bodies. The 
NAIP is also promoting partnership between the public and private sectors in implementing its 
programs and achieving its objectives. This proposed project is particularly the type of financing 
which would be shared between the state and private operators, producers and investors. While the 
private sector is encouraged to increase investment in productive, industrial and marketing 
activities, the state needs to establish an environment favorable to the development of the sector. 
Efforts are being undertaken in this direction, for the coffee value chain – private operators are 
encouraged to be involved at several levels, notably at those of export, curing and de-pulping 
stations and roasting. Such initiative should be further promoted and expanded to establish 
sustainable public-private partnerships.  
 
9. The coffee sector: Coffee production is mostly a smallholder based activity with around 122 
million coffee trees and a production area of 70,000 hectares . The species grown is mainly the 
Arabica, though some Robusta is also planted. The average production of coffee cherries is 
estimated at about 164,800 tons and around 20,000 tons of green coffee  - of which about 70-80 
percent are fully washed. Average coffee cherries production per tree is about 1kg which is far

below the yields of 2.5 to 3.0kg observed in other coffee growing areas; for instance in Asia and 
Latin America. Registered production of green coffee  in Burundi in 1990/91 was 33,912 tons while 
observed figure in 2011/12 was about 15,000 tons. The highest pick was registered in 1994/95 with 
40,985 tons. The cyclical swing of seasons sometimes leaves the country with very limited 
quantities to export (5,673 tons in 2003/4).  
 
10. Despite the current low and declining productivity level of the coffee sector in Burundi, it 
continues to play a vital role in the country’s economy and represents the main industry and export 
product – accounting for up to 80 percent of the foreign currency earnings. During the harvest of 
raw and green coffee, the sector plays also a key role in stimulating the rural economy. The 
associated industry (de-pulping and washing stations) and traders inject an important sum of cash 
into rural areas which increases spending in purchase of goods for rural households, manufactured 
products, payment of social expenses, and reimbursement of credit. Furthermore, the construction of 
washing stations in rural areas led to a modest first stage of industrialization, off-farm jobs for local 
labor during the coffee campaign and, most importantly, the development of rural access roads to 
the washing stations which are also used for other purposes.  
 
11. The coffee industry was one of the priority sectors targeted for deregulation reforms and 
privatization in the structural adjustment program (initiated in 1986) that aimed to limit the state’s 
involvement in the productive sector. Due to the civil war and subsequent recovery challenges, this 
process (sector reform and privatization of state entities: OCIBU, SODECO and washing stations) 
experienced some delays. But it subsequently led to positive developments, among others: (a) the 
establishment of a new regulatory body (ARFIC) and an inter-professional association 
(INTERCAFE); and (b) an effective deregulation of de-pulping and export through the construction 
of new washing stations by private investors and SOGESTALs . 
 
12. Today, the government is eager to complete the process of privatization which consists of a 
3rd phase (some 77 washing stations and a mill firm) – although different actors of the value chain 
have different ideas about how this should be carried out. For instance, coffee farmer associations 
are determined to take part in the privatization and the emergence of these associations adds a 
politico-socio-economic dimension to the on-going reform process. Even if some of the competing 
interest groups are small, their diverse political, regional and even ethnic backgrounds prompt the 
coffee reform to be a central peace-building focus for Burundi. Important to note that a recent 
Poverty and Social Impact Assessment (PSIA) concluded that the earlier privatization (Phases I and 
II) had mostly a positive impact on the incomes and welfare of affected coffee producers. 
 
13. While several steps have been taken toward improving the performance of the Burundi 
coffee sector, it is currently experiencing serious instability and decline which cannot be explained 
by chance or climatic conditions alone. Some of the causes behind this situation: (a) Persistence of 
structural deficiencies, such as inefficiencies in the governance of the value chain. The institutions 
and the actors involved in the value chain are facing several constraints (incomplete reform and 
privatization process, lack of technical and managerial capacity for emerging farmers’ association, 
non-transparent pricing mechanisms, etc.) that hamper their operations and, consequently, limit the 
development of the coffee sector in Burundi; (b) Low productivity due to insufficient technical and 
financial support to farmers. Lack of investments in productivity enhancing technologies following 
the liberalization of the market resulted in low and highly fluctuating productions, poor maintenance 
and degradation of the orchards, low input application as well as pest and disease problems, etc.; (c) 
Limited competitiveness with a decrease in quantity and quality caused by the aging of orchards at

the farm level (28 percent are more than 30 years old and 62 percent are between 9 and 30 years), 
limited technical know-how moving downstream the chain to support quality improvements 
(milling, tasting, etc.); and inefficient marketing structures for promoting the Burundi brand; and (d) 
Primary production has also not kept pace with the expansion of processing capacity, leading to a 
situation in which all raw materials are competitively sought with little price differentiation. Many 
washing stations have experienced low profitability due to high operational costs (partly related to 
capacity underutilization) and management limitations.  
 
14. Under such circumstances it will be extremely difficult for Burundian coffee producers to 
be able to compete with the world coffee industry (or even maintain their competitiveness at the 
regional level). The resulting economic and social consequences are severe for Burundi. Despite 
these weaknesses, the coffee value chain in Burundi is not entirely without its strengths and 
therefore presents  some advantages which justify transformative investments in reversing current 
trends: (a) climate and altitude to produce specialty Arabica coffee that attracts premium world 
market prices; (b) opening of the sector to private investors; (c) local producers interested and 
experienced in growing coffee; (d) emerging farmer associations and private-led governance 
structures; (e) well-established processing infrastructure - washing stations and dry milling capacity 
to support increased production of high quality coffee; (f) increasing worldwide consumption with 
an average annual growth rate of 1.9 percent during the last 50 years and a high demand for 
specialty coffee in developed markets ; and (g) in term of the macro-economic situation of the 
country, Burundi is heavily depending on  coffee export proceeds that failure is not an option. Also, 
since coffee is a perennial and the land is already tied to it for the lifecycle of the tree, it is not 
readily easy to convert and diversify the production base. 
 
15. Against this background, the proposed World Bank project is supporting the Burundi 
Government in implementing its PRSP II and NAIP’s programs - enhancing the productivity and 
competitiveness of the coffee value chain. The proposed project is aligned with the ECCAC 
regional strategy for the development of the coffee sector.  It builds on ongoing operations by the 
World Bank in the country such as PRODEMA (Agriculture and Livestock Modernization Project) 
and PAZDOC (Sustainable Landscape Coffee Project) . It benefits from the coffee sector reforms 
and privatization supported by the World Bank and other development partners (AfD, EU, USAID, 
etc.). It is also complementing on-going operations by IFAD focusing on food security, namely the 
Agricultural Intensification and Value Enhancing Support Project (development of marshlands, 
increase the productivity and yields of rice and other food crops, access to quality inputs and seed, 
etc.), and the Value Chain Development Program (promotion of rice and milk and six other 
secondary value chains).

Relationship to CAS
16. The proposed support project is aligned with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for 
Burundi for FY13-16 that aims to support Burundi’s development as an “increasingly stable, 
competitive and diversified economy with enhanced opportunities for productive employment and 
improved standards of living”. Within the CAS framework, the proposed project supports the first 
strategic objective of increasing competitiveness to achieve inclusive growth and reduce poverty.

II. Proposed Development Objective(s)

enhance coffee quality, for the benefit of smallholders. This will contribute to: (a) improving the 
sector productivity and competitiveness; and (b) the country’s strategic goals of poverty reduction 
and enhanced exports revenues.

Key Results (From PCN)
18. At PDO level, the key results expected from this project are as follow: (a) Increased coffee 
production at the country level at project-end through the combined effect of application of good 
agricultural practices and rejuvenated/renewed plantations; (b) Higher coffee quality demonstrated 
by an increase in the share of coffee sold with price premiums on export; and (c) Enhanced farmers’ 
share of the net FOB price on coffee exports. 
 
19. It is estimated that approximately 200,000 small-scale farmers (from a total of roughly 
600,000 coffee growers at the national level) will directly benefit from the project planned 
activities. These are mostly composed of hillside farmers with less than 1 hectare of land, who 
cultivate an average of 150-250 coffee trees as an integral part of their livelihoods.

III. Preliminary Description
Concept Description
20. Burundi is a small player in international coffee markets and is operating in an environment 
of aggressive competitors. The area where the best results may be realized in terms of the sector 
productivity and competitiveness is not only limited to production increase, but most importantly, 
quality improvement along the value chain and a focus on the lucrative specialty coffee markets. 
Such efforts would certainly allow differentiating the country’s products and also provide a better 
buffer for the inevitable periods of low prices. However, the business principle driving 
improvements needs to be that quality starts at the farm level and can be maintained only through 
proper processing and storage. 
 
21. In this respect, the proposed project will operate through multiple interventions, along 
different segments of the coffee value chain, to address productivity and quality bottlenecks and to 
open new market opportunities to Burundi– the specialty coffee markets.  The proposed project 
would reinforce the private sector role in leading and structuring the sector, namely the coffee 
producers and the industry. More specifically, the following key areas of the value chain will be 
addressed: (a) Governing structure of the value chain and institutional strengthening; (b) increasing 
production and productivity; (c) improving quality and market access. A particular focus would be 
put on greater organization and integration of smallholders into the chain and on more equitable 
sharing of the benefits from improved quality and market access.   
 
22. Component 1 – Institutional strengthening and value chain governance: An essential 
property of the chain is its governance structure, which determines to a considerable extent how 
resources and gains are allocated and flow within the chain. In the case of Burundi, this structure is 
developing but constrained by lack of capacity to implement concerted specific sector policies; 
weak coordination; limited information exchange and non-transparent price mechanisms. The 
project will support streamlining the governance structure of the sector by: (a) reviewing and 
adapting the current intuitional framework to improve its level of effectiveness and efficiency with a 
particular focus on transparency in the decision-making process and on quality and pricing 
mechanism; (b) upgrading the capacities of existing institutions/organizations overseeing the sector; 
and (c) improving the dialogue among the key public and private actors of the chain to arrive at a

consensus on solving value chain bottlenecks. 
 
23. More specifically, the institutional architecture for coffee sector management that the 
project would support strengthening comprises: (a) INTERCAFE -- a stakeholder-driven 
coordinating body that has the mandate for most sector management decisions; (b) ARFIC-- a 
public regulatory authority that ensures that the basic “rules of the game” for managing the sector 
are adequately defined, transparently implemented, and where necessary, enforced by Government 
authority. This intervention will aim also at upgrading the capacities of ARFIC to provide quality, 
inspection and certification services to the coffee industry. The project will support both the 
modernization of existing labs in line with international standards (and possibly their expansion 
within the producing regions) and developing ARFIC human resources capacities for managing 
regulatory areas and for coffee testing; (c) CNAC-- a coffee grower organization largely represented 
in all coffee growing region; and (d) other stakeholder organizations for each of the main sector 
constituencies, to provide representation into the INTERCAFE’s collective decision making on 
sector management. This architecture is broadly similar to successful agriculture value chain 
management elsewhere in Sub-Saharan Africa and many other producing countries as well, with 
strong public-private sector participation. 
 
24. The project will also support increased consultations among the chain stakeholders; for 
instance, through regular forums to: (a) discuss the various problems and constraints of the sector 
within a “value chain approach”; (b) elaborate (or update) a comprehensive strategy for the coffee 
sector aiming at the general interest of the sector; (c) find harmonized and shared solutions to the 
various challenges facing the sector; (d) eliminate or minimize potential conflicts among the various 
actors in view of the general and common interest; and eventually (e) coordinating donors, 
government and private sector investments to avoid overlap, scale-up impacts, etc. 
 
25. Furthermore, under this component the project will support the development of a Data Base 
on the sector which would provide reliable data on the number of producers, number of trees, 
production, quality, washing stations performance and other ecological and socio-economic factors. 
This Data Base to be initially placed within ARFIC and linked to INTERCAFE, can be further 
expanded to include a formal GI S module that can capture more of the agro-ecological variables 
such as soil types, water sources and other variables that affect coffee quality. This investment will 
constitute an important tool for the value chain actors in terms of planning, monitoring and 
evaluation of their activities and return on investments. It can also be used as an export promotion 
tool (see component 3 below).  
 
26. Component 2 – Support to increased production and productivity: Under this component the 
project will support investments aimed at increasing production and productivity with a focus on: 
(a) the adoption of good agricultural practices - sustainable land management, planting trees, 
nutrition and fertilizer management, pests and diseases control, pruning, rejuvenation (25 percent of 
existing trees), harvesting, quality assessment and improvement, etc.; (b) improving production 
technology and soil fertility; (c) the dissemination of improved varieties to renew old plantations 
(20 percent of existing trees); (d) supporting specific research topics (coffee under shade, variety 
improvement and germplasm enhancement, etc.); and (e) a support fund to facilitate access to 
inputs. 
 
27. In addition special emphasis will be on: (a) linking coffee growers to national agricultural 
research bodies and extension services (public and private) and promoting a two-way flow of

information between these entities; (b) expanding the tested models for productivity enhancement 
implemented as part of the PRODEMA project (community based mechanisms); (c) disseminating 
sustainable water and land management (SWLM) best practices and more diversified plantations, 
with fruit trees, inter-cropping with food crops, etc.; and (d) encouraging south-south exchange for 
coffee production, for instance, with coffee growing countries including Rwanda, Ethiopia and 
Colombia. This exchange will aim at various learning programs: production techniques, extension 
methodologies, coffee under shade, etc., and will build on cooperation already established between 
the PAZDOC project (Sustainable Landscape Coffee Project – GEF) and Columbia coffee growers. 
 
28. For the implementation of the productivity investments, the proposed project will make use 
of INTERCAFE’s current contractual system provision for extension services and supply of inputs, 
and extend these to a larger share of coffee farmers as well as to coffee-specific agronomic and 
processing research. INTERCAFE has a cess revenue mechanism  already in place to finance such 
activities but, at current levels of national coffee production, the cess revenues only permit activities 
at a modest scale. 
 
29. Component 3 – Support to improved quality and market access: The management of quality 
in the coffee value chain is the most immediate instrument growers can use to improve their 
upgrading opportunities and it is a critical element of the current trend toward coffee differentiation. 
Furthermore, it is specifically vital in Burundi where the existence of “potato taste”, a strong off-
flavor resulting from the interaction between agro-climatic conditions and antestia bug infiltration, 
is endemic . Currently, cherries washing stations have only limited capacity to evaluate their coffee 
and do not have the experience or the cupping infrastructure to evaluate their production. In this 
respect, the project will promote quality enhancement activities along the value chain which would 
require changes in the field, at the washing station and at the dry mill. Applying good agricultural 
practices, flotation of cherries at the washing stations reception, meticulous hand sorting during pre-
drying and several other technical improvements are needed before Burundi can be recognized as a 
reliable supplier of coffee specialty markets. Under this component, the project will build on 
successes of recently closed USAID project in the country  and will in particular support the 
following investments: 
 
Sub-component 3.1- Improving quality: 
 
30. Developing cupping capacity: A main focus of this activity will be on educating all value 
chains actors on quality and cupping and establishing cupping labs in main producing areas.  This 
will be achieved by: (a) selecting a number of “leader” coffee washing stations to serve as an initial 
focus for specialty coffee value chain development and as models for other stations to learn from; 
and (b) the selection of a set of second tier washing stations to serve as “training hubs” aimed at 
maximizing the dissemination of production, processing and marketing best practices that will help 
in improving the quality and market access throughout all coffee producing regions in Burundi. 
 
31. Improving washing stations technical, operational and managerial capacities: Under this 
sub-component, assistance will be provided to the managerial staff of the washing stations to 
develop and implement customized Quality Improvement Plans (QIPs), including infrastructure 
improvement, best practices and Quality Control (QC) systems. The production and processing of 
high quality coffees requires sound technical and business management skills and systems. 
Currently the management (and governance) capacity of most private and cooperatively owned 
washing stations needs improvement. This element is critical to obtaining the highest returns,

continued access to financing and sustainability. Furthermore, selected strategic supplier 
certification programs offer substantial price premiums to growers but require the implementation 
of detailed and transparent financial reporting systems. In the particular cases of cooperatives where 
the governance can be problematic, it is also important to maintain a fully transparent financial 
management system to ensure cooperative cohesion. 
 
32. For highly performing washing stations, traceability systems from the plantations to the 
destination market may be introduced. Such systems will enable buyers and sellers to track each lot 
from the time it enters the washing station (or even the field) until it is delivered to its final 
destination. This feature is also an essential element that distinguishes specialty coffee production 
from the production of standard grade coffee. The ITC component described below (parag. 34) will 
be integral to the development of the coffee traceability system and to using this system to its full 
potential. 
 
33. Improving existing processing infrastructure to meet environmental concerns: As pulping 
coffee can be the source of significant environmental problems (pollution of water table and the soil 
surrounding the washing stations, etc.), the project proposes integrating environmental mitigation 
measures in existing (and new) washing stations. These investments (water treatment and recycling) 
can lead to substantial cost reduction of production (reduction of water quantities used for de-
pulping) and, most importantly, responsible environmental stewardship is not only a best practice, 
but is an obligation for certification to several preferred supplier programs such as the Neumann 
Kaffee Gruppe (NKG) and the Starbucks’ C.A.F.E. Practices Program. 
 
34. Developing an information technology and communication system specific to the sector: 
Wireless internet access is now available in much of Burundi, presenting an exciting opportunity for 
washing stations to broaden their horizon in terms of technology access, learning opportunities and 
direct communications with buyers. The Data Base described in parag. 25 above can also be 
expanded to track and report on key performance characteristics of all washing stations for purposes 
of monitoring and planning and assessing the impacts of investments in quality improvement. 
Similarly, the Data Base can serve as an important tool for export promotion, accessible to buyers 
interested in visiting and buying Burundi’s coffee. Hot-links to individual washing stations sites will 
allow buyers to download fact sheets, learn about the coffee characteristics, and communicate 
directly with the stations that interest them most. From a basic training point of view, access to the 
internet by washing stations staff will be a powerful tool for the dissemination of training materials 
across the country. Other countries, particularly in Latin America and more recently in Rwanda 
have benefited greatly from the development of information and communications technologies. 
Burundi will be no different in this regard.  
 
Sub-component 3.2- Marketing and promoting the Burundi Coffee brand:  
 
35. Burundi must learn to market its coffee to the new consumers and also minimize the risk 
and uncertainties associated with coffee production, processing and marketing. In addition to the 
investments made on increasing production and productivity, profiling of coffee quality for more 
focused marketing, upgrading t he processing infrastructure, etc., this component of the project will 
support investments in: (a) building a recognizable image for Burundi’s coffee, including, a country 
logo, brochures, standardized washing station fact sheets, coffee maps and other information that 
may be useful to coffee markets; (b) developing a reliable coffee industry intelligence and 
forecasting system; (c) establishing direct sales relationships with roasters and buyers; and (d)

introducing other innovative promotional activities such as buyer tours, certifications strategies, 
competitions such as the “cup of excellence”, and many other features that will place Burundi’s 
coffees in some of the very best markets in the world. These activities will focus on cultivating 
appropriate contacts and potential coffee relationships in North America, Europe, Japan and other 
emerging markets such as China and Russia. 
 
36. This component of the program will require the full coordination of investments and 
activities at multiple levels, including growers, washing stations, mills and other supporting 
institutions. A key player in this process will be INTERCAFE which would be reinforced to take a 
lead role in coordinating these activities and promoting the Burundi coffee brand. 
 
37. International Finance Corporation (IFC): The IFC Advisory Services Department has been 
supporting the 3rd phase of the coffee sector privatization. A main focus of IFC assistance was to 
advice on financing options for the coffee growers to buy shares of washing stations and to develop 
a target list of experienced international investors in the coffee sector who may be interested in the 
opportunity offered by the privatization. Further support will be sought from IFC, in particular for 
developing industry partnership and linkages with potential international specialty coffee buyers. 
 
38. Component 4 – Program coordination, monitoring and knowledge management: This 
component will facilitate: (a) administrative, technical, and financial management of the program; 
(b) coordination among all institutional partners to ensure efficient flow of information and support 
to all value chain actors, in particular the small coffee growers; (c) effective contractual 
arrangements with key implementing partners (INTERCAFE, CNAC, ARFIC, etc.) and other 
private sector operators; (d) monitoring and evaluation of the performance and the financial, 
environmental, and social impact of the program; and (e) development of communication activities 
to publicize and disseminate the project results, best practices and success stories.  
 
39. Inclusion of youth and women: This population already active in the coffee value chain 
(trees maintenance, harvesting, grading, etc.) will be systematically considered in all project’s 
interventions. In line with the PRSP-2 and the National Gender Policy, a special focus will be given 
to promoting increased youth employment (both women and men) in all segments of the value chain 
by involving them in technical and entrepreneurial training programs and other planned 
developments actions. The project will aim at a target of 50 percent of youth and women directly 
benefiting from the project supported activities. 
 
40. Project costs: The indicative cost for the Coffee Competitiveness Support Project is US
$50.00 million. The proposed Bank-financed support would cost about US$45.00 million. It is 
expected that the beneficiaries (INTERCAFE, ARFIC and CNAC) will contribute up to US$5.00 
million. Furthermore, a GEF project is being considered for potential co-financing of selected 
productivity enhancement activities (PAZDOC: Sustainable Landscape Coffee Project - US$ 4.2 
million). Finally, USAID and the French Development Agency (AfD) are preparing parallel 
financing for the sector with a focus on productivity and trade issues. The exact amount for this 
financing is not yet defined, but is expected to be made available in the 2015 fiscal year. 
Coordination with these projects is foreseen to ensure complementarities and cost effectiveness. 
 
41. Categories of expenditures: For all project’s components, there will be various categories of 
expenditures including: (a) civil and rural works – case of upgrading the processing infrastructure

Decision

I. Project Context
Country Context
Lebanon is an upper-middle-income country, with a population of 4.5 million people and a gross 
domestic product (GDP) of US$9,930 per capita in 2013.  The country is highly urbanized, with 
more than 85 percent of its population living in cities.  It has an open economy in which services 
and trade account for 60 percent of GDP and 73 percent of jobs.  The economy is driven by a 
dynamic private sector and is dependent on financial flows from Arab Gulf countries. The country 
is well-known for the high quality of its education system, ranking 13th out of 122 countries.   
 
The Lebanese economy expanded at a moderate pace (3.6 percent annually) during the past five 
decades. However, political instability, terrorism activities and the spillovers from regional conflicts 
made this growth erratic and unstable. Moreover, the ongoing conflict in Syria has resulted in a 
large inflow of refugees (estimated at 1.4 million  in January 2015), accounting for 30 percent of 
the country’s population. This complex political, social, and security environment put additional 
strain on the economy and public services. In fact, the GDP growth decreased from 8 percent in 
2010 to just 0.9 percent in 2013.   
 
Poverty affects nearly 28 percent of the Lebanese population (living on US$4 per day) and extreme

poverty touches 8 percent (living on US$2.4 per day).  The highest concentration of poor is found 
in the North, followed by the South and the Beqaa. In addition, most refugees are concentrated in 
the already impoverished area of the Beqaa (35 percent) and North Lebanon (35 percent). The 
Syrian crisis is expected to have increased poverty among 170,000 Lebanese by 2014, with the 
existing poor becoming even poorer.  In light of these challenges, job creation and social protection 
are among the main development priorities in the country.  
 
Lebanon made considerable progress in shaping the legal and institutional framework and restoring 
infrastructure after the civil war (1975-89) and the more recent war with Israel (2006). However, 
the country is still at an early stage of transition to environmental sustainability. The cost of 
environmental degradation in Lebanon has been estimated at 3.2 percent of the country’s GDP in 
2005.  Water pollution stands out as the country’s major environmental problem, costing more than 
1 percent of the GDP per year. This accounts for the damages caused by the discharge of untreated 
sewage, industrial effluent, and agricultural runoff into valleys, rivers, and the Mediterranean Sea.

  

Sectoral and institutional Context
THE LITANI RIVER AND LAKE QARAOUN 
 
The Litani River is the principal artery of Lebanon. Rising from the Olleiq springs close to the city 
of Baalbeck, it flows 170 km through the Beqaa valley and the Qaraoun Lake, before it reaches the 
Mediterranean Sea. The upper Litani River catchment extends over an area of 1,500 km2 (10 
percent of the Lebanese territory) and comprises 99 towns distributed into 4 administrative districts: 
Baalbeck, Zahlé, West Beqaa, and Rachayya. The major water structure along the Litani River is 
the Qaraoun Dam, which forms the Qaraoun Lake (or resevoir).  
 
POLLUTION OF WATER RESOURCES  
 
Large stretches of the Litani River and of the Qaraoun Lake are polluted due to four sources of 
pollution.   
• Municipal wastewater. In 2013, the volume of wastewater generated in the Beqaa was 
estimated at 63 million m3 with an annual load of 21,300 tons of Biochemical Oxygen Demand 
(BOD). Most wastewater is currently discharged untreated into the Litani River.  
• Industrial wastewater. This is estimated at about 4 million m3 in the Beqaa. There are 
factories producing effluents that are conveyed to surface water through nearby tributaries. Out of 
294 industrial establishments in the region, 120 are large-scale industries located within 400 m of 
the Litani River, its tributaries, or the Qaraoun Lake. 
• Municipal solid waste. Waste generated in the upper catchment of the Qaraoun Lake is 
estimated at 650 tons per day. Because of the lack of sanitary landfills, most garbage is dumped in 
open dumps and in the Litani River along the Qaraoun catchment. Water pollution comes from 
littering and surface water runoff of solid waste. This is acute when the waste site is close to surface 
water streams. The main dump sites exerting pressure on the Litani River are Temnin El Tahta, 
Saadnayel old dump, Qabb Elias, Barr Elias, Hawch El Harimi, El Khiyara, Ghazzé, and Jeb 
Jennine.  
• Agriculture. The largest use of land in the Litani River basin is for agriculture. In 2010, 
irrigated agriculture in the Beqaa covered about 54,000 ha, primarily concentrated in three districts: 
Baalbeck (24,000 ha); Zahlé (16,000 ha); and West Beqaa (10,000 ha). Vegetables, fruit trees, and 
industrial crops are the main irrigated crops in these areas.  Agricultural water pollution originates

mainly from irrigation overflows and seepage. A field survey conducted in 2010  concluded that 
farmers in Beqaa are over-fertilizing their crops and many pesticides are being applied at almost 
twice the recommended rates. As a result, agricultural chemicals and non-degradable pesticides end 
up in waterways with irrigation overflows.  
 
BUSINESS PLAN TO COMBAT POLLUTION IN LAKE QARAOUN   
 
The Ministry of Environment (MoE) commissioned in 2010 a Business Plan to help the government 
of Lebanon (GoL) identify the major sources of pollution in the Qaraoun Lake and to recommend 
appropriate solutions to mitigate them (detailed information is provided in annex 2). The Business 
Plan was completed in 2011 and endorsed by the Presidency of the Council of Ministers in 2012. 
The plan includes detailed prioritized investments for each polluting sector, with a financing 
requirement estimated at about US$255 million. In February 2013, the GoL requested World Bank 
assistance to fund priority activities of the Business Plan. 
 
The Business Plan identifies the largest two pressures as agriculture and municipal wastewater. 
Action on agriculture sources of pollution is needed to improve the overall surface water while 
continuing to contribute to the agriculture sector, a key sector, in the Bekaa. On municipal 
wastewater priority actions identified relate to continue to increase the volume of wastewater 
treated in Zahle, Iaat, Temninm El Tahta, Anjar, Jeb Jannine where the population and economic 
activity are most dense. 
 
INSITUTIONAL CONTEXT  
 
The Ministry of Environment. The MoE is empowered to study, propose, and implement national 
environmental policies. It is considered the only regulatory environmental agency in the country. 
The MoE is primarily responsible for environmental policy planning; setting laws, regulations, and 
environmental standards; imposing the application of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) 
on development projects; monitoring environmental quality; and identifying permitting conditions 
for new industry, agriculture, quarrying, and mining. In relation to the proposed project, the MoE is 
responsible for regulating the collection and disposal of solid waste. 
 
The Ministry of Energy and Water (MoEW) is responsible for the strategic planning and 
management of water resources. Prior to 2000, there were 21 regional water utilities. Water Law 
221 of year 2000 and its amendments merged them into four Water and Wastewater Establishments 
and one pre-existing river authority: North Lebanon, Beirut/Mount Lebanon, Beqaa, South 
Lebanon, and the Litani River Authority (LRA). This was a major step towards consolidating the 
responsibility of these establishmen ts and clarifying their mandate as public agencies empowering 
them to better manage water and wastewater services. The ultimate role of the water establishment 
is to have full administrative and financial autonomy over the service provision of water and 
wastewater services and irrigation. The Beqaa Water and Wastewater Establishment (BWE) is the 
one responsible for the project area. The BWE inherited distribution networks in poor conditions, 
with very high levels of illegal connections and very low collection rates from those legally 
connected. LRA is a public establishment under the MoEW is primarily responsible to (a) exploit 
hydro electrical power plants; (b) construct irrigation scheme, (c) conduct preliminary studies and 
construct dams, and (d) monitor the quality of the Litani River. 
 
The Ministry of Agriculture (MoA). The MoA has overall responsibility for the development of the

agriculture sector. While the MoEW has the overall mandate for water resources, including 
irrigation, the MoA has the prime responsibility for irrigation at the farm level. Sustainable 
management and conservation of natural resources is considered an important pillar of the MoA’s 
strategy for 2010�2014. The strategy gives high priority to enhancing the efficient use of irrigation, 
expanding the use of treated wastewater for irrigation, and reducing water pollution from 
agricultural chemicals. The MoA is also responsible for the regulation of pesticide and fertilizer 
imports, marketing, and use, and it has launched a series of measures to enhance enforcement of 
these regulations and promote awareness about the proper use, handling, and disposal of pesticides. 
 
The Council for Development and Reconstruction (CDR). The CDR, established through Decree 
no.5 of 1977 is responsible for preparing national development plans, implementing infrastructure 
project, and mobilizing external financing to lead the reconstruction and development of the 
country. The CDR is accountable to the Council of Ministers.  
 
The Qaraoun Committee. In June 2012, a committee was established  to study the pollution 
problems of the Litani River and Qaraoun Lake and to propose remedial measures. The committee 
included representation of all key stakeholders and was active in the preparation and review of the 
Business Plan for Combating Pollution of the Qaraoun Lake. Once the Business Plan and 
subsequent roadmap were agreed upon, the study committee was dissolved. In May 2014, the 
Qaraoun Committee was established  to follow up on the implementation of the roadmap to combat 
pollution in Lake Qaraoun. The committee includes 16 members representing key stakeholders and 
has assigned the secretariat responsibility to the Litani River Authority.

II. Proposed Development Objectives
The development objectives of the project are to reduce the quantity of untreated municipal sewage 
discharged into the Litani river and to improve pollution management around Qaraoun Lake.

III. Project Description
Component Name
Component 1: Improve the collection of municipal sewage
Comments (optional)
This component will finance activities that increase sewerage collection in areas where wastewater 
treatment plants have been constructed (or planned to be constructed), to maximize the use of these 
investments. The criteria used for the selection of the investments on the expansion of the network 
are the following: (i) network for a currently underserved WWTP; and (ii) network for WWTP 
completed or expected to be completed within the project implementation period.

Component Name
Component 2. Promotion of good agricultural practices including integrated pest management to 
reduce agrochemical pollution in upper Litani basin
Comments (optional)
This component will promote adoption of sustainable production systems among farmers in the 
upper Litani basin, by introducing selected IPM (for example, reduced pesticides application) and 
GAP (for example, reduced fertilizer application and other conservation practices). These practices 
are expected to provide increased quality of agricultural products (without reducing yields); farmers’ 
savings (through decreased cost of production); and reduced pollution of the Litani River.

V. Implementation
The Qaraoun Committee -formally established by COM decision 32 of May 2014—already includes 
a representative from each institution involved in pollution management along the Qaraoun.  The 
committee will have an oversight role in the implementation of the proposedproject. Its main role is 
to ensure coherence and consistency between the proposed project and all other ongoing and 
planned investment in the upper Litani watershed area.  
 
Given the multisectoral aspects of the project, the CDR will be the implementing agency. CDR has 
wide experience with Bank operations, and is familiar with fiduciary and safeguards aspects. A 
Project Management Unit (PMU) will be headed by a project coordinator under the CDR’s 
responsibility. The PMU will be responsible for contract management, fiduciary and safeguards 
oversight, auditing, monitoring and reporting, coordination, and so on. Line ministries will be 
associated in the preparation and implementation of the project from the onset. As such, technical 
experts will be recruited by the CDR as part of the PMU but will be assigned to the line ministries/
agencies and will report to the PMU project coordinator at the CDR and their respective sectors. 
This arrangement will facilitate and bridge the gap between the CDR and the line ministries. It will 
also contribute to raising capacity in the different sectors involved.

I. Project Context
Country Context
After rebounding from the economic crisis of 2002, Argentina has been one of the top two 
performers in the Latin America and Caribbean region in reducing poverty and sharing the gains of 
rising prosperity by expanding the middle class.  Total poverty (measured at US$4 per day) 
declined from 31.0 percent in 2004 to 10.8 percent in 2013, while extreme poverty (measured at US
$2.50 per day) fell from 17.0 percent to 4.7 percent.  Income inequality, measured by the Gini 
coefficient, fell from 50.2 in 2004 to 42.5 in 2012. Argentina’s poverty rate and Gini coefficient are 
among the lowest in the region. At the same time, the middle class in Argentina grew by 68 percent 
between 2004 and 2012, reaching 53.7 percent of the population.  
 
However, significant regional disparities persist with respect to poverty and access to basic 
services. The gap between regions has grown since the 2002 crisis, with Patagonia far outpacing 
Northeast and Northwest regions. The Northern provinces have poverty rates two to three times 
higher than the national average and lag behind the rest of the country in social services and basic 
infrastructure. In addition, disparities exist among and within provinces in terms of levels of

economic and social development and access to high-quality basic services (see figure 1), such as 
education, health, roads, and water, which in turns limit the ability of the poor to participate in 
economic activities, particularly in rural areas. Improving basic services in impoverished rural 
communities is critical for human capital formation and building pathways out of poverty. 
 
Indigenous people are one of the largest and most vulnerable groups of rural poor in Argentina. 
Indigenous people (2.5 percent of the population) are present in all provinces of Argentina but more 
so in the northern provinces of Salta, Jujuy, Chaco, Formosa, Santa Fe, and Tucuman. In access to 
services, 23.5 percent of indigenous households have unsatisfied basic needs, compared to 13.8 for 
the rest of the population. 
 
Today, more than 40 percent of the Argentine population remains at risk of falling into poverty.  
Three challenges stand out for the poor and vulnerable population. First, the greatest vulnerability 
to poverty arises in periods of economic crises or prolonged sluggish growth, which reduce 
employment and earnings and limit the ability of the Government to finance social programs that 
directly support the poor. Second, although Argentina is a broadly inclusive society, endowments 
and opportunities continue to vary for different groups in society and across regions. Poverty risks 
are highest among those with limited access to, and command of, human and basic infrastructure 
assets. Third, Argentina’s economy depends on natural capital, and environmental degradation 
represents a significant cost to the economy, threatening livelihoods, especially for the poorest rural 
households that are the most dependent on these resources. 
 
Strong economic growth over the last decade was accompanied by rising macro-imbalances. Key 
macroeconomic challenges include the existence of inflationary pressures, deficits in fiscal and 
current accounts and falling international reserves. Argentina has relatively modest fiscal and 
current account deficits as well as low public sector debt to GDP. Nonetheless, given the limited 
access to international capital markets, they create pressures on the economy. These imbalances 
need to be resolved in order to avoid unwanted effects on the medium-term sustainability of the 
gains in equity and development achieved during the last decade. In this regard, the Government of 
Argentina (GoA) has recently implemented various public policy interventions aimed at resolving 
key macroeconomic imbalances. It must be noted, however, that continued and consolidated efforts 
are required for achieving the desired results.

  

Sectoral and institutional Context
A third of Argentina’s continental territory is covered with natural grasslands, and another third 
with crops and forest plantations. Only around 11% of its territory is covered with natural forest 
totaling approximately 31.4 million hectares. Two thirds of this area is situated in the Chaco Eco-
Region (21.7 million ha), which also has around 13.4 million ha of forest and shrub land in various 
stages of degradation due to overgrazing and unregulated timber and fuel-wood extraction.  The 
Chaco Forest Biome occurs in  12 Argentinean provinces, four of which, Chaco, Salta, Santiago del 
Estero and Formosa account for 87 % of the total area (19.1 million ha) and produce 98 % of 
registered round wood, firewood and poles of the whole Chaco Eco-Region. 
  
The Chaco Eco-Region produces around 90% of all natural forest products in Argentina (mainly 
poles, tannin, firewood and charcoal), or around 6.3 million tons per year. Although the population 
of the 12 Provinces that make up the Chaco Eco-Region amounts to only 18% of the national total, 
they consume more than 50% of the total fuel wood in the country. Eight out of ten rural

households in the most critical areas  of the Chaco Eco-Region use wood or charcoal to cook their 
food. The illiteracy rate there is three times higher than the national average and more than a third 
of its population lives with unsatisfied basic needs. 
  
Most deforestation in Argentina takes place in the fragile Chaco Eco-Region where a combination 
of limited development options, poverty and weak institutions combine to make the area extremely 
vulnerable both economically and environmentally. Between 2006 and 2011 more than 1.5 million 
ha of natural forest were destroyed, with conversion to agriculture and uncontrolled (often illegal) 
forest exploitation causing deforestation at a rate of 1.2% per year biodiversity has been lost, soil 
and water resources have been degraded, and carbon emissions have increased.  
 
Rationale for the World Bank’s Involvement. The Bank has maintained a partnership with the GoA 
by supporting work on sustainable natural resources management since at least 1995. Previous 
Bank supported forestry operations, have demonstrated that SAyDS and the provinces are 
committed to sustainable forest management. However institutional capacity and collaboration 
among the national, provincial and local levels are still modest compared to the magnitude and 
complexity of the task. Developing an effective working relationship with local communities and 
indigenous peoples in the area is still a work in progress. The Bank and the FAO, through its 
Cooperative Program (FAO/WB-CP), are uniquely placed to assist the GoA in this effort because of 
their twenty-year working relationship in forestry conservation, agriculture and demand-driven 
sustainable development in the country.

II. Proposed Development Objectives
The PDO is to improve forest management and increased access to markets and basic services by 
forest dependent communities and small producers – indigenous and criollos – in Northern 
Argentina.

for agriculture (and agro-exports) due to their ecological functions (regulating hydrologic cycles, 
contributing to soil fertility and biodiversity conservation), and emphasize the important role that 
forests play in supporting rural livelihoods and maintaining the cultural values of the indigenous and 
criollo populations.

Component Name
Skills and Technology Transfer
Comments (optional)
Financing strengthening the technical and managerial skills of (a) indigenous and criollo community 
members, (b) small private forest owners, and (c) technical service providers and extension agents 
working in the project area. The training delivered under this component will cover project related 
topics; such as, sustainable forest management, improved production, climate resilient agricultural 
and livestock production, value addition and tenure security. Short training courses will be delivered 
through both classroom and community level instruction. Classroom instruction will be delivered to 
both community members and Rural Development Agencies (RDA) staff and others involved in 
project related service delivery.

Component Name
Forest Information and Monitoring Systems
Comments (optional)
Financing the expansion of SAyDS technical and institutional capacity to manage forest information 
and monitor changes in forest cover. The component would finance (a) expanding coverage of the 
Forest Administration, Control and Verification System (SACVEFOR) to 10 Provinces in Northern 
Argentina, (b) establishment of a national Deforestation and Forest Degradation Early Warning 
System, and (c) the planning and establishment of a National Grid of Permanent Sample Plots. The 
component would finance consultant and non-consultant services, training, and equipment.

V. Implementation
A.  Institutional and Implementation Arrangements 
 
Implementing Agency. The project will be implemented under the Ministry of Environment by the 
Secretariat of Environment and Sustainable Development (SAyDS). During implementation of the 
preparatory activity (BIRF-7520-AR) SAyDS established a National Executing Unit (NEU) in 
Buenos Aires integrated into its line functions.  
 
Project Management. The existing NEU includes an Executive Coordinator responsible for 
oversight of the Project and its operations, and the NEU will recruit individual thematic specialists 
acting as managers for each of the four technical components. By utilizing the NEU’s established 
administration and management capacity, systems and procedures initial costs and time frame for 
launching the project should be greatly reduced. The NEU led the development of the technical and 
institutional design of the proposed Project. The team of the NEU will be completed by M&E, 
safeguards, accounting, and procurement specialists and administrative assistants. Consultants will 
be recruited to fill knowledge gaps as they arise. 
 
Technical Implementation. Local Executing Units (LEU) located in the eight selected departments 
will include one specialist in charge of each of the following technical areas; (a) Community Forest 
Management, (b) Participatory Land Use Planning (PICs), (c) Land Tenure and Rights 
Strengthening, and (d) Marketing of Forest and NTFP. One of the specialists will act as coordinator 
in each LEU. LEU’s will also include administrative and M&E support officers (see Organogram 
Annex 3, Figures 2 and 3). Component 1 will be implemented in close collaboration with national, 
provincial and local Rural Development Agencies (RDA) that already work with targeted 
indigenous and criollo communities in the Project area. Selected RDAs will include public agencies, 
non-governmental organizations, and academic institutions. 
  
Consultation Committees. Each LEU will work closely with provincial institutions responsible for 
forest, tenure, social development, and indigenous peoples’ issues. To facilitate information 
exchange and coordination a Local Project Consultation Committee (LPCC) will be set up in each 
Department with representatives from local agencies, NGOs, and communities Project Consultation 
Committee should include IP and Criollos organization representatives.  
 
B. Results Monitoring and Evaluation 
 
The results framework (Annex 1) details performance indicators by component and sub-component. 
Monitoring and evaluation efforts will include (a) biannual progress reports with performance 
indicator updates and (b) a project-specific impact evaluation designed in consultation with the 
Development Impact Evaluation Initiative (DIME) . SAyDS has gained experience reporting on 
progress during the ongoing operation (LN 7520) however with a greater number of field activities 
and a larger number of implementation partners, SAyDS will need to rely more on Local Executing 
Units (LEU) and ensure that they follow established methodologies for reporting progress. An M&E 
strategy will be included in the operational manual and a M&E specialist will be providing support 
and capacity development at all levels (See Organogram Annex 3, Figure 3) The implementing 
agency was involved in the development of the results framework and plans to collect disaggregated 
data on gender and ethnicity. 
 
M&E reports, including environmental and social monitoring results, will be produced quarterly at

the LEU level, and every six months at the NEU level. The data collected at the field level would be 
consolidated and analyzed at the LEU level and consolidated by the NEU for reporting and 
feedback. Annual evaluation and impact monitoring reports will facilitate adaptive management, 
allowing for the identification of issues and lessons that could help adjusting the operational 
strategy. The format and content of the annual monitoring report will be defined in the Project 
Operational Manual. The mid-term review of the Project would occur no later than 30 months after 
effectiveness. 
 
C. Sustainability 
 
The proposed project design will increase the availability of key technical and managerial skills at 
both departmental and community levels and address shared prosperity by improving small-
producers’ access to financial resources for sustainable forest management (through links to the 
Forest Fund under the Forest Law). Adoption of a community driven approach ensures that 
beneficiary communities will acquire skills needed to advocate for improved natural resources 
management and access forest management funding through provincial authorities on an ongoing 
basis, after project completion, though the Forest Fund. Engaging a number of RDAs will contribute 
to inter-agency coordination and cooperation and spread the implementation burden across 
participating institutions allowing selected provinces and departments to meet a wide range of 
beneficiary needs (land tenure, water, and resilient agriculture). Investments in forest monitoring, 
early warning systems, publicity campaigns and community radio are expected to increase public 
awareness and cooperation with indigenous people and criollo communities’ efforts to manage 
natural resources sustainably.

I. Introduction and Context
Country Context
The Republic of Angola, with a total population of 24.3 million inhabitants, covers an area of about 
1.25 million km2 and is located on the Atlantic coast of south-western Africa. According to the 
2014 population census, 52 percent of the total population are women and about 38 percent live in 
rural areas.  
 
Angola became independent from Portugal in 1975. This was followed by a civil war that lasted for 
almost 25 years from 1975 to 2002 and ended with a peace agreement in 2002. Angola is one of 
Africa’s resource-rich countries, with a large potential for economic growth based on many mineral

resources (particularly oil and diamonds) as well as agriculture. 
 
Agriculture contributes to approximately 10 percent of GDP, the industry sector accounts for  60 
percent of GDP and the services to about 30 percent. However, the economy of Angola is 
predominantly oil based.  The oil sector accounts for almost 45 percent of the GDP, 95 percent of 
total export value and 80 percent of government revenues. Oil prices are at a four years low and 
have declined by about 40 percent since June 2014. Currently oil prices are below US$50 per barrel. 
With the declining international oil prices, the government would like to reduce this dependence on 
the oil sector and promote diversification of the economy, including expanding the role of 
agriculture. 
 
Projections for GDP growth made by the government are: 9.7 percent in 2015; 5.9 percent in 2016 
and 5.1 percent in 2017. Growth is mainly driven by the recovery of the oil sector and an increase in 
public investments in the non-oil sectors. This includes, among others, rehabilitation of roads, 
increase in energy production, and development of new irrigation systems to enhance agricultural 
productivity. The average inflation rate is projected to be about 7 percent by end of 2015. While 
macroeconomic prospects in the medium-term are challenging due to declining oil prices, 
macroeconomic performance and commitment to reforms have been favorable. 
 
While reasonable progress has been made toward achievement of the Millennium Development 
Goals (MDGs), Angola is not likely to meet the MDGs by 2015. Angola ranks low in both the 
human development indicators and business environment indicators. Overall, institutional capacity 
remains weak. There are bureaucratic hurdles and governance challenges that inhibit growth of the 
private sector. 
 
The performance related to social indicators has been mixed. Good progress has been made in 
poverty reduction, primary education and gender equality since 2002. Despite these achievements, 
however, social indicators remain very poor. For example, life expectancy at birth is about 51 years. 
Maternal mortality is 450 out of 100,000 births which is the highest in sub-Sahara Africa. 
Malnutrition is also acute with 30 percent of children less than five years of age suffering from 
stunting and 16 percent are under-weight. 
 
The overall poverty rate has declined from 62 percent in 2001 to about 37 percent in 2009 (about 
nine million people). This is a major achievement. However, there are major regional disparities in 
the poverty rate across provinces as well as between rural and urban sectors. In the rural areas the 
poverty rate is almost 58 percent. On the other hand, the poverty rate in Luanda (the largest city in 
the country) is only about 9 percent. Clearly there is a great need to reduce poverty rates in the rural 
areas. 
 
Angola is estimated to have about 57 million hectares of arable land of which less than 4 million 
hectares are currently under cultivation. Despite enormous potential to increase cropped area and 
crop yields, and diverse agro-climate regions in the country for increasing food production, national 
and household food security continues to depend on imports of various food commodities and this 
cannot be sustained. Angola continues to import a significant share of food consumption, except for 
roots and tubers. For example, the overall output of cereals is currently estimated at 1.9 million MT 
against a total consumption need of 3 million MT. The difference (1.1 million MT or 36 percent of 
the needs) is met through imports. In other words, national food security remains a major 
development issue.

Global experience suggests that growth in agriculture has much higher potential than in other 
sectors (such as industry) to reduce rural poverty. Inclusive growth in the agricultural sector can 
make a major contribution to diversify the economy, accelerate economic growth, increase food 
security, reduce rural poverty, improve social indicators in the rural areas, and help achieve MDGs. 
The proposed agricultural project envisages a major impulse to the agricultural sector that will not 
only increase productivity and production but will also improve the lives of rural population at 
large, thus providing for structural change and transformation of the agricultural sector in the project 
areas.

Sectoral and Institutional Context
While agriculture accounts for only about 10 percent of the GDP, almost two-thirds of the 
population depend directly or indirectly on agriculture for their income, employment and livelihood. 
About 37 percent of the population is below the poverty line and about 85 percent of the poor are in 
the rural areas and depend on agriculture.  The cropping pattern varies across the agro-climatic 
conditions in the country. However, Central Highlands (Huambo, Bie and Malanje Provinces) 
appear to have a high density of population and a high potential for agricultural production, 
including cassava, maize, beans, potato and horticulture. 
 
Prior to independence, Angola had a long history of exporting agricultural commodities, having 
been once the third largest exporter of coffee in the world. Exportable surpluses, such as coffee and 
maize, were for the most part produced using traditional technologies and few modern inputs. 
During the colonial period (up to 1975), agriculture had a dual structure with a commercial sector of 
about 800,000 ha managed by Portuguese settlers using modern technologies, and a traditional 
sector primarily composed of smallholder family farms cultivating about 3.4 million ha.  
 
After independence, most of the Portuguese settlers left the country and many of the former 
commercial farms and plantations were converted into state farms, which have now been privatized. 
The civil war (1975 to 2002) resulted in a virtual collapse of commercial production as large 
numbers of rural inhabitants either fled or reverted to subsistence agricultural production. 
Infrastructure suffered a great deal with widespread destruction of roads, bridges, irrigation systems 
and warehouses, compounded by the presence of thousands of land mines in the rural areas. 
Although the situation has improved since the end of the civil war with the rehabilitation of main 
roads and bridges, and clearance of mines, agricultural exports are currently negligible. The 
agricultural sector has not yet fully recovered from the de-capitalization experienced during the civil 
war. 
 
With recent developments in the rehabilitation of infrastructure that includes main roads and 
bridges, agricultural production gradually started to increase since 2002.  However, crop yields 
remain very low as compared to other countries in sub-Sahara Africa. According to FAO statistics, 
the average yield in Angola of beans is 0.34 tons/ha compared to 0.6t/ha in the region; groundnuts 
0.38 t/ha compared to 0.88 t/ha in the region and millet 0.24 t/ha compared to 0.7 t/ha in region.  
This implies that there is substantial scope for increasing crop yields and production through 
agricultural modernization and technical change as well as through an increase in cultivated area. 
However, this will require the use of animal traction power, adoption of improved agronomic 
practices, improvements in soil fertility, use of modern agricultural inputs, bringing cropped area 
under irrigation, and disseminating agricultural knowledge to farmers. In addition, there is a 
substantial scope and need to strengthen market linkages, improve commercialization and build

agro-business facilities through local entrepreneurs.  
 
At present, almost 80 percent of the farmers are smallholders, with weak capacity and limited 
knowledge of improved agricultural practices. Human capital in agricultural education, research and 
extension institutions suffered a great deal during the civil war and have not yet been fully 
strengthened or replaced. The institutional capacity in the agricultural sector, including irrigation 
and agricultural statistics, is extremely weak. The agricultural programs are designed and 
implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture at the national level and by the Departments of 
Agriculture at the provincial levels. The capacity of these agencies needs to be strengthened as well. 
 
The Bank-supported Angola Market Oriented Smallholder Agriculture Project (MOSAP), approved 
by the Board in July 2008 and implemented over the past years, was designed to increase 
agricultural production through the provision of improved agricultural services and investment 
support to rural smallholder farmers. Activities implemented under the project include: (a) training 
of over 44,000 smallholder farmers in the use of improved agricultural technologies to boost 
production of the major crops targeted by the project (the training was provided by service providers 
recruited under the Project as well as training provided by FAO to over 14,000 producers on family 
farms through Farmers’ Field Schools ); (b) training of more than 60 technicians; and (c) provision 
of financial support to over 14,000 smallholder beneficiaries through financing of around 280 sub-
projects ; and (d) capacity building for staff from the Agrarian Development Institute (ADI) of the 
Ministry of Agriculture at targeted municipalities. 
 
In addition to the provision of capacity building, MOSAP contributed to: (i) an increase in 
agricultural production; and (ii) the adoption of improved technologies in the project areas.  The 
crop index during the 2013/14 season was 64 percent against an overall project target of 10 percent.  
The major crops supported under MOSAP were: maize, beans, cassava, and Irish potatoes. About 
66 percent of smallholder famers have adopted an improved technology promoted by the project 
against a project target of 30 percent. 
 
As indicated earlier, with the exception of cassava, the average yield of major crops cultivated in 
Angola, including maize, beans, Irish potatoes, is still extremely low, even compared to yields in 
other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. There is a large potential for increasing crop yields and 
agricultural production in the country. There are (at least) three major reasons justifying increasing 
public and private investments in the agriculture sector:  
 
(i) To ensure institutional continuity and scaling up of the on-going but limited support to 
smallholder farmers in Angola. As indicated, MOSAP has been critical in promoting agriculture 
recovery following the end of the civil war, strengthening institutions, and bringing formerly 
displaced agricultural producers back to agriculture in the project areas. 
(ii) To improve economic diversification. Angola possesses large and well-endowed natural 
resources including land and water. Almost two-thirds of the Angolans earn their livelihood from 
agriculture, a sector that could become one of the engines of economic growth and source of 
productive rural employment, provided capacity building and investments in public infrastructure 
and private assets take place. Unless investments are made to lay the foundations for future 
agricultural growth, national economic growth and diversification (which are critical in light of 
declining international oil prices), income, employment and foreign exchange earnings/savings will 
be seriously constrained.

(iii) To ensure sustainable use of natural resources.  Despite the low levels of economic activity, 
the country already faces various pressures on its natural resources, such as wastage of water and 
overuse of pastures and subsequent soil erosion (largely attributable to population pressures; 
desertification); and deforestation of tropical rain forest in response to both international demand for 
tropical timber and to domestic fuel use. Investments in an efficient use of water for irrigation and 
promotion of soil conservation techniques, including erosion control and enhancement of soil 
fertility, and natural resource management, will ensure a sustainable use of soil and water and will, 
over time, contribute towards mainstreaming climate smart agricultural practices.  
 
The proposed Smallholder Agriculture Development and Commercialization Project (SADCP) 
intends to scale-up activities being implemented under MOSAP and will also finance critical  new 
activities, as per government’s medium and long-term agriculture programs. MOSAP is scheduled 
to close on December 31, 2015, i.e. in eleven months.  The implementation of the new project is 
expected to start on January 1, 2016.  Given the popularity of MOSAP in the project areas as well as 
with agencies dealing with agriculture, government indicated preference for keeping the name of 
MOSAP and calls this project MOSAP-2.

Relationship to CAS
The Bank CPS for FY13-16 aims at (i) deepening diversification for inclusive growth; (ii) 
enhancing the quality of decentralization for services delivery; and (iii) building human resources 
capacity. The CPS recognizes the role of agriculture and the need to increase agriculture 
productivity and competitiveness to reduce rural poverty and promote growth. The proposed 
Smallholder Agriculture Development and Commercialization Project is a critical instrument to 
contribute to achieving the CPS objectives

II. Proposed Development Objective(s)
Proposed Development Objective(s) (From PCN)
The Project Development Objective is to increase smallholder agricultural production and 
marketing in the project areas.

Key Results (From PCN)
21. The proposed project is expected to provide assistance to about 200,000 smallholder 
farmers in three provinces. The key results expected from the proposed project are: (i) to increase 
yields of selected crops, including cassava, maize, beans and Irish potatoes to the average yield 
levels prevailing in sub-Saharan Africa; (ii) to increase production of selected crops; and (iii) to 
increase the share of crop production that is marketed. In addition to these key results indicators, the 
results framework will also measure intermediate performance indicators for each of the 
components that will be developed during project preparation. These indicators will include the 
percentage of farmers who benefit from training and apply their knowledge; the average yields of 
major crops supported by the project; the percentage of the agriculture produce marketed by the 
smallholder farmers in addition to other indicators that will be discussed and agreed upon during 
project preparation. 
  
22. The strategy to achieve key results under the proposed project is to build upon the outcomes 
achieved under the on-going MOSAP and support smallholder farmers to increase agricultural 
productivity, production and market linkages that generate self-sustaining agricultural growth over a 
larger project area, as compared to MOSAP.  This will be achieved by: (a) building on potential 
synergies with on-going agricultural programs; (b) maximizing opportunities for quick-win results

by focusing on farmers that received training under MOSAP or other programs and have applied 
their knowledge); (c) strengthening the knowledge and skills of smallholder farmers and their 
associations as well as of agricultural extension staff and agricultural services providers;  (d) re-
capitalizing productive agricultural systems and infrastructures, including irrigated agriculture; (e) 
providing access to demand-driven agricultural services and agricultural markets; and (f) promoting 
rural entrepreneurship in agri-business development. As far as possible, investments will be based 
on a flexible, participatory and demand-driven approach that promotes enhancement in productivity, 
commercialization and sustainability of agricultural activities.

III. Preliminary Description
Concept Description
The proposed project is designed to be climate smart, gender and jobs responsive and nutrition 
sensitive. The project is consistent with the main agriculture development programs in the country. 
Angola tends to experience seasonal rain variability and sometimes even long periods of drought 
that affect agricultural production. The proposed project will promote appropriate adaptation 
practices, including irrigated agriculture, to reduce such production losses. The project will support 
the participation of women in different project components, including farmers associations, 
production, marketing and training. The project will have a positive impact on employment and job 
creation in the rural areas by contributing to increased agricultural production, marketing, agri-
business and value addition as well as increased demand for agricultural inputs and services.  
Finally, since the project will promote the production of beans and vegetables, it is likely to have a 
positive impact on the food security and nutrition of rural households.  
 
The proposed project is a follow up project to the on-going MOSAP.  While broadly similar to the 
original MOSAP project, the new project differs in the following important aspects. First, it is larger 
in scope in terms of absolute funding and number of beneficiaries. Second, it includes a sub-
component to support the development of small-scale irrigated agriculture. Third, in addition to 
food crops (maize, cassava, beans and Irish potatoes), it will emphasize the production of high value 
crops, particularly horticulture. Fourth, it will further strengthen commercialization of agriculture, 
including market linkages, contract farming and agri-business development.  
 
The SADCP project area would cover the whole country for capacity building and institutional 
development activities. However, investment would be limited to the same provinces of Bie, 
Huambo and Malanje but with more coverage to municipalities. MOSAP was limited to three 
provinces covering 12 municipalities and only 50,000 beneficiaries. The proposed project would 
significantly expand the number of municipalities and communes covered under MOSAP and cover 
about 200,000 smallholder beneficiaries.  Besides the high potential for agricultural production, the 
selected provinces also meet the following criteria: 
 
• Well-endowed with resources, in particular land and water. Smallholder farming systems 
are already sustainable and profitable. Smallholder activities in these areas, before the civil war, 
included producing a wide range of crops, including most cereals and high value products such as 
vegetables (notably potatoes and onions). These areas appear to have high agricultural potential. 
 
• High concentration of rural population. The three provinces have around 52 percent of the 
population that is considered rural, as compared to 38 percent nationally. Overall, the three 
provinces account for about 24 percent of the rural population in Angola (2014 Population Census).

• Proximity to potential markets and possibility of benefiting from the rehabilitated road 
network and railways. Hopefully, this will facilitate the strengthening of market linkages and 
commercialization. 
 
The target groups of the project will be smallholders in the selected provinces with a potential to 
increase agricultural production and commercialization. The potential project beneficiaries will be d 
ivided into the following three categories: (i) Group 1 of 1,000 beneficiaries that are  likely to 
benefit from irrigated agriculture, production and marketing activities (primarily horticulture) with a 
possibility for contract farming; (ii) Group 2 of 49,000 beneficiaries that are  likely to benefit from 
production and marketing activities related to food crops and horticulture; and (iii) Group 3 of 
150,000 beneficiaries that are likely to benefit from capacity building, production and marketing 
related to key food crops. Specialized capacity development training may also be provided to 
beneficiaries in Groups 1 and 2 that may have also benefitted from capacity development under 
MOSAP. 
 
The proposed project will have three components: Component 1 - Capacity Building and 
Institutional Development; Component 2- Support for Agricultural Investment; and Component 3- 
Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation. The proposed project is expected to be 
implemented over a period of five years from January 2016 through December 2020. The total cost 
will be US$125 million, of which US$20 million will be contribution by the Government of Angola 
and US$5 million equivalent will be in-kind contribution by the beneficiaries. A 100 million IBRD 
loan will constitute the remainder of the total cost. Overall, the project is expected to support about 
200,000 beneficiaries (members of about 6,500 farmer associations) with approximately 300,000 ha 
cropped land (on an average, 1.5 ha per beneficiary and with a range of about 0.50 ha to 2.5 ha per 
beneficiary). 
 
 
Component 1. Capacity Building and Institutional Development (US$30 million) 
 
As under MOSAP, this component would focus on strengthening national, provincial and municipal 
institutions, develop technical capacity and introduce participatory processes to accelerate the 
decentralized agricultural development.  This component will also aim to strengthen the technical 
and managerial skills of participants and institutions involved in agricultural production and 
marketing in the project areas. This component entails the following four  sub-components:  
 
a. Formation and strengthening of Farmers’ associations, which would include organizational 
and managerial capacities, and technical skills related to modern agricultural technologies and 
agronomic practices, agricultural production, marketing, investment and entrepreneurship. Training 
of vulnerable groups (e.g. female-headed households) will be given special attention. This will also 
include training of farmers through farmers’ field schools (FFSs), as is being done under MOSAP. 
 
b. Institutional strengthening of local, provincial and national units of the Ministry of 
agriculture (MINAG) to ensure that these institutions can better play their respective roles in the 
sector.  This sub-component would include support for strengthening institutional capacity in 
agricultural extension services (including linkage with research), agricultural research service, small 
scale irrigation, agricultural marketing and agricultural statistics. In addition, the capacity of 
MINAG staff will be enhanced to prepare and implement appropriate agricultural programs and

policies. There will also be support for strengthening market information systems, linked to farmers’ 
and traders associations. Finally, the project will also support linkages with research programs 
relevant to agriculture that are being undertaken by the Ministry of Science and Technology.  
 
c. To strengthen agricultural research capacity and global knowledge about the latest 
technologies related to selected crops relevant to Angola, support to specific agricultural research 
will also be provided. Possible collaboration with both the International Institute for Tropical 
Agriculture (IITA) and the Brazilian Corporation of Agricultural Research (EMBRAPA) will be 
developed/further strengthened to address agricultural research and disease management issues that 
are critical for existing (cassava, maize and beans) and emerging crops (soybean) in Angola. As part 
of the CGIAR, IITA is responsible for carrying out research related to cassava, maize and beans in 
Africa. EMBRAPA has been working closely with Angola in building agricultural research 
capacity, including breeding for disease and pest resistance, in the context of integrated disease and 
pest management. 
 
d. Strengthening capacities of private and NGO agricultural service providers, especially those 
working closely with the smallholder farmers. Among other activities, this would include support 
for smallholder farmer groups or associations to prepare investment proposals for various sub-
projects for funding under the project as well as support for managerial and business capacities of 
new and existing agri-business entrepreneurs. 
 
Component 2. Support for Agricultural Investment  (US$55 million) 
 
This component supports investments in agriculture assets, both of a public as well as a private 
goods nature, with the aim to improve agricultural productivity, competiveness and market linkages 
of farmer beneficiaries (groups and individuals). The smallholder farmer beneficiaries will be re 
quired to make a small in-kind contribution (of at least 10 percent) to the investments that they 
receive based on criteria to be established during preparation. The investment component will, in 
the first year, consider farmer associations that received training under MOSAP. This component 
consists of the following sub-components:  
 
(a) Support for the Development of Small Scale Irrigation 
 
This sub-component will deal with the rehabilitation of existing and the development of new small 
scale irrigation systems. The Central Highlands, particularly comprising large parts of the provinces 
of Malanje, Huambo and Bie, have excellent conditions and water resources for development of 
small scale irrigated agriculture. Productive soils and water resources are abundant. Topographical 
conditions make it possible to develop irrigation by gravity. Gravity irrigation is particularly 
favorable for the development of small scale irrigated agriculture for smallholders. Some 
smallholder communities have already created and managed gravity irrigation schemes.  With their 
own resources (mainly labor and local materials) they derive water from small streams by 
(temporary) weirs to a network of unlined earthen canals for irrigation. The management and 
operation of these systems requires limited financial resources (the scarcest resources of 
smallholders). However, the efficiency and productivity of these systems will be improved by 
simple and cost-effective measures such as the construction of permanent weirs, the tubing and 
lining of canal stretches with infiltration losses, construction of culverts to cross roads and (natural) 
drainage streams etc.

(b) Support for Agricultural Production Investments 
 
This sub-component will support investments in farm assets. In order to access matching grants for 
investment sub-projects, farmer associations have to submit project proposals. This sub-component 
will assist eligible participants in the preparation of detailed proposals that will allow an informed 
decision about their feasibility from technical, economic, financial, social and environmental 
perspectives. The potential funding proposals (list will be finalized during preparation) will consider 
dealing with any activity that will increase crop productivity and production. Few examples are 
draft animals, simple tools and agricultural equipment, soil fertility/quality improvement, soil 
conservation, seeds of improved crop varieties, fertilizers and integrated pest and disease 
management. In addition, matching grants will also be provided to individual enterprises in the rural 
areas that will provide critical agricultural services to smallholders in the project areas.  
 
A review and evaluation of exist ing schemes will be carried out as part of the project preparation to 
help determine what kind of support might be needed and appropriate.  This assessment will also 
include on-going experiences and scope for the provision of rural financial services in Angola that 
are currently being provided by local and international NGOs. The main goal of this component is 
sustainable increase in agricultural production for the smallholders. 
 
(c) Support for Value Addition and Marketing Infrastructure  
 
This sub-component will support investments related to market linkages and commercialization, 
including value addition, post-harvest management and marketing activities for key crops and 
horticulture. The critical issues that need to be addressed are packaging, storage, small-scale 
processing, and marketing infrastructure and even contract farming. The main focus will be on 
value addition, reduction of post-harvest losses and market linkages. All sub-projects requesting 
financing under this sub-component will prepare a project proposal and a business plan that will go 
through a complete appraisal process to determine the economic feasibility and sustainability. 
Specific list of sub-projects that will be supported under this sub-component will be identified 
during preparation of the proposed project. 
 
Component 3: Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation (US$10 million) 
 
This component deals with coordination and monitoring and implementation of the project and 
consists of two sub-components: 
 
a. Project Management: 
The purpose of this sub-component is to ensure that the project is implemented correctly, on time 
and in accordance with the Loan Agreement. This would be the responsibility of a Project 
Coordinator and a small team of ex perts located at the national, and provincial or municipal levels. 
The final arrangements for project management will incorporate the lessons learned under MOSAP. 
  
b. Project Monitoring and Evaluation: 
 
The monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system will be established that will be responsible for 
collecting and processing appropriate information to verify the output, effect and eventually the 
impact of project activities over time. Baseline information will also be collected at the beginning of 
the project.

Concept Review 
Decision

Track II - The review did authorize the preparation to continue

I. Introduction and Context
Country Context
1. During the last decade, Ecuador has seen a period of relative political stability. The 
Government of Ecuador (GoE) has invested heavily in infrastructure and social sectors in an effort 
to stimulate growth, reduce inequality and promote inclusion for a total population of slightly more 
than 15.7 million inhabitants.  
 
2. The Ecuadorian economy relies largely on the extraction and export of oil, and on the 
export of natural resource-based products and services. The agricultural sector accounted for 7.8 
percent of the GDP in 2013. With more than 60 percent of its agricultural production destined for 
export, Ecuador could benefit significantly from stimulating productivity through integrated rural 
development approaches.

3. Growth combined with falling inequality has led to important gains in reducing poverty and 
promoting shared prosperity. Over the last decade (2003-13), GDP per capita growth in Ecuador 
was above regional average levels (2.7 percent vs. 2.5 percent), while progress in reducing 
inequality has exceeded regional trends. Income distribution was significantly improved, as 
expressed by the Gini coefficient, declining from 0.54 in December 2006 to 0.49 in June 2014. 
Likewise, between 2006 and 2014, income poverty at the national poverty line fell from 37.6 
percent to 24.5 percent, while extreme poverty fell from 16.9 percent to 8 percent.  
 
4. Despite the significant reduction in poverty and growth of the middle class, more than half 
of the population in Ecuador remains poor or vulnerable to falling back into poverty, particularly in  
rural areas. In 2014, 4.2 percent of the urban population lived in extreme poverty compared to the 
16 percent for the rural population. The difference was less pronounced at the moderate poverty 
line, but even in this case the rural headcount was more than twice the urban headcount (41.7 
percent versus 16.3 percent).

Sectoral and Institutional Context
5. The proposed project is fully aligned to the National Development Plan for 2013-2017, the 
National Strategy for Diversification of the Productive Matrix, the institutional objectives of 
Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Aquaculture and Fisheries (MAGAP) and with the Irrigation 
National 2012-2027 Plan, which are: (i) to improve the lives of farmers and rural communities 
through the strategies: social inclusion of small and medium producers; (ii) to promote the 
modernization of agriculture; and (iii) to strengthen capacity of the Autonomous Decentralized 
Provincial Governments (GADPs) to assume the transferred competencies of constructing, 
operating and maintaining irrigation systems and promoting agricultural activity. 
 
6.  Ecuador has 1.1 million agricultural households with land size between 1 ha and 20 ha, 
regarded as small and medium producers, who own about 1.6 million hectares (25% of total area at 
national level). This segment of farmers is crucial for many value chains such as rice (49% of 
national production), potatoes (64%), maize (76%) and onions (80%). Nevertheless, the 
development of this segment of farmers and its capacity to contribute to the diversification of 
productive matrix at national level are limited by the size of land, the access to market, and by the 
poor access to efficient water management in agriculture. Out of the 304,000ha irrigated by small 
and medium producers, 284,000ha are still under traditional irrigation methods with very low water 
efficiency and limited water storage capacity. The proposed project aims at supporting MAGAP’s 
initiative to strengthen this category of farmers in their effort for intensification and modernization 
of agriculture. 
 
7. The 2008 Constitution of the Republic of Ecuador defined the decentralization framework 
recognizing the political, administrative, and financial autonomy of the Decentralized Provincial 
Autonomous Governments (GADPs) at their different levels (canton, province, and parish). This 
decentralization grants each province jurisdiction to plan, build, and maintain the infrastructure 
(transportation, water, and sanitation) under its competencies and to promote the development of the 
productive sector within its territory. 
 
8. Within the competences of Provincial Governments under the current Constitution are: (i) 
planning, building and maintaining the road system at provincial level; (ii) planning, constructing, 
operating and maintaining irrigation systems and; (iii) promoting agricultural activity. Therefore,

the implementation of new development projects and the sustainable operation of existing irrigation 
projects are limited by the level of capacity for project preparation, implementation and financing 
by the Provincial Governments.

Relationship to CAS
9. The World Bank Group's Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for Ecuador approved on April 9, 
2013, identified agriculture and rural development as key priorities for the Government and the 
Bank to contribute to the country's goal for inclusive and sustainable growth. 
 
10. The proposed Project is fully consistent with the World Bank’s ISN for Ecuador for the 
period 2014-2015, which focuses on investment project financing in three strategic areas: (i) Pillar I 
-  Sustainable and Inclusive Growth; (ii) Pillar II - Access to Social Protection and Quality Services 
for All, and (iii) with the country’s Plan Nacional para el Buen Vivir, where five out of twelve key 
objectives outline the importance of enhancing the productive water access in a sustainable manner 
as key intermediate priorities to ensure quality of life and social cohesion for its farmers and rural 
communities. 
 
11. It is expected that the proposed Project will contribute to the reduction of extreme poverty, 
to the increase of shared prosperity and equality of access to opportunities in targeted provinces 
across the country by increasing agricultural revenues and resilience of Ecuador's family farming 
sector, promoting diversification and increase of agricultural production, and improving access to 
markets for smallholders and their organizations.

II. Proposed Development Objective(s)
Proposed Development Objective(s) (From PCN)
12. The project development objective is to enhance the profitability and sustainable production 
of small and medium farmers in targeted areas by improving productivity and by supporting more 
efficient and climate-smart uses for land and water. 
 
13. To reach its objective, the project will support technical assistance, capacity-building 
activities, on-farm and complementary off-farm investments geared toward a more efficient use of 
natural resources, especially water, an increased adaptation to climate change, improvement in 
productivity and market access. On-farm investments are made within the farmer's plot. Off-farm 
investments are referring to interventions on irrigation and drainage networks upstream of the intake 
of the farmer’s plot. 
 
14. Project beneficiaries. The project beneficiaries are small and medium-sized family farmers, 
including indigenous communities. Small and Medium farmers are established by MAGAP 
according agroclimatological regions:  
• Sierra: 0 - 5 ha. (small farmers) – 5 to 20 ha. (medium farmers)  
• Costa: 0-20 ha. (small farmers) - 20 to 40 ha (medium farmers)  
 
15. Project areas. While the project is national in scope, the Sierra Central and the Coastal 
regions are the main target areas for investment subprojects where climatological conditions justify 
investments in water storage and irrigation to foster diversification and intensification of agriculture.

Key Results (From PCN)
16. The key indicators at the beneficiary level would measure changes in: (i) profitability of

agricultural activities and; (ii) climate-resilience and sustainability of the improved production 
systems.  
 
17. Intermediate outcome indicators would include: (i) Profitability (margin) by unit of land 
(hectare), by unit of water (cubic meters) and by household (family); (ii) Reduced volatility of yield 
from year to year for main crops; (iii) Hectares of areas and number of beneficiaries with new/
improved irrigation and drainage services like drip or sprinkler (core indicator); (iv) Number of 
clients who have adopted an improved agricultural technology promoted by the project (core 
indicator); (v) Number of Operational Water User Associations created and/or strengthened (core 
indicator); (vi) Sub-projects for which arrangements for community engagement in post-project 
sustainability and/or operation and maintenance are established (core indicator) and; (vii) Hectares 
of area with change in land use (increase of cropping intensity and diversification of crops).

III. Preliminary Description
Concept Description
18. The Project supports a framework program to strengthen sustainable modernization and 
intensification of agriculture systems with an emphasis on beneficiary and community participation. 
The Project will support: (i) demand-based investment subprojects; (ii) capacity-building activities 
that strengthen national and local institutions (MAGAP, GADP, mainly) and farmers’ organizations; 
(ii) climate-smart project planning; (iii) training and technical assistance to enhance productivity, 
increase value-added and improve market access; and, (iv) small investments to protect natural 
resources linked to the subprojects (see details of Project Concept in Annex 3). 
 
19. In order to maximize the positive impact and sustainability of activities, the project will 
seek to coordinate its actions with existing government programs aimed at agricultural development 
such as the MAGAP’s Hombro a Hombro Program (national extension program for family farming) 
and the agricultural component of the Plan Nacional Buen Vivir 2013-2107; as well as programs 
developed by Provincial Governments in thematic support agricultural production and marketing. 
The project should also ensure that rural credit programs and/or micro-credit (Cooperative Savings) 
will be accessible to project beneficiaries. 
 
20. The proposed Project will build on the successful model of the PIDD (see details of project 
description and main lessons learned in Annex 3). The PIDD or Proyecto de Inversiones de 
Desarrollo Productivo (P094784), which closed in June 2014, financed subprojects of 
modernization works for 55 small and medium scale collective irrigation systems, benefiting 4,685 
ha and 7,900 families. The most important lessons learned from the PIDD, taken into account in the 
proposed project’s design are the following (details in Annex 4): 
a) Combining physical investments with capacity building. The PIDD followed an integrated 
approach with rehabilitation and modernization of irrigation systems and strengthening of the 
capacity of Water Users Association and improving farmers’ irrigation and agricultural practices 
and the commercialization of agricultural produce.  
b) Frontloading technical assistance and training to the institutional stakeholders. This capacity 
building needs to be done in technical screening, design, supervision of sub-projects), and fiduciary 
aspects (procurement, in financial management and safeguards). 
c) Increasing ownership and sustainability. Irrigation component follows a demand-driven and 
participatory approach in which WUAs/farmers’ groups participate in subproject design, financing, 
execution and supervision and are fully responsible for Operation & Maintenance. This approach,

by ensuring subproject ownership, increases subproject sustainability and effective use and will be 
used for the new operation.  
d) Thinking scalability. The project cycle developed by the PIDD, especially the effective 
participation of beneficiaries from the design to the construction, has been adopted by the Provincial 
Government of Chimborazo as a public policy to develop any investment intervention in the future.  
e) Building Partnerships. Several partnerships between different organizations and institutions 
at local, national and international level have been developed during the preparation and 
implementation of the PIDD, and will be replicated in the new operation.  
 
21. The proposed project will also be designed taking into account some lessons learned from 
other similar operations in the region such as, for example, the PSI Sierra in Peru (P104760), which 
has very similar scope, activities and target group, or the PROSAP (P106684) in Argentina, which 
can bring experie nce on the construction of the project framework and the progressive process of 
delegating responsibilities to the sub-national level (Provinces). 
 
22. The proposed project (US$60 million in IBRD financing) will be implemented over a 
period of five years and comprises four components: (1) Investments for productive sub-projects; 
(2) Capacity building for institutional stakeholders and beneficiaries’ organizations; (3) Natural 
Resources Management Enhancement and; (4) Project Management. 
 
23. Component 1: Investments for productive sub-projects (estimated amount US$ 50M.). This 
component will finance subprojects aligned with the project objective and provincial priorities 
related to the following investments: (i) individual and/or collective small water storages (ponds); 
(ii) collective and/or individual on-farm investments for modernization of irrigation techniques 
(drip, sprinkler or modern gravity techniques) and; (iii) complementary works aiming at improving 
off-farm irrigation and drainage networks.  
 
24. Subproject proposals will be reviewed against a set of objective criteria in order to be 
eligible for financing, including consistency with project objectives and scope. To ensure the 
balanced and equitable allocation of public funding, subproject preparation will include specific 
selection criteria to be applied early on in the selection and approval process, which will include: (i) 
demand expressed by the potential beneficiaries, which should have sufficient organizational 
capacity to manage sustainable infrastructure; (ii) formal prioritization by the relevant Provincial 
Government preferentially in their Provincial Irrigation Plan; (iii) compliance with the requirements

26. Component 2: Capacity building for institutional stakeholders and beneficiaries’ 
organizations (estimated amount US$ 5 M.). This component will support a range of services that 
provide support for: (i) agricultural modernization and intensification to the beneficiaries and their 
organizations (Water Users Organizations and Farmers Organizations) and; (ii) institutional 
strengthening to the main institutional stakeholders (MAGAP central and regional offices, 
Provincial Governments / GADPs). 
 
27. Component 2 will finance consulting and non-consulting services, training and workshops 
and goods and equipment. Activities will include: (i) Extension services, training and Technical 
Assistance and; (ii) Institutional and organizational capacity building (see details in Annex 3). This 
training will be focused on improving and supporting the outcomes r elated with the subproject 
investments. 
 
28. Component 3: Natural Resources Management Enhancement (estimated amount US$ 1.5 
M.). This component aims at laying the foundations for conservation and sustainable management 
of watersheds and natural resources, in areas where investments on irrigation sub-projects will be 
developed. 
 
29. Component 3 will finance small investment and management subprojects of natural 
resources protection (reflorestation, protection of páramos, and conservation of watersheds) linked 
to the subprojects of Component 1. The component will adopt an integrated and participatory 
approach to watershed management intended to make rural populations more accountable and 
encourage them to manage their land and natural resources in a more sustainable manner. Thus, the 
component would contribute to: (i) protect watersheds by reducing or preventing erosion and 
sedimentation; (ii) increase the productivity and sustainability of agricultural production based on 
agroecological and agroforestry technologies; and (iii) strengthen the management of natural 
resources to improve the environment and living conditions.  
 
30. Component 3 will finance small works, consulting and non-consulting services, training and 
workshops and goods and equipment (see details in Annex 3). This component will be placed under 
the responsibility of the regional offices of MAGAP who, depending on the local capacities and the 
existence of services, will enter into agreements with the GADPs, consulting firms, local ONGs or 
community organizations for the preparation and implementation of subprojects. The procedures 
will be detailed in the operation manual. 
 
31. Component 4: Project Management (estimated amount US$ 3.5 M.). This component will 
support the functioning of the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) to be installed within the Sub-
Secretary of Irrigation and Drainage in the MAGAP in Quito and some eligible costs related to the 
Project on the regional offices of MAGAP and Provincial Governments/GADPs. The component 
will also finance Monitoring and Evaluation, impact evaluations, progress reports, and audits.  
 
32. The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) will be responsible for the overall administration of 
the Project, within the MAGAP in Quito. Component 4 will finance: consulting and non-consulting 
services, training and workshops, small works, goods and equipment and operating costs.

Track II - The review did authorize the preparation to continue

I. Introduction and Context
Country Context
India is a lower middle-income country with per-capita GDP of US$ 1,499 (2013).  From 2001 to 
2011, India’s economy performed well, with sustained annual GDP growth of 8%.  High rates of 
investment and savings contributed to this growth, as did strong exports. Yet more than 400 million 
people in India still subsist on less than US$ 1.25/day.  India faces challenges in reducing extreme 
poverty, curbing high malnutrition and achieving shared prosperity.  The Government of India has 
emphasized increased farm productivity as fundamental to India’s poverty reduction and growth 
strategy. Building relevant skills sets has been a persistent challenge across the economy.  
Educational institutions, particularly at the tertiary level, are critical to accelerate India’s emergence

in global markets, yet teaching is poorly linked with labor market demand, research and 
development, thereby producing graduates with limited problem-solving skills.

Sectoral and Institutional Context
Agriculture in India employs 52% of the labor force and is the main source of livelihood for 80% of 
the rural poor, but contributes only 14% to GDP and 10% to total exports. Women constitute about 
60% of the economically active population in agriculture and livestock. The Green Revolution in 
the late 1960s and 1970s, with investment in new seeds, production technologies, cultivation 
methods and irrigation practices, improved agricultural productivity and made India food-secure.  
Where the Green Revolution flourished – Haryana and Punjab – are today among the higher income 
states in the country.  However, agricultural productivity growth declined in the 1990s, rebounded 
in the 2000s, and today still remains low. Moreover, this growth has been largely price driven and 
heavily reliant on inputs rather than efficiency gains.  
 
At current Total Factor Productivity (TFP) growth, India’s domestic agricultural output will meet 
59% of the country’s 2030 projected food demand (GAP Report 2014).  Agricultural higher 
education can be the engine for increasing productivity through better skilled technicians, 
innovative research and extension linked to technologies and practices, common under the Land 
Grant model.  A 2014 Bank agricultural sector study argues that while India doubled investment in 
agricultural research and extension (0.4% of AgGDP in 1981 to 0.96% in 2011), the quality of 
innovation has suffered along with institutional capacity to adapt and remain relevant.  
Reawakening the “research-education-extension nexus” intrinsic to the Land Grant model can 
propel India’s agricultural innovation, farmers’ technology adoption and agriculture’s overall 
transformation.  In Brazil, for example, the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education 
Personnel (CAPES) and the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development 
(CNPq) have worked together to build and maintain high-quality faculty in universities nationwide. 
 
The National Agricultural Education System comprises 56 State Agricultural Universities (SAUs), 
one Central Agricultural University, and four Research Institutes with deemed-to-be university 
status.    The first SAU – G. B. Pant University of Agriculture and Technology, Pantanagar – was 
established in 1960 based on the US Land Grant model emphasizing the integration of research, 
education and extension.  Under the Indian Constitution, statutory control of agriculture (including 
agricultural education) lies with the respective State Governments while the Union Government 
coordinates and sets educational standards. In 1996, the Indian Council of Agricultural Research 
(ICAR) began voluntary SAU accreditation to establish norms and quality standards for agricultural 
higher education.  ICAR continues its financial support to SAUs for accreditation; to date, ICAR 
has accredited 43 SAUs.   
 
The face of Indian agriculture has changed.  Women producers must participate in and benefit from 
agricultural research, education, and extension. There is also growing private sector demand for 
skilled labor in all aspects of agriculture, particularly high-value agro-industry, food processing, and 
specialized knowledge-intensive areas such as water efficiency, food safety, and trade.  A 2014 
assessment of human resource requirements shows an annual deficit of 14,000 in satisfying the 
demand for degree holders in agricultural and allied sciences.   A 2010 National Academy of 
Agriculture Research Management study found a jobs deficit of 50% in agriculture and allied 
sciences relative to the anticipated demand in 2020.   SAUs must adapt to the rapidly changing 
agricultural sector and its increasing knowledge intensity, and prepare the high-quality human 
resources essential for any technology and innovation system to succeed.

Yet the once-impressive SAUs established during the Green Revolution have become less effective 
and less relevant in stimulating transformative change in Indian agriculture. The research-education-
extension synergy — strong in earlier years — has waned substantially and academic inbreeding 
has stunted teaching curricula, eroded faculty quality and weakened research and extension 
outcomes.  As a result, the SAU system is not attracting high-quality students to equip the next 
generation of talent to lead India’s agricultural growth, principally in the private sector. 
ICAR has taken the lead in analyzing the challenges facing agricultural higher education in India.  
This has led to an ambitious reform agenda for SAUs, spelled out in the 2013 Bhubaneshwar 
Declaration, emphasizing: (a) transparent governance; (b) financial and academic autonomy; (c) 
adequate and consistent funding; (d) standards and accreditation; (e) public-private partnerships; (f) 
revamped teaching curricula and methodologies; and (g) international cooperation.   Several 
challenges confront SAUs, among these: 
 
• Poor governance: Vice-chancellors tend to be political appointees and often have little role 
in setting budget priorities or allocations.  Overall accountability is weak and not linked to desired 
academic outcomes. 
• High faculty vacancy rates and pervasive academic inbreeding: Some 56% of SAU faculty 
positions are vacant, with minimal recent recruitment, leading to heavy workloads, poor teaching 
performance and scarce time available for research or extension. Limited contacts with national or 
international centers of excellence and weak linkages with industry, farms and the private sector 
have led to academic stagnation, at a time when competitiveness requires more such interaction. 
There are few incentives to spur faculty productivity in teaching, research or extension. 
• Disconnect between agricultural education and employment: The private sector generates 
nearly one-half of agricultural employment, yet curricula remain focused on the shrinking 
opportunities in the public sector. Importantly, curricula lack a problem-solving orientation. SAUs 
must strengthen job-driven programs, including entrepreneurship-focused courses, to build avenues 
for off-farm work and facilitate technology transfer from lab-to-land.  
• Capital development and financial management:   Salaries comprise up to 90% of SAUs’ 
budgets, funding is almost entirely sourced from the public sector and has not kept pace with 
increasing student admissions.  In contrast, Michigan State University, a model for Indian SAUs, 
sources 10% of its annual budget from public funds. SAUs must begin to raise their own resources 
through fee-based/market-oriented programs, sales of proprietary seed/planting material, 
consultancies and capital development initiatives. 
• Meeting globalization: Greater infusion of frontier science subjects (e.g., biotechnology, 
nanotechnology, precision and climate-resilient agriculture, information and communication 
technology), good trade practices, ethics of intellectual property rights and genetically modified 
crops, and market intelligence have become critical to promote efficiency, awareness, equity, and 
competitiveness in agriculture as India strives to cement its role as a global player in agriculture. 
• Forging service market development: Staffing of Agricultural Technology Management 
Agencies (ATMAs) and Krishi Vigyan Kendras-KVKs (Agriculture Science Centers) and other 
professional private and public agricultural service providers will require business and technical 
skills to meet the knowledge demanded by farmers, particularly women.  
 
The World Bank and ICAR have a long and fruitful collaboration, most recently through the 
National Agricultural Innovation Project (NAIP), National Agricultural Technology Project (NATP) 
and sector work.  The current ICAR reform priorities require further refinement and focus, and 
ICAR has requested World Bank support as a knowledge adjunct to the proposed project.

The challenges faced by SAUs mirror those faced in general by higher education in India.  The 
needs of the agricultural sector resonate with other sectors, i.e., highly trained workforce and 
relevant cutting-edge research.  The Bank’s Agriculture and Education Global Practices are 
collaborating on the proposed project to ensure that the SAU reform process benefits from 
innovations in both sectors across India and internationally.  Through strategic priority interventions 
at the Central and State levels, the proposed project would have far-reaching and long-term impacts 
on agricultural higher education in India.  The project would also incorporate disbursement-linked 
Indicators (DLIs) to build time-bound financial incentives for SAUs and ICAR in pursuit of the 
proposed reform agenda.

Relationship to CAS
The proposed project supports the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2013-17 and addresses the 
three engagement areas of integration, transformation and inclusion. These engagement areas 
foresee increased agricultural productivity and also support quality improvements of higher 
education to create a more skilled workforce that continuously improves the productivity of key 
sectors, including agriculture.   Further, by working with SAUs in low-income states, the proposed 
project supports the CPS strategy of improving their economic performance.  
 
The proposed project is a multi-Global Practice collaboration (Agriculture and Education) and is 
expected to support activities and results directly related to cross-cutting strategic areas of climate 
change, jobs, gender and public-private partnerships.

II. Proposed Development Objective(s)
Proposed Development Objective(s) (From PCN)
The project development objective is to increase educational relevance and quality in selected State 
Agricultural Universities. 
 
Equity, especially gender and caste-based equity, is a cross-cutting theme of the proposed project 
and would be tracked through the key performance indicators.

Key Results (From PCN)
The following key performance indicators are proposed: 
 
1. Percentage change in SAU faculty scientific effectiveness as measured by h-index [quality]; 
2. Percentage change in level and source(s) of SAU revenue [quality]; 
3. Increased awareness and uptake of locally-relevant agricultural research [relevance];  
4. Increased student retention rates, disaggregated by gender and SC/ST [quality, relevance 
and equity]; and  
5. Increased satisfaction rates of students, farmers and agribusinesses with SAU curricula and 
service provision [quality and relevance].

III. Preliminary Description
Concept Description
The proposed project addresses strategic reforms in agricultural higher education at the state level 
(targeting SAUs) and the central level (focused on ICAR).  Selected SAUs would pilot a range of 
innovations in education, research and extension under diverse settings.   In so doing, these SAUs

will test options to create 21st century educational institutions to successfully meet the current and 
future challenges facing India’s agricultural sector. These institutions will attract a diverse cadre of 
high-quality students, train them with labor-market relevant skills, nurture research talent and 
ensure knowledge flows between lab and land. The second set of reforms will empower ICAR by 
strengthening its capacity to provide strategic support to SAUs nationwide.     
 
The project would likely consist of three components: 
 
Component 1 – Support to State Agricultural Universities – addresses the need to raise educational 
quality and relevance in SAUs and create knowledge and technology hubs for priority themes in 
support of agricultural transformation.  The component, which would absorb most of project 
finance, would have two sub-components: 
 
Sub-component 1a – Investments toward 21st Century State Agricultural Universities – would 
target reform-ready SAUs and States (applying verifiable criteria) and support Institutional 
Development Plans (IDPs), developed through multi-stakeholder processes, that undertake key 
governance reforms, finance new and refurbished research and teaching facilities, curricula and 
faculty development, training for administrators, strengthening locally relevant research, student 
placement and technical assistance. Supported IDPs would also emphasize universities’ exploring of 
alternative income streams, such as: tuition; alumni contributions; competitively-selected research 
projects; patents; joint ventures; extension services; consultancy services; and special courses for 
mid-career professionals. These diverse activities would not only generate own financial resources 
for SAUs, but also link them to the national and global knowledge economy, thereby further 
enhancing their relevance.  By focusing on income-earning capacity, SAUs would also create 
openings for sustained private sector participation.  Suitable twinning arrangements with foreign 
universities would also be explored, as would innovative pilots for research dissemination and 
mechanisms for internal revenue generation.  
 
Sub-component 1b – Investments in Centers for Advanced Agricultural Science and Technology – 
would support SAUs in establishing interdisciplinary centers for teaching, research and extension on 
critical agriculture and rural development topics (e.g., agricultural adaptation to climate change; 
land and water use efficiency, scalable technology and mechanization, agro-industry, agro-
entrepreneurship).  Multi-stakeholder consultations would inform the selection of geographic 
locations and core themes under the sub-component.  The sub-component would finance research 
and teaching equipment, faculty and scientist development fellowships, scholarships, and costs 
associated with twinning arrangements with similar centers outside and within India. 
 
Component 2 – Investments in ICAR for Leadership in Agricultural Higher Education – would: (a)  
empower ICAR by financing its own internal reforms to enhance its effectiveness in coordinating, 
guiding and managing agricultural research and education nationwide; and (b) support ICAR in its 
interactions with SAUs and key stakeholders nationwide through interventions that increase the 
quality and relevance of agricultural education.   The component would have two sub-components: 
 
Sub-component 2a – Investments in ICAR to support excellence in SAUs – would leverage ICAR’s 
comparative advantage in assessing systemic challenges ac ross all SAUs and incubating solutions.  
Among the interventions financed would be: (a) digital information systems for SAU data collection 
and analysis to improve quality metrics in agricultural higher education; (b) an improved curricula 
review process to tighten its relevance in today’s dynamic job market; (c) enhanced methods to

consolidate and disseminate global best-practices (e.g., benchmarking) in agricultural higher 
education; and (d) institutionalization of stakeholder and advisory inputs to better inform research, 
education and extension across the SAU system.          
Subcomponent 2b – ICAR innovation grants to SAUs – would be open to all SAUs nationwide and  
support interventions that would include: (a) quality assurance (e.g., accreditation); (b) next-
generation management information and financial management systems to increase transparency 
and administrative efficiency; (c) campus student placement offices to facilitate stronger linkages 
between academics and future employment opportunities; (d) theme-based competitive grants to 
students, faculty and academic departments to promote inter-state and international collaboration, 
including matching funds from the private sector; and (e) needs-based equipment, training and 
technical assistance.  
 
Component 3 – Project Management and Learning – would support ICAR’s project management, 
primarily through its Education Division, to administer, supervise, monitor and evaluate overall 
project implementation.  The component would also support the formation of an external advisory 
board to guide ICAR throughout project implementation.

Track I - The review did authorize the preparation to continue

I. Introduction and Context
Country Context
Background. China's success in reducing extreme poverty during the economic reform period 
(1978?2014) is widely recognized. Over the last three decades, China has lifted over 750 million 
people out of poverty, which represents 89 percent of global poverty reduction during that period. 
World Bank estimates show that the number of absolute poor (that is, those people consuming less 
than $1.25 per day in PPP terms) in China declined from 84 percent in 1981 to 6.3 percent in 2011. 
Based on different poverty lines, official government estimates confirm a similar sharp decline in 
poverty over these years, and the number of the people who lived on less than US$2 per day was 
approximately 367 million or 27.2 percent of the total population. Using China's rural poverty line 
of annual per capital net income below CNY 2,300 (2010 constant process and which is slightly 
above the 1.25US$/day in PPP terms), the number of poor people living in rural areas declined to 
70.2 million in 2014. This represents continued decline of rural poverty from 17.2 percent in 2010 
to 8.5 percent in 2013.

Economic growth has been a key driver for poverty reduction in China. From 1981 to 2011, real 
GDP per capita grew at average annual rate of 9.1 percent. The relationship between annualized 
GDP growth and poverty reduction during this period suggests that poverty headcount index 
(measured by US$ 1.25 per capita PPP line) fell annually by 0.99 percentage points for each 
percentage point increase of the GDP per capita. Improvements in access to public services, such as 
education and health, has been another driver of poverty reduction. All levels of education, 
employment in non-agricultural activities, and migration have been identified as critical forces 
driving poverty reduction. 
 
Geographically, the remaining pockets of poverty, including chronic poverty, are largely 
concentrated in rural areas, especially in mountainous and remote areas in western provinces of 
China with ethnic minorities. These areas are usually characterized by challenging natural 
environment with water scarcity, low soil fertility and poor endowment with natural resources. The 
Government has classified 14 zones (crossing provincial boundaries) as the focus for its poverty 
alleviation efforts. The 14 zones contain 680 nationally designated poverty counties which benefit 
from special financial support under the government??s rural poverty alleviation programs. Majority 
of these poverty counties are concentrated in mountainous areas of central and western China and 
among ethnic minority and other disadvantaged groups, including people with disabilities and 
elderly.

Sectoral and Institutional Context
Guangxi ranks the fifth province in the nation in terms of the absolute poor numbers.  Out of its 
total population of 52.4 million in 2013 there were 6.3 million poor people Guangxi which gives 
poverty incidence rate of 14.9 percent.  Majority of these poor live in rural areas and over 80 
percent of the poor people are from ethnic minority groups. Some 17.1 million people belong to 
various ethnic minority groups, making it a largest ethnic minority population in China. The 
province has 28 national level designated poverty counties and it is a recipient of a significant 
portion of national poverty reduction funds from the central government. In 2013, the net income 
per capita in these counties remained 59.6 percent of the national average.  The main causes of the 
poverty are low levels of human capital (poor education attainment levels and lack of skills needed 
to participate in modern economy) in particular in mountainous rural areas; poor natural resources 
base and limited infrastructure (roads, water and electricity). 
 
China has seen a rapid growth in the number of farmer cooperatives since the Law on Specialized 
Farmer Cooperatives promulgated in 2006. In March 2015 there were about 1.3 million specialized 
cooperatives in China. In some of the proposed project counties, formally registered cooperatives 
were almost non-existent before 2009. Their numbers are now growing rapidly and cooperatives are 
allowing both enhanced presence of the agribusiness sector and small entrepreneur initiatives. 
However, while most cooperatives are now recognized as economic entities, they are often small-
scale and lack management skills. The project is expected to benefit from the national legal 
framework for farmer cooperatives, which is expected to be updated in 2015.

Relationship to CAS
The proposed project is consistent with the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), approved in 2012.  
The project would support the CPS's strategic theme two: promoting more inclusive development, 
by geographically focusing on lagging regions and small towns and by supporting policies and 
demonstration projects that address inequalities. It would contribute to the CPS outcome 2.3:

enhancing opportunities in rural areas and small towns, by piloting new ways to boost rural incomes 
and reduce poverty under the umbrella of the new Poverty Reduction for China's Rural Areas 
Strategy (2011-2020) and by promoting inclusive innovation to decrease disparities.

II. Proposed Development Objective(s)
Proposed Development Objective(s) (From PCN)
The proposed PDO is to increase income opportunities for rural households in selected poverty 
counties of Guangxi.

Key Results (From PCN)
The achievement of the PDO would be measured by: (a) the number of project beneficiaries joining 
a new organizational arrangement decomposed by poverty levels and gender; and (b) the number of 
project supported cooperatives making profit.

III. Preliminary Description
Concept Description
Project Area: The proposed project areas are located in the rural areas of the Dian Gui Mountain 
Degraded Area. Within this area 10project counties under the two cities of Baise and Hechi are 
proposed. These include: Tiandong, Tianlin, Leye, Donglan, Bama, Fengshan, Dahua, and Pingguo 
County, and Yizhou City. All of the selected counties/city are characterized by a particular high 
level of poverty combined with poor natural resource conditions, difficulties in water management, 
limited availability of farm land,low levels of technology and a high percentage of ethnic minorities. 
 
Proposed Project Components: The proposed project would consist of the following four 
components with a preliminary cost estimate of US$182 million including a Bank loan of US$100 
million and counterpart funding of about US$82 million equivalent implemented over five years: 
 
a) Component 1: Improvement of Pro-Poor Value Chains. The component aims to address 
market failures in the development of agricultural and non-agricultural rural value chains and key 
industries with a particular focus on linking poor rural households with higher value markets. The 
component would finance the Cooperative Development Fund (CDF), which would provide grant 
financing to newly or existing cooperatives. It would also aim to establish Competitive Grant Fund 
for Enterprises which would provide matching grants to finance enterprise investments in order to 
demonstrate linkages and benefit sharing with poor farmers/households.  
 
b) Component 2: Improving Public Infrastructure and Services. The component would support 
the establishment and strengthening of public infrastructure and service systems in support of value 
chain/key industry development under the Component 1. It would provide financing for rural 
infrastructure such as rural roads, small-scale irrigation and drainage infrastructure, small water 
storage facilities, land levelling, IT infrastructure, public market facilities, etc. The component 
would also support public services, such as product certification, developing and registration of 
local/regional brands, branding and protection of ethnic minority product features, market and 
production risk management as well as strategic product marketing and promotion.  
 
c) Component 3: Enhancing Investments in Poor Areas. The component would improve and 
facilitate investments in poor areas by existing and new entrepreneurs and business entities such as 
Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), migrant returnees, or cooperatives through establishing

Decision

I. Project Context
Country Context
Myanmar is the largest country in mainland Southeast Asia with a land area of about 654,000 
square km. It is located between Bangladesh, China, India, Lao PDR, and Thailand, with more than 
2,800 miles of coastline. It is also one of the poorest countries in East Asia, with an estimated 
poverty headcount between 26 and 37 percent, depending on the methodology used, among its 
population of around 52 million. The new government which took in office in March 2011 has 
introduced sweeping political and economic reforms. Myanmar is now embarking on a triple 
transition: from an authoritarian military system to democratic governance; from a centrally 
directed economy to a market-based economy; and from 60 years of conflict to peace in the border 
areas. From a strategic point of view, agriculture is of central importance for achieving the twin 
goals of ending extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity in Myanmar. The sector accounts 
for about 36 percent of the GDP, which is largest share of GDP among ASEAN members. Rice 
production constitutes about 30 percent of agricultural GDP and covers 70 percent of cultivated 
land. The sector generates about 53 percent of total employment and is source of livelihoods for 
about 70 percent of population who live in rural areas. The poverty headcount, which ranges from 
26 to 37 percent depending on methodologies, is highest in upland areas, but in absolute terms most

rural poor live in the Dry Zone (34 percent), followed by the Delta region (25 percent), according to 
the Systematic Country Diagnostic carried out by the World Bank Group in 2014. In the lowland 
areas of the Delta and the Dry Zones where population densities are highest, poverty is associated 
with landlessness or limited farmland holdings. The rural poor in these areas depend primarily on 
farm income generation and on-farm seasonal and other informal labor opportunities. Among the 
rural households who own land persistent poverty stems from a combination of low productivity of 
farming systems and high vulnerability of these systems to adverse weather events, especially 
drought in areas featuring limited or unreliable access to irrigation services. The government places 
high priority on the development of the agriculture sector and sees it as the basis for food security, 
poverty reduction, job creation, and export promotion.

  

Sectoral and institutional Context
Myanmar has a favorable agricultural potential. It has abundant water resources -- 20,870 m3 per 
person compared to the Asia-wide average of 3,948 m3 per person -- and relatively abundant 
agricultural land, which translates into the highest agricultural land per worker in the East Asia and 
Pacific (EAP) region of about 1.1 ha/worker, compared to 0.8 ha/worker in Thailand and Cambodia 
and less than half of Myanmar figure in Vietnam and Indonesia). According to the Myanmar 
Census of Agriculture (2010), the average farm area is 2.6 hectares, which is the second largest in 
EAP after Thailand (3.1 ha) (and about five times of that prevailing in Vietnam’s Mekong Delta 
region). Finally, it has diverse agro-ecological conditions which would allow it to produce a wide 
range of temperate, sub-tropical and tropical crops. The current agricultural productivity is 
constrained by under-supply of public services (extension, basic education), low levels of 
technology adaption and farm mechanization, insecure irrigation water supply, limited access to 
affordable credit suitable for agricultural production cycles, and rising labor costs that have trapped 
farmers in poverty even within double cropping systems in irrigated areas. There is a lack of an 
overarching and clear agricultural sector strategy in Myanmar to guide public sector and donor 
spending programs. The effectiveness of current public spending programs is also affected by the 
nature of agricultural services provided to smallholders. Too often, public goods and services 
provided to farmers, such as irrigation and extension, are supply driven with little consideration of 
farmer interests.  For example, farmers’ crop choices could be sometimes restricted by local 
authorities at regional and district level who make decisions on water allocations. The limited 
extension services are often focused on the promotion a single crop rather than helping farmers to 
overcome problems they are facing in their farming systems, such as soil infertility and fertilizer 
use, pest management, increasing labor cost, etc. At the same time, farmers’ incentives to invest in 
better water, soil and crop management technologies may be constrained by their lack of security on 
water and land use rights, as well as issues related to the underdeveloped marketing systems and 
high volatility of agricultural prices. Many irrigation schemes function below their potential 
because of inappropriate operation of reservoirs and a lack of responsive irrigation system 
management.  For example, while about 2 million hectares are equipped with irrigation and 
drainage infrastructure, a second crop is being grown on only about 28 percent of this area 
(2011/12). This may reflect both technical deficiencies as well as uncertainties farmers are facing in 
marketing their crops. While primary irrigation structures (dams, canals) seem in general in good 
shape there are problems in getting water to farmer fields. With improved management and a 
change in cropping patterns, including to non-rice crops, it is possible to expand the cropping areas 
and cropping intensity. This may necessitate minor structural alterations to the irrigation schemes to 
improve drainage and, for some fields, to which improves in-field drainage through land leveling. 
However, improving irrigation management is not sufficient to increase farm incomes. This is

because farmers often do not possess the necessary agronomic technologies and skills to take 
advantage of an improved access to irrigation. The current public extension system is under-
resourced and extension personnel rarely visit farmers to provide advice on the correct fertilizers 
rates to use improved technologies such as improved seeds. There is also some reluctance by 
farmers to change from growing rice to more water efficient crops, such as legumes and sesame. 
This may be partly caused by the rigidity of irrigation systems which does not offer enough 
flexibility in on-field water delivery and thus result in a lack of control over water levels on 
individual farm plots. The general under-capitalization of smallholder farming systems in Myanmar 
caused by decades of public under-investment and policy inefficiency fuels the risk of a vicious 
cycle of declining terms of trade. The development of smallholder agriculture in Myanmar thus 
requires significant public investments in institutional development, technology generation and 
dissemination, rural infrastructure, and human capital for years to come.  The Ministry of 
Agriculture and Irrigation (MOAI) has made significant investments in irrigation infrastructure bet 
ween the 1980s and 2000s which can serve as platform for development of smallholder farming 
systems. Many of these schemes host large numbers of smallholders who have the potential to 
respond to public investments under a supportive environment. These schemes would offer good 
opportunities for landscape-based rural development approaches that address agricultural, natural 
resource management, and social development goals.

II. Proposed Development Objectives
The Project Development Objective is to increase crop yields and cropping intensity in the selected 
existing irrigation sites in Bago East, Nay Pyi Taw, Mandalay, and Sagaing regions.

III. Project Description
Component Name
1. Irrigation and Drainage Management
Comments (optional)
The component seeks to enhance more responsive and reliable provision of irrigation and drainage 
services in the project areas to enable an increase in irrigation area coverage, a resulting better farm 
productivity and better distribution of benefits between upstream and downstream users. It will 
initiate institutional change required for the provision of farmer-responsive irrigation services and 
finance the improvement and rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage infrastructure covering about 
35,000 ha within up to 8 selected schemes in the project regions and will pilot 2-3 small land 
improvement sites in these schemes. The component would support also inclusive land 
administration activities in the selected project irrigation sites.

Component Name
2. Farm Advisory and Technical Services
Comments (optional)
The component seeks to enhance MOAI technology development and farm advisory services at

V. Implementation
The MOAI will be the implementing agency of the project. The Project will be governed at the 
Union level by the National Project Steering Committee (NPSC) and at the township level by the 
Township Agricultural Coordination Committees (ACC). The project will be managed by the 
Project Management Unit (PMU) which will be integrated within the existing structures of 
Department of Irrigation (ID). The PMU will be located in Nay Pyi Taw in MOAI headquarters. 
PMU would be responsible for day-to-day management and coordination of the project. It will be 
responsible for the project financial management and procurement functions.  It will ensure that 
annual work plans are prepared, budgeted and implemented in a timely manner, and that 
management of project funds is in line with the provisions of the project’s eligibility guidelines. The 
PMU will be responsible for management of the Designated Accounts; disbursement of project 
funds and replenishment of the project bank accounts and preparing and submitting withdrawal 
applications; and consolidation of annual work plans, budget planning, arrange for project annual 
audit, project reporting and M&E.  
 
Implementation of the project activities will be carried out by five technical departments 
(Department of Irrigation/ID, Department of Agriculture/DOA, Department of Agricultural 
Research/DAR, Agricultural Mechanization Department/AMD, and Settlements and Land Records 
Department/SLRD) through their central, regional, district and township level structures. ID will be 
the lead agency for the implementation of the Component 1, with technical inputs from SLRD and 
AMD, and DOA would be the lead agency for Component 2, with technical inputs from DAR and 
AMD. The implementation of filed activities will be done by respective township level staff with the 
supervision and technical backstopping from the team of central/regional/district level Subject 
Matter Specialists (SMS). The implementing departments are responsible for the initiation of the 
procurement activities as per work plan, provision of technical specifications and TORs to PMU and 
serve as members of the evaluation committee; accounting for funds on their respective Operating 
Accounts and at district level accounts and provision of financial information to PMU for the 
compilation of the financial documents; and preparation of the annual work plans of their respective 
sub-components and activities, and provision of information and indicators for the PMU for the

consolidated project reporting. The ACCs are township level structural coordination bodies, which 
are responsible for the coordination of crop planning and extension activities, and makes irrigation 
water allocation and distribution decisions. The main function of the ACC under the project would 
be to provide a platform for joint (MOAI-farmer) planning and monitoring of project activities in 
targeted irrigation schemes. Implementation of the project activities at the township level will be 
done by the Project Implementation Committees, which is a sub-committee under ACC, and it 
includes township level staff of the implementing MOAI departments.

Appraisal Review Decision 
(from Decision Note)

Appraisal was carried out from March 17 to 25.

I. Project Context
Country Context
Morocco has been on a steady path of growth in the past decades, which has proved relatively 
resilient in the face of the recent global economic slowdown. Growth averaged 4.8 percent over 
2001-12 compared to 2.8 percent in the 1990s, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita 
doubled from 2001 to 2012 reaching US$2,951, unemployment declined from 13.6 percent in 2000 
to 9 percent in 2012, and absolute poverty decreased from 15.3 percent in 2001 to 8.8 percent in 
2008. 
 
The Arab Spring that has swept the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region in early 2011 
spurred a peaceful political transformation in Morocco. Morocco had engaged on a wide-ranging 
reform program, with the adoption of a new constitution through a popular referendum on July 1, 
2011. The new constitution lays the foundation for extended regionalization as a democratic and 
decentralized system of governance. It also contributes to improving the status of women through 
the adoption of the principle of gender equality and through provisions on increasing the

participation of women in decision-making bodies. In November 2011, parliamentary elections 
followed the promulgation of the constitution, leading to the formation of a four-party coalition 
government that has embraced the constitution's principles and called for more social solidarity and 
inclusion.  
 
Inequality, poverty, and vulnerability remain important challenges in Morocco. A quarter of the 
population is still economically vulnerable (near-poverty). There are persistent disparities as 70 
percent of poverty is still rural, and most development indicators in rural areas lag behind urban 
areas, largely as a result of difficult geography, deteriorating infrastructure, poor access to basic 
services, and limited capital investments to improve labor value added and hence returns to self-
employment and contract labor. Ten percent of Morocco’s 13.4 million rural residents lived below 
the poverty line in 2011. Rural poverty exacerbates gender disparity with relatively higher illiteracy 
and primary school dropout rates for rural women, and higher infant and maternal mortality. 
 
Morocco has engaged in a dynamic process towards strengthening economic opportunities and 
social inclusion. Several high profile development programs (e.g. the second phase of the National 
Human Development Initiative, INDH) and new sectoral strategies in the areas of education, 
employment, and youth have been initiated. Nonetheless, additional efforts are needed to support 
the country-led reforms. The movements associated with the political transition and constitutional 
changes generate pressure on the Moroccan State for credible and faster reforms, notably in the 
areas of job creation and improvement of the quality of public services delivered.

  

Sectoral and institutional Context
Agriculture is central to Morocco’s economy, as evidenced by the strong correlation among GDP 
and agriculture GDP. Over the last agricultural campaign, thanks to favorable weather, the sector 
represented 15.6 percent of GDP, contributing the most to the country’s overall growth. The 20 
percent increase in agricultural production allowed Morocco’s GDP to jump from 2.7 percent in 
2012 to 4.4 percent in 2013. The agricultural sector represents a critical element in the country’s 
demographic and socio-economic situation, generating 40 percent of the jobs nationwide, mostly in 
rural areas where the majority of the poor live. The sector is largely composed of small farmers 
mostly dedicated to low-value agriculture, but also counts a limited group of dynamic and well 
performing large farmers with state-of-the-art technologies and well integrated into the national and 
international markets. The sector exhibits great gender disparities. Women’s work is typically 
unpaid (in 2003-04, 58 percent of cases; in 2008, 91 percent), or it is seasonal and unstable when 
remunerated (59 percent of cases in 2003-04; 84 percent in 2008). 
 
Irrigation increases both the level and stability of incomes in rural areas. Despite representing only 
16 percent of the cultivated land, irrigated agriculture contributes to about half of the agriculture 
GDP, 75 percent of agricultural exports, and 15 percent of overall merchandise exports. The 
country has 1.46 million ha of permanently irrigated land, 682,600 ha of which are part of nine 
Large Scale Irrigation (LSI) perimeters operated by nine public agricultural development agencies 
(ORMVA). ORMVAs are autonomous agencies under the supervision of the Ministry of 
Agriculture and Maritime Fisheries (MAPM), with the responsibility of constructing new irrigation 
schemes, rehabilitating and modernizing existing ones, ensuring Operation and Maintenance 
(O&M) of irrigation and drainage facilities, and providing extension services to farmers. The 
remaining area is shared between small and medium scale traditional irrigation schemes managed 
by Water Users Associations (WUA, 334,000 ha) and private irrigation (441,000 ha). Morocco is

among the first countries with experience in irrigation Public-Private Partnership (PPP). In 2004, it 
launched the first successful irrigation PPP in the world, in the citrus production perimeter of 
Guerdane. Other PPP are at various stages of preparation (Azemmour Bir Jdid, Dar Khrofa, 
Chtouka). 
 
The ability of irrigated agriculture to continue to drive shared prosperity in Morocco is threatened 
by increasing water scarcity. Reduced rainfall, increased rainfall variability, reduced run off, 
groundwater depletion, and degradation of water resources have reached alarming levels. Annual 
renewable water resources total 22 billion m3, corresponding to 730 m3/inhabitant, which is below 
the United Nations’ threshold for indicating water stress (1,000 m3/inhabitant). The water deficit is 
estimated at around 2 billion m3. Climate change is expected to worsen this situation. Impacts of 
climate change are already visible in Morocco: the proportion of dry years increased by four times 
and surface water availability decreased by 35 percent between the period 1947-1976 and 
1977-2006. Water scarcity impacts irrigated agriculture in different ways: 
• In private irrigation, which largely relies on groundwater, reduced and more variable 
rainfall translates into groundwater overexploitation. The majority of the wells are neither 
registered nor monitored, and improvement in water pumping technologies and butane subsidy 
facilitate overextraction. Decreasing groundwater levels have a specific equity dimension, 
impacting at first smallholders with less capacity for drilling and pumping deeper.  
• In LSI perimeters, which rely on surface water, water scarcity translates into reduced 
volumes allocated to farmers and limits summer crops production. While agriculture remains the 
primary user of surface water, accounting for about 85 percent of the withdrawals, severe 
restrictions in irrigation have been common in the last 15 years. LSI perimeters in the Oum er Rbia 
river basin received, on average, only 60 percent of the water volumes they were designed for. 
These volumes were consistently lower than the water allocation stated in the Regional Masterplans 
for Integrated Water Resources Management (PDAIRE). Wherever possible, farmers in LSI 
perimeters have been making up for this shortfall by complementing water allocated by the 
ORMVAs with groundwater, bearing the extra pumping costs and further aggravating groundwater 
depletion.  
Farmers in LSI perimeters face structural constraints that limit the productive use of the scarce 
water resource. These include among others: collective water management, rigid water distribution 
rules, frequent shut-downs, unequal access to water, and land tenure issues. All of these constraints 
lock farmers in LSI perimeters into a low-risk and low return equilibrium in which they carry out 
low input, extensive farming focused on low value crops, and avoid more capital intensive 
strategies which allow for high value products and higher returns but bear higher risks in case of 
water deficiencies. 
 
LSI perimeters suffer from aging irrigation networks and poor Operation and Maintenance (O&M). 
The ORMVAs have limited budget to improve this situation. Recovery rates in Morocco are 
amongst the best in MENA, varying between 68 and 100 percent, with an average of 76 percent 
(2010). In some LSI perimeters, water tariffs are insufficient to cover the operation and 
maintenance (O&M) costs, and even more so the amortization costs, translating into the need for 
subsidies from the Government. Tariffs in LSI perimeters vary between 0.27 and 0.77DH/m3 
depending on the perimeters and the associated energy bill, compared to 1.30 to 1.80DH/m3 in 
perimeters managed through PPP. While there was an increase in O&M budget since 2009 (average 
2001-08: Tadla DH14.6 M, Doukkala: DH18.6 M; average 2009-13: Tadla DH31.1 M, Doukkala 
DH36.8 M), the allocation remains insufficient to meet the needs. Cost recovery rates in Morocco 
are amongst the highest in MENA, varying between, 68 and 100 percent, with an average of 76

percent (2010). While the recovery of water bills should be improved in the LSI perimeters were 
the most important arrears are generated, this increase would not be sufficient to meet the financial 
needs of the ORMVAs. Consequently, a plan to increase water tariffs in LSI perimeters was laid out 
in 2011, but it sparked protests by farmers, which led the Government of Morocco (GoM) to 
postpone the measure. A political economy analysis of the irrigation sector reform, revealed that 
there is typically no capacity to pay problem, and that the main reason for farmers’ opposition was 
the lack of direct improvements in service quality associated with tariff increase. 
 
The GoM is putting in place incentives, investments, and institutional reforms to ensure greater 
returns at the farm and overall economy levels in light of increasingly restricted water resource. 
This is done through two synergic strategies: 
• The Morocco Green Plan (PMV) aims to double the agriculture sector’s value-added and 
create 1.5 million jobs by 2020, thus transforming the sector into a stable source of growth, 
competitiveness, and broad-based economic development. In addition to its transversal institutional 
and policy reforms, the PMV comprises two Pillars reflecting the dualistic nature of Moroccan 
agriculture: Pillar I targets commercial farmers and their integration into the national and 
international markets, while Pillar II targets small farmers mainly in marginal areas. Under both 
pillars, technology and organizational support is provided to implement an agri-food chain 
approach linking farmers to market. The Agricultural Development Fund (FDA), the GoM’s 
principal agricultural subsidy instrument, has been reformed and support measures aligned with the 
strategic directions of the PMV. Since PMV’s launch in 2008, production has increased by 45 
percent, agricultural exports have risen by 18 percent, and 77,000 permanent jobs have been 
created. 
• The National Plan for Saving Water in Irrigation (PNEEI) promotes more productive water 
use by introducing efficient irrigation technologies (mainly drip irrigation) on 555,000 ha of the 
country’s irrigated land by 2020, of which 335,000 ha in private farms and 220,000 ha in LSI 
perimeters. This process is supported though the FDA, with up to 100 percent subsidy for the 
adoption of drip and microsprinkler irrigation, and up to 70 percent subsidy for sprinkler irrigation. 
Since PNEEI’s launch in 2008, the adoption of drip irrigation has been proceeding at a fast pace in 
privately developed irrigation areas, with over 200,000 ha completed (60 percent of the 2020 
target). In LSI perimeters, conversion is ongoing on 57,000 ha only, due to the need for prior 
investments in the irrigation networks. The figure is expected to increase steadily in the coming 
future, considering that pre-feasibility studies in LSI perimeters have been completed for 100,000 
ha. While impacts remain to be observed, field experiments in Tadla demonstrated that agricultural 
water productivity (defined as value of produce per unit of water used) could be doubled by 
switching from the traditional surface irrigation to improved water management under drip 
irrigation. 
 
The Large Scale Irrigation Modernization project is fully aligned with the comprehensive reform 
process of Morocco. The project supports the ORMVAs of Tadla, Haouz, Doukkala and Gharb in 
providing farmers located in the LSI perimeters with an improved water service. This means 
individual access (rather than collective), on-demand (rather than on rotation), reliable (with faster 
re-establishment of the service in case of shut-downs), and equitable (in terms of flow and pressure 
across the irrigation network). Targeted farmers will be freed up of some structural constraints and 
have the opportunity to improve their farming choices, adopting improved irrigation technologies 
(mainly drip irrigation), which are more efficient in the use of the scarce water resource and better 
suited for high-value crops.

I. Introduction and Context
Country Context
The Chinese Government has always made poverty reduction an important goal and task of national 
development and China’s success in reducing poverty has been remarkable, an achievement that is 
acknowledged worldwide.  In the mid-1980s, the Government started the development-oriented 
poverty reduction programs in rural areas. Subsequently, the Government formulated and 
implemented the Seven-year Priority Poverty Reduction Program (1994-2000) and the Outline for 
Poverty Reduction and Development of China’s Rural Areas (2001-2010). After three decades of 
successful poverty alleviation and strong economic growth that has lifted some 600 million people 
out of poverty, the rate of poverty reduction, however, is beginning to show signs of becoming less

responsive to broad-based growth. In addition, with increasing rural-urban disparities and diverging 
living standards, the Government recognized that the number of remaining rural poor was likely to 
be underestimated and adjustments to the previous poverty reduction policy were needed to better 
understand the patters of the remaining rural poverty and to integrate traditional rural poverty 
reduction with rural-urban transformation and urbanization policies.  
 
Consequently, in 2011, the Government revised the rural poverty line from CNY1,196 (2009) to 
CNY2,300 (US$361) which increased the number of rural poor from 27 million in 2010 to 128 
million in 2011. In addition, the State Council’s Leading Group for Poverty Reduction and 
Development released the Outline for Development-oriented Poverty Reduction for China’s Rural 
Areas (2011-2020) to provide a new strategic direction for addressing rural poverty. The strategy 
complements the traditional geographical targeting of designated poverty counties with the concept 
of adjacent destitute mountain areas of which 14 are prioritized for comprehensive regional 
development investments. The new strategy aims to eliminate hunger and elementary needs by 
2020, achieve a growth rate in rural per-capita income in poor areas that is above the national 
average, and promote the convergence of human development indicators and public services 
coverage across rural and urban areas. To narrow the rural-urban gap, the strategy lays out a broad 
approach that includes rural industrialization based on comparative advantage, infrastructure 
development, relocation and village consolidation, rural-urban integration, comprehensive public 
service provision and expansion of household-based social protection programs, such as the 
minimum living allowance (dibao), rural pension, and healthcare, and education, family planning, 
and environmental management.

Sectoral and Institutional Context
The project is proposed to be implemented in Gansu, Sichuan, and Guizhou provinces.  The three 
provinces face the common challenge of persistent rural poverty in remote rural areas.  Many of the 
project areas are traditional semi-subsistence areas where the poverty rate ranges between 30 to 50 
percent.  Agriculture remains an important source of local employment and income but geographic 
and climatic conditions, labor migration, underinvestment, and underdeveloped infrastructure pose 
challenges to future agricultural development.  In all three provinces, a gradual restructuring of the 
agricultural sector is needed to allow productivity and farm income to increase and to overcome 
constraints to agriculture modernization.  
 
Gansu Province.  Project counties are situated in the Liupan Mountains of Gansu in northwestern 
China.  Project areas have comparative advantages in horticulture, and several counties have 
successfully developed advanced production and marketing bases for apple, pear, grapes, medicinal 
herbs, and potato.  Still, rural poverty is high, often above 40 percent.  Poverty appears not so much 
rooted in poor production potential but more in the dominance of enterprises in the horticulture 
sector which appear to capture a considerable share of revenue in the value-chain while relatively 
little value is reaching the household or farm level.  One of the challenges in Gansu under this 
project is to strengthen the institutional environment for smallholders through the promotion of 
effective farmer cooperative arrangements that allow farmers to participate effectively in the 
modernization of the sector and to benefit from the high-value agricultural production chains. 
 
Sichuan Province.  Project areas are located in the Wumeng and Wuliang Mountains of southern 
Sichuan.  They are characterized by high mountains, narrow and steep valleys, and very limited flat 
or terraced land for farming.  Per capita farmland is often less than half a mu or about 0.03 hectares.  
Altitudes within one county range from several hundred to over 4,000 meters above sea level and

agro-climatic conditions vary widely.  Alpine meadows and shrublands are generally used of 
livestock grazing, often in unsustainable ways with visible degradation of vegetation and soils. At 
lower elevations, steep slopes and narrow valleys are used for cropping and erosion risk is high. 
 
Local communities belong nearly exclusively to the Yi Minority.  Yi language is used widely while 
only few people speak Mandarin Chinese in rural areas. Due to the remoteness of these areas, the 
unique cultural background of the population, as well as low education levels, communities are not 
well integrated into the mainstream society and labor mobility is limited as compared to other areas. 
Development opportunities are limited as well; and investments in public service expansion appear 
to be prohibitively expensive in many remote locations.   The development challenge in Sichuan is 
to identify and focus on those project areas with long-term development potential and to promote 
agricultural production systems that can generate income and are environmentally sustainable. 
Opportunities exist for producing and primary processing of higher value and niche-market 
products, such as walnuts, medicinal herbs, and fruits, and for restructuring the high altitude 
livestock sector to become environmentally and economically sustainable.  
 
Guizhou Province.  Guizhou Province is located in southwest China. Out of Guizhou’s total 
population of 40 million, 11.5 million live below the national poverty line. About 80 percent of the 
province belongs to the limestone and karst areas of the Wuling and Wumeng Mountains in which 
sixty-five poor counties and 85 percent of Guizhou’s poor are located.  These areas are 
characterized by relatively fertile but often shallow soils and are subject to severe water and soil 
erosion and management problems.  The unique geographic conditions and the limited availability 
of productive farmland, combined with inaccessibility and underdeveloped infrastructure, represent 
significant challenges to agricultural development.  Recent improvements in transportation 
infrastructure, both highways and village access roads, however, are providing potential 
opportunities to reach large urban markets in Chongqing and Guiyang.  These remain un-tapped to 
date because of the limited investment into the agricultural sector itself. For the future, modern 
agricultural production systems that build on: (a) more sustainable land use; (b) improvements of 
the organizational level of farmers, and (c) carefully designed land consolidation programs offer 
promising ways to overcome technology constraints, attract investment, and link agricultural value 
chains to urban markets.

Relationship to CAS
The project would support the CPS’ strategic theme two: promoting more inclusive development, 
by geographically focusing on lagging regions and small towns and by supporting policies and 
demonstration projects that address inequalities. It would contribute to the CPS outcome 2.3: 
enhancing opportunities in rural areas and small towns, by piloting new ways to boost rural incomes 
and reduce poverty under the umbrella of the new Poverty Reduction for China’s Rural Areas 
Strategy (2011-2020) and by promoting inclusive innovation to decrease disparities.

III. Preliminary Description
Concept Description
The proposed project seeks to assist the Government in developing models to advance the rural-
urban integration and rural sector modernization agenda in representative destitute rural and 
mountain areas.  The focus of the project would be on demonstrating approaches to rural income 
generation that are based on the modernization of selected agricultural sub-sectors and value-chain 
development, institutional farmer cooperative development, the provision of grant funds for poor 
farmer households and cooperatives to support their participation in agricultural value chains, and 
capacity building for rural households, cooperatives, enterprises, and local governments.   
 
The project would seek to achieve the development objective through the implementation of the 
following components and activities: 
 
Component 1: Integrated Value Chain Development.  The objective of this component would be to 
develop more efficient agricultural value chains focusing on 2 to 4 agricultural or rural pillar 
industries in each project county.  This would be achieved through the restructuring and 
modernization of the current production patterns and by supporting the enabling institutions in each 
pillar industry.  The modernization would aim at creating or supporting larger, economically more 
viable and long-term sustainable production arrangements, for example cooperatives, household 
groups, or enterprises, which are capable to use better technologies and can capture value added in 
the up-stream processing and marketing value chains.  The component would also support the 
establishment of socially acceptable models of cooperatives, household groups, company-farmer 
household, and company-farmer household-cooperative organizations through a business and 
market-based approach. 
 
Component 2: Public infrastructure and services support.  The objective of this component would be 
to improve public infrastructure and public services in order to enable and facilitate restructuring of 
the agricultural sub-sectors under Component 1.  The component would support investments in: (a) 
production road infrastructure; (b) irrigation and drainage, terracing, etc. (c) communications and 
information and telecommunications (ICT) infrastructure and equipment; and (d) public market 
facilities, electricity supply and other infrastructure necessary to facilitate and complement farmer 
and private investments.  In addition, the component would provide investment in other supporting 
public services, such as food safety testing and control, public extension and training services, 
marketing systems and agriculture research and technology transfer. 
 
Component 3: Rural and Agricultural Business Development Support.  The objective of this 
component would be to provide business development services to farmer households and

cooperatives in support of the agriculture-value chain development under omponent 1.  Specific 
investments would include:  (a) a conditional grant program to poor households and households 
groups to encourage the self-organization of households and provide means for the purchasing of 
agricultural and other inputs to allow them to participate in new production arrangements; (b) 
training and mentoring for new and existing enterprises and cooperatives and for community-based 
economic groups in ethnic minority areas; (c) training for government officials on the roles of 
government and private sector and on how to built public-private partnership arrangements; in 
addition, training on appraisal guidelines for public sector support in rural areas; (d) technical 
assistance to value-chain operators; (e) policy studies on how to improve investment climate, good 
governance, and fair benefit-sharing in cooperative-enterprise arrangements; and (f) marketing 
studies for selected products, analytical studies related to poverty reduction and agricultural sector 
development, policy guidelines, and the development of appraisal guidelines for public sector 
support in rural areas.  
 
Component 4: Project management, monitoring and evaluation (M&E).  The component would 
establish the project management and M&E system of the project and provide office equipment, 
transportation and technical assistance services. It would support the coordination between 
implementation agencies at all levels and with other government programs and institutions and the 
capture of implementation lessons from value chain development.  It would also include support to 
establishing and operatingthe project’s progress and impact M&E system.

Concept Review 
Decision

I. Introduction and Context
Country Context
Building on its remarkable social and economic performance over the last 20 years, Bangladesh 
aims to become a middle income country by 2021; to achieve this will require among other that the 
GoB overcomes considerable challenges in agricultural development and rural economic growth. 
The country’s GDP growth averaged 5.8 percent between 2000 and 2010, accompanied by a decline 
in the national poverty headcount rate from 48.9 percent to 31.5 percent over the same period, 
effectively lifting some 16 million people out of poverty. Bangladesh, a country of over 160 million 
inhabitants, has also made noteworthy gains in education and health, and is well set to achieve most 
of the MDGs.  
Bangladesh remains a predominantly agricultural country and growth and development 
achievements in rural areas must be brought on par with those in urban areas. Agriculture occupies

some three-quarters of the scarce land space of the country and supports the livelihoods of the 
majority of the population. While overall poverty has significantly declined over the 2000 to 2010 
period, the poverty headcount in rural areas (still 35.2 percent) has not declined as fast as in urban 
settings; moreover, the proportion of people living in extreme poverty in rural areas is still three 
times higher than in urban areas. The contribution of agriculture to the country’s economic output 
has declined over the past decade, but crops, livestock, forestry, fisheries still combine for almost 
one-fifth of GDP. Moreover, with some 70 percent of the population living in rural areas and over 
43 percent of the country's total labor force engaged in agriculture, achieving further economically, 
socially and environmentally sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction will require 
policies and investments conducive of lasting transformational changes in rural areas – including 
through technological innovations in agriculture.

Sectoral and Institutional Context
To eliminate the country’s extreme poverty by the year 2030 and to promote shared prosperity for 
the poorest 40 percent, agriculture  must continue to grow (in ways that are sustainable and adapted 
to climate change) and rely on a more diversified production base. Poverty reduction in rural areas 
depends crucially on growth in agricultural productivity, which is driven by investment in 
infrastructure, generation of new or improved technologies adapted to changing climate, and their 
adoption by farmers and other value chains actors (e.g. processors). Sustainable intensification and 
diversification of agriculture through technological change requires an efficient and productive 
national agricultural technology system, comprising agricultural research (technology development 
and refinement) and agricultural extension (technology dissemination and adoption). This needs to 
be supported by appropriate value addition and market linkages through smallholder participation in 
emerging/established supply chains for higher value agriculture. To achieve these strategic goals, 
the GoB has been seeking the support of development partners such as the Bank, to develop and 
finance activities aimed at boosting agricultural production through productivity enhancement, and 
increasing smallholders’ income.   
In Bangladesh, while the performance of the NARS has been impressive in contributing to food 
security (in particular with rice), research in some key sub sectors (e.g. livestock, fisheries) has yet 
to reach its potential productivity in terms of releasing a sufficient stream of useful innovations 
(including a range of new climate smart technologies for production and post-harvesting). The 
extension system has still extremely limited reach into the myriad communities of the nation (in 
particular for the fisheries and livestock subsectors were local level public extension workers are 
absent), and worse, hardly communicates with the NARS, or the relevant private and non-
government entities also engaged in technological advance. In short, the national agricultural 
innovation system is far from exploiting the systemic interactions that should drive it to success, and 
the insufficiencies pervade the system both within the subsystems, the all-too disconnected and in 
some instances less than strong elements of the NARS: public-private links are disturbingly absent, 
and links between research entities public and private with the higher education sector are sparse 
and severely underexploited. To enable agriculture and stakeholders to adapt readily when 
challenges occur and to respond readily when opportunities arise, the proposed project will seek to 
overcome some of the key constraints to increasing the efficiency and performance of the national 
agricultural innovation system. 
The National Agricultural Extension Policy (NAEP, 2012) and the Bangladesh Agricultural 
Research Council Act (BARC, 2011) provide the sector policy framework for the proposed 
NATP-2. NAEP advocates inter alia the development of decentralized, integrated, demand-driven 
agricultural research and extension services. Support is now required for the Department of 
Agricultural Extension (MoA) towards achieving the strategic objectives of the NAEP and as well

as technical assistance for the Department of Livestock Services and the Department of Fisheries 
(both MFL) for the completion of their respective sector extension strategy/policy. The 2012 BARC 
Act aims at fostering the coordination of research activities conducted by the twelve NARS 
institutes, making BARC responsible for the allocation of resources among the NARS institutes and 
for the approval of the institutes’ research programs; it is among other things expected to reduce 
duplication of research efforts and enhance accountability. Implementation of the BARC Act 
remains a challenging process and requires additional financial and technical assistance. Further, 
there are some significant differences in the institutional capacity and performance among the 
various NARS institutes (with livestock and fisheries lagging behind), and the project is expected to 
strengthen the research agenda and outcomes for livestock and fisheries given the importance of 
these sub sectors for rural economic growth and rural livelihoods.

Relationship to CAS
Agriculture has long occupied a central place in the Bangladesh development agenda and in the 
CPSs of the WBG. In the CPS for FY11-14 (subsequently extended to FY15), agriculture is 
highlighted in Pillar 3, Vulnerability, Adaptation and Inclusion, although the sector surely 
contributes to the growth Pillar 2, and benefits from initiatives under the 4th Pillar of Governance. 
As the CASPR (Report No. 73983-BD) of November 20, 2013 notes concerning Pillar 3 Outcome 
3.1 on Agriculture and Food Security, program implementation has been ramping-up and is showing 
significant improvements in agricultural productivity as measured in crops and livestock 
performance. Recurrent natural disasters and deficiencies in technology remain the basic threats to 
improvements in agricultural production, and are therefore the focus of Bank interventions in the 
sector. IFC, with financing from the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience, is also assisting by 
supporting the climate resilience of agribusiness companies and their supply chains, and is 
exploring availability of low-cost housing and livestock protection structures in flood-prone coastal 
areas. Furthermore, IFC’s investment climate and advisory services include activities in agriculture 
that are complementary to NATP-2 (e.g. development of Seed Act and National Seed Policy, 
strengthening of sanitary and phyto-sanitory registration and certification system, development of 
the dairy value chain). The proposed follow-up to NATP Phase 1 was retained in the revised CAS 
for FY15 implementation.

II. Proposed Development Objective(s)
Proposed Development Objective(s) (From PCN)
6. The proposed project development objective (PDO) for NATP-2 is to enhance the 
agricultural productivity of smallholders through better research and extension and improve their 
market access through better integration in selected value chains. To that effect, NATP-2 will 
support a decentralized, demand-driven agricultural research and extension services, and promote 
market-oriented smallholder production. NATP-2 will also support access to markets for 
smallholder farmers by facilitating their linkages with selected value chains, contributing in turn to 
increased farm income and to the sustainability of farmer groups and producer organizations formed 
by the project. The following project design emerged as an outcome of the Identification mission: 
Comp.1: Promoting Agricultural Innovation, Comp.2: Supporting Crops Development; Comp.3: 
Supporting Livestock Development; Comp.4: Supporting Fisheries Development; and Comp.5: 
Project Management and Coordination. 
7. NATP-2 will achieve the PDO: (i) by strengthening the capacity of the NARS and the 
extension services to generate and diffuse agricultural technologies aimed at increasing farm 
productivity; and (ii) by promoting the sustainability of existing and newly created farmer groups

and producer organizations by strengthening their linkages with markets. Sustainable intensification 
and diversification of agriculture through technological change requires an efficient and productive 
national agricultural technology system, comprising agricultural research (technology development 
and refinement) and agricultural extension (technology dissemination). This needs to be supported 
by appropriate value addition and market linkages through the strengthening of supply chains for 
high value agriculture. To that effect, while NATP-2 will continue supporting agricultural research 
and extension, it will need to have a stronger focus on market-oriented production, on value chains 
and on the participation of smallholders in those emerging market opportunities, than under 
NATP-1.

Key Results (From PCN)
(i) Client satisfaction (including for female-led households) with the agricultural extension and 
advisory services provided by the agricultural innovation system has increased  
(ii) New technologies generated by the agricultural innovation system have been adopted by 
producers (including by female-led households) and other value chain actors targeted by the project  
(iii) The increase achieved in agricultural productivity (for crops, fisheries and livestock) is 
larger for farmers supported by the project  
(iv) The proportion of smallholder agricultural production marketed relative to total smallholder 
farm output has increased 
(v) The women-led Common Interest Groups for homestead gardening are making a significant 
contribution to improving nutrition in participating households

III. Preliminary Description
Concept Description
NATP-2 will achieve the PDO by: (i) continuing to strengthen the capacity of the NARS and 
extension services to generate and disseminate agricultural technologies aimed at increasing farm 
productivity; and (ii) promoting the sustainability of existing and new farmer groups and producer 
organizations by strengthening their linkages with markets. Sustainable intensification and 
diversification of agriculture through technological change requires an efficient and productive 
national agricultural technology system, comprising agricultural research (technology development 
and refinement) and agricultural extension (technology dissemination). This needs to be supported 
by appropriate value addition and market linkages through the development of supply chains for 
high value agriculture. To that effect, while NATP-2 will continue supporting agricultural research 
and extension, it will need to have a much stronger focus on market-oriented production, on value 
chains and on the participation of smallholders in those emerging market opportunities, than under 
NATP-1. A differentiated approach will be required for project activities at field level to account for 
the vertical and horizontal scaling up efforts under NATP-2. The new project will deepen the 
interventions in existing upazillas (vertical scaling up) while expanding the geographic coverage to 
include new districts and upazillas (horizontal scaling up) . 
The project design for NATP-2 takes into account some of the shortcomings identified under 
NATP-1 and reflects the integrated approach required to achieve the PDO. NATP-2 includes a 
broader component that addresses the multiple dimensions required for decentralized, demand-
driven agricultural research as a core pillar of an agricultural innovation system in the country 
context. The project further includes three sub sector components, each tackling specific constraints 
to the development of selected commodities from technology generation to transfer and adoption at 
farm level, to market-oriented production and agro processing. This value chain approach is 
expected to lead to a better integration of research and extension, which was regularly reported in

NATP-1 as an area requiring further improvement. Finally, the project includes a component that 
covers most cross-cutting activities as well as regular project management tasks. Project 
components, their objectives and contribution to the PDO, as well as the core activities covered, are 
described below. 
 
Component 1: Enhancing the Agricultural Innovation System 
This component, led by the Project Management and Coordination Unit with implementation 
support from other agencies, will support the development of decentralized, demand-driven and 
integrated agricultural research. This component will likely include investments, capacity 
enhancement and technical assistance in areas launched under NATP-1 (such as sustainability of 
Common Interest Groups (CIGs) and emerging Producer Organizations (POs), rehabilitation of 
rural markets, technical advisory services), strengthening National Agricultural Research Institutes  
(NARI) (including investments in physical infrastructure), developing one-stop farmer advisory 
service centers. The component will also include the window for competitive research and matching 
grants under the Agricultural Innovation Fund.   
 
Component 2: Supporting crop development  
This component, coordinated by the Department of Agricultural Extension, will support the 
development of decentralized extension services and demand-driven research for crop production 
(including horticulture), post-harvest management and processing, and facilitate the integration of 
smallholder farmers in selected crop-based value chains (bananas, vegetables, and aromatic rice). 
This component would include investments, capacity enhancement and technical assistance in e.g. 
smallholder farm mechanization, seed testing facilities (with IFC), an electronic phytosanitary 
certification system (with IFC), food safety, agricultural commercialization, and promotion of 
smallholder-based commodity value chains. Financial incentives to smallholder farmers for the 
adoption of productivity enhancing and post-harvest loss reducing technologies, as well as support 
to private small and medium agro entrepreneurs in the selected value chains (e.g. food processing) 
will be secured through the corresponding AIF window.  
 
Component 3: Supporting fisheries development  
This component, coordinated by the Department of Fisheries, will support the development of 
decentralized extension services and demand-driven research for fish and aquaculture, and facilitate 
the integration of smallholder fish farmers in selected commodity value chains (tilapia, major carps, 
and shrimps). This component would include investments, capacity enhancement and technical 
assistance in e.g. the rehabilitation of fish ponds, food safety, quality improvement of fish feed and 
fingerlings, fish commercialization and the promotion of aquaculture-based commodity value 
chains. Financial incentives to smallholder farmers for the adoption of productivity enhancing and 
post-harvest loss reducing technologies, as well as support to private small and medium agro 
entrepreneurs in the selected value chains (e.g. food processing) will be secured through the 
corresponding AIF window. 
 
Component 4: Supporting livestock development  
This component, coordinated by the Department of Livestock Services, will support the 
development of decentralized extension services and demand-driven research for livestock products, 
and facilitate the integration of smallholder farmers in selected commodity value chains (dairy, goat 
meat). This component would include investments, capacity enhancement and technical assistance 
in e.g.: laboratory infrastructure and equipment (including at the regional level), artificial 
insemination, fodder production and conservation, efficient biogas production, farm mechanization,

food safety, and the promotion of livestock-based commodity value chains. Financial incentives to 
smallholder farmers for the adoption of productivity enhancing and post-harvest loss reducing 
technologies, as well as support to private small and medium agro entrepreneurs in the selected 
value chains (e.g. food processing) will be secured through the corresponding AIF window. 
 
Component 5: Project Management and Coordination 
Under this component a Project Management and Coordination Unit will be in charge of overall 
day-to-day project management and implementation, as well as coordination among the project 
PIUs from the Ministry of Agriculture and Ministry of Food. The PCMU will have the operational, 
safeguards and fiduciary responsibility and be accountable for overall project performance. The 
PCMU will carry out procurement and financial management activities. Other specific PMU-led 
activities under this component will include among others: (i) the support to the development of a 
national agricultural atlas, (ii) the coordination of third-party project monitoring and impact 
evaluation (with baseline, midline, endline surveys), (iii) the coordination of analytical studies and 
dissemination of findings, (iv) the support to short- and longer term assistance to the project 
management team and other agencies involved in component implementation, (v) the coordination 
of all staff training and (vii) preparation studies for a potential follow-up operation (phase III of 
NATP).

I. Project Context
Country Context
Ethiopia is a large and diverse country. It is land-locked and located in the Horn of Africa, with an 
area of 1.1 million km2. Its bio-physical environment includes a variety of ecosystems, with 
significant differences in climate, soil properties, vegetation types, and agricultural potential, 
biodiversity and water resources. Ethiopia is a country of many nations, nationalities and peoples, 
with a total population of 91.7 million (2012).  Only 17 percent of the population lives in urban 
centres, the great majority of them in Addis Ababa. At a current annual growth rate of 2.6 percent, 
Ethiopia’s population is estimated to reach 130 million by 2025, and is projected by the UN to be 
among the world’s ten largest countries by 2050. Ethiopia is vulnerable to terms of trade shocks 
from international food and fuel prices, and to large domestic weather-related shocks as 
demonstrated by the 2011/12 East Africa drought. 
 
Ethiopia has a federal, democratic government system, established in the early 1990s, with nine 
autonomous states (‘regions’) and two chartered cities. Decentralization of governance to the

regional and district (woreda) levels has been actively pursued since 2003. The Ethiopian People’s 
Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) has been in power in Ethiopia since 1991. EPRDF 
comprises four regionally-based parties from the four major regions (Amhara, Oromia, Southern 
Nations, Nationalities and Peoples (SNNPR), and Tigray). The long-serving Prime Minister, Meles 
Zenawi, (from Tigray) died in August 2012 and was succeeded by Hailemariam Desalegn (from 
SNNPR) who has pursued largely the same policies. The next national elections are scheduled for 
2015. 
 
Ethiopia has experienced strong economic growth over the past decade. Economic growth averaged 
10.7 percent per year in 2003/04 to 2011/12, compared to the regional average of 5.0 percent. 
Growth reflected a mix of factors, including agricultural modernization, the development of new 
export sectors, strong global commodity demand, and government-led development investments. 
Private consumption and public investment have driven demand side growth, with the latter 
assuming an increasingly important role in recent years. On the supply side, growth was driven by 
an expansion of the services and agricultural sectors, while the role of the industrial sector was 
relatively modest. Recently, annual growth rates have declined slightly, but still remain at high 
single-digit levels. Growth in the export of goods has also moderated in recent years and a decline 
was observed in 2012/13 for the first time since 2008/09. There have been bouts of high inflation in 
recent years and, while inflation is currently much lower, keeping it down remains a major 
objective for monetary policy. 
 
Ethiopia is one of the world's poorest countries, but has made substantial progress on social and 
human development over the past decade. The country’s per capita income of US$470  is 
substantially lower than the regional average of US$1,257 and among the ten lowest worldwide. 
Ethiopia is ranked 173 out of 187 countries in the Human Development Index (HDI) of the United 
Nations Development Program (UNDP). High economic growth, however, has helped reduce 
poverty in both urban and rural areas. Since 2005, 2.5 million people have been lifted out of 
poverty, and the share of the population below the poverty line has fallen from 38.7 percent in 
2004/05 to 29.6 percent in 2010/11  (using a poverty line of close to US$1.25/day). However, 
because of high population growth, the absolute number of poor (about 25 million) has remained 
unchanged over the past fifteen years. Ethiopia is among the countries that have made the fastest 
progress on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and HDI ranking over the past decade. It 
is on track to achieve the MDGs for gender parity in education, child mortality, HIV/AIDS, and 
malaria. Good progress has been made in universal primary education, although the MDG target 
may not be met. Reduction of maternal mortality remains a key challenge. 
 
GoE is currently implementing its ambitious Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP; 
2010/11-2014/15), which sets a long-term goal of becoming a middle-income country by 2025, 
with growth rates of at least 11.2 percent per annum during the plan period. To achieve the GTP 
goals and objectives, GoE has followed a “developmental state” model with a strong role for the 
government in many aspects of the economy. It has prioritized key sectors such as industry and 
agriculture as drivers of sustained economic growth and job creation. The GTP also reaffirms 
GoE’s commitment to human development. Development partners have programs that are broadly 
aligned with GTP priorities. 
 
The World Bank Group’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS, FY13-16) builds on the progress 
achieved by Ethiopia in recent years and aims to help GoE address structural transformation and 
assist in the implementation of the GTP. The CPS framework includes two pillars. Pillar One,

“Fostering competitiveness and employment”, aims to support Ethiopia in achieving: (i) a stable 
macroeconomic environment; (ii) increased competitiveness and productivity; (iii) increased and 
improved delivery of infrastructure; and (iv) enhanced regional integration.  Pillar Two, “Enhancing 
resilience and reducing vulnerabilities”, aims to support Ethiopia in improving the delivery of social 
services and developing a comprehensive approach to social protection and risk management. Good 
governance and state building form the foundation of the CPS. In line with the GTP, gender and 
climate change have been included as cross-cutting issues to strengthen their mainstreaming across 
the portfolio. The programs of IFC and MIGA are well aligned with the CPS framework, 
contributing mainly to the strategic objectives under Pillar One.

  

Sectoral and institutional Context
The agricultural sector remains a dominant sector in the Ethiopian economy and an important 
source of economic growth. Although there is an on-going structural transformation in the 
Ethiopian economy, predominantly from agriculture to services and manufacturing, agriculture still 
comprises 45 percent of total output and continues to dominate employment (78 percent). The 
sector is also a major contributor to export earnings, with over 80 percent of goods exports. Despite 
its declining share in the economy, the agriculture sector is growing rapidly. Over the past 15 years 
the average rate of growth has been around seven percent per year according to official statistics. 
Sources of growth have come from an increased area under cultivation and from increased 
productivity, the latter driven by large public investment in the sector, including agricultural 
extension, rural roads, and advances in public policy such as improvements in land tenure security. 
In addition to contributing to economic output and exports, agricultural growth is correlated with 
poverty reduction, for smallholder farmers and also through positive impacts on non-farm rural 
economies. 
 
Although Ethiopia has a trend of negative overall balance of trade, the country has consistently had 
a positive balance of trade in the agriculture sector. The agriculture imports per capita and exports 
per capita stood at $13.28 and $18.27 respectively in 2011. The top three agriculture exports have 
been coffee, oil seeds and pulses while the largest imports have been cereals, edible oils and sugar. 
In spite of the positive trade balances in the sector, marketing (including intra-regional trade) in the 
sector is constrained by mixed and often unfavorable policies for input and output markets and poor 
infrastructure leading to high transportation costs. There remains considerable potential for both 
increased exports from the sector and further import substitution, especially for cereals 
(predominantly wheat) and sugar.   
 
The further growth of the agriculture sector is expected to feature prominently in the second phase 
of the GTP (GTP-II), currently under preparation.  Maintaining the current growth rate in the sector 
will be challenging as recent gains from land expansion may be exhausted, and further increases 
will need to come from increased agricultural productivity. Progress requires both investment and 
policy reform.  The general thrust on policy reform is to pursue agricultural transformation by 
increasing private sector investment and value added in the country to increase the value of exports. 
In 2012, the Government agreed a G8 New Alliance framework for Ethiopia with a number of 
commitments for policy actions to facilitate the expansion of private investment.  Under this 
framework, the Government intends to focus its efforts in particular on: i) increasing stability and 
transparency in trade policy; ii) improving incentives for the private sector investment; iii) 
developing and implementing a transparent land tenure policy; and iv) developing and 
implementing domestic seed policies that encourage increased private sector involvement in this

area. To support the transformation agenda, the Government established the Agricultural 
Transformation Agency (ATA) in 2011 to support the Ministry of Agriculture to advance policy 
and build capacity.  Notable achievements include the new Agricultural Cooperatives Development 
Strategy and the passing of the Seeds Proclamation. 
 
The Government’s agricultural development strategy focuses on both encouraging large scale 
investment in commercial agriculture and support to smallholder farmers, who in 2012/13 
contributed 96 percent of the total agricultural production according to official statistics. To 
increase agricultural productivity of smallholders and their transformation to commercial farmers 
requires a strengthening and focusing of support services and infrastructure, and greater private 
investment to support input and output value chains.  To drive this transformation, the Government 
is moving towards focused support to specific commercialization clusters targeting areas with the 
highest potential for the production of commodities for which Ethiopia has a comparative 
advantage and can stimulate agro-processing and value addition.   
 
Despite the large investment into public agricultural services, especially into extension, which has 
seen a rapid rise in the number of extension workers and beneficiaries served year on year, there are 
capacity weaknesses which continue to inhibit the identification and dissemination of technologies 
to support increased productivity.  Strengthening research and extension linkages, further expansion 
and capacity of the extension service and enhancing farmer access to inputs are required to support 
investments in extension workers.  Improving agriculture research has been prioritized in GTP and 
the same is expected in GTP II because of the pivotal role it plays to improve agricultural 
productivity and production and recognizing that in recent years it has been underfunded.  Animal 
health and production services also suffer from capacity limitations and low outreach, leading to 
low productivity and quality across a range of animal products.  
 
Access to and application of agricultural inputs is a decisive factor to improve agricultural 
productivity and production.  In addition to improved seeds, animal breeds and fertilizers, there is 
considerable opportunity to promote the use of machinery for production and post-harvest 
activities.  Innovations such as row planters for teff have had a considerable impact on productivity. 
However, input markets in Ethiopia are typically overly dependent on cooperative unions and the 
agro-dealer market is small and underdeveloped.  While cooperatives can play an important role in 
linking smallholder farmers to input and output markets, they are often hampered by weak 
management and facilities, and currently only handle a small percentage of agricultural output.  
There is potential for strengthening cooperatives while also enabling greater private engagement in 
both input and output markets.  
 
Output marketing system and infrastructure in Ethiopia are dominated by traditional, informal 
exchanges. For a large part of the country, this means trading with limited infrastructure. There are 
few market structures, storage, loading and unloading facilities, quality checking and banking 
services in or around most of the market centers. This has resulted in the cost of trading being very 
high due to cumbersome conditions for transaction, low product qualities and post-harvest losses.  
Value chains (other than for coffee which has a relatively efficient market structures) are therefore 
characterized by an absence of market participants, market inefficiencies and limited value addition. 
With increasing agricultural surpluses, rapid urbanization and increased opportunities for agro-
industrial investment, there are gaps in the current functioning in a number of value chains which 
are prioritized under the commercialization cluster approach to achieving transformation.

Agricultural water development is crucial to improve smallholders’ livelihood and income in 
Ethiopia, since irrigation can help farmers increase their crop production, increase crop varieties, 
and lengthen their agricultural seasons. From a very low base, over the next five years there are 
targets to increase the total area of irrigated land from the current 640,000 hectares (about 4 percent 
of currently cultivated land) to about 1.8 million hectares. Small Scale Irrigation (SSI) and Rain 
Water Harvesting (RWH) will account for about two-thirds of this expansion, as these technologies 
require lower capital and technical investments and they are possible on small plain areas. Beyond 
the next five years, plans are to reach the full irrigable potential of the country of over 5 million 
hectares. Household irrigation as well as medium- and large-scale schemes will be an important 
strategy to achieve this goal, in combination with exploring and developing groundwater potential, 
especially given that an estimated 85 percent of Ethiopia’s total surface water irrigation potential is 
estimated to be in large-scale schemes.  
 
Future agricultural growth needs t o be sensitive to gender.  On average, female farm managers in 
Ethiopia produce 23 percent less (in terms of gross value of output) per hectare than their male 
counterparts. Differences in both the levels of productive factors used and the returns that these 
factors generate drive this gender gap. Future inclusive agricultural growth should consider: (i) the 
promotion of labor-saving technologies for women; (ii) the provision of relevant information to 
female farmers, customized to the needs of female farmers; and (iii) the easing of the time burden 
of household responsibilities, by providing services to reduce the time that female farmers need to 
perform household duties to enable them to devote more time to productive farm activities. Recent 
research demonstrates the potential of women to contribute to agricultural growth and improve 
outcomes, including improved nutrition.   
 
In Ethiopia, forty percent of children under the age of five suffer from stunting as a consequence of 
chronic and cyclical malnutrition. The National Nutrition Program (NNP) was revised in 2013 to 
strategically address the nutrition problem in the country to include initiatives that have emerged 
since the 2008 NNP, including taking into account the multisectoral and multidimensional nature of 
nutrition and the linkages among key implementing sectors, one being agriculture.  This program, 
endorsed by the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Health and another eight line Ministers, 
includes a strategic objective to strengthen implementation of nutrition sensitive interventions in the 
agriculture sector. The initiatives focus on improving the consumption of diversified diets at the 
household level through: (i) diversification of crop, fruits and livestock production; (ii) promotion 
of appropriate technologies for food production and processing through the handling, preparation 
and preservation for food diversification to ensure nutritious food utilization;  (iii) building the 
capacity of Development Agents (DAs) at community level and agriculture program managers at all 
levels to implement nutrition sensitive agriculture;  (iv) supporting local complementary food 
production and creating economic opportunities for women through development groups and 
cooperatives; and, (v) supporting agricultural research centers to develop seeds of high nutritional 
value.  Thus, it calls for aligning the agricultural growth programs to improve nutritional status. 
 
With the limits of bringing uncultivated land under production being met, the likelihood of climatic 
variability and the potential degradation arising from more intensive production practices increases, 
and thus there is an urgent need for agriculture to conserve resources and reduce degradation. In 
recent years, considerable amount of work in natural resource conservation and development work 
has been undertaken. In 2013/14 alone, the communities undertook natural resources conservations 
work on 20.15 million hectares of land throughout the country, according to official statistics.  This 
current momentum of community mobilization in natural resource conservation by pursuing

activities such as slope stabilization, watershed approaches to water management and reduction of 
tillage should be sustained to make the sector more resilient and sustainable. 
 
The opportunities for inclusive and sustainable growth in the sector are strong as is the 
Government’s commitment to achieving ambitious growth and transformation targets.  The 
Agricultural Sector Policy and Investment Framework (PIF), 2010 – 2020, provides an investment 
framework to align the investment and policy priorities with higher level goals to transform the 
sector and is designed to operationalize the CAADP Compact signed by the Government and its 
development partners. Under the PIF, there have been concerted efforts to collaborate and partner 
on investments and the Agricultural Growth Project (AGP I – P113032) was a clear output of this. 
The first phase of the program was financed to around US$350 million, including US$150 million 
from IDA, US$50 million from the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP), a US
$50 million Multi-donor Trust Fund with contributions from the Netherlands, Canada and Spain, 
and parallel financing from USAID and Italy.  Currently, AGPI operates at  kebele levels (the 
lowest administrative unit) in 96 woredas of the four regions of Amhara, Oromia, SNNPR and 
Tigray and has provided support for improved public agricultural service provision, technology 
transfer, improved market access and marketing, infrastructure (household and small-scale 
irrigation, feeder roads and market centers) and capacity building.  The project further explicitly 
aims to increase the participation of women and youth in the sector.  The proposed project therefore 
aims to build on AGP1, to scale up the geographical extent, consolidate the investments, and meet 
the emerging challenges of the sector outlines above. 
 
Under AGPI, the project has been operating in 4 regions (Amhara, Oromia, SNNP and Tigray), 96 
woredas and 2,423 kebeles, targeting 1.57 million direct beneficiaries.  The AGP2 project would 
cover 157 woredas, which would include all woredas targeted under AGP1 plus an additional 61. 
The woredas are distributed among the following regions: Amhara, Oromia, SNNPR, Tigray, 
Benshangul-Gumuz, Gambella, Harari and Dire Dawa Administrative Council. The expansion into 
the new regions and Dire Dawa would be on a limited scale, with two woredas in each of 
Benshangul-Gumuz and Gambella, and one in each of Harari and Dire Dawa.

the production of breeder and pre-basic seeds for major crop varieties.

Component Name
Small-scale Irrigation
Comments (optional)
To increase the access to and efficient utilization of irrigation water of small holder farmers, the 
project will support the increased availability of irrigated water through: i) the rehabilitation, 
upgrading and/or improvement of existing Small-scale Irrigation Schemes; ii) establishment of new 
SSI systems integrated with access roads where necessary; and iii) household irrigation systems. 
The project would also support improved water management services through establishing and/or 
strengthening Irrigation Water Users Organizations and the introduction of improved irrigation 
agricultural management.

Component Name

V. Implementation
The AGP 2 will build on institutional arrangements and implementation mechanisms established for 
th AGPI.  As in the first phase, the implementation of the project will rely on existing GoE 
structures, with the exception of parallel funding through the USAID and Canadian DFATD that 
will be channeled through specific implementation arrangements. The Ministry of Agriculture will 
have the overall responsibility of the coordination and implementation of the project. To fulfill its

responsibilities, the MoA will use - or will establish in the new targeted regions - the institutional 
mechanisms already established for AGP 1 at Federal, Regional, and Woreda levels, i.e: (i) the 
Steering Committees (SCs), (ii) the Technical Committees (TCs), and (iii) the Project’s 
Coordination Units (CUs). The existing composition of these Committees will be reviewed in order 
to include new implementing agencies such as the Ethiopian Institute for Agricultural Research 
(EIAR). At the Zonal level, the Zonal Agriculture Office (ZAO) will provide technical support, 
extension services and M&E to the group of woredas under its authority. The ZAOs will coordinate 
with the Woreda Offices of Agriculture (WOA). 
 
Implementation of the project will be decentralized. Federal implementing agencies will provide 
guidance and support to regions, spearhead most institutional capacity building activities and 
undertake monitoring, evaluation and communication activities. At regional and woreda levels, the 
Bureaus/Offices of Agriculture will assume primary responsibility for execution of the project.  
Implementation of AGP at the regional level will also be supported by relevant service providers 
and institutions.  
 
The annual planning process will follow a two-pronged approach associating: (i) a demand-driven 
approach based on the Community Level Participatory Planning (CLPP) approach adopted for AGP-
I in which communities are assuming primary responsibility for identifying and executing the 
community-based investment of the project, and (ii) a strategic-based approach in which 
investments are pre-identified through the Kebele, Woreda and Regional development plan or 
through specific feasibility studies, and implemented in close collaboration with the community 
after a consultation process. At the woreda and kebele levels, the implementation of the project 
would be undertaken jointly by Woreda Office of Agriculture through the Woreda Development 
Committee (WDC), the Kebele Development Committee (KDC), and the communities. The WDC 
and the KDC will be guided by their respective SCs and TCs.
