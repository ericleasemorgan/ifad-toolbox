EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 

Programme 

overview  

 

Country: TOGO. 

Programme Name: Governance and Agribusiness Support Programme (PAGPA) 

Overall Implementation Schedule: November 2017 – December 2018 

Operational Instrument: General Budget Support  

Programme Cost: UA 9.53 million disbursed in a single tranche in 2017 

Sector: Economic Governance and Agro-industry  

Programme 

Outcomes 
The main expected outcomes under Component A are: (i) a shorter ownership 

transfer timeframe from 283 days in 2016 to 60 days (WAEMU zone recorded 

average); (ii) a reduced agricultural trade deficit from CFAF 64 billion to 40 

billion, (iii) Togo's enhanced resilience to spatial and gender inequality-related 

fragility factors through the promotion of regional development around Agropoles 

and (iv) land tenure security on developed sites. Regarding Component B: (i) 

increased tax pressure from 17.9% in 2016 to 19.1% in 2018; (ii) optimized 

investment management, with the PI-11 rating moving from D to at least C in 2018; 

(iii) improved local tax governance through effective skills transfer and enhanced 

technical capabilities of local and regional authorities. 

Alignment with  

Bank  

Priorities 

 

PAGPA is aligned with the national development programme, SCAPE 2013-2017, 

notably Pillar (I) development of sectors with strong growth potential and Pillar 

(IV) strengthening governance. It is also aligned with the two pillars of the Bank's 

CSP (2016-2020), namely: (i) Development of inclusive growth and agribusiness 

competitiveness poles and (ii) Support for financial, sector and local governance 

and the Bank's 2013-2022 Ten-year Strategy as well as the Bank's Governance 

Action Plan (GAP II 2014-2018), more specifically, it contributes to the 

achievement of three of the Bank's five key strategic priorities (i) "Feed Africa," 

(ii) "Industrialize Africa" through agro-industry promotion measures, and (iii) 

"Improve the quality of life for the people of Africa" by supporting reforms seeking 

improved budget management and public action effectiveness through enhanced 

economic and financial governance. 

 

Needs  

Assessment and  

Programme  

Rationale 

 

The encouraging socio-economic performance notwithstanding, Togo remains in 

fragile situation due mainly to the wide spatial disparities in wealth generation and 

distribution. Economic activity remains mainly concentrated in the maritime 

region which generates on average 97% of the tax revenues collected by the OTR, 

against merely 2% for the other regions representing 89% of the territory and 57% 

of the population. To boost its resilience and accelerate its exit from fragility, Togo 

is banking on the structural transformation of the agricultural sector, notably 

through the establishment of agriculture hubs (Agropoles) for economic as well as 

social inclusion reasons. The effective implementation of this strategy requires 

mobilizing substantial investments, both public and private. The total cost estimate 

for the 2016-2020 phase is CFAF 3,791 billion, with an average financing ratio of 

46% from the State budget and 56% from the private sector. PAGPA, by 

concomitantly supporting substantial increase in internal resources, improving the 

private investment climate and strengthening agricultural sector governance, will 

provide Togo with the required financial and technical capabilities to implement 

its agricultural policy, a vehicle for sustainable and inclusive growth. Additionally, 

budget support resources will cover some of the financing requirements of the 

2017 budget, amounting to CFAF 400.6 billion. 

Harmonization Efforts are still required to coordinate the interventions of technical and financial 

partners (TFPs), in particular those engaging in budget support. The budget support 

consultation framework (COAB) set up since 2010, remains inoperative. The TFPs 

are yet to develop a joint matrix of their interventions, for which agreement with 

the government is awaited regarding its orientation, but they are working to 



v  

strengthen the complementarity of their actions in terms of dialogue and reforms 

monitoring. 
 

Bank’s Value  

Added 

 

The Bank has acquired proven expertise in strengthening economic and financial 

governance in Africa, notably in the sub-region (WAEMU). More specifically, the 

Bank has a comparative advantage in Togo for dialogue on reforms, having been 

the first development partner to re-engage after more than 15 years of dialogue 

with the international community; and on account of the results obtained in highly 

strategic areas such as revenue mobilization. Indeed, the Bank lent its full support 

to Togo in its vast and ambitious tax transition project that led to the establishment 

of OTR. PAGPA supports complementary measures to complete reforms seeking 

to optimize this structure, and diversify the economy by creating an enabling 

environment for the establishment of Agropoles. 

Contribution to 

Gender Equality 

and Women’s 

Empowerment  

Increased domestic resources mobilization and greater efficiency in public finance 

management will help improve the living conditions of the people in general and 

women in particular. PAGPA measures will lay the groundwork for a structural 

transformation of the economy, particularly at the local and regional level. The 

numerous opportunities that will open up around major Agropole projects will 

benefit women. In particular, that of the Kara region, the first pilot Agropole to be 

established with the support of this programme should, by 2020, help create 2,500 

jobs, 30% for women and 65% for the youth.  

 

Dialogue on 

Policies and  

Associated 

Technical 

Assistance  

 

 

PAGPA will help reinforce dialogue with the Government on public policies to 

support Togo’s economic transformation. The dialogue will focus on conditions 

for the effective implementation of the agricultural policy, with special focus on 

issues related to broadening the tax base to maximize domestic resources 

mobilization, thus strengthening macro-stability and creating a private investment-

friendly environment. Through ongoing capacity-building projects, the Resource 

Mobilization and institutional capacity building support project (PAMOCI) and 

the Fiscal Governance Support Project (PAGFI), Togo will continue to benefit 

from the assistance of national and international experts in revenue mobilization. 

The implementation of the agribusiness reforms will be supported by the 

investment project being prepared by the department in charge of agriculture in the 

Bank, which is aimed at establishing the Kara Agropole. The submission of this 

project to the Bank's Board of Directors is scheduled for December 2017.

1  

I. INTRODUCTION - THE PROPOSAL. 

1.1 Management submits the following proposal and recommendation for a grant of 

UA 7.21 million from Transition Support Facility (TSF) resources, and a grant of UA 2.32 

million from African Development Fund (ADF) resources, to the Republic of Togo to 

finance the Governance and Agribusiness Promotion Support Programme (PAGBA). 

PAGPA supports reforms aimed at creating a private and public investment environment 

conducive to agribusiness promotion, and improving revenue mobilization notably for capital 

investment purposes. It is designed as a reform operation funded by a budget support of 

total amount of UA 9.53 million to be disbursed in a single tranche in 2017. 

1.2 Single tranche disbursement, was justify by the particularity of 2017 fiscal year 

situation, which presents a high level of need for concessional financing mainly due to Togo's 

limited access to borrowing resources;  this is in accordance to the Government commitments 

under the framework of the economic program (2017-2019) supported by the IMF's Extended 

Credit Facility approved in May 2017. It also emerges from the revised budget prepared 

following the conclusion of the program with IMF, an overall need for financing gap of 280.8 

CFAF billions excluding grants, part of which will be financed by the ADF and TAF grant 

resources. On account of this financial support for Togo's budget, social sector allocations will 

be maintained, thus minimizing risks of the social climate deteriorating at this crucial 

transitional phase towards exiting fragility. With the programme spanning the November 2017 

to December 2018 period, the Bank will maintain sustained dialogue with the Togolese 

authorities for the effective implementation of the reforms scheduled for 2018. These reforms 

will be monitored in close collaboration with the IMF, World Bank and European Union whose 

programmes cover the 2017-2019 period. 

1.3 Despite the favourable outlook, Togo remains confronted with a number of socio-

economic challenges, including inadequate internal resources and an underperforming 

economy with low and non-inclusive value added creation. Despite efforts by GoT and the 

structural reforms implemented in recent years, including the creation of the OTR and the 

adoption of a new customs code, internal resources mobilization remains low compared to the 

financing requirements of the Accelerated Growth and Employment Promotion Strategy 

(SCAPE). The operationalization of the OTR, which is strongly supported by the Bank, has 

definitely yielded encouraging results, with a tax burden of 17.9% in 2016 that is expected to 

reach 18.3% in 2017 and 19.1% in 2018. However, despite this positive trend, on account of 

Togo's weak capacity to create value-added with one of Africa’s lowest GDPs, the absolute 

value of domestic revenues collected falls far short of the budget’s funding requirements. The 

average coverage rate of budgetary spending by tax revenue is about 60%, hence its heavy 

dependence on external financing and public borrowing both internally and externally. Indeed 

since 2016, Togo's debt risk is considered high with a debt ratio of 80.8% of GDP. In this regard, 

GoT has committed, under the new programme with the IMF, to lowering this rate to not more 

than 73% by 2019. 

 

 



2  

1.4 In a bid to maintain medium and long-term viability of the macro-fiscal 

framework, Togo is banking on the structural transformation of the agricultural sector 

to give sustained and inclusive impetus to accelerated economic growth. To leverage this 

sector as a prime mover of economic growth and social inclusion, the country has formulated 

and adopted an agricultural policy (2015-2030) aimed at achieving "a modern, sustainable and 

high value-added agriculture to support a strong, inclusive, competitive economy generating 

decent and stable employment by 2030". The country’s agriculture sector employs 60-70% of 

the working population and accounts for up to 38% of GDP. This sector has significant potential 

with 3.4 million hectares of arable land, of which only 45% is currently under cultivation 

yielding less than 50% of the optimum level. Furthermore, the industrial processing of 

agricultural products is in its infancy, as is the Togolese industrial sector as a whole. Over the 

last three years, the industrial sector, which is not well developed and is poorly integrated with 

the rest of the economy, contributed an average of 17.8% to GDP, with an average annual 

growth rate of 1.3%. PAGPA is a continuation of the Bank's previous PARG-II budget support 

and will allow more in-depth reforms focusing on strengthening public finance management 

and creating conditions conducive to agro-industry development. 

1.5 PAGPA is aligned with Togo's national development policies and contributes 

towards implementing the Bank's intervention strategies in Togo. PAGPA is in line with 

the national development agenda, SCAPE 2013-2017, particularly Pillar (I) "development of 

sectors with strong growth potential" and Pillar (IV) "strengthening governance". It is also 

aligned with the two pillars of the Bank's CSP (2016-2020), namely: “Development of inclusive 

growth and agribusiness competitiveness poles” and (ii) “Support for financial, sector and local 

governance”. It is also consistent with the Bank's ten-year strategy 2013-2022 and the 

Governance Action Plan (GAP II 2014-2018). More specifically, it is aimed at contributing to 

the achievement of three of the Bank's High-5s: (i) "Feed Africa", (ii) "Industrialize Africa" 

and (iii) "Improve the quality of life for the people of Africa". 

1.6 In accordance with the Bank's Policy on Budget Support Operations, this proposed 

operation is subject to consideration by the Board following the implementation of the agreed 

prior actions, which are fully consistent with the reform programme of the Government of Togo 

(GoT), designed in consultation with civil society and the country's technical and financial 

partners. 

II. COUNTRY CONTEXT 

2.1 Political Situation and Governance Context 

2.1.1 Political Situation: The 2015 presidential election which was won by the Presidential 

Party, and intensified dialogue between the ruling party and the opposition, contributed towards 

easing the political climate up to the end of the first half of 2017. This relative political stability 

has been conducive to the implementation of structural reforms for a progressive exit from the 

situation of fragility. However, the August 2017 political demonstrations, with sporadic 

violence, indicate that the dialogue during the budget support programme period could unfold 

in the context marked by tension arising from the holding of the legislative elections in 2018, 

local elections in 2019 and the presidential election in 2020. 



3  

2.1.2 Fragility Situation: Despite the progress achieved in recent years, particularly in 

economic terms, Togo remains in a fragile situation. Its average score in the Bank's and World 

Bank's Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) is 3.2 out of 6. The reconstruction 

process following the political-democratic crisis is still ongoing. The North-South ethnic and 

regional divide continues to fuel the radicalization of the divergent positions among the political 

class and recurrent social tensions. The ownershipof sustainable mechanisms of socio-political 

dialogue, that is courteous, inclusive and constructive among the political class and the elite as 

well as the strengthening of institutions, constitute major challenges that Togo will face in terms 

of political governance. Moreover, the economy’s extremely heavy dependence on the 

phosphate sub-sector (over 40% of export earnings), and on revenues from port and airport 

traffic, also constitutes a source of fragility, as do the persistent spatial socio-economic 

development and gender disparities. The new development-oriented national agricultural policy 

has the dual objective of diversifying the economy and reducing inequalities in opportunities 

between the maritime region and other regions; and between men and women, by facilitating 

women's access to land through the provisions of the new land code that is in the process of 

adoption. 

2.1.3 Governance: According to the 2016 Mo Ibrahim report on the assessment of global 

governance in Africa, Togo ranks 33rd among 54 countries evaluated with a score of 48.5 out 

of 100. Notwithstanding its poor overall ranking, Togo, with an average change of +9.7 points,  

ranks 2nd  best governance reformer over the period 2006-2015, behind Côte d'Ivoire (13.1), the 

same as Zimbabwe (+9.7) and ahead of Liberia (+8.7), and Rwanda (+8.4). It is the only country 

whose overall governance has improved steadily with progress in each of the 14 sub-categories 

of the IIAG. The 2016 report by Transparency International ranks Togo 116th  out of 176 with 

a Corruption Perception Index (CPI) of 32 against 29 in 2014, on a scale of 0 (high corruption) 

to 100 (very low corruption). 

2.2 Recent Economic Developments, Macroeconomic and Fiscal Analysis 

2.2.1 The country is characterized by limited transformation of its economy, which is 

dominated by agriculture with 47.6% of GDP, followed by services (36.2%) and industry 

(16.2%)with merely 6.4% for manufacturing. However, despite a challenging external 

environment, the Togolese authorities were able to maintain a positive trend of economic 

activity. Indeed, the GDP growth rate, which was 6.1% in 2013, remained at an average of 5.4% 

over the period 2014-2016 due to the good performance of the agriculture and infrastructure 

investment sectors. This trend is expected to continue in 2017, with a growth rate of about 5.0% 

which could reach 5.3% by 2018, due to the combined effects of fairly good rainfall and 

increased productivity arising from the agricultural sector’s transformation and the improved 

transportation system. Inflation is also contained through the stabilization of food, energy and 

transport prices. It dropped from 1.8% in 2015 to 0.9% in 2016 and is projected to be negative 

at -0.1% for 2017. An analysis conducted in 2016 by the IMF and World Bank shows that Togo 

is at high overall debt risk. 

 

 



4  

2.2.2 The country's debt risk level is deemed extremely worrying. The public debt stock 

rose sharply from 48.8% at end- 2010 to 80.8% of GDP at end- 2016, above the Community 

norm of 70%. This increase is due mainly to infrastructure investments in 2015 and 2016. 

Togo's new programme (2017-2019) under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) with the IMF 

seeks mainly to create conditions conducive to a substantial public debt level reduction from 

80.8% of GDP in 2016 to 67.8% by 2020.1

2.2.3 The budget deficit (cash basis) deteriorated progressively over the period 2013-

2016. It reached a record 9.6% of GDP in 2016,2 against 5.8%, 7.9% and 7.8% of GDP 

respectively in 2013, 2014 and 2015. Such deterioration in the budget balance is due mainly to 

a sharp increase in the aforementioned infrastructure spendings, and high cost of commitments 

under the "pre-financing" method used by the country to finance them. This deficit is projected 

at 4.9% in 2017 and should improve slightly to 4.7% in 2018 with the discontinuation of the 

pre-financing practice at end- 2016 and the renegotiation of the terms of the related 

commitments in 2017. The external current account balance is structurally in deficit, standing 

at CFAF 142.5 billion in 2016. It could rise to CFAF -140.5 billion in 2017, representing an 

improvement of CFAF 2 billion, attributable to an increased services balance (+ CFAF 4.1 

billion) and secondary revenues (+ CFAF 1.2 billion), which is cushioned by the decrease in 

the goods trade balance (CFAF -4.0 billion). 

2.2.4 The outlook is deemed favourable. The combined effects of support for the 

modernization of agro-industry, including Agropoles and extractive industries, and the 

envisaged reforms to strengthen competition rules in the hospitality, electricity, banking and 

telecommunications sectors, should help achieve an average growth rate of 5.3% over the 

period 2017-2019. Additionally, lessons learned from the implementation of budgets (2012-

2016) and the implementation of the programme with the IMF under the Extended Credit 

Facility (2017-2019) should lead to improved budget credibility and stability. 

2.2.5 Competitiveness of the Economy    

The Togolese economy’s competitiveness is structurally constrained by low overall 

productivity and high production costs. In the report Doing Business 2018 Togo loses two 
places compared to 2017 and ranks the 156th. Similarly, although the labour force has grown 

through improved education, physical capital accumulation has stagnated since the 1990s, 

contributing to a steady decline in overall factor productivity. However, significant progress is

being made by Togo in the international transport sector, which is crucial to improving its 

competitiveness. Mention can be made of (i) the 700 km trans-Togo road, (ii) the coastal back 

road (54 km), (iii) the modernization and extension of the port of Lomé, whose capacity has 

increased from 0.5 to 2 million containers per year, and (iv) the construction of a new airport 

in line with international standards. These impactful infrastructures, as well as their 

geographical position, represent opportunities that reinforce Togo's objective of becoming, in 

the medium term, one of the best performing logistics hubs in the region, given its current 

comparative advantage in that domain. In that regard, the World Bank's 2016 report on the 

logistics performance index (published every two years) shows that Togo has climbed 47 

positions, from 139th out of 160 to 92nd, and remarkably 64 positions on the "Speed" indicator, 

measured by shipment forwarding to freight forwarder times or  expected goods to port delivery 

times. 

2.3 Public Finance Management   

2.3.1 Since 2010, the Government has had a National Finance Reform Strategy with a 

Public Finance Management Reform Plan (PA-RGFP), the implementation of which is 

considered generally satisfactory although subject to improvement. Following the PEFA and 

PEMFAR conducted in 2008-2009, which revealed Togo’s extremely weak public finance 

management system, GoT in September 2010 adopted a public finance management reform 

strategy for the period 2010-2020, with an action plan (PA-RGFP) implemented on a sliding 

triennial basis. The PEFA and PEMFAR evaluations conducted in 2016 show that Togo has 

made significant efforts to put in place budget management tools and procedures that are 

good enough to restore public finance sustainability. 

2.3.2 Regarding budget preparation, the budget nomenclature in force (former WAEMU 

1998 standards) is considered adequate to ensure budgetary transparency. The new 

nomenclature, which complies with the new WAEMU guidelines, is being finalized and should 

enter into force for the 2019 budget at the latest. The budget programming process has also 

improved considerably since PEFA 2008, with an increased focus on short- and medium-term 

financial balances in conjunction with medium-term macro-economic and budgetary 

frameworks, debt sustainability analyses and cash flow plans. PEFA 2016 also noted an 

increased involvement of Parliament in the budget debate. 

2.3.3 In terms of budget execution and control, developments are also deemed positive, 

with noted improvement in revenue collection and the means used to ensure better tax base 

control, as well as enhanced taxpayer monitoring. Additionally, the national government 

procurement system has been assessed by the Bank as overall satisfactory, with a moderate 

level of risk. Similarly, financial control has been strengthened and is governed by general 

regulations that are aligned with good practices in terms of segregation of duties in public 

finance management. The national procurement system was assessed in accordance with 

accepted transparency and competition standards. 

 

 

 



6  

2.3.4 However, despite the above-mentioned progress, there are lingering weaknesses, 

although overall fiduciary risk has been assessed as moderate (see Technical Annex 1 on 

Fiduciary Risk Assessment). Accrual accounting is yet to enter into force, and still depends 

on the effective establishment of stock accounting. Similarly, the process of setting up the 

Single Treasury Account, initiated in 2013, has made no notable progress since the State’s 

accounts census stage. Through the Resource Mobilization and institutional capacity building 

support project (PAMOCI) project, the Bank is supporting the implementation of WAEMU 

directives and the Single Treasury Account. Furthermore, the adoption of the legal framework 

governing the financial regime of local and regional authorities has been delayed; the 

completion and publication of public procurement audits are not regular, and PIMA 2016 

reports that "public investment efficiency in Togo is low" with a gap of almost 70% against 

the most efficient countries, which would represent an efficiency loss of approximately 2/3 of 

the potential impact. These weaknesses have been taken into account in the design of the 

PAGPA. At the end of the last PEFA, PEMFAR and PIMA exercises conducted in 2016, the 

PA-RGFP was updated to take into account the findings and recommendations. The 

implementation of this plan should be accelerated, with a view to improving the overall 

performance of public finance management, in particular PI-11 "Investment Management." 

2.4 Inclusive Growth, Poverty and Social Context 

2.4.1 While the social indicators have improved slightly, Togo remains in the bottom 

quintile of the Human Development Index (HDI). The net enrollment ratio (NER) in primary 

education improved overall to 94.3% by 2015. The poverty incidence declined from 61.7% in 

2006 to 55.1% in 2015, but far short of the target of 27.6% expected in 2030 (SDG 1.2) and the 

extreme poverty rate has virtually remained unchanged , moving from 28.6% in 2006 to 28.7% 

in 2015. The Gini index improved from 0.393 to 0.380 between 2011 and 2015 (ODD 10), but 

growth is not yet pro-poor. Despite the progress of the last five years, spatial and gender 

inequalities persist. In rural areas, almost 7 out of 10 Togolese are poor and the availability of 

curative care decreased from 41% in 2014 to 37.7% in 2015, and more than a third of the 

population has to travel at least 5 km to a health centre. Only 50% of women are literate 

compared to 77% of men, and 25 women per 100 men own land, with their average areas 50% 

smaller than for men (CWIQ 2015). As a result, the Human Development Index 2016 remains 

low with a score of 0.487 ranking it 166th out of 188 countries. 

III. GOVERNMENT’S DEVELOPMENT AGENDA 

3.1 Governmental development strategy and medium-term reform priorities 

3.1.1 The Accelerated Growth and Employment Promotion Strategy (SCAPE) is the single 

reference framework for interventions under the Government's development agenda for the 

medium term. In 2013, GoT adopted SCAPE for 2013-2017; it is the reference framework for 

governmental action and comprises five strategic Pillars: (i) development of sectors with high 

growth potential; (ii) strengthening economic infrastructure; (iii) development of human 

capital, social protection and employment; (iv) strengthening governance and (v) promoting 

participatory development. The National Development Programme (PND 2018 - 2022), which 

is being prepared, will replace SCAPE. The transformation of the agriculture sector into a strong 

and inclusive growth sector is at the core of the Government's priorities. Furthermore, Togo is 



7  

working to strengthen financial management by continuing, in particular, with reforms fostering 

increased tax revenues, optimal management of public investments as well as public debt 

reduction.  The proposed PAGPA supports the implementation of these reforms through its 

Component (A), which aims to create a public and private investment framework conducive to 

agribusiness promotion; and component (B) which supports reforms aimed at increasing 

internal resources and improving their predictability in order to facilitate the capital expenditure 

necessary for the agriculture sector’s development. 

3.2  Obstacles to Implementing the National/Sector Development Agenda 

3.2.1  Togo has made remarkable progress which certainly places it on the road to lasting 

resilience. These gains must be consolidated in order to firmly lay the foundations of social 

peace and sustainable and equitable development. Progress is noted in the following areas: 

strengthening of security and stability, economic recovery with average growth rates of 5% 

over a ten-year period, implementation of major institutional and economic reforms, and 

strengthening of regional cooperation. However, the persistent ethnic and regional divide could 

constitute a setback to political stability, thus posing a severe threat to social peace and to exit 

from fragility. These challenges, if not addressed speedily, could impede economic progress. 

Moreover, the effective implementation of the SCAPE is severely constrained by inadequate 

financial resources. It is indeed clear from the last review of SCAPE, ahead of the development 

of the new NDP 2018-2022, that during the period 2013-2015 a total amount of merely CFAF 

516 billion, or 68%, was mobilized for the implementation of the scheduled priority action 

programmes against a requirement of CFAF 2.228 billion. Furthermore, the unsuitability of the 

business environment also constitutes a major obstacle to the emergence of a dynamic private 

sector, capable of driving the transformation of economic activity which remains unstructured 

and over 90% dominated by the informal sector.  

3.3 Consultation and Participation Process 

3.3.1  SCAPE 2013-2017 was developed in a participatory manner to ensure a 

comprehensive consideration of the different concerns of political and socio-economic 

stakeholders countrywide. SCAPE was prepared in consultation with all central and regional 

level stakeholders (central government, local authorities, civil society, private sector, political 

parties, traditional and religious leaders, etc.). Moreover, Togo's technical and financial partners 

were involved throughout the preparatory process.  

3.3.2 The design of the proposed PAGPA benefitted from broad consultations with key 

stakeholders. In particular, detailed discussions were held with the Permanent Secretariat for 

the Monitoring of Reform Policies and Financial Programmes (SP-PRPF) the Togolese 

Revenue Authority (OTR), the budget directorate and the Ministries of Agriculture, Commerce 

and Industry, Livestock, Rural Development, Environment and Gender. These discussions were 

followed by broader consultations with civil society (ONGs and producer associations). These 

exchanges led to agreement with the authorities on the need to involve the Togolese rural 

organizations and farmers’ associations in the framework for follow up and monitoring of 

implementation of the reforms.         



8  

IV. BANK SUPPORT FOR GOVERNMENT’S STRATEGY 

4.1 Linkages with Bank's Strategy 

The reforms under PAGPA support the implementation of the Bank's Togo CSP (2016-

2020). The programme’s first component supports reforms within the framework of Pillar (I) 

of the CSP, which aims at "Development of inclusive growth and agribusiness competitiveness 

poles”, and its second component largely contributes to the implementation of the Pillar (2) 

"Support for financial sector and local governance ". The proposed PAGPA, envisaged in the 

CSP, also contributes to the implementation of the Bank's 2013-2022 ten-year strategy and the 

Governance Action Plan (GAP II 2014-2018 ); more specifically, it contributes to three of the 

Bank's High Five strategic priorities: (i) "Feed Africa"; (ii) "Industrialize Africa" through 

measures to promote agro-industry and (iii) "Improve the quality of life for the people of Africa" 

by supporting reforms aimed at improving budget management and public action effectiveness 

through strengthening economic and financial governance and the key sector of agriculture. 

4.2  Compliance with Eligibility Criteria 

Togo fulfills the pre-requisites for budget support operations, as defined in the Bank's policy 

on reform programme support operations (see Technical Annex 3). However, efforts are still 

required in terms of coordination. The budget support consultation framework (COAB) is not 

optimal; there is no joint policy matrix of budget support interventions. Additionally, delays are 

noted in the implementation of a number of public finance reforms, translating into 

unsatisfactory results in the PEFA 2016 evaluation, where 28 out of 30 indicators are rated "C" 

or "D". Similarly, PIMA 2016 assessed the management of weak-efficiency investments. 

However, in view of the consistency of the measures of institutional reform being implemented 

and the level of integration of the national framework of the public finance management (see 

technical annex 1), global fiduciary risk has been rated moderate. In addition it should be 

minimized if the reforms planned in the PAGPA and others being finalised in the different 

departments concerned were diligently implemented. Furthermore, the Government is 

determined to accelerate the implementation of the national public finance reforms plan of 

PEFA, PEMFAR and PIMA, updated at the end of the 2016 fiscal year. 

4.3 Collaboration and Coordination with other Partners 

In designing the proposed programme, the Bank met with key technical and financial partners 

(TFPs) intervening through budget support, namely the IMF, WB, and EU. The AFD and 

UNDP also participated in the discussions. The operations in progress, or under preparation for 

the period 2017-2019, are: (i) the IMF's ECF of USD 241.5 million; (ii) the WB’s reform 

programme of USD 75 million and (iii) the EU’s budget support of EUR 54 million. Although 

thus far there is no joint intervention matrix, which awaits agreement with the government on 

its orientation, all partners, including the Bank, are strongly committed to harmonizing their 

actions in terms of dialogue and monitoring reforms. The areas of intervention of the TFPs are 

presented in Technical Annex No. 10.

4.4 Linkages with other Bank Operations 

4.4.1 Bank’s Active Portfolio in Togo: The active portfolio at April 2017 consists of ten 

operations for a total net commitment of UA117 

million (USD 160 million). It comprises eight 

national operations of UA 41.7 million (USD 57 

million) or 36% of the overall envelope. It also 

includes 64% for two multinational operations of UA 

75.3 million (USD 103 million). A high 75% of the 

portfolio is financed by grants. The sector 

distribution of the portfolio indicates the 

predominance of transport infrastructure with about 

64%, followed by economic and financial governance (17%), the social sector (16%), the water 

and sanitation sector (1%) and agriculture (1%). 

4.4.2  The March 2016 Portfolio Review assessed the portfolio performance as overall 

satisfactory, with a score of 3 out of 4 according to the rating of the latest Implementation Status 

and Results Report (ISRR). The portfolio’s performance is considered satisfactory with an 

overall disbursement rate of 42%, for an average age of 2.3 years. The portfolio is fairly young, 

with 50% of the projects approved between 2015 and 2016. The key challenges concern the 

mobilization of the national counterpart funds (particularly for transport projects) and the 

administrative red tape for disbursement and procurement. Special attention should be paid to 

the release of the national counterpart funds for the Togo-Burkina road rehabilitation and 

transport facilitation project, which is scheduled to close at end- 2017. The government will 

also take steps to accelerate the construction of the Togo-Benin juxtaposed checkpoint financed 

by the Lomé-Cotonou road rehabilitation project and transport facilitation on the Abidjan-

Lagos Corridor, Phase 1. 

4.4.3 Complementarity with Previous Operations: PAGPA is a continuation of the Bank's 

previous PARG-II budget support through the strengthening of public finance management and 

improvement of the business environment (see technical annex 7 on the achievements of 

PARGII). The implementation of the first component reforms will create the appropriate legal 

and institutional framework for the investment project under preparation by the department in 

charge of agriculture in the Bank, aimed at establishment of the Kara Agropole. The 

presentation this project to the Board is scheduled for December 2017. Furthermore, the second 

component reforms will benefit particularly from the capacity building activities under PAGFI 

(2016-2020), which is institutional support for the modernization of the OTR for optimized 

revenue collection. Additionally, the programme budget and the deconcentration of payment 

authorization and financial control will be further facilitated as the Integrated Public Finance 

Management System (SIGFIP) will be fully deployed and adapted to the new the new budget 

framework. The technical assistance and equipment needs for its deployment are fully covered 

by PAMOCI (2015-2018). Lastly, PAGPA is in complete synergy with the project to support 

markets reconstruction and traders in Kara and Lomé (2014-2018); the project to support youth 

employability and integration (2015-2020) and the project to support the financial inclusion of 

vulnerable women (PAIFFV 2016-2018).

4.4.4 Lessons Learned from Previous Operations:The completion reports for PARCI I and 

II, and PARG II, indicate the following lessons: (i) the match between the scope of the reform 

programmes and the implementation capabilities of the structures involved; and (ii) the need to 

underpin reform programmes with institutional support. These lessons are taken into account 

in the design of PAGPA. The programme focuses on a limited number of reforms, but is 

strategic and aligned with the national objectives of the SCAPE. Furthermore, the programme 

will be supported by capacity building projects (PAMOCI and PAGFI), and the monitoring and 

evaluation mechanism will involve civil society in periodic reviews.  

4.4.5 Analyses Underlying the Operation: Analyses conducted by GoT, the Bank and other 

technical and financial partners (TFPs) served as the basis for the preparation of the budget 

support programme. The foremost among them are: (i) Public Expenditure Management and 

Financial Accountability Review (2016 PIMA, PEFA and PEMFAR), at the end of which the 

PA-RGFP action plan was updated; (ii) the WB's 2018 Doing Business report; (iii) the IMF's 

Article IV consultations report in November 2016; and (iv) the report of the Dutch Consultancy 

Kadaster on the reform of the Directorate of State Land and Cadastral Affairs (DADC). The 

main recommendations of these studies concern (i) strengthening budget credibility and 

accelerating the fiscal transition, (ii) improving land management, and (iii) the need for 

economic transformation to drive strong and more inclusive growth. 

V. THE  ENVISAGED PROGRAMME  

5.1 Programme Goal and Objective  

5.1.1 The programme’s principal objective is to contribute towards creating conditions 

conducive to inclusive economic growth. Its specific objectives are to support the development 

of an investment climate conducive to agribusiness development in a context of improved 

internal resource mobilization capacity to support the required public investment. The 

programme addresses Togo’s major persistent challenges in terms of exiting fragility and 

reducing its vulnerability to social crises. Furthermore, the programme will extend the Bank's 

interventions to reforms geared towards gender mainstreaming in government actions, 

particularly in the agriculture sector. 

5.1.2 The programme comprises two components: A) Support for improved private 

investment environment and agribusiness promotion: this component supports implementing 

reform measures aimed at setting up efficient mechanisms and a business environment 

conducive to agribusiness development; (B) Support for enhanced internal resource 

mobilization and optimization of public investment management: This component aims to 

strengthen the mobilization of internal resources, and streamline the management of public 

investments, in order to offset the agricultural sector’s infrastructure deficit and attract more 

private investors to agribusiness. 

 



11  

5.2 Component A: Support for improved private investment environment and 

agribusiness promotion 

Sub-component A.1: Improving the private investment environment 

5.2.1 Context, Constraints & Challenges. The private sector’s contribution to the national 

economy remains relatively low. It contributes merely15% to GDP and remains dominated by 

the informal sector. The formal industrial private sector contributes only 4 to 6% to GDP, which 

is well below the country’s potential. The agricultural sector offers the greatest potential in 

terms of job and wealth creation. However, formal private sector investment is undermined by 

the constraints of this sector. The main constraints on private sector development, particularly 

in  agribusiness, include: (i) predominance of the informal sector; (ii) lack of competitiveness 

due to the high cost of inputs (water, energy, transport, the Internet, etc.); tax policy not aligned 

with private sector development, in particular the need to create more synergy between the 

Investment Code incentives and the Free Zone regime; (iii) insecurity of land tenure; (iv) a 

dispersed institutional framework based on a multitude of entities dedicated to the same 

investment promotion functions (Togo's Presidential Investment Council, Togo-Invest, 

Ministry of Trade, Ministry of Industry, Investment Promotion Agency and non-operational 

free zones, etc.); (v) limited capacity of management structures to support SME/SMI enterprises 

in developing business plans for access to markets and technology; (vi) mismatch between 

training and employment in relation to the actual needs of the Private Sector; and (vii) 

inadequacy of the regulatory framework for management of Public-Private Partnership (PPP) 

Contracts (the revision of framework and establishment of the PPP Unit is envisaged after the 

adoption of the pertinent UEMOA directives). 

5.2.2  Government’s Achievements & Strategies: In response to these constraints, the 

Government of Togo has adopted national and sector strategy papers focusing on the private 

sector as the prime mover of economic growth, jobs and wealth creation. The establishment of 

structures, such as the One-Stop Shop and the Presidential Council for Investment in Togo 

(CPIT), which is a framework for dialogue between the Government and the Private Sector at 

the highest level, has been beneficial. The CPIT helped identify the major constraints on the 

Togolese Private Sector’s attractiveness and competitiveness, and made recommendations that 

enabled the country to climb from 164th to 149th position, moving up 15 places in one year in 

the Doing Business 2015 ranking. But this ranking has deteriorated in successive reports by 

2016, 2017 and 2018 with respective ranks of 154th and 156ieme on 190 ranked economies. 

However, the country has made progress compared to the year 2016, notably in the following 

areas: Starting a business (+7 points); Getting electricity (+1 point); Trading across borders 

(+10 points); and Resolving insolvency (+3 points). Togo must not only consolidate the above 

gains by pursuing structural reforms, but also make efforts to improve its ranking in the 

following areas: lengthy timeframes for: (i) ownership transfer (283 days against an average of 

60 days in WAEMU) and (ii) obtaining a building permit (163 days against 156 days in the 

WAEMU), and the multiplicity of taxes paid per year (49 against an average of 39 in the 

WAEMU). Furthermore, the government has established DOSI. This structure, supported by 

the bank under PAMOCI, is aimed at supporting informal sector operators to gradually 

formalize their activities. The government has also supported the setting up of recognized 

management centres in line with the directive of UEMOA. In addition, the government is 



12  

committed, under the FMI programme and the World Bank operation under preparation, to 

implement structural measures to improve the competitiveness of the sectors of energy and 

telecommunications with a view to reducing production costs.    

5.2.3  Reforms envisaged: Creating a business environment conducive to private sector 

development in Togo requires removing the above constraints through administrative and 

institutional reforms. These include: (i) updating the Investment Code to attract foreign and 

domestic investment and strengthen it, with a view to employment creation under SCAPE; (ii) 

operationalizing the Investment and Free Zone Promotion Agency by appointing the Director 

General and his team; (iii) adopting a National Strategy; (iv) adoption of a new tax code aimed 

at simplifying the tax structure and procedures; and (v) the creation of a Business Climate Unit 

dedicated to strengthened monitoring and improvement of indicators of performance relating 

to the business environment. 

Sub-component A.2: Strengthening the legal and institutional framework for agribusiness 

development  

5.2.4 Context and Challenges: Since the 1960s, the State of Togo has demonstrated its 

willingness to promote the industrial sector, through the transformation of a substantial part of 

agricultural and mineral commodities successively through a State model based on imports 

substitution until the late 1980s and then through liberalization policies granting the private 

sector an increased role. Despite these efforts, it is clear that the industrial sector remains poorly 

developed and weakly integrated with the rest of the economy. Embryonic and sparse, Togo’s 

industrial fabric comprises around ten large companies, a hundred medium-sized industries and 

a relatively large number of very small industrial units. The industrial sector's contribution to 

GDP over the last three years averaged 17.8%, with an average growth of 1.3% per year. Togo 

has opted for the transformation of the agricultural sector as the basis for the structural 

transformation of its economy. Togo’s agricultural sector employs 60-70% of the working 

population and accounts for 38% of GDP. This sector has significant potential, with 3.4 million 

hectares of arable land, of which, only 45% are currently under cultivation with low yields of 

below 50% of the optimum level. It is characterized by a very low level of mechanization and 

professional expertise, with 89% of the cultivated land sown manually (hoes and machetes). To 

leverage this sector as an engine of economic growth and social inclusion, the country has 

formulated and adopted an agricultural policy (2015-2030) aimed at achieving "modern, 

sustainable and high value-added agriculture ". The promotion of agro-industry and Agropoles 

is pivotal in this policy, which will enable the creation of integrated development zones around 

agricultural activity in order to support the promotion of industrial and services clusters and 

stimulate growth. The Agropoles pilot programme covers three of the country’s five regions 

that have been selected on the basis of their comparative advantages, as well as inclusion and 

poverty reduction criteria. The priority target products are rice, soybean, cashew nuts and 

sesame, sorghum, millet, maize and livestock. The objective is to enhance food security through 

import-substitution and exporting surpluses in the regional markets of WAEMU and 

ECOWAS, given Togo's age-old trade tradition, the opportunities offered by its geographical 

position and the expected increase in regional demand due to population growth, urbanization, 

income growth and diet diversification. 



13  

5.2.5 Major constraints on the promotion of Agropoles and agro-industry in Togo are: (i) 

lack of industrial policy and lack of serviced industrial sites; (ii) weak integration of the 

industrial sector with other sectors of the economy in general and the agricultural sector in 

particular, due mainly to supply difficulties and the lack of organization of the sectors; (iii) 

inadequacy of quality infrastructure and production support that hamper the development of the 

industrial fabric and agribusiness in particular; (iii) weak competitiveness of industrial 

products, due notably to the high cost of production factors (energy, transport, communications, 

etc.), non-conformity of industrial products with international standards, unfair competition 

from some industrial products imported fraudulently, and absence of legal instruments and an 

institutional quality control system for consumer products marketing in Togo; (v) credit access 

difficulties, notably for the agricultural sector which represents on average 1-2% of the bank’s 

portfolio, due particularly to the poor organization and professionalization of agricultural value 

chains and land tenure insecurity, especially for women; (vi) weaknesses in the institutional 

framework for industrial support, due mainly to strategic, organizational and institutional 

weaknesses at the level of the Ministry of Industry and industrial support services3; (vii) lack 

of accredited laboratories and inspection bodies capable of carrying out physical/chemical and 

microbiological analyses of industrial and agro-industrial products, testing and calibration in 

metrology and certifications to international standards for local marketing and export; (viii) 

territorial imbalance between the maritime region, which hosts nearly all the industrial units, 

and the country’s other regions which are agriculture-oriented and under-industrialized due 

mainly to the lack of appropriate infrastructure.      

5.2.6 Government’s Achievements & Strategies: In response to these constraints, the 

Government of Togo has adopted a number of reforms with special focus on industrial 

development. These include the Framework Law of 12 August 2009 on the organization of the 

national harmonization scheme for standardization, accreditation, certification, metrology, 

environment and promotion of quality in Togo; Decree of 27 December 2013 issued pursuant 

to Law No. 2011-018 of 24 June 2011 on the status of the industrial free zone; Law of 20 

January 2012 on the Investment Code in the Togolese Republic; Decree of 27 December 2013 

issued pursuant to Law No. 2012-001 of 20 January 2012 on the Investment Code in the 

Togolese Republic; Decree of 27 December 2013 on the allocation, organization and operation 

of the National Agency for the Promotion of Investments and the Free Zone and the Accelerated 

Growth and Employment Promotion Strategy (SCAPE) 2013-2017, under which industrial 

development and the transformation of agriculture are major pillars. More recently in 2016, the 

Agricultural Policy, together with the Strategic Plan for the Transformation of Agriculture in 

Togo by 2030, was also adopted.  

5.2.7 Several measures have also been implemented with a view to facilitating access to 

financing, in particular the creation of the National Agency for the Promotion and Guarantee 

of Financing of SMEs and SMIs (ANPGF). Additionally, the WAEMU Directive on public 

procurement and the delegation of services was made internal in 2014. This instrument, which 

did not take into account partnership contracts, nevertheless provided for the development of a 

PPP strategy and the setting up of a PPP management unit. These two reforms are suspended 

                                                 
3  In particular the quality management infrastructure: Metrology-Standards-Quality Control (MSQC) 

 



14  

pending a new institutional framework by WAEMU, which more clearly separates delegation 

and partnership contracts, on the one hand, from public procurement, on the other. Lastly, the 

finalization of the National Industrialization Policy is underway and will be followed by an 

Industrialization Strategy, which will be prepared in collaboration with the Bank and UNIDO. 

To this end, the authorities sent a request for technical assistance to the Bank aimed at making 

Togo a pilot experiment for the implementation of the strategic pillar relating to the 

industrialization of Africa. 

5.2.8 Reforms envisaged: Accelerating industrial development in Togo requires 

implementing a number of reforms aimed at removing the above constraints, particularly 

through measures such as: (i) adoption of a National Industrialization Policy; (ii) 

operationalization of the High Authority for Quality and Technical Quality Structures (the Fund 

and the Agencies) through the appointment of the Director General and his team and the 

allocation of the necessary resources for its start up in the 2018 budget; (iii) the adoption of a 

National Agropoles Strategy; (iv) adoption of instruments governing the national Agropoles 

development structure; (v) adoption of a new Land Code governing the land registry which 

would foster agribusiness development and loan access. 

5.2.9 The main expected outcomes of Component A are: (i) improving the agricultural trade 

balance deficit, (ii) strengthening Togo's resilience to fragility factors related to spatial and 

gender inequalities; (iii) improving the competitiveness of the agricultural sector; (iv) securing 

land for the development of agribusiness and facilitating access to financing; and (v) improving 

the business environment for domestic and foreign private investment. 

5.2.10 Component B: Support for internal resources mobilization and optimal 

management of public investments: 

Sub-component B.1: Improved Revenue Mobilization 

5.2.11 Context Constraints and Challenges: Togo has committed, under the programme with 

the IMF, to substantially reducing the level of public debt by prohibiting any new external non-

concessional loan and by capping the volume of concessional commitments. Against this 

backdrop, and faced with the urgent need to pursue investment spending that is crucial to 

achieving the development objectives of SCAPE, maximizing internal resources mobilization 

in the short term is essential as the main factor for macroeconomic stability and the 

sustainability of the budget framework. The establishment of the OTR in 2014, coupled with 

the modernization and extension of the Lome Port Authority, has definitely helped to enhance 

Togo’s revenue mobilization capabilities. The ratio of tax revenues (cash basis) to GDP 

increased from 15.9% in 2013 to 17.9% in 2016 and could reach 19% in 2018, nearly the 20% 

WAEMU standard. However, recent economic developments in the sub-region have 

highlighted the great sensitivity of OTR's performance to customs duties; with OTR’s, results 

for 2016 falling below target for the first time. This underperformance, though minimal (-1.1%), 

is mainly due to the sluggish economic conditions in the country's key trading partners (Nigeria, 

Ghana). In this regard, the major challenge for the country is to optimize domestic taxation by 

broadening the tax base through the exploitation of the land niche in particular. Additionally, 

simplification of customs and tax procedures should be pursued to attract private investment 

and accelerate added value creation. 



15  

5.2.12 Government’s Achievements & Strategies: In response to the challenge of improving 

internal revenue mobilization, the Government, with the Bank's support, initiated structural 

reforms that culminated in the establishment in 2012 of the Togolese revenue authority (OTR), 

which incorporates the two State financial administrations (taxes and customs) into a single 

entity with administrative and financial management autonomy. The operationalization of the 

OTR has enabled Togo to increase its budgetary revenues substantially; they increased from 

CFAF 403.6 billion in 2013 to 568.5 billion in 2016, representing a 40.8% rise. The average 

growth rate of tax revenues over the period 2013-2016 is 12.7%. Furthermore, the country 

adopted a new Customs Code which entered into force in 2014 (Law No. 2014 - 003 of 28 April 

2014) replacing the old instrument dating from 1966. A new revision of the Customs Code is 

underway to, among other things, further clarify the division of powers and responsibilities 

between the OTR and the Ministry in charge of finance and fiscal policy. In addition, the draft 

text of the new Customs Code will take into account recent developments in international trade 

regarding trade facilitation and improved customs procedures. Similarly, the GoT initiated the 

revision of the tax code with a view to simplifying the tax system to make it more attractive to 

investors and also more accessible to tax administration and taxpayers. Lastly, the GoT in 2016 

committed to a feasibility study for the establishment of a tax registry for an optimized property 

tax base. 

5.2.13 Reforms Envisaged: To accelerate enhanced internal resources mobilization, PAGPA 

will support the adoption by the Council of Ministers of the: (i) Lomé Tax Registry Decree, (ii) 

new national Customs Code; (iii) decree establishing the fiscal policy unit by the MEF; and (iv) 

bill on the transfer of powers and resources to local and regional authorities. 

Sub-component B.2: Strengthening Public Investment Management 

5.2.14 Context, Constraints and Challenges: Investment management was assessed as very 

unsatisfactory by the PIMA, PEFA and PEMFAR exercises conducted in 2016. The PIMA 

report shows that "public investment efficiency in Togo is low" with a nearly 70% gap 

compared to the best performing countries. This represents a loss of approximately 2/3 of the 

effectiveness of the potential impact. The Public Investment Program (PIP) is not aligned with 

the budget. An absolute gap of 15% between the 2016 PIP component and the draft budget for 

2016 transmitted to Parliament was noted. Inadequacies have been identified at all levels of the 

process (multi-year programming, ex ante evaluation, project selection, public procurement 

performance monitoring, and availability of investment credits). PEMFAR4 noted the absence 

of "national guidelines defining the principles and conditions for the economic and financial 

evaluation of projects". Economic evaluations of cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness are not 

always conducted, and whenever this is done no review mechanism for results review by an 

independent structure of the contracting authority is in place. Additionally, project recurrent 

costs are poorly estimated and only the operating costs of a project as an administrative unit are 

included in the budget. This partly accounts for the shortcomings noted in the public 

investments monitoring with irregular implementation monitoring activities and incomplete or 

non-existent data bases on physical and financial implementation of investments. The 

investment management situation in Togo deteriorated further with the so-called "pre-

                                                 
4  PEMFAR 2017 Report 



16  

financing"5 practice that the GoT applied between 2011 and 2016. Under this mechanism, 

besides the shortcomings of the basic financial package, pre-financing agreements were 

concluded and executed outside the public expenditure circuit and to the total exclusion of the 

internal control and external audit bodies. State reimbursements to banks thus faced high risks 

of fictitious progress payment claims and/or poor quality work. Lastly, investment management 

and, in general, the implementation of public policies in Togo are also handicapped by the lack 

of programme budgets, weak results-based budgeting practices and the centralization of 

financial control. PEMFAR 2016 noted that "in Togo, the centralization of authorizing officer 

and financial controller functions are veritable sources of delays and inefficiency in the 

expenditure circuit". Indeed, having no local or regional delegations, all vote holders in local 

authorities must travel to Lomé to submit their commitment and validation files. 

5.2.15 Government’s Achievements & Strategies: As part of its IMF- backed programme, 

the government stopped the pre-financing practice in the latter half of 2016. The government 

also pledged not to undertake new pre-financed investments, to validate all existing pre-

financed investments and to include pre-financing debt in the outstanding public debt. The 

authorities have also decided to follow in future the budgetary and procurement procedures for 

all new public investments. Besides the effective abandonment of pre-financing, it is crucial to 

establish an efficient investment management system, systematize programme budgets and 

decentralize financial control speedily in order to ensure an optimal framework for future 

investments, notably those required for the implementation of the national Agropoles 

development strategy. 

5.2.16 Reforms envisaged: PAGPA will support (i) the development of a public investments 

planning, selection and programming manual; (ii) adoption of the ministerial order on the 

framework for regional monitoring of investment projects execution; (iii) finalization of the 

adaptation of SIGFIP to the technical requirements for the implementation of programme 

budgets; (iv) adoption by the Council of the Ministers of the decree on the deconcentration of 

financial control and powers, organization and functioning of financial control; (v) publication 

of the 2014 and 2015 public procurement audit reports; and (vi) the creation of Unit for 

government participation with a view to strengthening the monitoring of public investments 

and the management of state assets. 

5.2.17 The main results of Component B are: (i) sustained revenue growth, (ii) improved 

PIP implementation rate; (iii) improved local fiscal governance; and (iv) enhanced financial 

and technical capabilities of local and regional authorities. 

5.3   Policy Dialogue 

5.3.1 PAGPA will strengthen dialogue with the Government and consultation with other 

TFPs, mainly in the following areas: (i) internal resources mobilization, where discussions will 

focus on the need to broaden the tax base; and (ii) transformation of the Togolese economy with 

special focus on the conditions for effective implementation of the agricultural policy. In this 

regard, and relying on its country office, the Bank will continue support for improved land 

                                                 
5  PEMFAR 2017 Report: This mechanism consists in awarding a public contract to one or more contractors to carry out a public investment. 

Successful bidders are financed by commercial banks to perform the work with guarantees from the Togolese State. The State in its 

capacity as contracting authority reimburses the former as and when the works/services are performed, in principle after acceptance of 

progress payment claims submitted by the operators. 



17  

management in order to speed up the establishment of a reliable registry to secure land tenure, 

a prerequisite for attracting private investors. In addition, PAGPA will enable the Bank to raise 

the level of dialogue with Togo on issues of gender promotion and civil society’s participatory 

role. Lastly, ongoing discussions will be continued with the Togolese government towards 

operationalizing the joint framework for the monitoring and evaluation of the performance of 

budget support and reform program. 

5.4 Grant Conditions  
 

Table 2. PAGPA Preliminary Measures 

 

5.5 Application of Good Practice Principles on Conditionality 

In accordance with the 14 March 2012 Bank policy on budget support operations, the design of 

the proposed PAGPA applied good practice principles on conditionalities. Eight conditions 

precedent have been agreed with the Country and these are in line with the country's priorities. 

They are drawn from national reform documents, in this case the agricultural policy and PR-

GFP. The programme’s Pillars and the results-based logical framework were discussed, and 

agreed, with the Government and all stakeholders, including other TFPs and civil society. The 

disbursement schedule is aligned with the budget cycle. 

5.6 Financing Requirements and Terms 

The macroeconomic framework was updated as part of the supplementary budget approved by 

the Cabinet in November 2017 in order to take into account the commitments made under the 

IMF program which aims to reduce Togo's indebtedness risk. This revised budget 2017 projects 

a level of revenues (excluding grants) of CFAF 560.4 billion against expenditures of CFAF 

841.23 billion (including arrears payments). The resulting financing gap of CFAF 280.83 

billion is entirely covered by internal financing and external resources from technical and 

financial partners including the Bank.

5.7 Application of Bank Group Policy on Non-Concessional Debts Accumulation 

The proposed PAGPA is financed by a grant and thus not governed by the Bank Group Policy 

on non-concessional debt accumulation. 

 

VI. IMPLEMENTATION  

6.1 Programme Beneficiaries 

The direct beneficiary of the programme is the Ministry of economy and finance through 

the financing of the national budget. In an indirect way the program will benefit to the 

whole Togolese population. PAGPA will help lay the groundwork for a structural 

transformation of the local economy and regions around major Agropole projects, as a source 

of resilience to address fragility concerns in the rural areas (about 62% of Togolese population) 

and on the outskirts of Lomé and the regional capitals. In particular, the development of the 

Agropole in the Kara region should enable the creation of 2,500 jobs by 2020, of which 30% 

for women and 65% for youth, an electricity access rate of 43% (against 16% in 2015) and 55% 

access to drinking water (against 25% in 2015). 

6.2 Impact on Gender, the Poor and Vulnerable Groups 

Despite the progress made over the past five years, gender discrimination persists. In 2011, 

Togo adopted a National Policy on Gender Equity and Equality. In 2014, the Code of Persons 

and Family was also revised, thus enabling legislation on major discriminations that existed in 

marriage and inheritance. In particular, Article 99, which provided that "The man shall be the 

family head" has become "The family shall be run by the spouses". However, in the absence of 

a clear intervention strategy, exclusionary practices identified in the National Policy remain 

topical, including difficulty of access to farmland for women. In addition to the family code, 

PAGPA will support the adoption of the law on gender parity in elective and appointive 

positions, the effectiveness of which will do more to further raise the required awareness among 

opinion leaders. Moreover, the programme will support a study to explore equitable gender 

mainstreaming in tax policy without altering the impersonal nature of taxation. The 

recommendations of this study will form an integral part of the national gender strategy also 

supported by the programme. 



19  

6.3 Impact on the Environment and Climate Change  

PAGPA is classified as Category III in accordance with the Bank's environmental and 

social impact assessment procedures. PAGPA has no negative environmental impact. 

However, the country is faced with the adverse effects of climate change and environmental 

challenges, particularly in the agricultural, forestry, energy, mining and water resources sectors 

and in coastal zone management. The GoT demonstrates a strong commitment to providing 

lasting solutions to the environmental degradation problems and considering climate change in 

public policy. Since 29 December 1998, Togo has adopted its National Environment Policy in 

accordance with international environmental agreements (the Vienna Convention and the 

Montreal Protocol, the Rio Conventions and their respective Protocols, Rotterdam Convention, 

Stockholm Convention)6. Furthermore, SCAPE 2013-2017 lays special emphasis on the 

environment and community resilience to climate change, with the intensification of actions 

provided for under initiatives such as: (i) National Adaptation Plan (PANA); (ii) National 

Programme for Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD + 2010-

2050); (iii) National Action Plan for the Management of Marine and Coastal Environmental 

Resources; and (iv) Environmental Management Capacity Building Programme (PRCGE). 

6.4 Macroeconomic Impacts 

The proposed PAGPA will contribute to macroeconomic stability by improving the agricultural 

sector’s performance and reducing the trade deficit. Furthermore, according to a study by the 

Dutch firm Kadaster on the reform of State lands and Cadastral Affairs Directorate (DADC), 

the potential yield of property tax (Land Taxes on built-on estates, land ownership registration 

duties) at the national level, based on a computerized cadastre on only the 400 000 plots already 

identified, would be over CFAF 100 billion against CFAF 1.4 billion of revenue collected in 

2016. PAGPA would help generate the budgetary resources required to make impactful 

investments, notably those needed for the Agropoles, which represent sources of new business 

and employment opportunities. 

 

6.5 Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation 

The Programme’s executing agency is the Permanent Secretariat for the Monitoring of Reform 

Policies and Financial Programmes (SP-PRPF) within the Ministry of Economy and Finance. 

The implementation of PAGPA will be monitored through semi-annual and annual 

implementation reports, prepared by the SP-PRPF on the basis of a joint review with the 

programme’s participating structures as well as members of civil society, in particular the 

Coordination of Togolese farmer organizations and agricultural producers. The Togolese 

authorities will also transmit to the Bank the compliance report on the 2017 budget review law 

no later than 31 December 2018, drawn up by the Audit Court. The Bank will monitor the 

Programme in coordination with the group of TFPs acting through budgetary support. The Bank 

will undertake at least two programme supervision missions per year, and ensure that it interacts 

with all Programme stakeholders, including civil society.

6.6 Financial Management and Disbursement 

 

6.6.1 Disbursement: The resources of the proposed operation comprise as follows:  

 An amount of UA 2.32 million (ADF) that will be disbursed in a single instalment in 2017, 

upon entry into force of the ADF Grant Agreement between the Republic of Togo and the 

African Development Fund and the fulfillment of the conditions precedent set out for the 

disbursement in section 7.2.3 below; and 

 An amount of UA 7.21 million, from the Transitional States Facility (TSF), that will be 

disbursed in a single instalment in 2017, upon entry into force of the TSF Grant Agreement 

between the Republic of Togo, African Development Fund and African Development Bank 

and the fulfillment of the conditions precedent set out for the disbursement in section 7.2.3 

below. 

 

6.6.2 Financial Management and Audit: The assessment of the fiduciary framework of the 

public finance management system shows moderate fiduciary risks (see technical annex 1). In 

accordance with the fiduciary strategy for the CSP 2016-2020 period, PAGPA will be entirely 

managed within the national public finance management system. The effective payment of 

budget support resources into the State budget will be monitored through the Audit Court’s 

General Compliance Report on fiscal 2017, which will be transmitted to the Bank and the 

National Assembly of Togo at the same time. In addition, the Audit Court will audit the 

financial flows of the Special Account opened in the name of the Treasury and intended for the 

deposit of the grant resources. This report must be sent to the Bank no later than 3 months after 

the disbursement. 

 

6.6.3 Goods and Services Procurement: The grant will be in the form of general budget 

support. Accordingly, its implementation does not directly entail any goods and services 

procurement issues. It is clear from the fiduciary risk assessment that the legal and institutional 

framework for public procurement in Togo is overall operational, and that public procurement 

is conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Public Procurement Code. However, some 

shortcomings are noted, particularly, the regular absence of: (i) annual audit reports; (ii) post-

auditing of contracts below the review threshold of the National Procurement Audit Department 

(DNCMP); and (iii) capacity constraints of the contracting authorities. The reform measures 

identified under the proposed PAGPA, and the political dialogue on the continued need to 

improve the procurement system, will help address these shortcomings. Furthermore, the 

revision of the public procurement code and its implementing instruments initiated since 2011 

is being finalized, and should lead to the adoption before end- 2017 of a new legislative and 

regulatory framework.

Subject: Letter of Development Policy. 

Mr President, 

This Letter of Development Policy (LDP) outlines the progress Togo has made in implementing 

its national development strategy and the prospects for 2017-2020. It describes the development 

objectives and policies the authorities have defined for the pursuit of their reform agenda to 

consolidate economic growth and reduce poverty. To achieve these goals, the Government 

continues to seek the technical and financial support of all the various partners, in particular the 

African Development Bank, through the Governance and Agribusiness Promotion Support 

Programme (PAGPA). 

I. Status of Implementation of the Accelerated Growth and Employment Promotion 

 Strategy (SCAPE 2013-2017) 

The Accelerated Growth and Employment Promotion Strategy is in its final year of 

implementation. At end-2016, the implementation by strategic thrust stands as follows: 

1. For the thrust on the development of sectors with high growth potential, performance 

indicators show progress in the agricultural production sector, in the development of handicrafts 

and in services. On the other hand, the industrial development sector falls short of the 

objectives. The results recorded in the agricultural sector stem from the implementation of the 

PNIASA projects. Thus, agricultural GDP grew by 7% relative to 2015. The rate of coverage 

of cereal product needs is on average 110% over the 2013-2016 period, and that of livestock 

products is estimated at 56% of national needs in 2016. In services, the balance of goods and 

services as a percentage of GDP indicates an improvement in the deficit from -21.1 in 2013 to 

-9 in 2016. With regard to industrial development, the harmonized production index rose from 

121.9 in 2011 to 147.5 in 2013 and fell to 126.9 in 2014, 99.7 in 2015 and 97.3 in 2016. 



II  

2. There has been significant progress in the area of human capital, social protection 

and employment, particularly in the education, health and employment sectors. The primary 

school completion rate reached 94.8%; maternal and neonatal mortality recorded a downward 

trend and 8,143 permanent jobs and 11,478 temporary jobs were created. Social indicators have 

improved slightly in recent years but still rank Togo in the last quintile of the Human 

Development Index (HDI). The net enrolment ratio (NER) in primary education improved 

overall to 94.3% in 2015. The incidence of poverty fell from 61.7% in 2006 to 55.1% in 2015, 

and the extreme poverty rate has not witnessed any tangible improvement. The Gini index 

improved from 0.393 to 0.380 between 2011 and 2015 (SDG 10) despite progress over the last 

five years and spatial and gender inequalities persist. In rural areas, nearly 7 out of 10 Togolese 

are poor and the availability of curative services decreased from 41% in 2014 to 37.7% in 2015. 

The 2016 Human Development Index remains weak with a score of 0.487, ranking Togo 166th 

out of 188 countries. 

3. Significant progress has been made in the area of infrastructure strengthening. In 

order for Togo to bridge its infrastructure deficit, the socio-economic infrastructure 

rehabilitation and construction policy was the most financed of the SCAPE focus areas. Roads 

with fairly good service levels reached 60%, compared with 16.7% in 2011; thus, the average 

time taken by a truck to ply the NL1 dropped from 72 hours in 2012 to 48 hours in 2016. 

Extension of the PAL, by the construction of the dock and third quay with a capacity of 14,000 

TEU, helped to boost traffic especially regarding transhipment (70,808.537 or 55.8% of the 

traffic in 2016). Thanks to the extension and modernization of GNASSIMGBE Eyadema 

International Airport, airport activities have grown and traffic has increased from 694,335 to 

758,784 passengers, representing a rise of 9.2% in 2016. The electrification rate rose from 

28.3% in 2014 to 35.5% in 2016, and the fixed and mobile telephony penetration rate rose from 

67.11% in 2011 to 77.6% in 2016. 

4. With regard to the promotion of participatory, balanced and sustainable 

development, the evaluation of indicators at end 2016 shows progress. Thus, 25.67 billion 

worth of micro-credits were granted on guarantee funds to support grassroots communities in 

2016, compared with 2 billion in 2013. As regards the number of development hubs created, 

the Government, through SCAPE, planned to promote wealth creation at local level based on 

the potential of each region. Public action aims to develop agricultural clusters, industrial 

clusters and service clusters. As regards the balanced emergence of development hubs, no 

cluster has yet been created. 

5. Progress has also been made regarding the strengthening of governance. The CPIA 

indicator rose from 2.94 in 2011 to 3.55 in 2013, and stagnated at 3 as from 2014. The 2016 

Mo Ibrahim report on the evaluation of global governance in Africa shows that Togo ranks 33rd 

out of 54 countries evaluated with a score of 48.5 out of 100. Notwithstanding the low overall 

ranking, Togo, with an average evolution of +9.7 points, was ranked the 2nd best governance 

reformer country during the 2006-2015 period; Transparency International's 2016 report ranks 

Togo 116th out of 176 with a Corruption Perception Index (CPI) of 32 compared to 29 in 2014 

on a scale of 0 (high corruption) to 100 (very low corruption). 

Socio-economic Context 

6. Despite a difficult external environment, economic growth was sustained over the 

2013-2016 period with an average rate of 5.2% thanks to the sound performance of the 

agricultural sector and infrastructure investments. This trend is expected to continue in 2017 

and 2018 due to the combined effects of fairly good rainfall and productivity gains from 

agricultural processing, and operation of the improved transport system. Inflation has also been 



III  

contained, falling from 1.8% in 2015 to 0.9% in 2016, and projected at 1.5% in 2017. However, 

due mainly to infrastructure investments in 2015 and 2016, total public debt increased 

considerably from 48.8% in 2010 to 80.8% of GDP by the end of 2016, above the Community 

norm of 70%. As a result of the increase in the above-mentioned infrastructure spending and 

the high cost of pre-financing commitments, the overall budget deficit (cash basis) widened to 

9.6% of GDP in 2016 against 7.8% of GDP in 2015. The deficit, projected at 9.7% in 2017, is 

expected to improve to, and stagnate at, 3.6% in 2018, according to IMF estimates.  

7. An analysis conducted in 2016 by the IMF and the World Bank shows that Togo 

presents a risk of over-indebtedness in respect of the overall debt stock. Togo's new programme 

(2017-2019) under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) with the IMF aims essentially to create 

favourable conditions for a substantial reduction of Togo's public debt, from 80.8% of GDP in 

2016 to 67.8% by 2020. In this regard, the Government has discontinued the practice of pre-

financing and has committed to implementing measures to build the institutional public debt 

management capacity. 

II. Prospects for 2017-2020 

8. As part of its National Development Programme (NDP), the Government is committed 

to vigorous action in growth-enhancing sectors, particularly the agricultural sector. It will pay 

particular attention to improving the governance and performance of social sectors in order to 

enable our country have a healthy and well-educated population fit for the labour market. The 

private sector’s contribution will be further fostered by improvements in the business climate 

to enhance its competitiveness for it to become the real driver of strong and inclusive economic 

growth. 

Governance and Agribusiness Promotion Support Programme (PAGPA) 

Overall Objectives  

9. The main objective of the PAGPA is to help create conditions conducive to strong, 

sustainable and inclusive growth. The programme has two components: (i) support to 

strengthen the mobilisation of domestic resources and optimal management of public 

investment: this component aims to strengthen domestic mobilisation and streamlining of 

public investment management, in particular in the agricultural sector; (ii) support for the 

promotion of agropoles and the strengthening of local governance: this component aims at 

implementing reforms geared towards setting up effective mechanisms and a business 

environment conducive to the development of agropoles. 

Reforms Supported by the Programme and Expected Outcomes 

10. Support for the promotion of agribusiness: the main reforms focus on: (i) the 

adoption by the Council of Ministers of the National Agropoles Development Strategy; (ii) 

operationalisation of the Agency for the Promotion of Investment and Free Trade Zones; (iii) 

development and adoption of the national industrial policy; (iv) preparation and adoption of the 

national private sector development strategy; (v) adoption of instruments for the establishment 

of the national standardization and quality control office; (vi) adoption of the land code and a 

rural land registry; and (viii) adoption of the national gender policy monitoring and evaluation 

mechanism. 

11. Support for domestic resource mobilisation and optimal public investment 

management: The main reforms aim at: (i) the adoption of the new National Customs Code; 

(ii) establishment and operationalisation of the tax policy unit and adoption of the draft 

simplified tax code; (iii) establishment of the tax registry in Lomé; (iv) adoption of the draft 

law on the devolvement of powers and resources to local and regional authorities; (v) adoption 

of the framework for monitoring the implementation of investment projects at the local level; 



IV  

(vi) adaptation of SIGFIP to the technical requirements of programme budgets; and (vii) 

adoption of the decree on the devolvement of financial control and powers, organisation and 

operation of financial control. 

12. The main expected outcomes of the PAGPA are: (i) improvement of the agricultural 

trade balance deficit, (ii) strengthening of Togo's resilience to fragility factors related to spatial 

and gender inequalities; (iii) improvement of the agricultural sector’s competitiveness; (iv) 

securing of land tenure for developed sites; (v) sustained revenue growth, (vi) improvement in 

the PIP implementation rate; (vii) improvement of local tax governance and (viii) building of 

the financial and technical capacity of local government bodies. 

Other Structural Government Reforms during the 2017-2020 Period:   

Governance, Transparency and Structural Reforms  

13. The Government is committed to further improving public finance management as part 

of economic and financial governance. In this regard, evaluations (PEFA, PEMFAR, PIMA and 

DeMPA) were carried out in 2016 and made it possible to update the public finance 

management action plan. This new action plan covers the 2017-2021 period. 

14. The Government is committed to continuing the fight against corruption and fraud as 

well as the establishment of a judicial and regulatory environment conducive to economic 

activity. To take into account WAEMU public financial management guidelines, and to attune 

control bodies to international standards, the instruments governing these bodies are being 

reviewed by a committee set up for this purpose. Similarly, the Government will continue to 

strengthen the national public procurement system; revision of the public procurement code to 

include the PPP management framework, among others, is ongoing and is expected to be 

finalized during the first quarter of 2018. 

15. In addition, the 2017 budget is being implemented with rigour, transparency and 

efficiency, and regarding the domestic debt clearance process, the Government will no longer 

accumulate domestic and external arrears or resort to exceptional procedures in the execution 

of public expenditure. This budget, like the previous one, gives priority to expenditure targeting 

the social sectors, particularly education, health, and basic socio-economic development in rural 

and semi-urban areas. Revenue generation and expenditure implementation reflect the 

implementation of reforms undertaken by the Government. The 2017 budget is based on the 

Integrated Public Finance Management System (SIGFIP), taking into account the economic and 

administrative aspects. Arrangements have been made to adapt and implement SIGFIP in all its 

functionalities and extend it to all ministries, institutions and regions in order to improve 

coordination and ensure the effectiveness of the programme budget by January 2019. The 2018 

draft budget will be adopted by the Council of Ministers and voted by the National Assembly 

within the constitutional deadline. 

Business Climate Reforms  

16. In order to improve the business environment needed to promote the private sector, 

Government action will be directed towards: (i) further simplifying business creation 

procedures and formalities; (ii) further simplifying cross-border trade procedures and 

formalities; (iii) implementing the SME/SMI Charter; (vi) conducting the inventory and 

mapping of SMEs/SMIs; (iv) strengthening the private sector promotion and support system; 

(ix) building the skills of economic operators in SMEs/SMIs; (x) providing support to 

strengthen the Togolese Court of Arbitration to enable it to play its role of resolving conflicts 

or disputes between economic operators; (xi) strengthening dialogue and public-private 

partnership; and (xii) facilitating access to finance and diversifying financial supply and 

products (Guarantee Fund, leasing, FNFI, etc.). 



V  

Agricultural Sector Reforms  

17. Various initiatives are being implemented by the Government to address the major 

challenges and consolidate the gains made towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal 

No. 2 (SDG) relating to the elimination of hunger and food security for all. These actions 

include the development of agricultural mechanization, restructuring of actors in the various 

sectors around buoyant value chains, definition of a quality label and the setting up of national 

safety nets. 

18. In addition to these actions, and in anticipation of the emergence of agro-industrial 

enterprises, alongside micro processing enterprises, the Government has undertaken various 

initiatives to encourage private investors in the agricultural sector, in particular by effecting 

reforms in the energy, financial, social, and water and sanitation sectors. 

The NDP Process  

19. The Accelerated Growth and Employment Promotion Strategy 2013-2017 is in its final 

year of implementation. The Government has engaged with all stakeholders in the process of 

developing the new national strategy (National Development Plan - NDP) for the period 2018 

to 2022. Based on the priorities identified through a countrywide participatory process, NDP 

2018-2022 will build on five pillars, namely: (i) the fight against poverty and for the 

improvement of social welfare; (ii) promotion of sustained and inclusive economic growth; (iii) 

strengthening of the potential of growth sectors; (iv) sustainable environmental management 

and reduction of spatial inequalities; and (v) consolidation of governance and peace. As part of 

implementation of this NDP, the Government undertakes to fully integrate the identified 

priorities into the budget, and domestically financed social expenditure, in particular for 

projects with a considerable impact on poverty reduction. 

Programme Monitoring and Evaluation  

20. The Ministry of the Economy and Finance is responsible for the overall 

implementation of the reforms supported by the Agribusiness Governance and Promotion 

Programme (PAGPA). The daily monitoring and evaluation of the programme is the 

responsibility of the Permanent Secretariat for the Follow-up of Reform Policies and Financial 

Programmes (SP-PRPF). This structure, which coordinates the implementation of the 

Government programme, will periodically organise a joint programme review with all 

stakeholder structures as well as members of civil society, including the Togolese Coordination 

of Farmers' Organisations and Agricultural Producers. The Government will submit quarterly 

reports to the AfDB on programme implementation progress, measured against agreed 

timetables and performance indicators. 

Request for Financing 

21. The growth prospects of the Togolese economy over the 2017-2018 period remain 

favourable, with real GDP growth rates projected to average 5.30%. For the year 2017, the 

macroeconomic framework projects a total revenue (excluding grants) of CFAF 567.5 billion 

against an expenditure of CFAF 968.1 billion (including arrears payments), or a financing 

requirement of CFAF 400.6 billion. The financing identified amounts to CFAF 323.3 billion, 

leaving a residual gap of CFAF 77.3 billion. 

The required ADF contribution to cover the 2017 financing needs stands at about CFAF 7.6 

billion (at the rate of UA1 = CFAF 799.76). 

 

Please accept, Mr. President, the assurances of my highest consideration.

Fragility factors identified at

partners (TFPs)  

Measures supported by AfDB

(2017-2018) 

Political, institutional and 

security factors  

 

 

 

1. Legitimate policies and political governance (legitimacy, inclusiveness,  strengthening of statehood and trust in State institutions 

Legitimacy: Togo has achieved significant progress which definitely sets it on the path to lasting resilience. 

Such achievements include enhanced security and stability, economic recovery with average growth rates of 

5% over a ten-year period, implementation of major institutional and economic reforms, stability, 

consolidated social cohesion and strengthening of regional cooperation. TFPs continue to commend the 

Togolese government for its efforts to rebuild infrastructure and boost the country's economy following the 

resumption of cooperation in 2006. These improvements notwithstanding, the reconstruction process in the 

aftermath of the political/democratic crisis is far from over. The North-South ethnic and regional divide 

continues to undermine political stability and underpin deep-seated discord among Togo’s political 

protagonists. Slowness in the democratic transition and weak institutions constitute the major challenges to 

political governance in Togo. This has heightened mutual distrust between the dominant coalitions and 

weakened ownership of sustainable, courteous, inclusive and constructive mechanisms for socio-political 

dialogue within the political class and among the elite. 

PAGPA proposes a series of 

reforms designed to improve 

economic governance and 

transparency of government 

actions. The implementation 

of these reforms should help 

to systematically address 

institutional credibility and

Governance:  Togo has undertaken a series of actions to improve its situation. Through this process 

coordinated by the Permanent Secretariat for Reforms, several instruments have been prepared, including 

a public procurement code, those on the operationalization of the Audit Court and the Finance General 

Inspectorate, and the establishment of a single window at the Treasury, as well as the reports on the budget 

review law. The Togolese administration’s capacities remain weak both at the central and local levels in 

terms of contracts management and award, as well as regarding the preparation, implementation and 

monitoring and evaluation of development programmes and projects, and the internalization of 

accountability principles. 

The reforms proposed under 

PAGPA seek enhanced 

political, economic and 

financial governance. 

Greater fiscal credibility, 

empowerment of audit and 

anti-corruption agencies, 

and enhanced local 

government capacity are 

expected when the 

programme ends. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Transparency:  Despite remarkable progress, perceptions of corruption remain high according to 

Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index (116
th
 among 176 countries in 2016 against 107

th
 

among 168 countries in 2015) and Togo’s corruption perception rating puts it below the global average (30 

against 43) of the most corrupt countries out of 168. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) are plagued by the 

non-existence of a formal consultative framework and are often misused to award contracts by direct 

negotiation. Other challenges include non-transparency in natural resources management and allocation. 

The lack of transparency and good governance in public procurement contract awards and unlawful use of 

private permits in large-scale land allocations for mining purposes are symptomatic of major unresolved 

resource governance issues and weaknesses. To remedy this situation, the government deemed fit to set up 

an institution with the necessary resources to combat corruption, hence an independent administrative 

institution, HATPLC, was established on 28 July 2015. Its members were appointed on 3 January 2017 and 

were officially sworn in on 7 February 2017. This body is tasked with promoting and strengthening 

corruption prevention as well as combating corruption and related offences in the administration, public 

institutions, private enterprises and non-governmental organizations. It enjoys administrative and financial

autonomy. It shall also protect whoever reports to the competent authorities, in good faith, all facts relating 

to established offences. Not being a State crackdown apparatus or court of law, it must forward substantiated 

complaints to the public prosecutor. 
 

2.        Security and violence issues, security sector capacity and performance 

Security: Despite the largely stable security situation in Togo, potentially destabilizing   incidents continue 

to occur sporadically, thus justifying a sustained social sector reform effort to address the diverse and now 

recurrent demands for better living conditions in the education and health sectors. Overall, security 

problems manifest through violent attacks on individuals and property as well as the criminalization of the 

economy, including the informal or even illicit exploitation of natural resources. 

While PAGPA does not 

directly contribute to the 

security issue, it however 

provides solutions that 

mitigate the risks likely to 

undermine the security 

situation. 

 

 

3. Justice sector (inclusive  access to justice, rule of law and  independence of the judiciary, checks and balances) 

A weakened judicial system: The successive crises arising from the democratic transition and the sanctions 

imposed for over a decade by Togo's leading technical and financial partners very negatively impacted the 

judicial system. Rendered dysfunctional by the various fragility factors, it has been exploited for political 

gain by the entire political class and is undermined by a lack of independence, corruption, and inadequate 

technical and material resources. Thus, in the aftermath of the crises, deep distrust remains between litigants 

and the justice system. Aware of this situation, regional leaders in each member country have embarked on 

justice sector reform. To date, significant progress has been achieved, albeit modest compared to the 

people’s expectations. In the light of this, Togo was called upon and pledged to accelerate the justice system 

modernization process, the adoption of the Penal Code and the Criminal Procedure Code, and the reform of 

the National Commission on Human Rights (CNDH). 

PAGPA while not directly 

contributing to the justice 

system, addresses the issue 

of inclusion, which is a 

source of social injustice by 

mainstreaming the 

vulnerable groups, notably 

women and youth, in the 

reforms to be carried out.

Togo has recorded encouraging macro-economic performances which have enabled its return to growth. 

However, it remains fragile and particularly sensitive to exogenous shocks and climatic hazards due to the 

structure of its economic fabric which in recent years has scarcely changed. Growth remains structurally 

constrained by low overall productivity and high production factor costs. Similarly, although labour force 

quality has improved thanks to better education, physical capital accumulation has stagnated since the 

1990s, contributing to a steady decline in total factor productivity since 1980. Togo must explore ways of 

turning its geographical position into an asset. The modernized port and airport as well as the presence of 

the ASKY airline hub constitute impactful infrastructures through which it can regain its past position. 

Various reforms proposed 

under PAGPA will 

contribute towards creating 

an environment conducive to 

Togo’s economic 

diversification in order to 

cushion the effects of 

exogenous shocks, through 

the Agropoles to be set up 

and professionalization of 

agriculture. 

 
Social factors: poverty and 

inequality  

 

5. Increased mobilization of resources to develop opportunities relating to employment, income and inclusive access to basic social services, focusing on 

the crucial role of the State, improved financial governance and an appropriate refocusing of the functions of the State 

 

Inequalities: Progress in human development varies across regions and prefectures and will fall short of the 

goals of Agenda 2030 for sustainable development. The education and health systems as well as the living 

standards of the Togolese people while slowly improving, face multiple setbacks, namely inequalities, which 

diminish the impact of growth on poverty reduction; the lack of genuine structural transformation, which 

limits economic opportunities; and stagnation in gender equality, which reflects on skills and business  

development. Beyond this, there are enormous challenges delivering human development to an ever-

growing, youthful and mobile employment-seeking population which the government must factor into the 

huge reform task it has embarked upon with the resumption of cooperation with various donors.  

 

The range of PAGPA-

supported reforms is aimed 

at preparing an environment 

conducive to the 

operationalization of 

Agropoles as a key element 

of the structural 

transformation of a rural 

social fabric that is affected 

more by inequalities. 

 

 

Revenue sources: The economy’s dependence on the phosphate sector as well as port and airport traffic is 

a fragility source. The largest share of GDP is generated by two prominent sectors: the port of Lomé and 

the exploitation of a huge phosphate deposit, which accounts for more than 40% of export earnings. The 

country is the world’s fifth largest phosphate producer. Many studies have revealed that "countries whose

economies depend on the export of a limited number of commodities are more prone to political fragility" 

and conflict. To avert this, the authorities plan to invest heavily in the structural transformation of the under-

productive agricultural sector by developing Agropoles and thus consolidating the agricultural sector’s 

GDP share and progressively curbing food import expenditure 

rationalized management of 

public investments required 

to boost local resources. 

 

Regulatory framework (State’s role in services provision): Togo has the advantage of having renovated its 

road networks connecting it to neighboring countries, and developed good quality urban roads in the capital 

city even if these have deteriorated due to the political/democracy crisis. The constraints on infrastructure 

development by the State to improve the quality of its services vary across activity sectors. Although progress 

is recorded in the international transport sector despite significant lingering regional disparities, the public 

utility sectors (water, waste, electricity and transport) are struggling to take off due to the lack of quick and 

efficient action, and also delayed financing. The unbalanced distribution of public utilities between regions 

and population strata is another fragility factor likely in the long term to heighten sociopolitical tensions if 

remedial measures are not taken to stamp out any social divide. 

The noted urban-rural 

service availability 

imbalance will be 

significantly mitigated by 

operationalizing the 

Agropoles for which the 

PAGPA proposes a number 

of reforms designed to 

facilitate the establishment 

of Agropoles, which will be 

comprehensively serviced 

agribusiness centres of 

excellence, conducive to the 

socioeconomic integration of 

communities.

ANNEX IV: Note on the relationship with IMF 

 
IMF Staff Team Completes Review Mission to Togo 

October 31, 2017 

End-of-Mission press releases include statements of IMF staff teams that convey 

preliminary findings after a visit to a country. The views expressed in this statement are 

those of the IMF staff and do not necessarily represent the views of the IMF’s Executive 

Board. Based on the preliminary findings of this mission, staff will prepare a report that, 

subject to management approval, will be presented to the IMF's Executive Board for 

discussion and decision. 

 Economic activity expanded at a moderate pace in the first half of 2017, accompanied by 

a low inflation. 

 Performance under the ECF-supported program has been good, with all quantitative 

performance criteria met and structural reforms continuing to be gradually implemented. 

 Lingering tensions could take a toll on the macroeconomic situation. 

An International Monetary Fund (IMF) team led by Ivohasina Razafimahefa visited Lomé 

during October 23-30, 2017 to conduct discussions on the first review of the program 

supported by an Extended Credit Facility (ECF) which was approved in May this year. 

At the conclusion of this visit, Mr. Razafimahefa issued the following statement: 

“Economic activity expanded at a moderate pace in the first half of 2017, accompanied 

by a low inflation. End-year economic growth is expected to be slightly below 5 percent. 

Headline year-on-year inflation rate through July was -2.5 percent, driven primarily by 

lower food prices; the core inflation rate, excluding food prices, was 0.6 percent. Fiscal 

consolidation has begun with the aim of reducing debt to a safer level. Expenditure has 

been curtailed significantly. The primary fiscal balance registered a surplus of 1.4 percent 

of GDP during January-June 2017. 

“Despite broadly positive medium-term outlook, supported by the expected boost in 

productivity from recent infrastructure upgrading and external concessional financing, 

Togo’s economy faces risks. In particular, lingering tensions could affect consumer and 

investor sentiment and, thus, take a toll on macroeconomic performance. 

“The authorities are making strong efforts to align the draft 2018 budget with the 

authorities’ economic reform agenda supported under the ECF arrangement. The 

authorities target further fiscal consolidation with a projected domestic primary fiscal 

deficit of 0.2 percent of GDP. This consolidation will be achieved through both an increase 

of revenue and a reduction of domestically financed investment. The mission encouraged 

the authorities to pursue their consolidation efforts to bring debt below the threshold of 

heightened risk of public sector debt. These efforts will help create fiscal space for 

additional social spending which are critical for poverty reduction. The mission also 

reiterated the need to further improve the business climate and encourage private 

investments. 

“The mission reached staff level agreement with the authorities on economic and financial 

policies that could support approval of the first review of their three-year program under 

the ECF. The country's economic program has remained broadly on track, with all 

quantitative performance criteria under the program met and structural reforms continuing 

to be gradually implemented. In particular, the non-orthodox financing of public 

investment—which had led to a rapid debt accumulation in recent years—was halted. The 

first review under the ECF is tentatively scheduled to be considered by the IMF Executive 

Board in December 2017. 

“The mission met with President Faure Gnassingbé, and held discussions with Minister 

Sani Yaya (Minister of Economy and Finance), Kossi Assimaidou (Minister of

authorities for their hospitality and all interlocutors for the collaborative discussions. ”
