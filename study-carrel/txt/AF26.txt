Project Summary  

1 Project Overview  

1.1 The Malawi Agricultural Infrastructure and Youth in Agribusiness Project (AIYAP) is to 

deploy irrigation infrastructure as an enabler and facilitator to address the twin problems of food 

insecurity and high rate of youth unemployment within the context of 2011-2016 Malawi Growth and 

Development Strategy (MGDS) which identifies agriculture and food security, irrigation and green belt 

initiatives as drivers of economic growth. Malawi’s agriculture sector is highly vulnerable to the adverse 

impacts of climate change and extreme weather events, such as dry spells, droughts and floods. The 

sector is also characterized by low level of irrigation development, and low uptake of improved farm 

inputs. In addition, low profitability of smallholder agriculture is influenced by weak links to profitable 

markets which make value addition seemingly impossible because of lack of information between the 

farmers and the processors, high transport costs, weak farmer organizations, poor quality control, lack 

of market information, as well as limited participation of the youth in agricultural development and 

businesses. The proposed project, will develop two large scale irrigation schemes at Linga (Nkhata-

Bay) and Dwambazi (Nkhotakota) covering 1945 hectares, targeting 10,000 beneficiaries with special 

focus on the youth (about 50%). The project is to use irrigation infrastructure as an enabler to scale up 

the production of maize, rice, sugar and horticulture production and value chain in project areas in 

particular and Malawi in general.  

 

1.2 The project apart from mitigating the challenges arising from dependency on rain-fed production 

will also promote youth ownership of agribusiness, access to funding/credit through seed funds, loan 

facilities and risk sharing from Micro Finance Institutions, agro -processing, engaging in value addition, 

modern methods of crop diversification and market linkages. Socially, the project by introducing youth 

skill acquisition, entrepreneurship development and job creation will address social vices such abuse, 

prostitution, violent crime etc. In addition, the project will also reduce rural and urban migration as well 

as cross border migration of youth in the targeted areas. It is estimated that within four and half years 

the project will produce 500 Agripreneurs, train about 100 artisans for the maintenance of irrigation 

infrastructure, launching 175 new agribusinesses and employing about 4600 additional persons, 

including out-growers. It is expected that at least 50% of the beneficiaries will be female.  

 

1.3 The project has four components namely (i.) Irrigation Infrastructure & Watershed Management, 

(ii.) Youth Entrepreneurship, market linkages, agro-processing and Value Addition (iii.) Agro-

Cooperative Development and Enhancement and (iv) Project Management and Institutions 

Strengthening.  

2 Needs Assessment:  

The need for the Project is justified by the priorities in the Malawi Growth and Development Strategies 

II (MGDS II: 2011-2016) which emphasizes on agriculture, food security, irrigation and water 

development.  As a consequence, there is an urgent need for transformation of the agriculture sector to 

enhance sustainable growth and break the cycle of food insecurity as espoused in the National Export 

Strategy, 2015 Irrigation Master Plan and Investment Framework and the draft National Irrigation 

Policy, Green Belt Initiative and the National Agriculture Policy focusing on commercialization of 

agriculture.    In addition, the 2013-2018 Malawi National Export Strategy, identifies agriculture value 

chains driven by private operators including smallholder farmers, youth entrepreneurs, women’s 

groups, MSMEs and large businesses to boost and diversify exports in order to improve Malawi’s 

growth prospects as the bedrock of the economy. The Project is a direct response to GoM’s desire to 

enhance agricultural productivity by promoting irrigated agriculture and dynamize the sector through 

active youth participation in agribusiness for job creation in order to meet the objectives of these 

policies.

3 Cost and Financing   

The project total cost of AIYAP is estimated at $US27.50 million (UA19.36million), to be financed by 

the Bank UA16 million ADF loan, EU €2 million grant (parallel financing) about  UA 1.6 million and 

Government contribution in kind estimated at UA1.7 million.   

4 Implementation  

The project will have a PIU which staff will be externally recruited through a competitive process and 

serve on full time basis. The project will recruit competitively a Technical Adviser (TA)   at the 

commencement of implementation ENABLE YOUTH sub-component of the project. The TA will work 

with the Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources (LUANAR) for one year after which 

LUANAR will take over the full implementation of the component. The PIU will be reporting to the 

Principal Secretary for the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Water Development. There will be a 

Technical Committee comprising Directors of relevant Departments to assist with the implementation. 

The composition of the Committee will be determined by the Government. The Technical Committee 

will report to the Project Steering Committee chaired by PS MoAIWD which will approve the work 

plans and budgets and guide the project on policy matters.  

5 Bank’s Added Value  

The Bank’s intervention in this project will add significant value to the investments already made in 

agriculture and irrigation projects by the Government of Malawi, the Bank and other development 

partners. It will give impetus and acts as boost to the efforts/programmes of the GoM in youth 

development through entrepreneurship in agriculture value chains and agribusiness. The project is in 

line with the TYS 2013-2022 which focusses on inclusive growth and transitioning to green growth. 

The project focus on youth unemployment through skills development and entrepreneurship in is line 

with the TYS. Finally, the Bank’s intervention has the multiplier effect on economic development 

through infrastructure development and private sector development in line with the Malawi Country 

Strategy 2013-2017 and is aligned to three of the five pillars of Bank’s ‘High 5’ i.e. Feed Africa, 

Industrialise Africa, and Improved livelihood. 

6 Knowledge Management  

The knowledge gained through the implementation of several projects and studies in the sector in 

Malawi has been duly applied in designing this project. In the same pattern, the knowledge that will be 

generated by this Project will contribute significantly to the design and implementation of agricultural 

interventions within the Agriculture Sector Wide Approach (ASWAp) arrangement and build the 

capacity of the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Water Development (MAIWD) and other 

Ministries particularly the Ministries of Labour, Youth and Manpower Development, and Trade and 

Industries. Consequently, useful information will be generated for similar future interventions. AIYAP 

will, in addition to irrigation development, focus on agro-processing and value addition, agriculture 

cooperative development and agribusiness along agriculture value chains as well as building of 

entrepreneurship skills and generations of bankable projects in agriculture value chains which will 

provide lessons in the post-harvest management, processing and marketing of various crops to inform 

project designs of similar projects in the future. The Bank is a key member of the Donor Committee on 

Agriculture and Food Security (DCAFS) and the lessons learnt from this project will be shared with 

other Development Partners through DCAFS platform. ASWAp, through the Bank, will provide 

information generated from AIYAP to key stakeholders for knowledge sharing and coalition building 

through the agriculture sector working group. The results from the various studies and surveys, 

including the socio-economic impact study will inform the stakeholders on how to put the acquired 

knowledge attributes into practical use for better results-oriented achievements and sustained benefit 

flows.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE MANAGEMENT OF THE AFDB GROUP TO THE BOARD OF 

DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF MALAWI FOR AGRICULTURAL 

INFRASTRUCTURE AND YOUTH IN AGRIBUSINESS PROJECT (AIYAP) 
 

Management submits the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed ADF loan of UA16 

million to finance the Malawi Agricultural Infrastructure and Youth in Agribusiness Project.  

 

I STRATEGIC THRUST & RATIONALE 

 

1.1 Project linkages with country strategy and objectives 
 

1.1.1 The Malawi Growth and Development Strategy II. 2011-2016 has identified agriculture, 

irrigation and water development as some of the key priorities and drivers of economic growth and 

poverty alleviation. The Government formulated Agriculture Sector-Wide Approach (ASWAp 2011-

15) as the priority investment plan for the agriculture sector which focusses on (i) food security and risk 

management (ii) commercial agriculture, agro-processing and market development and (iii) sustainable 

land and water management and support services. The Government is implementing a Farm Inputs 

Subsidy Program (FISP) to address the food security problem and developed a National Export Strategy 

to promote crop diversification, value addition and export of agro-based commodities. The National 

Irrigation Policy which is currently at the draft level is aimed at enhancing farmers’ ownership through 

farmer managed irrigation and National Agriculture Policy, whose main objective is to commercialize 

the agriculture sector. In ASWAp, the Government also introduced a Green Belt Initiative (GBI) in 

order to promote irrigation and minimize reliance on rain-fed farming and achieve increased agricultural 

productivity for domestic and international markets. The Government is currently finalising a five year 

National Resilience Plan to break the cycle of food insecurity with irrigation as a key component. 

Regarding youth initiatives, the Government adopted the National Youth Policy in 2013 which 

recognises that the youth represent a vast human resource potential for promoting economic growth and 

if neglected it would be a lost opportunity.   AIYAP will address the twin problems of food insecurity 

and high rate of youth unemployment using irrigation infrastructure as an enabler, which will 

substantially contribute to the achievement of the objectives of these policies and strategies.  

 

1.1.2 The project is aligned with the Bank’s 2013-17 Country Strategy Papers (CSP) Pillars focusing 

on (i) addressing infrastructure bottlenecks to competitiveness and growth and (ii) supporting actions to 

expand private sector investments. While the former covers irrigation infrastructure development and 

agricultural market infrastructures the latter Pillar covers private sector investment and entrepreneurship 

in agro-processing, crop diversification and value chain development which are articulated in AIYAP. 

The country socio-economic indicators are presented in Appendix 2 and it is envisaged that AIYAP will 

contribute to improving these indicators and ultimately achievement of the Sustainable Development 

Goals (SDGs).  

 

1.1.3 Currently, only 26 percent (104,000 hectares) of the potential irrigable area (408,000 hectares) is 

under irrigation. In order to exploit this potential, Government has developed the National Irrigation 

Master Plan and Investment Framework (NIMPIF). The NIMPIF which was published in February 2015 

confirmed that the plan will be implemented in three phases: Phase I (2015-2020), phase II (2021-2025) 

and Phase III (2026-2035) comprising of approximately 20,000 hectares, 28,500 hectares and 67,500 

hectares of new irrigation schemes in Phases I, II and III respectively. The project is part of the Bank’s 

efforts to support the government of Malawi in the implementation of the Irrigation Master Plan given 

that the targeted sites are among the priority sites identified in the Master Plan which objectives are to: 

(1) accelerate economic growth, (2) reduce rural poverty, (3) improve food security, and (4) increase 

exports.

1.2 Rationale for Bank’s involvement  

1.2.1 The Bank’s Ten Year Strategy (TYS) 2013-2022, identify agriculture related infrastructure 

development as a key enabler for increased production, productivity and effective utilization of land 

resources. It also identifies agriculture and food security as an area of special emphasis. The 2016 

Bank’s Agriculture strategy: Feed Africa: Strategy For Agricultural Transformation in Africa 2016-

2025 is targeted at executing the Comprehensive African Agriculture Development Programme 

(CAADP) goals of contributing to elimination of extreme hunger, malnutrition, poverty, and increased 

prosperity, in partnership with alliances including farmers, agribusiness, and civil society, and 

exploiting regional comparative advantages and opportunities for trade and collaboration. The Bank’s 

Gender Strategy 2014-2018 calls for economic empowerment, knowledge and capacity building for 

women.  Furthermore, the Bank’s Fragility strategy “Addressing Fragility and Building Resilience in 

Africa, 2014 – 2019” which aims at effectively assisting countries build resilience to move forward 

towards more stable political and economic development with Youth employment as a special focus, as 

jobs are alternatives to rents or participation in illicit activities associated with fragile situations and 

thus help prevent the outbreak of violence related to critical unemployment.  

 

1.2.2 This project addresses all of the above key Bank strategies and policies as part of broader 

development efforts to achieve sustainable growth and poverty reduction thus, (1)  streamlining of the 

crops along value chains (economic crops) and crops to address food security as well as linking the agri-

prenuers to the value chains, ensuring that sustainable incomes will be achieved for the beneficiaries in 

particular and the country at large, (2)  focusing on youth with special emphasis on targeting women (at 

least 50% of beneficiaries) social and economic empowerment, while protecting the environment 

through various catchment activities, and (3) addressing the objectives of inclusive growth and 

transition to green growth by addressing infrastructure development, private sector development, and 

skills and technology adoption through promotion of irrigation for agriculture intensification and 

diversification.  

 

1.2.3 The project also resonates with three of the five pillars of Bank’s ‘High 5’ by addressing Feed 

Africa, Industrialize Africa, and Improved quality of life for the people of Africa.  At country level, the 

project is aimed at contributing to increase in agricultural exports, import substitution, generation of the 

much needed foreign exchange and job creation especially for the youth.    

 

1.3 Donor coordination 

 
1.3.1 Malawi’s recent progress towards the aid effectiveness agenda under Busan is mixed.  Whilst 

donor alignment with national policies remains strong, the use of the national country system and aid 

on the budget has significantly reduced following suspension of budget support in 2013. 1  Development 

Partners (DPs) are instead channelling the resources earmarked for budget support or basket funding 

through other aid modalities and off budget.2  The GOM is working with DPs to improve aid 

effectiveness guided by the new Development Cooperation Strategy launched late 2014. Successful 

outcome of   on-going PFM reforms will be indispensable in encouraging DPs to increase the use of 

country systems.   The current platform is on the Donor Committee on Agriculture and Food Security 

(DCAFS) as the key form for donor coordination, monitoring of sectoral plans and strategies and 

harmonizing interventions. The Bank is currently chairing the Irrigation Technical Sub-Group.   With 

the provision of Euro 2.00 million EU funding for catchment management in the project, the Bank is 

leveraging on collaboration with other Development Partners in Malawi.   

 

                                                 
1 According to the 2014 Global Partnership Monitoring Surrey, Malawi’s score on the aid on budget aid indicator declined 

from 62 in 2010 to 49 whilst that of use of national country system dropped from 65 to 50. 
2  51 % of planned externally financed development expenditure for FY 2014/15 is off budget.

II PROJECT DESCRIPTION 

Project Objectives: The specific objective of the project is to alleviate poverty in the project area in 

particular and the country in general by contributing  to economic growth and food security through: 

(1) Deploying irrigation infrastructure to scale up improved crop production and productivity leading 

to improve net farm incomes of the project beneficiaries, (2) expansion of opportunities in agriculture 

and agribusiness among the  rural youth in Malawi as a means to advance and improve rural livelihoods 

and economic development, (3) enhancement of import substitution through improved value additions 

and processing, (4) introduction of revolving loan for agriculture purposes will grow and build the 

cluster youth entrepreneurs in agribusiness and value chains, and (5) Using cooperative societies as a 

vehicle to transit the smallholders farmers to commercial farmers.  

2.1 Project Components: AIYAP has four main components mainly; (1) Irrigation Infrastructure 

(Dwambazi 945 hectares and Linga 1000 hectares irrigation schemes) and Watershed Management, (2)

2.2 Technical Solution retained and alternatives explore  

Table 2.2: project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection or acceptance 

Alternative  Brief description Reasons for rejection/Acceptance 

Alternative 1 

 

Invest in gravity fed irrigation 

system (technical solution 

retained) 

Gravity fed irrigation system have proved to be 

more sustainable in terms of operation and 

maintenance with locally available material, 

requiring minimal training which translates to 

sustainability and profitability of the enterprise. 

Alternative 2 Invest in rain water 

harvesting infrastructure such 

as small water holding 

structures scattered all over 

the selected districts for 

agriculture, livestock and 

domestic use 

Rain water harvesting structures cannot sustain 

the impacts of climate change and their socio-

economic impact will be spread out thinly. In 

addition, it cannot provide food and cash crops 

two to three times a year.  

Alternative 3 Invest in pumped irrigation 

development by lifting water 

mechanically to higher 

ground for crop production 

Pumped irrigation schemes were dropped on 

account of the complex nature of their operation 

and maintenance, costs are high and the capacity 

to maintain at small farm level does not exist. 

Further it contributes to carbon emission.  

Alternative 4 Introduce spate irrigation 

system  

Not sustainable due to variability of rainfall; 

non-efficiency and drudgery. 

 

2.3 Project type 

 
AIYAP is designed in the form of a stand-alone Investment Project with the main aim of supporting 

irrigation infrastructure development (civil works) as an enabler of scaling up of high value crop 

production, value chain development, youth skill development in Agribusiness and capacity building 

activities largely funded by ADF 13 Loan and EU Grant resources. 

2.4 Project Cost and Financing Arrangements 

 
2.4.1 The total project cost, including physical and price contingencies, is UA 19.36 million which 
will be financed by: (i) ADF loan (UA 16.00 million covering cost of infrastructure, purchase of 

vehicles, youth training and provision of seed capital, etc. ), EU Grant (UA 1.60 million to finance 

catchment management) and (iii) the GoM and Beneficiaries (UA 1.76 million), through provision of 

office space and salaries for the counterpart staff on the project on the part of Government and provision 

of labour for maintenance of the irrigation infrastructures on the part of beneficiaries. The resources 

from EU will be made available to the project through parallel financing, since the Department of 

Irrigation will be responsible for the management of the resources using the EU procedures.  

2.4.2  The ADF Loan will be used to finance both local costs and foreign costs. The project will 
finance local costs such as training, personnel and operating costs while most of the activities under 

infrastructure development will attract foreign costs as detailed in the summary tables below. The GoM 

does not have the capacity to finance most of the project activities and has therefore committed to 

contribute to the project in kind through staff and office space. The details are indicated in Tables 2.3, 

2.4, 2.5 and 2.6 below.

2.5. Project’s target area and population: 

2.5.1 Demographic Aspects: According to 2016 data from the Department of Statistics, Malawi has 

an estimated population of nearly 17 million people with women constituting about 51% of the 

population3. The population is characterised as follows: (i) 0 – 10 years (33%); (ii) 10 – 20 years (22%); 

(iii) 20 – 40 years (29%); (iv) 40 – 60 years (10%) and (v) those above 60 years comprise (6%).  The 

districts of Nkhotakota and Nkhata Bay have populations of 229,460 and 164,761 respectively with 

combine total land mass of 8330km² representing 9% of country total land mass of 94,080km² 

(excluding Lake Malawi which covers an area of 24,404km²). The targeted beneficiaries are 10,000 

households estimated at 6 person per household. In the two districts only 1 in 30 women and 1 in 10 

men complete secondary education. However, 1 out of 7 women and 1 out of 9 men are unemployed.  

2.5.2 Location: The project is located mostly in the Green Belt Zone covering a total of 2 Districts of 

Nkhota-kota (Dwambazi) and Nkhata-Bay (Linga) Districts in the Central Region. These Districts were 

selected because they were ranked among the Phase 1 projects in the Malawi National Irrigation Master 

Plan. 

2.5.3 Climate: The climate in Malawi ranges from semi-arid in the Lower Shire Valley, semi-arid to 

sub-humid on the plateaux and sub-humid in the highland areas in the northern parts of the country. 

Average rainfall ranges from 763 mm to 1,143 mm per annum (p.a.) with only a few areas receiving 

over 1500 mm of rain annually. Such areas include Mulanje, Nkhata Bay and the northern end of Lake 

Malawi. Rainfall (almost 90%) occurs between the months of December and March, with no rain at all 

between May to October over most of the country. Mean annual temperatures vary with altitude, ranging 

from 25o C in the Lower Shire Valley to 13o C in the highland areas. 

 

2.5.4 The project area like other parts of Malawi is largely a semi-arid country hence greatly 

threatened by droughts and other negative impacts of climate change. The semi-arid nature of the 

country makes it highly fragile and susceptible to environmental degradation hence sustainable 

management of natural resources is not an option but a priority. The area is also prone to flooding which 

has been accelerated by extensive deforestation and tree cutting in most parts of the country which was 

highly experienced in the 1970s and the 1980s during which time annual deforestation rate was 

estimated at 3.5% per annum. Deforestation was and is still caused by (i) expansion for agriculture; (ii) 

demand for fuelwood for both domestic and other uses including industrial production. Soil erosion 

constitutes one of the major types of land degradation in Nkhotakota and Nkhata-Bay area of Malawi. 

 

 

 

 

                                                 
3 Malawi is largely rural. Despite rapid urbanization, nearly 85 percent of the total population of Malawi lives in rural areas.

2.5.5 Water Resources: Water for the irrigation schemes is supplied from Dwambazi and Mazembe 

rivers. Dwambazi is a perennial river with a minimum monthly flow of 3,305 l/s indicating that the 

water available is more than sufficient for the development of Dwambazi irrigation scheme. Mazembe 

River with a minimum monthly flow of 224 l /s demonstrates the need for a water harvesting structure 

to harness the water required to irrigate the Linga scheme. 

2.6 Participatory process for project identification, design and implementation  

2.6.1 The ESIA:  

2.6.1.1 During the project preparation, extensive public consultations were carried out to determine the 

environmental and social impacts of the project. The consultations were also aimed at identifying the 

key environmental challenges experienced in the project locations as well as project districts. Meetings 

were held with various departmental heads at the Ministry of Agricultural, Irrigation and Water 

Development, Ministry of Trade, Ministry of Gender and Ministry of Labour and Youth Development 

at the ministries’ Headquarters in Lilongwe. Consultative meetings were also held with various heads 

of department at Nkhotakota and Nkhata Bay District Headquarters including with the District 

Commissioner of Nkhata Bay District. Further meetings were held with Dwangwa Cane Growers Trust, 

Dwangwa Cane Growers Company Ltd and Senior Officers of Illovo Sugar Company Ltd. Other 

consultative meetings were held with various community leaders led by Senior Chiefs and their deputies 

together with community members, members and executives of Farmers Associations in Linga (Nkhata 

Bay District) and in Dwambazi (in Nkhotakota District). 

2.6.1.2 The reasons for consultative meetings were: (i) to generate a good understanding of the project 

by all stakeholders within the project area; (ii) to enhance ownership of the project by local leadership, 

the community and local farmers; (iii) to understand people’s and agency expectations about the project; 

(iv) to understand and characterise potential environmental, social and economic impacts of the project; 

(v) to acquire, but also advance local benefits that may accrue from the project; and (vi) to enable 

stakeholders involved in the project to provide views, hence participating in or refining project designs. 

In addition, site-specific investigations were also conducted to gain insight to the likely environmental, 

social, and economic impacts of the project. 

2.6.2 Community Participatory Processes: The community participatory processes were organised 

by the officers from the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Water Development as well as the project 

team during the preparation and appraisal mission. Two town hall meetings at each project location 

were held where a range of issues including among others, project details, land issues, community 

development, choice of cropping, farmers associations –development, formations and operations, etc. 

were discussed and agreed upon. The team, also visited the projects sites and the existing farms on the 

land with a view for getting the understanding of the farmers, listen to their concerns – especially land 

distributions and beneficiaries of youth entrepreneurship, how to address them and incorporate them 

into the project design. Over half of the target population is youth and women who are already active in 

the agriculture sector. Most of the youth also own land that has been inherited or allocated by the 

traditional leaders in line with the customary land acquisition. Consultations also involved all relevant 

sector departments at the district and headquarter levels. The key players included the local 

administration structures spearheaded by the local chiefs headed by two Traditional Authorities, one of 

which is a woman and their assistants and included a significant proportion of the community members 

of which youth and women constituted more than 50%. The Mission met and held discussions with 

major private sector players among which are;  Crown Ministries, Illovo Sugar Company, Farmers 

Engineering Services, Public Private Partnership Commission in Blantyre, the Malawi Chamber of 

Commerce, Industry and Cooperative and Telekom Networks Malawi Limited (TNM) – a mobile 

company quoted on Malawi Stock Exchange. The project team held sessions with Civil Society 

Organisations, and Non-governmental Organisations as well as youth entrepreneurship training 

institutions in Malawi

2.7 Bank Group experience, lessons reflected in project design  

2.7.1 Experiences, challenges and lessons learnt in the implementation from the Bank’s past and 

current agricultural projects in Malawi have been taken into account in the design of the current project. 

These include the need for proper project orientation, emphasis on farmer group approach, strong M&E 

and capacity building for staff which AIYAP has incorporated by including project launching, regular 

training for implementing staff, emphasis on Cooperatives and Water Users Associations and support 

to M&E. To avoid future land disputes as noted from some of the projects due to inadequate 

consultations, adequate consultations were held with the beneficiaries and other relevant stakeholders 

during preparation and the Bank has received a letter of comfort from the Government confirming the 

support of the locals for the project. In addition, beneficiary farmers registered their names to confirm 

that their pieces of land will be made available for the project activities. Non availability of full studies 

and designs have always led to delays in disbursements and project implementation. To address this 

problems, AIYAP locations were selected based on readiness of the designs, drawings and feasibility 

studies already prepared under the National Irrigation Master Plan. In addition, the sites were also 

selected on the least cost based among the sites which are ready for development. The need for a full 

time Project Coordination Unit was noted from almost all the previous projects, therefore, provision has 

been made for the recruitment of technical experts to support the Project Coordination Team under 

ASWAp Secretariat to fully focus on the planned activities.   

2.7.2 Through the project team interaction with the DP and government officials it was noted that 

youth skill development program were bedevilled by; (1) Lack of transparency in the process of trainees 

selection, (2) In adequate or non-availability of financial support to raise start-up capital, and 

(3)Inadequate post training technical support, and (4) Uncoordinated monitoring processes. All these 

are taken into consideration in the design of AIYAP as a result, the selection processes of the trainees, 

the training as well as provision of seed capital will the carried out by an independent 

consultants/Financial Institutions. In addition the project has already confirmed with organised private 

sector – Ilovo, PressCane, etc. which have agreed to take the trainees as interns. 

2.7.3 The issues of sustainability of the irrigation facilities after project completion in Malawi have 

been highlighted in all the reports. Irrigation is capital intensive and demanding in terms of technical 

capacity. Some of the old irrigation schemes in Malawi have had to be rehabilitated.  By introducing 

value chains and agripreneur it is expected that the farmers will transit to commercial farmers who will 

be able to pay for the maintenance of infrastructure.  The project has built in resilience of the facilities 

to the effect of climate change by addressing the issues of catchment management which will be 

specifically addressed with Euros 2million mobilised from EU.   Furthermore, to enhance sustainability 

of other physical infrastructure, the facilities and resources to be provided for the youth after graduations 

will be on revolving loan basis.  To address the issue of week technical capacity to maintain the 

irrigation infrastructure, resources have been allocated to the training of technicians and artisans for 

maintenance of the infrastructure. More importantly, the project is designed to  enhance ownership of 

the infrastructures by the farmers through Farmers Associations, improving capacities for O&M, and 

importantly, using climate-smart designs (flood regulation, sediment control etc.) which objective is to 

prolong the lifespan of the infrastructures.  

2.7.4 Lessons from the Revised 2015 Country Portfolio Improvement Plan (CPIP) also highlighted 

the: (i) Weak Capacity in Financial Management , (ii)Weak Capacity of Project Implementation Units 

which are precipitated by the staffing configuration and modalities of assigning staff to project 

coordinating units,  (iii) Project Start-Up Delays, and (iv) Weak Procurement Capacity. In order to 

address these challenges, the project has embedded (i) the need to ensure adequate stakeholders 

consultations during project design to ensure ownership and compliance during implementations phase; 

(ii) Project designs and detailed feasibility studies are already in place;(iii) training on the Bank’s rules 

and procedures for consultants and contractors engaged in Bank’s funded projects will be carried out as 

part of the project launch and on regular basis thereafter (iv) baseline and annual targets data are 

established within the first year of a project where this is not available (v) reporting would be based on 

results framework including gender disaggregated data , (vi) supervision missions’ checklist to include 



 

10 

environmental and social management activities and projects’ quarterly reports and (vii) frontloading 

of procurement activities by adopting advance contracting which have been agreed with government.. 

While addressing catchment vulnerability through the catchment management program is valid, this 

doesn’t necessarily confront the challenge of weak technical capacities nor sustainability challenge of 

the irrigation infrastructure alluded to in this  

2.8. Key performance indicators  

2.8.1 The Project Results-Based Logical Framework contains key impact and outcome indicators for 

the monitoring of the performance of the Project. The main outcomes are expected are: (i) Increased 

crop production and productivity; (ii) Increase in number of youth engaging in farming and 

Agribusiness and (iii).Increase in Household Income. Progress towards achieving these outcomes will 

be monitored through the sector monitoring and evaluation system.  

2.8.2 The Project Implementation Unit will prepare quarterly and annual project progress reports 

presenting the progress on output indicators disaggregated by gender where appropriate. Outcome 

indicators will be monitored through PIU’s management system and national statistics. Indicators will 

be updated in the Implementation Progress Report (IPR) and necessary adjustments will be made as 

appropriate. A medium term report (MTR) and Project Completion Report (PCR) will be prepared. All 

of these reports are circulated widely within the Government, the Bank and to other development 

partners.   

 

III PROJECT FEASIBILITY 

3.1 Economic and financial performance. 

3.1.1. Financial Analysis: At full operation, each farmer household will be making an income of MK 
1,575,119.74 (US$2300) per year from the current average income of MK 791,349.11      (US$1150). 

The analysis at the project level has been carried out by comparing with and without project costs, on 

farm crop establishment and operational cost with the benefits. The analysis also covered the benefits 

and costs of processing some proportions of selected crops such as maize, rice, cassava and selected 

horticultural crops such as tomatoes, onions and bananas.  The discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis 

carried out on the net cash-flow gave a Financial Internal Rate of Return (FIRR) of 23%, and a Financial 

Net Present Value (NPV) of USD 3.8 million at an opportunity costs of 18%. The opportunity cost of 

18% takes into account the prevailing high interest rates on commercial loans in the country ranging 

between 42% and 47% with inflation rate of 23% and the bank interest rates on concessional loans. The 

high financial rates of returns are attributed to the benefits accruing to the project from the value chain 

development of three major crops namely rice, maize and sugarcane and other horticultural crops such 

as tomatoes, onion, bananas and chillies. In addition, there are other benefits such as employment 

generation along the value chains, spin off effects of the investments to boost local economy and other 

environmental benefits further justifies the project.  

3.1.2. Economic Analysis: The DCF analysis carried out on the net cash-flow gave an Economic 
Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) of 26% and the economic Net Present Value is estimated at USD 7.2 

million at an opportunity cost of 12%. The economic values for the goods and services were arrived at 

using a standard conversion factor of 1.1for traded goods and services while the non-traded items were 

estimated using the market prices which were good estimates of the economic values under the 

liberalized market system in the country. The results show high economic internal rates of return due to 

the focus of the project on modernisation and commercialisation of farming in the project areas for the 

selected crops which include horticulture crops. The project will also attract the participation of more 

small medium scale enterprises mostly owned by the youth in the project. The project intervention will 

also enhance productivity through capacity building of the key stakeholders in the project. Sensitivity 

analysis on the effect of increasing investments costs by 10% and reducing crop prices by the same 

margin resulted into decrease of EIRR to 25 and 24 % respectively which means EIRR is more sensitive 

to crop produce price variation. See table 3.2 for details.

3.2 Environmental and Social impacts  

3.2.1 Environment: 

3.2.1.1 In accordance with the Bank’s Integrated Safeguards Systems (ISS), the project has been 

validated as category 2 by ORQR. This implies that the anticipated negative impacts are minimal and 

can be readily managed in line with measures elaborated in the Environmental and Social Management 

Plan. The project will have both positive and negative environmental and social impacts. Positive 

impacts will include among others: (i) improved environmental and ecological conditions; (ii) increased 

agricultural activities and enhanced agricultural production and outputs; (iii) improved food security 

and nutrition; (iv) enhanced value of agricultural produce through value addition; (v) improved social 

and economic well-being of the beneficiaries through improved economic activities; (vi) enhanced 

agricultural production capacities and skills; (vii) enhanced entrepreneurial and agro-processing skills; 

(viii) improved better quality water flow downstream; (ix) increased employment opportunities; (x) 

improved infrastructure in designated project areas; (x) capacity building including institutional 

strengthening, environment and natural resources management. Negative impacts will include: (i) 

vegetation, habitat and biodiversity loss during the development and construction phase of the project; 

(ii)  generation of solid wastes as a result of excavations during construction works; (iii) compaction of 

soils and destabilization of the geological balance; (iv) chances of threats of increased incidences of 

water-borne diseases and accidental deaths at the water conservation reservoirs; (v) dust, air quality and 

noise pollution; (vi) threats of occupational health and safety; (vii) soil, rivers and wetlands pollution 

from chemical fertilizers and other agricultural chemicals during the operational phase of the project; 

(viii) threats of transmissions of HIV/AIDs and other communicable diseases. The project ESMP for 

the two sites have been developed and posted on the Bank’s website on 9 August 2016.  

 

3.2.1.2 Though the environmental and social assessments of the project based on the African 

Development Bank’s Integrated Safeguards System (ISS) and the Environmental and Social Assessment 

Procedures, validated the project as Category 2, however according to Schedule A of the Malawi’s 

Environmental Impacts Assessment Guidelines of 1997, development of agricultural land of more than 

10 hectares requires implementation of a full EIA, thus qualifying such projects under Category 1 

Projects. However, this is annulled by Schedule B 2.1 and Schedule D (D.1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, 

D8.1, D8.2, D8.5, D8.6, D8.8 and D10, of the Guidelines because the proposed project has limited and 

reversible negative environmental and social impacts. 

3.2.2. Climate Change: The Project is classified Category 2 by the Bank’s Climate Change Screening 

System. The design review includes climate change risks and proposal of adaptation measures. Risk 

management and adaptation options are integrated through promotion of gravity irrigation water flows. 

Catchment management programme has been incorporated as part of the climate change resilience 

programme. The proposed project interventions are imbedded with adaptation measures in the irrigation 



 

12 

and land and water management sub-sectors to secure and improve agricultural productivity against 

climate change impacts through enhancement of water supply and basin-wide management. Irrigation 

schemes will help address the challenges due to low rainfall while irrigation systems have been designed 

to control the flooding menace in the target areas. These measures are consistent with Malawi’s National 

Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPAs) and these include: (i) improved early warning systems (ii) 

use of improved crop varieties and livestock breeds, (iii) improved crop and livestock management 

practices, and diversification of agricultural activities within single farm units, e.g. introduction of agro-

forestry systems 

3.2.3. Gender Analysis: Malawi has a high gender disparity between men and women. The 2014 
female Human Development Index value for Malawi is 0.423 in contrast with 0.467 for males, resulting 

in a GDI value of 0.9074. Only 32% of individual holders of agricultural land in Malawi are women 

despite their significant contribution in the agriculture sector.5 Rural women in Malawi play an 

important role as subsistence farmers,6 and there is increasingly involvement of young female (91% of 

young males works and 96% of young female workers are employed in the agriculture activities).7 Yet 

their productive capacity is hindered by gender inequalities. The gender inequalities in the agriculture 

sector can be attributed to:  

(i)  Limited access to land ownership and land tenure. This has led to gender implications mainly hinge 

around women’s control over the land and agriculture inputs including improved technology, 

extension services, credit and finances. This has affected women’s decisions over the agriculture 

sectors. Sensitisation meetings have been done to promote women participation and ensuring that 

farmer participation will be based on head of household rather than on gender. However, adequate 

safeguard will be put in place to ensure that at least 30% of the women are reached.  

(ii) Low education rate and skills among women’s famers.  Illiteracy is high among rural women and 

gender inequalities persist in secondary education, 1 in 30 women compare to 1 in 10 men 

completed secondary school (reference to point 2.5 in the report). Furthermore, for example adult 

literacy rate in Nkhata Bay is 91% to 76.8 %, male to female respectively. The situation is a bit 

different for youth but still there is differential of 18 % (age of 25 – 34). Addressing female 

education and knowledge in the project would be very crucial for their effective participation. 

Sensitization, extension support and business support services will be provided by the Government 

district officers including the youth and gender officers in order to promote youth and women 

participation and development. In addition, the project include program in capacity development 

in areas of functional literacy, book keeping, business formation etc.   

(iii) Inequalities in rural employment; rural women´s participation in paid employment is hampered by 

a significant domestic work burden. Moreover, rural female workers face a greater burden 

combining domestic and probative workloads compares to their male counterparts, which further 

restrict their agriculture production capacity.  Women generally have limited control over money 

generated from sales of agriculture produce. Moreover, men, more often than not, have the overall 

say on the selection of crop types to be produced which eventually impacts household food security. 

This creates constraints regarding agricultural investments, since in real terms, women tenure 

insecurity is one decisive factor constraining agricultural production.   

(iv) Gender mobility patterns; women are more likely to move shorter distances and within districts.  

This resulted in limited access to markets. The project will promote women participation in agri-

business by providing business development services and also through collaboration with NGOs 

active in the area.

Female – male respective: Life expectancy at birth (63.7 - 61.7). Expected years of schooling (10.8 - 10.7), Mean years of schooling (3.4 - 5.20) GNI per 

capita (0.679 - 0,815) HDI values (0.423 0.467).  GDI value Malawi, 0.907. Major gap is realized in yeas if schooling, gross national income, and 

combine with low gender inequality index, which includes participation of women in decision-making. In 2014, the parentage of women in decision 

making position stands at i.e. women held 22.3% of seats in the national parliament.

3.2.4 Finally, the project will take into account these factors and support women famers in the decision 

making process. It is apparent that gender inequality is affecting the agricultural productivity in the 

targeted areas. Women farmers on average outnumber men farmers. However, women are not well 

represented in decision making positions in irrigation schemes in Malawi where women occupy as little 

as 25% of the decision making positions and are often deputies of men. For that reason the project will 

make a deliberate effort to ensure adequate participation of women (at least 40% of beneficiaries) in 

project implementation and will encourage committees and farmer-based groups to include a larger 

quota for women in management, training, community representation and decision-making, and other 

income generating activities. Women, will thus have the opportunity to participate in farm related 

income generating activities and contribute meaningfully to the socio-economic development of their 

communities. The gender perspectives have been integrated into project formulation in line with the 

Malawian Gender Equality Act, 2012 and the National Youth Policy, 2013, and also takes due 

cognizance of the Bank’s Gender Policy. 

3.2.5 Social  The outputs of this project as contained in the logframe will translate into multiple 

positive economic and social outcomes whose indicators include: (i) increased agricultural activities 

and agricultural outputs whose net impacts will include improved living standards, food security and 

improved nutrition; (ii) increased employment opportunities both directly and indirectly by people 

employed during the development works as well as those who will be employed in agro-processing, 

marketing, sale of farm inputs, etc.; (iii) improved agricultural production skills through training; (iv) 

enhanced environmental management skills; (v) improved rural as well as on-farm infrastructure to ease 

transportation; (vi) minimized post-harvest losses through the development of farm and off-farm storage 

facilities as well as processing facilities that will help improve socio-economic well-being of the 

beneficiaries. 

3.2.6 The youth profile in Malawi indicates that out of a population of 17 million people8, more 

than 40% are between 10 to 35 years old. Literacy rates within this age bracket is estimated at 81.8% 

with slightly more males (86.6%) than females (77%) being literate. Although youth constitute a 

significant proportion of the population, they lack basic opportunities that would enable them develop 

to their full potential. This has been compounded by the presence of a range of adverse conditions that 

impinge on the youth; the most perverse, being poverty. Discussions with youth groups indicated that 

lack of appropriate skills and training, limited access to land, lack of value addition equipment and lack 

of financial support are some of the major challenges facing the youth in Malawi. Therefore this project 

has built in activities that will help to address challenges being faced by the youth. The project will 

promote formation of youth farmer cooperatives to engage in agriculture as a business. The project will 

also provide training in entrepreneurship, promote entrepreneurship culture, enhance agro-processing 

and value addition and also improve access to finance through seed funds and credit schemes. 

3.2.7. Involuntary resettlement: There is no involuntary resettlement foreseen under this project. The 

project identified sites do not require land acquisition. The areas are already designated for agricultural 

production. Settlements are outside the scheme areas except in Linga where there are a few homes found 

within the scheme area. These do not pose major problems for the scheme development since the designs 

have already isolated those few homes to be affected which will benefit from the project through 

livelihood activities embedded in the Catchment Management.  

IV IMPLEMENTATION 

4.1 Implementation arrangements 

 
4.1.1 The project will be under ASWAp within MoAIWD, and will be implemented through the 

existing GoM structures. The MoAIWD is currently implementing six Bank’s projects satisfactorily 

which did not have any problems in meeting the pre-condition for first disbursement. To fast tracked 

and kick start the preliminary key activities of the project, the Government had put in place an Interim 

Project Implementation Unit which comprised of - a Project Coordinator (a Chief Irrigation Engineer), 

                                                 
8 Population and Housing Census, 2008 



 

14 

a Procurement Specialists, a Project Accountant, a Monitoring and Evaluation Expert and a Desk Officer 

to support the project. However, in order to fast-track the implementation process, the Project 

Coordinator, Supervising Irrigation Engineer, Cooperative Officer and  Procurement Specialist as well 

as the FM officer will be recruited competitively locally to serve on full time basis. The externally 

recruited staff will sign performance based contract with the GoM. The project has also allocated 

resources to recruitment a lawyer to guide the farmers on legal issues. 

4.1.2 The Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources will implement the ENABLE 

YOUTH sub-component. A Technical Adviser which will serve for one year will be recruited 

competitively at the commencement of ENABLE YOUTH to support the university after which the 

university will take over full implementation of the component. The project will partner with a financial 

institution licensed by Reserved Bank of Malawi on risk sharing of the ENABLE YOUTH sub-

component of the project. The financial institution will be competitively recruited using Quality Based 

Method of Procurement.     

The Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Water Development will sign a memorandum of 

understanding with Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources (LUANAR) for 

selection, training and evaluation of business proposals and recommendation of seed funds for the 

Agripreneurs. The Bank will only release resources for the funding of Youth Agribusiness on the 

recommendation of the LUANAR. A criteria for the selection of the youth will be developed which will 

include the minimum qualification of the Malawi Schools Certificate of Education and targeting the 

youth from the project areas. The Agripreneurs will be provided with modern farming production 

technologies on loan such as tractors and agro-processing equipment for the crops being promoted in 

the area through a Microfinance Institutions upon completion of the training at LUANAR 

4.1.3 The PCT will ensure that project resources are properly accounted for and that all project targets 

are timely delivered. The PCT will be reporting to the Principal Secretary for the Ministry of 

Agriculture, Irrigation and Water Development. There will be a Technical Committee comprising of 

Directors of relevant Departments. The Technical Committee will report to the Project Steering 

Committee chaired by PS MoAIWD which will approve the work plans and budgets and guide the 

project on policy matters. At field level the PIU will work closely with the District Commissioners 

Office especially the District Agriculture Development Officers, Irrigation Officers and Youth 

Development Officers. Program Managers, Divisional Irrigation Services Officers from Salima and 

Mzuzu Agricultural Development/ISD will provide technical support to the project.  

4.1.4 Steering Committee: The existing ASWAp Executive Management Committee in conjunction 

with members from the Department of Youth, LUANAR and Financial Institution to be recruited as risk 

sharing partner will act as the Project Steering Committee and will have the overall decision making 

responsibility. The Principal Secretary, MoAIWD will chair the Steering Committee. 

 

Procurement Arrangements 

 

4.1.5 Procurement of goods (including non-consultancy services), works and the acquisition of 

consulting services, financed by the Bank for the project, will be carried out in accordance with the 

“Procurement Policy and Methodology for Bank Group Funded Operations” (BPM), dated October 

2015 and following the provisions stated in the Financing Agreement. Specifically, Procurement would 

be carried out following: (1) Borrower Procurement System (BPS): Specific Procurement Methods and 

Procedures (PMPs) under BPS comprising its Laws and Regulations as stipulated under 2003 Public 

Procurement Act (PPA) and 2004 Public Procurement Regulations (PPR using the national Standard 

Solicitation Documents (SSDs) or other Solicitation Documents agreed during project negotiations” for 

various group of transactions to be entailed under components 3 and 4 under the Project, and (2) Bank 

Procurement Policy and Methodology (BPM): Bank standard PMPs, using the relevant Bank Standard   

Solicitation Documents SDDs, mainly for components 1 and 2 for contracts that are either: (i) above 

the thresholds indicated in Annex B5, Para. B.5.3;2, or (ii) in case BPS is not relied upon for a specific 

transaction or group of transactions; and (iii) in case BPM have been found to be the best fit for purpose 



 

15 

for a specific transaction or group of transactions. In order to gain time and specifically to meet the 

requirements of PD2 of 2015, the Interim Project Implementation Unit put in place by the Government 

has commenced the preparation of the procurement documents. In addition, the Government has 

selected to use Advance Procurement.  

4.1.6 Procurement Risks and Capacity Assessment (PRCA): the assessment of procurement risks at 

the Country, Sector, and Project levels and of procurement capacity at the Executing Agency (EA), were 

undertaken  for the project and the output have informed the decisions on the procurement regimes (BPS 

and Bank)   being used for specific transactions or groups of similar transactions under the project. The 

global rating of risk assessment was Substantial with possibility of reducing to moderate after the 

implementation of the mitigating measures. The appropriate risks mitigation measures have been 

included in the procurement PRCA action plan proposed in Annex B5, Para. 5.3.8.

4.1.7 Financial Management Arrangements:  

 

4.1.7.1 MOAIWD has prior experience in implementing projects financed by various development 

partners and currently manages a total of three projects funded by the Bank. The Bank-funded projects 

are mainstreamed within the Ministry but the financial management function is performed by 

Consultants working together with Government Accountants. The frequent rotation of Government 

Accountants has hampered the reinforcement of capacity within the Ministry thus necessitating the 

retention of Consultants to support the PIUs. The existing projects have had a number of financial 

management challenges related to the poor quality of quarterly reporting, delays in the preparation of 

annual financial statements, non-compliance with the Bank’s audit submission deadlines, late 

submission of expenditure justification documents and inadequate controls at the district level. 

 



 

16 

4.1.7.2 In order the mitigate the identified FM risks based on prior experience, the project will recruit a 

Financial Management Specialist and an Accountant on a contractual basis to work together with the 

two Accountants designated by the Accountant General. The Financial Management Specialist will have 

primary responsibility for the FM aspects and report to the Project Manager and to the Director of 

Finance at MoAIWD.  The contracted FM consultants will be subjected to annual performance 

evaluations to ensure that they support the borrower’s compliance with the Bank’s financial 

management requirements. 

 

4.1.7.3 The project’s FM will be centrally managed within the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) in 

MoAIWD. The PIU would coordinate all project FM-related issues. The overall conclusion of the 

assessment is that MoAIWD’s capacity to handle all the FM aspects of the project, satisfies Bank 

minimum requirements as laid out in the Bank’s FM guidelines subject to the recruitment on a 

contractual basis of a Financial Management Specialist and an Accountant . The overall FM risk for the 

project is assessed as Moderate (see Annex 1 – Risk Analysis summary).  

 

4.1.8 Financial Reporting and Auditing Arrangement:  

In accordance with the Bank’s financial reporting and audit requirements, the project will be required 

to prepare and submit a quarterly progress report to the Bank not later than forty-five (45) days after the 

end of each calendar quarter. The project will prepare and submit annual financial statements, audited 

by the National Audit Office or an independent private audit firm, together with the auditor’s opinion 

and management letter to the Bank not later than six (6) months after the end of the financial year. The 

detailed auditing arrangements are included in the Technical Annex B.4. 

4.1.9 Internal Audit:  

The Central Internal Audit Unit will be responsible for providing objective assurance and ensuring 

accountability in the utilization of public funds and assets. Various bank rules and guidelines (including 

procurement rules, FM guidelines and disbursement guidelines) would also provide additional guidance. 

The internal controls of the project will be spelt out in the project implementation manual which would 

include sections on accounting and administrative procedures and provide guidance on the day to day 

project FM issues. The internal control environment will be underpinned by the clear definition of roles 

and responsibilities allowing for segregation of duties. 

4.1.10 Disbursement Arrangements:  

The project would make use of the Bank’s various disbursement methods including (i) Direct Payment, 

(ii) Special Account (SA) and (iii) Reimbursement methods in accordance with Bank rules and 

procedures as laid out in the Disbursement handbook as applicable. The Bank will issue a Disbursement 

Letter of which the content will be discussed and agreed with the Government of Malawi (GoM) during 

negotiations.  

 

The government will open a special account which will be denominated in foreign currency, at a bank 

acceptable to the Bank for the Project’s use. A related local currency account will also be opened for 

eligible local currency operating costs.  

4.2 Monitoring  

 
4.2.1 The established ASWAp results framework will be used for M&E of the project performance. 

Support will be provided by the MoAIWD and Ministry Labour, Youth and Manpower Development 

(MLYMD) to undertake their roles in leading the M&E process. The M&E Units will generate gender 

disaggregated data and also assess socio-economic impacts on the target groups. The Environmental 

District Officers and Land Resources Conservation Officers will monitor the social and environmental 

impacts of the project. Project effect and impacts on the target groups will be monitored by constituting 

cross-section samples of beneficiaries. The component will facilitate stakeholder consultations, farmer 

organisation, nutrition and HIV/AIDS messages, promotion of women participation, field 

demonstrations including competitions and short-term consultancies.

4.3 Governance  

 

4.3.1 The Agricultural sector in Malawi is repositioning itself to institutionalize transparency and 

good governance as evidenced in earlier detection by the management and ordering of full investigation 

of suspected salary fraud in the ministry. It should be noted that the MAIWD was not involved in the 

Malawi Cashgate of 2013. However, the requisite fiduciary management framework still poise a lot of 

challenges which include lack of qualified and experienced project accounting staff due to high turnover 

or attrition of accounting staff, weak internal controls and non-compliance with key internal control 

procedures within line ministry.  

4.3.2 The 2015 report of Transparency International Corruption Perception Index showed that Malawi 

had slide from 37(88/176) to 31 (112/175) between 1912 and 2015. The overall score of 2015 was below 

Sub-Saharan average of 33 score. However, the overall average score for Malawi’s Country Policy and 

Institutional Assessment (CPIA) Governance component has been improving slowly between 2004-

2014 with intermittent slight decreases in 2010 (-0.1) and 2014 (-0.13). However, the theft of public 

funds amounting to about US Dollar 50 million in September, 2013 dubbed as Cash gate, exposed high 

level corruption and serious weaknesses in Malawi’s PFM system. The current administration has since 

coming into power shown strong resolve to address the root causes of Cash gate and reform the PFM 

system.  The Government is implementing the PFM Reform Action Plan to restore controls and integrity 

of the PFM system over the short term. The Government also is also implementing a broader Public 

Sector Reform Programme (PSRP) aimed at improving accountability and transparency in public 

service delivery.  Steady progress in reforms is being made as evidenced by recent improvement in 

financial reporting and completion of pay roll audit.  There are on-going efforts to strengthen the 

capacity of key governance institutions, such as the Anti-Corruption Bureau, Office of the Directorate 

of Public Procurement (ODPP) and the National Auditor General’s Office. 

4.4 Sustainability  

4.4.1 The participatory approach adopted during the project design and envisioned to be extended 

during the implementation phase will enhance the ownership of project’s activities and realizations by 

the main stakeholders ensuring its sustainability. The irrigation infrastructure will be operated and 

maintained by the Water Users Associations (WUAs) whose capacities will be developed through 

training. The project will ensure that at least 30% of women are represented in the irrigation 

management committees. Operation and Maintenance guidelines will be developed including tariff 

setting by the supervising consultant for the operation and maintenance of the schemes that takes into 

consideration past experiences in the management of irrigation schemes in the country. The WUAs are 

expected to cover the O&M costs from the contribution of farmers through water charges. Other 

sustainability of other components - Value Addition and Youth entrepreneurship and Agro-

Cooperatives Development for Employability are hinged on making paradigm shift of agriculture from 

development to business/commercial activities.  

4.4.2 The project is financially sustainable. The analysis indicates 23% and 26% FIRR and EIRR 

respectively. It is evident that the farmers will be able to pay for the water usage (which is currently 

estimated at KWA50, 000 per annum) through the Water User Association given that farmers will be 

linked to processors who will be ready to buy their products. In order to strengthen the relationships 

between the two parties,   provisions have been made for legal services. The project also makes 

provision for the training of artisans and technicians for the maintenance of the irrigation infrastructure.  

In addition regarding the irrigation infrastructure, marketing of value added products, provision of 

institutional support and development of strong farmer groups will work in synergy to ensure 

sustainability. In particular it is expected that, under AIYAP, the farmers who will be organized in 

Farmer Associations/Cooperative Societies will operate as farming businesses. Cooperative and 

Extension Officers will be recruited to provide technical supports in farms management, operation and 

maintenance.  The analysis also indicates that the young entrepreneurs will be able to service their loans, 

as well as obtain handsome net profits for re-investments in running of their farms.    

4.5 Risk management  

 

4.5.1 One major risk is the unpredictability of agricultural markets due to trade restrictions and price 

controls on some items. The Government is being urged by DPs, for instance to deregulate agriculture 

markets including removal of bans and pegging the price on some strategic crops such as maize.   

Enactment of the Goods Control Act would help to improve market predictability.  However, there is 

already a guaranteed market for sugarcane production by linking the farmers with Dwangwa Cane 

Growers Trust and Dwangwa Cane Growers Company Ltd.     

4.5.2  Volatility of the world commodity prices 

Mitigation: The country enjoys accessibility to SADC market and the project lays emphasis on internal 

processing of raw materials and value addition. 

 

4.5.3 Project Cost Overruns: Project cost overruns due to exchange rate fluctuations, uncertainties in 

economic situation of Malawi and SADC and the rise in the cost of materials. 

Mitigation: Project is costed in USD and efficient procurement timing to address the increases, as well 

as adequate price contingencies for the unavoidable increases will is provided in the project costing. 

4.5.4 Reduced precipitation, increased temperature, change in length of rainy season, increased 

incidences of drought and floods, due to climate risks:  

Mitigation: Training regarding vulnerabilities, assisting the communities to select various adaptation 

measures; e.g. rainwater harvesting, rotational grazing, using drought tolerant varieties e.g. cassava, 

sorghum etc. 

4.5.5 Delay in providing counterpart funding:  

Mitigation: The GoM contributions will be largely be in kind in form of provisions of office spaces, 

furniture, salary and wages, allowances (including per diem of staff), payment of all utility bills, office 

equipment and payment of hotel bills for staff seconded to the project.  

 
4.6 Knowledge building  
 

4.6.1 The knowledge gained and lessons learnt through the implementation of various agricultural 

projects in Malawi, government policies as well as studies carried out in the sector have been duly 

applied in designing this project. Similarly, the knowledge that will be generated through 

implementation of this Project will be synergised with other projects on ground such as SIVAP and 

AISP to achieve maximum result. The results from the various studies and other surveys, including the 

socio-economic impact study will inform the stakeholders on how to put the acquired knowledge into 

practical use for better results-oriented achievements and sustained benefit flows. 

 



 

19 

4.6.2 At the project level, the project implementation review, quarterly progress reports, audit, sector 

M&E and completion reports will also provide information on various aspects of the project for further 

diagnosis. The knowledge obtained will be shared within the Bank and with other development partners 

as well as with RMCs.
