Executive Summary 

A. Project Overview  

A1. The South Agro-Industrial Processing Zone Project (PZTA-Sud, or Agropole Sud) is among 

the flagship projects of Senegal’s Vision 2035 Emerging Senegal Plan (PSE), which raises the number 

of growth drivers from two (telecommunications and services) to six, the four new ones being 

agriculture and agribusiness, housing, mining and tourism. It forms part of Pillar I of the PSE on 

“Structural transformation of the economy and growth” and is an integral part of the industrial PSE 

component that provides for the establishment of three “integrated and competitive agricultural hubs”. 

Furthermore, PZTA-Sud is in line with the priorities of the Country Strategy Paper (CSP) for the 2016-

2020 period and the Bank's Ten-Year Strategy 2013-2022 through its High 5s “Feed Africa”, 

“Industrialise Africa” and “Improve the quality of life for the people of Africa”. 

A2. PZTA-Sud is a pilot project to be implemented over five years for a total cost (net of taxes) 

of approximately EUR 87.75 million, broken down as follows: (i) ADB loan: EUR 43.1 million; (ii) 

IsDB loan: EUR 27.85 million, and (iii) the State: EUR 16.8 million. The project comprises 3 

components: (a) Support for the establishment of a business ecosystem conducive to private investment 

in agribusiness; (b) Sustainable improvement of the capacity of agro-industrial producers; (c) 

Coordination, management and monitoring/evaluation. A Project Implementation Unit (PIU), attached 

to the Ministry of Industry (Executing Agency), will be responsible for: (i) coordinating investments 

in the agricultural hub; and (ii) implementing public sub-projects. It will be complemented by the 

Sovereign Fund for Strategic Investment (FONSIS), for the implementation of PPP sub-projects 

through a Construction and Operation Company (SCE). Lastly, private companies will be responsible 

for private sub-projects, in partnership with local financial institutions.  

A3. The project area is the natural region of Casamance, which has real agro-industrial potential 

in its three administrative districts of Ziguinchor, Sedhiou and Kolda. Thus, the project aims to 

contribute to the revival of this region’s economic activities to support the current peace and 

reconstruction momentum. In this regard, the project will have to mitigate the adverse effects of the 

independence crisis of these last decades through the establishment of an ecosystem conducive to 

private investment in the agro-industrial sectors with high nutritional and market (national and export) 

potential. The key expected outputs of the project are: (i) increase in the share of locally processed 

agricultural production from 2% to 20% for mango and from 5% to 30% for cashew nuts; (ii) reach a 

cumulative amount of catalysed private investment of more than USD 200 million (of which 20% for 

SMEs/SMIs); (iii) increase by at least 40% the agricultural production of key sectors (mango, cashew 

and maize); and (iv) create jobs and wealth, including for youth and women. The project was the subject 

of a comprehensive state-funded feasibility study conducted by a private firm and supported by the 

United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO).  

A4. The project will enable the creation and consolidation of about 14,500 direct jobs (of which 

50% women and 60% youth) and 35,000 indirect jobs (of which 50% women and 60% youth). The 

number of households that will be affected is estimated at 65,000, or about 365,000 people (of which 

50% women and 60% youth). The number of people who will be indirectly affected corresponds to the 

population of the natural region of Casamance estimated at 2 million in 2018. The expected outcomes 

concern improving the food and nutritional security of beneficiaries as well as their income through 

improved access to markets, agricultural inputs, and services. To this end, the project provides for (i) 

the increase in private investment thanks to the facilities provided (more favourable business 

ecosystem, construction of a central agro-industrial module (Adéane), three (3) regional modules 

(Bignona, Sédhiou and Kolda) and five (5) aggregation and service platforms; and (ii) capacity building 

of value chain actors in agro-industrial sectors (structuring/organisation of value chains, training, ease 

of access to finance, production by researching in-vitro mango, cashew, maize seedlings, etc.).  

 



vi 

B. Needs Assessment 

B.1  Despite efforts by the State, food security remains a challenge and food importation continues 

to weigh on the trade balance. Thus, imports of cereals and fruits/by-products amounted respectively 

to CFAF 329.7 billion and CFAF 37 billion in 2017. This is due to the limited private investment as a 

result of the unfavourable business environment (land, taxation, etc.), inadequate infrastructure 

(energy, transport, water, ICT, etc.) and poor structuring/organisation of agricultural value chains 

(which employ about 60% of the working population). Furthermore, there is a low level of processing 

of agricultural products based on quality industrial processes (barely 13% at national level), low 

agricultural productivity and high vulnerability to climate change. This situation is more pronounced 

in the project area where barely 2% and 5% of the mango and cashew nut productions are processed, 

respectively. Thus, the project aims to facilitate the mobilisation of private investment especially in the 

processing and marketing of key sectors (mango, cashew, corn, etc.).  

C. Bank’s Value-Added  

C.1  Through its initiative to support the development of Agro-Industrial Processing Zones 

(AIPZs), the Bank aims to increase private investment in the agro-industrial sector for a sustainable 

transformation of the rural economy particularly by providing quality basic infrastructure and a more 

attractive business environment in the agricultural production basins. The Bank has the requisite 

experience to support the preparation and implementation of this type of project (including in Togo, 

Ethiopia, Guinea, Côte d'Ivoire, etc.), which calls for an integrated approach encompassing the entire 

value chain. Lastly, lessons from similar projects supported by the Bank militate for such an 

intervention that will mobilise the public component (with ADB and IsDB public windows), PPP (with 

FONSIS) and private (with FONSIS and financial institutions).  

D. Knowledge Building 

D.1  As PZTA-Sud is a pilot operation under the PSE, a mechanism will be put in place for 

monitoring/evaluation (M & E) of outcomes and impacts. The project will set up a suitable internal 

monitoring system for project performance led by the Steering Committee, on the one hand, and 

external evaluation, on the other hand, supervised by the Operational and Monitoring Office (BOS) of 

the PSE under the oversight of the Presidency of the Republic. The project will support BOS to carry 

out baseline and end-of-project surveys and, if necessary, specific studies (incentives, private 

financing, public-private partnership, etc.).  Lastly, the results of the M&E mechanism will be 

leveraged and shared through the BOS e-platform, the analytical reports, the consultation and 

experience sharing meetings organised at the regional, national and international level.

BANK GROUP MANAGEMENT’S REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION TO THE BOARD OF 

DIRECTORS CONCERNING A LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL TO FINANCE THE 

SOUTH AGRO-INDUSTRIAL PROCESSING ZONE PROJECT (PZTA-SUD) 
 

Management hereby submits this report and its recommendation concerning a proposal to grant a loan of 

EUR 43,100,000 to the Republic of Senegal to finance the activities of the PZTA-Sud project, commonly 

known as “Agropole Sud”. 

I. STRATEGIC THRUST AND RATIONALE 

1.1 Project Linkages with Country Strategy and Objectives  

 

1.1.1 In 2014, the Government embarked on the implementation of the Emerging Senegal Plan (PSE), 

which aims to have “an emerging Senegal in 2035 with a society of solidarity in a nation of laws” through 

the structural transformation of the economic and social system. The strategic thrusts guiding the PSE are as 

follows: (i) Thrust 1: Structural transformation of the economy and Growth; (ii) Thrust 2: Human Capital, 
Social Protection and Sustainable Development; and (iii) Thrust 3: Governance, Institutions, Peace and 

Security. Thus, PZTA-Sud or ‘Agropole Sud’ falls within the framework of the PSE’s Thrust 1 and forms an 

integral part of the second Priority Action Plan (PAP) of PSE spanning the period 2019-2023. 

 

1.1.2 PZTA-Sud (or Agropole Sud) is one of PSE's three agro-processing hubs (or integrated agricultural 

hubs) through private investments in agribusiness. Thus, it is consistent with the Industrial Sector 

Development Policy Letter (LPSDI), which seeks to raise the industrial sector’s contribution to the GDP 

from 12 to 25% over the period 2014-35, by targeting the agricultural value chains with high potential (fruits 

and vegetables, oils, dairy products, cereals, and poultry). This will benefit the domestic market (import 

substitution) and the international market (fruits and vegetables, fishery products, etc.) as well. It is part of 

the guidelines of the Agricultural, Sylvicultural and Pastoral Policy Law (LOASP) 2004-24 aimed at 

reducing poverty and food security in rural areas. It also aligns with multisector strategies including the 

National Strategy for Food Security and Resilience (SNSAR 2015-35), the National Strategy for Social 

Protection (SNPS 2016-35) and the National Strategy for Equity and Gender Equality (SNEEG 2015-25).   

 Emerging Senegal Plan (PSE) 
  
PSE is the economic policy framework aimed at steering Senegal on the path of emergence by 2035. Pursuing the 
vision of "an emerging Senegal in 2035 with a society of solidarity in a nation of laws", it is structured around 3 thrusts 
targeting 6 priority sectors, 17 key reforms and 27 flagship projects. Thrust 1 aims at the structural transformation of the 
economy by strengthening the current drivers of growth and developing new sectors that create wealth and jobs. Thrust 2 
"Human Capital, Social Protection and Sustainable Development" aims to improve living conditions for the people while 
promoting the emergence of viable territories. Thrust 3 aims to modernise public administration and strengthen security, 
stability, governance, and consolidate the rule of law. 

The first priority action plan (PAP 1) over the 2014-2018 period has raised the GDP growth rate from an average of 
3.3% in 2009-2013 to more than 6% since 2015. Substantial progress has been made in key projects such as the Diass 
International Airport, the extension of the Dakar-Diamniadio motorway, the Thiès-Touba motorway, the Regional Express 
Train, the Diamniadio Industrial Park and the rehabilitation of the Dakar-Bamako railroad line. The agricultural sector has 
been strongly revitalised with the tripling of onion and groundnut production, the tenfold increase in potato production and 
the 141% increase in rice production. As regards energy, progress has been achieved in the installed capacity from 573 to 
1130 megawatts, but also in the generation of renewable energy (solar and wind) with 144 megawatts newly installed. The 
number of electrified villages over the period has increased from 1648 to 3864. The second Phase 2019-2023 (PAP II) 
seeks to remove or mitigate the potential constraints to this growth momentum, while promoting a better articulation 
between the development objectives (SDGs) and those of PSE. It emphasises improving the structuring and maturation of 
projects, and accelerating the implementation of reforms. 

Lastly, the PSE monitoring/evaluation system was strengthened with the implementation of the Harmonised 
Monitoring and Evaluation Framework (CASE) for Public Policy in 2015, comprising the Operational Monitoring Bureau 
(BOS), the Ministry of Economy and Planning and the Organisation and Methods Bureau (BOM). Thus, placed under the 
authority of the Minister in charge of monitoring the PSE, the role of BOS is to provide decision-making tools to the country’s 
highest authority on a weekly basis. It is also responsible for the organisation, coordination and management of 
maturation/structuring processes of projects or flagship reforms.

1.2 Rationale for the Bank’s Intervention 

 

1.2.1 Senegal’s economy continues to perform well, with average annual GDP growth of around 6.7% over 

the 2016-2018 period. This performance is attributable particularly to the dynamism of agriculture, 

construction, tourism, transport as well as financial and insurance service sectors. However, food imports 

continue to weigh on the trade balance and food security remains a challenge. Reasons identified include the 

low level of processing of agricultural products according to quality and competitive industrial processes, 

the low productivity of the agricultural sector and its high vulnerability to climate change. These constraints 

result from the limited private investment due to the business environment that remains unfavourable - 

despite jumping 18 spots in the Doing Business 2020 ranking, the poor quality of basic infrastructure (energy, 

transport, water, telecommunications, etc.) and the poor organisation of agricultural value chains (which 

employ about 60% of the labour force). 

1.2.2 The South Agro-Industrial Processing Zone Project (PZTA-Sud) aligns well with the priorities of 

the Bank's Country Strategy Paper 2016-2020 for Senegal, notably Pillar I on support for agricultural 

processing. Furthermore, it forms part of the Bank’s Regional Integration Strategy for West Africa (RISP 

2016-17, extended to 2019). It is in consonance with three (3) of the five (5) operational priorities of the 

Bank's Ten-Year Strategy 2013-2022, namely (i) the Feed Africa Strategy 2016-2025; (ii) the 

Industrialisation Strategy for Africa 2016-25; and (iii) the Strategy for Improving the Quality of Life for the 

People of Africa 2016-25. Furthermore, the project is in line with the Bank's Second Climate Change Action 

Plan (CCAP II 2016-2020). Lastly, the Bank's intervention forms part of the initiative launched in recent 

years for the development of "agro-industrial processing zones" in agricultural basins with high market 

(domestic and export) potential. Accordingly, Senegal has forged a strategic partnership with the Bank for 

the implementation of the three (3) "Competitive Integrated Agricultural Hubs" of the PSE. Therefore, the 

project will benefit from lessons learned from similar initiatives around the world, and from the Bank’s 

experience garnered in Africa (particularly in Togo, Ethiopia and Guinea), hence its comparative advantage. 

1.3 Donor Coordination  

 

1.3.1 Development assistance is coordinated by the Government through the Economic and Financial 

Cooperation Department (DCEF) of the Ministry of Economy, Planning and Cooperation (MEPC). 

Coordination is carried out by the Consultative Committee of Technical and Financial Partners (TFPs) 

through a three-tier consultation mechanism to which the Bank belongs: the G50, the G15 including a 15-

member Executive Committee (COMEX) and thematic groups. In the dialogues between the TFPs and the 

Government, the main issues addressed concern implementing the key PSE reforms, including land, portfolio 

performance, monitoring/evaluation of outcomes, strengthening of the road maintenance fund and resource 

mobilisation (including domestic resources) under the Ministry of Finance and the Budget (MFB). It is worth 

noting that for the "integrated competitive agro-industrial hubs" project, the agricultural sector TFPs 

participate in the meetings of the National Technical Working Group chaired by MDIPMI. 

1.3.2 Therefore, PZTA-Sud will make use of the results expected from the interventions of projects 

supporting increased agricultural productivity and the development of rural entrepreneurship, namely the 

Water Valorisation for Value Chains Development Project (PROVALE-CV), the Project to Open Up 

Production Areas in Support of the Local Development Programme (PDZP/PNDL-AfDB), the Support 

Project for Skills Development and Youth Entrepreneurship in Growth Sectors (PDCEJ-AfDB), the 

Multinational Programme to Build Resilience to Food and Nutrition Insecurity in the Sahel (P2RS-AfDB), 

and the Project to Develop Resilience to Recurrent Food Insecurity in Senegal (DRIARS-IsDB). 

1.3.3 Specifically, the project will work with the professional organisations engaged in these sub-sectors 

(producer organisations, aggregators/logisticians, agro-processing entities, and exporters) and synergize with 

similar ongoing projects, including Shelter for Life funded by the United States Development Agency

(USAID) and the Project to Support Investment and Competitiveness of Agribusiness in Senegal, focusing 

particularly on the mango industry in Casamance (also USAID-funded). Lastly, the following table shows

II. PROJECT DESCRIPTION    

2.0 Project Intervention Overview  

2.0.0  The project’s overall objective is to contribute towards improving living conditions for the people 

(including youth and women) through the creation of value-added on agricultural products and the 

sustainable increase of productivity of the priority agro-industrial subsectors (mango and cashew nut). The 

specific objectives of the project are (i) to create conditions conducive to private investment in the industrial 

processing of agricultural products, as well as in the provision of inputs and services; and (ii) enhance the 

capacity of priority sector actors to sustainably increase agricultural productivity. 

2.0.1 In terms of concept: the project was designed based on a feasibility study financed by the 

government with UNIDO support, as per the following principles: (i) the targeting of sectors with a domestic 

or international market potential, which led to the choice of two priority subsectors (mango and cashew) and 

three complementary subsectors (maize, banana and non-timber forest products); (ii) the presence of a high-

potential agricultural production basin; and (iii) private sector interest in investing, as confirmed during the 

consultation days (Labs) and with the creation of SOCAAS (Cooperative Society of Actors of the South 

Agricultural hub). The key expected results of mango processing are puree, nectar, dried mango and vinegar. 

For cashew, expected products are cashew nuts and cashew juice. 

2.0.2 At the physical level: PZTA-Sud (or Agropole Sud) will finance : (i) a central module for the 

industrial transformation of productions from the targeted sectors, their packaging and marketing, for a Phase 

1 surface area of 40 ha expandable to 85 ha; (ii) three regional modules for secondary packaging and primary 

processing (local and regional market) covering an area of 5 ha to be serviced, expandable to 10 ha; (iii) five 

division-level platforms for aggregation, cleaning, sorting and primary packaging with a unit area of 3 to 5 

ha; and (iv) collection points in villages (primary storage facilities). Furthermore, resources are earmarked to 

ensure access of modules and platforms to regional networks (roads, electricity, ICT, etc.). The land of the 

agricultural hub, which has been secured according to the requirements of national procedures and the Bank, 

will be registered in the name of SCE. 



 

4 

2.0.2 At the operational level:  three categories of sub-projects (SP) were deemed necessary to implement 

to ensure the success of the agricultural processing area (or Agricultural Hub), namely: 

 Public sub-projects (financed from AfDB and IsDB public windows) will be set up by the Project 
Executing Agency to facilitate private investment. These public sub-projects mainly concern the 

infrastructure of the central module (located in Adéane), regional modules (Kolda, Bignona and Kolda) 

and aggregation and service platforms for which the preliminary design studies (PDS) are in progress 

and those of detailed design (DD) are planned before end-2019. Thus, the project will finance the 

preparation of bidding documents (BD) as well as construction work. Capacity building of institutional 

structures (ministries, research centres, technical services, etc.) and actors of value chains (Banks/MFIs, 

POs, etc.) will be financed by the project to for performance enhancement. Partnership agreements, if 

needed, will be signed with the said structures. 

 

 The public-private sub-projects will be financed via the Sovereign Fund for Strategic Investments 
(FONSIS) to which this responsibility is entrusted under a MDIPMI-FONSIS-BOS tripartite agreement. 

Thus, FONSIS will set up a Construction and Operation Company (SCE), a public limited company 

whose majority capital will be held by the private sector (tenant companies, financial investors and 

members of inter-professional sectors), but will include public investors (FONSIS, local governments 

and the Central State). Alongside the relevant State entities, the SCE will be responsible for: (i) 

developing public-private sub-projects (about 5); (ii) promoting the arrival of private investors in the 

hub; and (iii) managing, recovering and maintaining the hub. SCE’s income will consist mainly of 

rentals, royalties and business services (see box 
 

South Agricultural Hub (Agropole Sud) Construction and Operation Company (SCE) 
 

The mobilisation of private investment is crucial for the success of Agropole Sud. The criteria influencing the investment 

decision include the country’s quality of life and stability, market size, existence of developed and competitive land for industrial units, 

quality of infrastructure (water, energy, wastewater treatment, etc.), connection to domestic and export markets, availability of 

qualified and affordable labour, and the existence of tax/non-tax incentives for targeted activities. 
 

In this regard, Agropole Sud has several strengths, among which: (i) the participatory structuring of the project, which has 

helped to obtain the commitment of producers of the targeted sectors and potential private sector interest; (ii) the upgrading of 

infrastructure thanks to the infrastructure provided for under the project (core module, regional modules, and aggregation and 

service platforms) and those planned by other actors (existence of the Trans-Gambia bridge, dredging of the Casamance River 

enabling the arrival of boats of 5500 tonnes, planned rehabilitation of the Senoba-Ziguinchor road, upgrading of the Ziguinchor 

airport, revival of tourism, etc.); and (iii) the facilitation of investments through the establishment by APIX of an Investment Platform 

in Ziguinchor and the future Agropole du Sud one-stop-shop, as well as the future implementation by FONSIS (Sovereign Fund for 

Strategic Investments) of the Agropole du Sud Construction and Operation Company (SCE). 
 

Thus, on the recommendation of the LAB (5-week participatory workshop organised by BOS, which brought together 96 structures 

for a total 10,500 working hours), a tripartite agreement (BOS-MDIPMI-FONSIS) was signed to entrust FONSIS with the creation 

of the SCE, as a founding shareholder. SCE will be a private company, majority owned by private companies including strategic 

investors (including tenant and inter-professional companies) and financial investors. The State (including FONSIS) and local 

authorities figure among the public shareholders. FONSIS will be responsible for developing and supporting the implementation of 

the future SCE business plan, with the possible involvement of a world-class strategic partner with expertise in the development, 

operation and promotion of private investments in the agricultural hub. The SCE will develop convincing business cases 

concerning specific investments expected in the modules (central and regional) and divisional -level platforms. In these efforts, SCE 

will synergize with the actors involved in investment promotion, including BOS, MDIPMI, APIX, and ASEPEX. 



 

5 

 Private sub-projects will be implemented by the interested companies that will be shareholders of the 
SCE. Among these are five (5) large companies and about 15 SMEs/SMIs. In this regard, this project 

will finance the intervention of the Upgrading Bureau (BMN) to provide non-financial support to about 

35 micro-enterprises and 15 SMEs. Access to financial services will be facilitated through local financial 

institutions (notably Banque Agricole, PAMECAS and ACEP), which have instruments tailored to the 

needs of short- and medium-term credit (“warrantage”, leasing, etc.). They will be supported by the 

Bank through a private sector-window operation under preparation (with PITD) to improve access to 

long-term resources, which is essential for the development of SMEs/ SMIs of the agricultural hub (see 

box). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 Facilitating Access to Financial Services for SMEs/SMIs 

The country's financial system comprises 29 credit institutions, but its banking penetration rate is 19%. Access to 
financial services remains a challenge, especially for SMEs/SMIs, which account for around 80% of enterprises, contribute 30% 
of GDP formation, and employ nearly 60% of the workforce. Furthermore, there is limited access to credit for the agricultural 
sector, perceived as risky by the banks and the SFDs (insufficient financial standing, weak organisational and management 
structures, unreliable financial information, lack of guarantees, and climatic and edaphic hazards) with total or partial crop losses: 
climate, price volatility, markets, health hazards, locust invasions, etc.). They have put in place various types of credit, mainly 
short-term, including: (i) credits for agricultural production; (ii) marketing credits for agricultural products; (iii) credits to breeders' 
organisations for fattening and marketing; (iv) working capital loans, notably through "warrantage"; and (v) medium-long-term 
agricultural equipment credits (tractors, tillers, motor pumps, etc.) via collateral. 

Thus, the project will provide support in the form of: (i) an upgrade of SMEs/SMIs operating in the targeted sectors through 
a technical assistance agreement to SME/SMI support structures (such as the Upgrading Bureau); (ii) a medium-to-long term 
line of credit (from the ADB's private window) to be set up with one or two well-established financial institutions; (iii) strengthening 

the capacity of FS/banks networks (based on a call for proposals) to help them develop financial products adapted to the 
needs of the agro-industrial sector (warrantage, leasing, etc.), staff training and equipment purchase.

2.2 Technical Solutions Adopted and Alternatives Explored 

2.2.1 PZTA-Sud aims to contribute to the transformation of the agro-industrial sector, with a view to 

inclusive agricultural growth reducing poverty and food imports and generating employment. Accordingly, 

PSE provides for the establishment of three "integrated competitive agro-industrial hubs or agricultural 

hubs", in public-private partnership. For Agropole Sud, the physical agro-industrial architecture planned for 

the targeted sectors (mango, cashew, corn, etc.) will include i) a centralised serviced module (external works, 

electricity, sanitation, one-stop shop, etc.) to accommodate the key industrial units and related services 

(logistics, services, etc.); ii) three serviced regional modules that will serve as storage, secondary packaging 

and primary processing areas for agricultural products; and iii) serviced aggregation and service platforms 

to facilitate interaction between value chain actors and to ease producers’ access to services, inputs and 

markets. With the support of the State services, this system will be complemented by improving the access 

of SMEs/SMIs and POs to technologies (quality plant material, inputs, etc.), knowledge (technical, 

organisational, management, etc.), physical infrastructure (access roads, shops, etc.) and soft infrastructure 

(ICT, digital platform, etc.). The system will be complemented by the establishment of the Construction and 

Operations Company by FONSIS. The company established will be in charge of agricultural hub construction 

and management, implementation of the PPP sub-projects (5) and support for private sector mobilisation (60 

enterprises of which 35 micro, 15 SMEs, 5 large), in conjunction with the other relevant State agencies 

(APIX, MDIPMI, ASEPEX, etc.).

2.3 Project Type    

2.3.1 PZTA-Sud is a public investment project that aims to create the conditions for increased private 

investment in targeted value chains, particularly in the areas of agricultural processing, input supply and food 

services.  

2.4 Project Cost and Financing Arrangement 

2.4. Project Cost: The project’s overall cost is estimated at EUR 87.75 million (~ CFAF 57.6 billion), 

net of taxes and customs duties. This cost is broken down as follows: a portion in foreign exchange estimated 

at EUR 59.1 million (~ CFAF 38.8 billion) and a portion in local currency amounting to EUR 28.65 million 

(~ CFAF 18.8 billion). This cost includes provisions for physical and financial contingencies estimated at 

approximately 3% each. The estimate of the financial contingencies was made based on the current and 

projected annual rates of inflation of the local currency and foreign exchange estimated on average 

respectively at 2.5% and 1.5% per year. A summary of the estimated project cost by component and 

expenditure category is shown in Tables 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5 below, while the detailed tables are given as an

2.4.2 Sources of Financing: The project will be financed by the AfDB, the IsDB and the Government of 

Senegal for the respective amounts of EUR 43.1 million (49%), EUR 27.85 million (32%), and EUR 16.8 

million (19%). Thus, it should be noted that the combined amount of the counterpart and IDB financing 

represents nearly 51% of the total, which indicates the Government's significant commitment. The 

government counterpart funding contribution, amounting to EUR 16.8 million, includes the seed money 

provided by FONSIS for implementing public-private sub-projects amounting to CFAF 1 billion, the 

compensation of affected persons, rehabilitation of some of the roads connecting the platforms/modules to 

the production areas and the social spending of the PIU. Details of expenditures by source of financing and 

expenditure category are given in Tables 2.6, 2.7 and 2.8, respectively.

2.5. Project Area and Targeted Beneficiaries 

2.5.1 The project impact area covers the regions of Ziguinchor, Kolda and Sedhiou which constitute the 
natural region of Casamance and had a population of about 1,947,967 in 2018. The agricultural and socio-

economic environment of the rural population is characterised by a low access rate to rural roads, storage, 

processing and agricultural production infrastructure, particularly for youth and women. The area has the 

distinction of being among the country’s most productive in agriculture thanks to its good rainfall and soil 

quality. However, a large part of agricultural production is difficult to market owing to low value-added for 

agricultural products. 

2.5.2 The area of intervention has been the focus of attention by the State following the armed conflict of 
the 1980s and 1990s, thanks to the inclusive dialogue for peace and the implementation of multisector 

projects (PPDC, PACM, PARCES, PUDC, etc.), some financed by AfDB (PPDC, P2RS, PROVALE) and 

IsDB (DRIARS, PROMISE, RRVCP etc.). To date, Ziguinchor port and airport are functional, the bridge 

over the Gambia River was completed in 2019 and the road network expanded with the rehabilitation of the 

Sénoba-Ziguinchor road. Therefore, the project comes to consolidate these gains by financing the requisite 

actions to attract private investment in agribusiness. The project will create 14,500 direct jobs and 35,000 

indirect jobs. It will benefit approximately 65,000 households, or about 365,000 people (51% women). It 

will target farmers and the private sector (including SMEs/SMIs) that can invest in agricultural processing 

and service delivery. Specific actions will target the youth and women to integrate them into the agricultural 

value chains. The construction of the agricultural hub infrastructure will be based on local labour. Enterprises 

will receive advisory support to provide decent jobs with basic social security. 

2.6 Participatory Approach to Project Identification, Design and Implementation 

2.6.1 The project design is based on a participatory and inclusive approach involving all stakeholders: 

technical services, producer organisations, women/youth groups, civil society, private sector, TFPs and 

projects. These broad-based consultations took place at all stages, including pre-feasibility and feasibility 

studies, sub-project or 'LAB' structuring workshops, and project preparation and appraisal missions. Under 

the supervision of BOS, the PEMANDU Big Fast Results method (the equivalent of BOS in Malaysia) was 

applied to allow full stakeholder participation through the LAB, which brought 150 participants from 96 



 

11 

structures (private sector, financial institutions, public sector, civil society, etc.) for a total of 10,500 hours 

of work. 

2.6.2  The process helped to (i) delimit the Agropole Sud scheme, with a focus on the priority sectors (mango 

and cashew); (ii) structure the priority sub-projects (public, PPP, and private) to be retained in the agricultural 

hub; (iii) decide on the creation of a Construction and Operations Company (SCE) of the hub in the form of 

a company under private law, in particular to implement the PPP sub-projects; iv) adopt the principle of 

mandating FONSIS to create the SCE, through a tripartite protocol agreement duly signed by FONSIS, BOS 

and MDIPMI. Furthermore, the involvement of various stakeholders has served to identify private investment 

opportunities to be mobilised, with a view to generating wealth, employment & youth entrepreneurship. 

2.6.3 At the project area level, working sessions brought together the territorial administration, local 

elected officials, technical services (agriculture, livestock, water and forestry, etc.), research institutes (ISRA, 

ITA, etc.), financial institutions (Banque Agricole, PAMECAS, ACEP), representatives of producers, civil 

society and certain projects. These working sessions served to (i) present the project's intervention strategy; 

(ii) share the technical choices and channels chosen; (iii) discuss the role of the project actors, gather the 

opinions of the actors and measure the interest of the beneficiaries and their level of accountability in project 

formulation, implementation and sustainability. This participatory approach will be continued during project 

implementation. 

2.7 Bank Group Experience and Lessons Reflected in Project Design 

2.7.1 As of 30 September 2019, the Bank's portfolio comprised twenty-nine operations for a total net 

commitment of UA 1,030 million. This amount is broken down as follows: UA 864.29 million for the public 

sector and UA167.14 million for the private sector. The sector breakdown of national public sector projects 

is as follows: transport (54.0%); water and sanitation (15.1%); rural (17.5%); ICT (6.0%); social (2.1%); 

energy (3.5%) and governance (1.8%). The portfolio performance of national public sector projects remains 

satisfactory with 3 out of 4. The project effectiveness has decreased on average from 9.4 months to 5 months 

between 2011 and 2019 and the average time from approval to meeting the conditions precedent to first 

disbursement has improved from 9.6 months in 2013 to 7 months in 2019. The disbursement rate is 26% for 

an average portfolio age of 3.5 years. Lastly, the public sector portfolio comprises 4 regional operations for 

UA 83.52 million (Senegal) and a disbursement rate of around 35%. 

2.7.2 The mid-term review of the CSP 2016-2020, combined with the portfolio review provided lessons and 

recommendations as follows: (a) For the Bank : i) strengthen Bank support to the private sector to enhance its 

competitiveness and contribution to growth (including through PZTA); ii) improve the project preparation 

quality by using the Project Preparation Fund (PPF); iii) increase the role of the Bank's country office in 

Senegal in project supervision and assistance to reduce file processing times; iv) support agricultural hub 

development projects; vi) improve the country's absorptive capacity by removing bottlenecks during project 

implementation (procurement, disbursement, M&E, etc.); (b) For the Government : i) strengthen project 

monitoring (Ministries of Economy, Finance, Industry); and ii) raise the level of domestic resource 

mobilisation in a context where 50% of AfDB public project financing must be sourced from counterpart 

funding.  

2.8 Key Performance Indicators  

2.8.1 The key performance indicators of the project's logical framework are: Impact Indicators: (i) the 

rural poverty rate; (ii) the per capita value of food imports and exports; (iii) the share of the agro-industrial 

sector in GDP; Outcome Indicators: (i) modern installed capacity of agricultural product processing; (ii) the 

proportion of agricultural products processed according to the required standards (mango, cashew, maize, 

and banana); (iii) the cumulative amount in USD million of private investments catalysed by agribusiness 



 

12 

(including SMEs/SMIs); (iv) additional decent direct/indirect jobs created/consolidated (of which 50% 

women and 60% youth); (v) change in the average annual income level of agricultural households (headed 

by women); (vi) agricultural production of key sectors; (vii) the number of jobs created/reinforced in the 

agricultural sector (of which 50% women and 60% youth). 

III. PROJECT FEASIBILITY  

3.1 Economic and Financial Performance  

3.1.1 The project is designed to generate direct spin-offs in the processing of targeted crops, through 
private agribusiness investments in Agropole Sud (i.e. about 60 units), which can reach 90 by the end of ten 

(10) years. Besides the spin-offs on the private companies established in the agricultural hub, the farms will 

reap substantial income by supplying companies with raw materials for the targeted crops, namely: cashew 

(over 10,000 ha), mango (over 5,500 ha), maize (over 5,000 ha) and banana (over 1,500 ha). In addition 

to these benefits generated by the project and reflected in the economic and financial analysis, there will be 

several others in terms of: (i) creation of temporary and permanent jobs estimated at around 180 per 

processing unit (about 14,500 in total); (ii) improving and increasing the production of non-timber forest 

products (such as baobab, honey, seeds and wild fruits, oils and resins, infusions , etc.); (iii) improving 

the quality of nutrition as a result of capacity building in food fortification and hygiene; (iv) improving access 

to index insurance; and (v) improving the quality of natural resource management through the application of 

smart agriculture, climate change adaptation, biogas energy production and forest cover restoration.   

3.1.2 Financial analysis: the bulk of the above benefits are not tradable or even tangible items, and thus 
do not lend themselves to a financial performance analysis based on existing markets.  As a result, it has not 

been considered appropriate to include them in quantitative analysis, based on a production model or profit-

making activities approach. However, it has been possible to perform a cost/benefit analysis of agribusiness 

and other agricultural production models (FARMOD), as indicated above. 

3.1.3 For agribusiness enterprises, an assumption is proposed based on four (4) types of processing units, 
namely micro, small, medium and large enterprises, with respective investments of CFAF 7 million, 15 

million, 1.345 billion and 15 billion each, according to the average of investment profiles in these kinds of 

models. In this case, the annual turnover per company is CFAF 3.95 million, 11.48 million, 782.10 million 

and 8.88 billion, respectively, for micro, small, medium and large units, from the fifth year, on an operating 

life of approximately 20 years. For agricultural crops from farms and suppliers of agribusiness companies in 

the parks, FARMOD-type production cost/benefit models (Input/Output, Project and No Project) over a 20-

year operating life were used. 

3.1.4 Thus, the financial analysis gave: (i) a financial impact of over CFAF 70.54 billion per year from 
the fifth year of operations expected over 20 years, according to the same type of operations, according the 

life of the investments. This implies that the financial benefits of the project over the period of operation 

exceed the cost of the investments needed to finance it; (ii) a cost/benefit ratio of 1.60, which means that the 

benefits are higher than the cost of the investments; (iii) an internal rate of return of 19.44 %, which is higher 

than the opportunity cost of capital (the capital cost of financial resources for investments in the project) is 

estimated at 12%. Based on these results, it can be concluded that the project presents a profitability profile 

justifying the cost of the investments financially. 

3.1.5 Economic analysis: the economic analysis was carried out using the reference price method, 
namely the prices under conditions of economic efficiency, according to the "Pareto" optimum. It was 

conducted based on the comparison between the "no project" and "project" situation of the production models 

presented in the financial analysis. In this model, tradable goods, i.e. goods likely to be the subject of 

commercial transactions beyond the country (FOB at the port and CIF at the Port of Marseille), are 



 

13 

considered. In this case, the reference prices of these products (economic prices) are evaluated based on the 

ex-ante balance of these crops enabling to obtain export parity prices at farm gate. The labour force was 

economically valued at 65% of its financial value of CFAF 1,800/day, to take into account the inelasticity of 

the labour demand in the country in general and in the project in particular. Based on realistic assumptions, 

the economic rate of return (ERR) of the programme was estimated at 20.14%, with a B/C ratio of 1.62. In light 

of these results, the overall project profitability is deemed satisfactory. 

IRR (baseline scenario) : 19.44% NPV Amount:  CFAF 301.39 billion  

ERR (baseline scenario) : 20.14% NPV Amount:  CFAF 298.21 billion 

3.1.6 Sensitivity analysis: the sensitivity tests conducted based on the reduction in production prices were 
used to measure the stability of the financial and economic performance indicators. Thus, the tests show that 

prices should be lowered to 54.17% (break-even or " switching value") to cancel out the additional benefits 

generated respectively at the financial and economic level, with IRR and ERR equal to the opportunity cost of 

capital, i.e. 12 %. This test shows that the programme profitability profile is robust, although it has not been 

performed on all endogenous values of the model. However, the price variable is of paramount importance since 

it is the only one that is beyond the control of programme management and operation. The summary of the 

sensitivity analysis is presented in the Technical Annexes (Volume II). 

3.2 Environmental and Social Impact 

3.2.1 Environment  

3.2.1.1 PZTA-Sud (Agropole Sud) is classified in Category I. Its classification is justified by the activities 

likely to cause major environmental and social impacts to the natural and human environment conceived as 

an agro-industrial development hub. This approach led to the separation of the agricultural hub infrastructure 

on sites covering the three regions and networking actors of the targeted value chains (producers, processing 

firms, aggregators, etc.). This classification is also justified by the fact that it could trigger all five operational 

safeguards. The documents presented are the Strategic Environmental and Social Assessment (SESA) and 

the SESA summary, which were finalised and posted on 1 August 2019.  

3.2.1.2 Negative impacts: The key negative impacts expected from the project are: (i) risks of 

deforestation; (ii) disfigurement of the landscape; (iii) proliferation of disease vectors (malaria); (iv) 

degradation of ecosystems (soil, wildlife and water resources); (v) waste generation; (vi) dust and smoke 

emission; and (vii) traffic accidents, etc. The planned mitigation measures include: (a) tree planting; (b) 

application of appropriate pesticide management measures; (c) strict control of the pesticides used; (d) 

elimination of expired pesticides; (e) training in integrated pesticide management; (f) producer awareness 

and training; and (g) watering the site, waste collection, etc. The estimated cost of the measures to be 
included in the Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) and entirely financed by the Bank is 

about CFAF 665,000,000.  

3.2.1.3 Positive impacts: The key positive impacts are: (i) business development; (ii) improved mango, 

cashew and maize cultivation; (iii) linking farmers to processing industries; (iv) direct and indirect 

employment for youth; and (vi) increased municipal revenue. The cost of enhancing environmental benefits 

is included in the cost of environmental and social measures. 

3.2.2 Social 

3.2.2.1 PZTA-Sud will have a positive social impact in the construction phase in terms of increasing the 

people's income through the use of local materials (stone, sand, gravel, laterite) and the purchase of materials 

on the local market (cement, wood, iron, etc.). The work will inject fresh money into local markets, which 

will contribute to the development of socio-economic activities. The work will also lead to the development 

of retail trade around construction sites. The supply of construction equipment and materials should boost 



 

14 

transactions in the villages. In the operations phase, there will be a partnership between the agricultural hub 

and the farmers. The agricultural hub operation should generate around 14,500 direct jobs and 35,000 indirect 

jobs by 2024. The agricultural hub could be a means of creating jobs in agribusiness, transport, logistics and 

services (accommodation, catering, etc.), which will improve market access and farmers' income. Therefore, 

strengthening the skills of actors involved in the cashew and mango sectors (producers, traders, transporters, 

etc.) should facilitate access to salaried jobs and the creation of self-employment, thus contributing to the 

fight against poverty, rural exodus and illegal emigration.  

3.2.3 Environmental and Social Management Framework Plan (ESMFP)  

3.2.3.1 The following mitigation measures are included in the ESMFP: (i) development and reforestation 

of the agricultural hub module sites; (ii) application of adequate pesticide management measures; (iii) strict 

control of pesticides used by farmers; (iv) disposal of expired pesticides; (v) training in integrated pesticide 

management; (vi) sensitisation and training of producers; and (vii) application of the Laws on the Protection 

of Wildlife and Soil Degradation, etc. The SESA recommends conducting an Environmental and Social 

Impact Assessment (ESIA) that will: (a) describe the biophysical characteristics of the environment in which 

the project activities will take place, and highlight the major constraints that need to be taken into account 

when preparing the land, building, installing equipment, and operating; (b) assess the potential environmental 

and social impacts of project activities and recommend appropriate mitigation measures including cost 

estimates; (c) evaluate needs regarding the collection of solid and liquid wastes, their disposal and 

management, and make recommendations; (d) conduct a review of national environmental policies, 

legislation, and administrative and institutional frameworks and donor safeguard policies, indicate which of 

these policies are applicable to project activities, identify any gaps that could exist and make 

recommendations to fill them. 

3.2.4 Involuntary Resettlement 

3.2.4.1 Regarding involuntary resettlement, there are legal safeguards to protect the rights of potential 

project-affected persons. Section 31 of Law No. 64-46 of 17 June 1964 on National Land provides that: 

"After the declaration of public utility, the compensation to be paid to affected persons is evaluated on 

specified bases by a commission chaired by the prefect or his/her representative and composed of local 

representatives of the ministries in charge of public works, economy, lands, and those of the communities 

and associations including the mayor of the municipality. The compensations are established taking into 

account exclusively the existing constructions, developments, plantations and crops in the affected area 

undertaken by the affected persons (Section. 32). Displaced persons will be assisted and supported in their 

efforts to improve and rebuild their livelihoods and standard of living. The standard of living of resettlement 

populations will be more favourable than the original situation. Although not a tool offered by the AfDB 

ISS, the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) is required as a precaution, to clarify the process whereby land not 

currently concerned by the project will be developed subsequently. The projected amount to cover the 

displacement and resettlement of affected persons is CFAF 1 300 million (from the counterpart funding).   

3.2.5 Climate Change 

3.2.5.1 Senegal, in its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), agreed to unconditionally reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions by 3%, 4% and 5% respectively in 2020, 2025 and 2030, compared to “business 

as usual” (BAU) emissions for those years. The project will contribute to Senegal's climate change policies, 

particularly for the agricultural sector, with a view to adapting it and achieving the mitigation objectives set 

out in its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), particularly at regional level (Ziguinchor, Kolda and 

Sedhiou).  



 

15 

3.2.5.2  The project is vulnerable to climate risk (classified as Category 2). For this reason, risk 

management and adaptation options have been incorporated into the project design. The sizing of the 

structures will be done taking into account the geotechnical and climatic conditions specific to each site. This 

involves adaptation and mitigation measures in the agriculture, forestry and other land use sectors. In this 

way, the project will support measures that will enable farmers to mitigate and increase their climate change 

adaptation and resilience through, among others: (i) capacity building of state services (ISRA) to produce 

resilient and high-yielding varieties (cashew, mango and maize); (ii) supporting farmer organisations for 

better access to efficient and resilient technologies; (iii) strengthening the quality of advisory support services 

to farmers (climate information, digital platform, etc.); (iv) facilitating access to index insurance for farmers; 

(iv) improvement and adaptation of plant and forest production techniques; (v) changes in agroforestry 

practices to sustainably improve the production, yields and income of agro-foresters; (vi) addition of quality 

and value to agricultural production through post-harvest operations (storage and primary processing 

facilities); and (vii) access to more profitable markets through investment provided for in the agricultural 

processing modules (central and regional).  

3.2.6 Gender  

3.2.6.1 The project is classified under Category 3 according to the Bank's Gender Marker System. It will 

be implemented in a social environment where gender inequalities persist and are exacerbated by the 

migration of men. This situation reinforces the triple role of women with its corollaries of work overload and 

poverty. Thus, the project will take into account the specific needs of women and men as well as youths of 

both sexes. The aim is to reduce the inequalities of access for women and men of all social categories to the 

opportunities offered by the agricultural hub. Actions to be taken include: (i) promoting a gender-sensitive 

regulatory and institutional framework; (ii) equity in implementing project activities, including a quota of 

50% of agricultural project aggregation/primary processing of women-run cooperatives and SMEs (project 

selection, training, financing, etc.); (iii) development of gender-sensitive infrastructure (childcare facilities, 

separate showers and toilets, secure and equipped with water, etc.); (iv) support for women's cooperatives 

and SMEs through the structuring of their businesses and adapted training (including functional literacy, 

financial inclusion, processing, storage and conservation of agricultural products, leadership, natural resource 

management, etc.); (v) promoting women’s inclusion and leadership in the committees set up/consolidated 

under the project (50% women); (v) a campaign/sensitisation to fight and prevent malnutrition; and (v) the 

recruitment of a social development and gender specialist based on the South Branch. The budget allocated 
for specific and gender-sensitive activities is EUR 6.3 million, or about 14% of the total amount. 

3.2.7 Nutrition and Health  

3.2.7.1 The Rural Survey of Food Security and Nutrition (ERASAN 2014) shows that households in food-

insecure rural areas account for 30% of the total (153,728 households), of which 12% are in a severe 

situation and 18% in a moderate situation. The rate of food insecurity is higher for female-headed households 

at 40.4% compared to 29.4% for men-headed households. The regions of Ziguinchor (63%), Sédhiou (52%) 

and Kolda (52%) have the highest rates of households with food insecurity. The project will ensure that the 

modules and platforms take into account the establishment of medical services to support the safety of users. 

The agreements to be signed with the research institutes, particularly the ITA for the Centre of Excellence, 

will ensure that the nutritional quality of the processed products are acceptable to the local population and 

the market. At community level, to ensure resilience, awareness and communication sessions for behavioural 

change in nutrition, health and hygiene will be supported by the project. For vulnerable groups such as 

women, activities to support processing for the local or divisional (“département”) market will be funded, 

which will increase their income. For better social inclusion, the youth and women who will be selected for 

the labour-intensive works during the constructions on the agricultural hub sites will come largely from the 

poorest households. To this end, the project will use the single national registry targeting community-based 

activities. These activities will be supported by partners already on site such, for instance the Malnutrition 



 

16 

Control Unit. To ensure greater inclusion, the labour-intensive works will target the most vulnerable youth 

and women. Index insurance for producers is also a social protection measure for inclusion purposes. 

3.2.8 Youth Training and Employment 

3.2.8.1 The mapping of vocational training institutions in the project area indicates the existence of several 

Vocational and Technical Training and Handicraft (FPTA) structures, of which thirteen (13) in Ziguinchor, 

seven (7) in Kolda and three (3) in Sedhiou (one of the structures is being established). The project will work 

with these centres to ensure that agribusinesses moving into the region will have on-site skilled labour for 

the different trades. The project will help create around 1,400 direct and 35,000 indirect jobs for youth and 

women in the region, during the construction phase (which will use labour-intensive techniques) and in the 

operation phase by the 60 companies expected on the different sites. The project will also address the key 

challenges related to youth entrepreneurship, namely access to land and finance and the acquisition of 

technical skills for managing agro-industrial enterprises. At the agricultural hub, there are plans to build four 

training halls which will facilitate the upgrading of the salaried and self-employed workforce. Close 

collaboration will be established with at least three vocational training centres in the region, such as 

Goudomp, which is being developed, particularly for the processing of cashew nuts and fruits. The business 

incubator to be established at the Adéane central module will enable the incubation of youth-initiated 

projects. As regards access to finance for SMEs, the project will carry out capacity building of at least three 

financial institutions to develop services tailored to the needs of agro-industrial enterprises, particularly those 

of youth. Furthermore, the project will collaborate with the Mastercard Foundation, which supports the 

vocational training institutes in the project area as well as SMEs to strengthen youth employability. 

3.2.9 Fragility and Resilience  

3.2.9.1. The Casamance Natural Region, the project's impact area, experienced an armed conflict in the early 

1980s, whose victims lived mainly in Sedhiou and Ziguinchor regions. The induced fragility endured over 

nearly four decades slowed public and private investment in the region and has increased the social divide 

and the feeling of social and spatial exclusion. However, the State has made substantial efforts to develop 

infrastructure in the transport, energy and social sectors (drinking water, health, education, etc.), and this has 

contributed significantly towards strengthening social cohesion at inter-regional and national level. That 

notwithstanding, much effort remains to be made to mitigate the effects of regional disparity, gender 

inequality and youth underemployment. This peculiarity of the region has been reflected in the project design 

by taking into account existing resilience capacity in communities to address drivers of fragility. To reinforce 

this fragile cohesion, the project will support the agricultural potential of each region and organise the 

targeted sectors to provide economic opportunities for women, youth and vulnerable segments of the 

population. The sensitive land issue for this region of the country was also considered through the 

participatory approach undertaken for the project in terms of land tenure security. Areas with high production 

cashew and mango plantations located along the border strip south of Casamance pose a risk for producers 

due to the presence of mines in some places. This threat, already covered by the government’s partners 

specialising in this aspect, will be regularly monitored by the project at the National Demining Centre, to 

ensure that producers operating in the above-mentioned area are protected from this risk (see Annex).

IV. IMPLEMENTATION  

4.1. Implementation Arrangements  

4.1.1 Institutional Arrangements 

4.1.1.1 The Project Executing Agency (AGEX) will be the Ministry of Industry through a Project 

Implementation Unit (PIU). A Steering Committee (COPIL) chaired by AGEX will be set up to: (i) formulate 

the strategic thrusts of the agricultural hub programme; (ii) review and approve the AWPB; and (iii) analyse 

and adopt activity reports (including financial reports) and audit reports. It will include representatives of the 

ministries in charge of the following portfolios: Planning and Cooperation, Finance, Agriculture, Trade, 

Gender and Social Affairs, Environment, Regional Planning, Health and Nutrition; as well as representatives 

of the Private Sector, the Sovereign Fund for Strategic Investments (FONSIS), Federations of Farmers' 

Organisations, Local Authorities, Consular Chambers and BOS/PSE. The PIU Coordinator will provide 

secretarial support to COPIL. 

4.1.1.2 The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) will be responsible for project coordination, implementation 

and monitoring. The PIU will be based in Dakar and will ultimately be in charge of the 3 agricultural hub 

(PZTA) projects (it will have 3 regional agencies corresponding to the three (3) agricultural hubs (South, 

Centre and North). However, only the Agropole Sud agency will be set up under this project. Specifically, 

the composition of the PIU includes the following staff: (i) a national coordinator; (ii) an agribusiness 

engineer ; (iii) a monitoring/evaluation specialist; (iv) a procurement specialist; (v) an administrative and 

financial officer; (vi) an investment and finance specialist ; (vii) a regional coordinator; (viii) an infrastructure 

engineer (regional); (ix) an agronomist specialised in agricultural sectors (regional); (x) and environmental 

safeguards specialist; (xi) a social safeguards specialist; (xii) 3 accountants (including one regional); (xiii) 3 

assistants (procurement, administration, monitoring/evaluation); and (xiv) support staff. The baseline survey, 

midterm surveys and the final evaluation of project outcomes and impacts will be conducted by consultants 

to be recruited (in conjunction with MEPC, BOS and ANSD). 

4.1.2  Procurement Arrangements 

4.1.2.1 All Bank-financed procurement of works, goods and consultants services under this project shall be 

carried out in accordance with the Procurement Policy for Bank Group-Funded Operations ("AfDB 

Procurement Policy"), October 2015 edition, and the provisions of the financing agreement. Pursuant to this 

policy and following the various evaluations conducted, all procurement listed in paragraph B.6.3.1 will be 

carried out  in accordance with the country's procurement system ("National System") enshrined in Decree 

No. 2014-1212 of 22 September 2014 on the Public Procurement Code (CMP), while all other procurement 

listed in paragraph B.6.3.2 will be carried out in accordance with the Bank Procurement Methods and 

Procedures (BPM), October 2015 edition, using the Bank's bidding documents (BDs). The use of the National 

System improves efficiency through the following actions, among others: i) better ownership of the 

procurement system to be used by the executing agency; ii) time saving with the absence of a second audit 

(after that of the national entities), namely the Bank’s ex-ante review. However, the Bank reserves the right 

to request the Borrower to revert to the use of the Bank System if: a) the legal framework of Senegalese public 

procurement system changes and becomes unsatisfactory to the Bank; b) the provisions in force were not 

respected by the Executing Agency; or c) the appropriate risk mitigation measures featuring in the Risk 

Assessment Action Plan were not observed. 

4.1.2.3 Advance contracting (AC): during the appraisal mission, the Government informed the Bank of 

its intention to request authorisation to use advance contracting for the selection of: (i) a firm specialised in 

human resources to be charged with recruiting the project team staff; and (ii) a technical assistance firm to 

support PIU. A request accompanied with a procurement plan shall be submitted to the Bank for opinion 



 

18 

before the project is presented to the Bank’s Board of Directors. 

4.1.2.4 Procurement Risk and Capacity Assessment (PRCA): to take project specificities into account, the 

Bank assessed: (i) risks at the national, sector and project level; and (ii) the capacity of the executing agencies. 

The findings of these assessments led to the conclusion that the procurement risk level was moderate and 

determined, subject to the application of the mitigation measures proposed in paragraph 5.9 of Annex B.6, 

the group of procurement to be carried out according to the Bank’s system and that likely to be carried out, 

without major risk, according to the National System. The planned contracts for works amount to 

approximately UA 27.307 million, for the various goods UA 5.162 million, and for consultancy services UA 

8.355 million. Details of these procurement arrangements are available in Annex B.3 of the appraisal report.  

4.1.3  Financial Management Arrangements  

4.1.3.1  In accordance with the provisions of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, the Bank, like most 

other TFPs, has agreed to maximise the use of country systems for project and programme management as 

far as possible. An assessment of the existing country financial and accounting management system was 

made during the appraisal mission and the required mechanism specified for the project. Thus, the financial 

management of the project will be carried out by the Project Implementation Unit (PIU), to be put in place by 

the MDIMPI in its capacity as the Project Executing Agency. The PIU personnel, which will be recruited on 

a competitive basis, will include among others a coordinator, an administrative and financial manager, an 

accountant and an accounting assistant. The current accounting system is accrual accounting on software 

enabling the recording of project operations. The software has the potential to handle multiple projects with 

budgeting, analytics and general modules, up to the production of financial statements. The project’s internal 

control will be formalised in an administrative, financial and accounting procedures manual to be drawn up 

once the project is put into effect by a consultant. PZTA-Sud will produce quarterly project monitoring and 

annual financial statements and submit them to the Bank after approval by the Project Steering Committee. 

The project financial and accounting audit will be conducted by an independent firm registered on the role 

of a national or regional order of Bank member countries. The audit firm will be recruited by Project 

Coordination for three years based on terms of reference approved by the Bank, and paid out of AfDB funds.   

 

4.1.4 Disbursement Arrangements  

4.1.3.1 Disbursements will be made in accordance with Bank rules and procedures. A special account will 

be opened in the books of a commercial bank to keep a portion of the loan resources. Three disbursement 

methods will be used: (i) the special account method for training, operating and other minor project expenses; 

(ii) the direct payment method for settling contracts and agreements for goods, works and services; and (iii) 

the reimbursement method for expenses chargeable to AfDB but settled with the resources from counterpart 

funding, with the Bank’s prior approval. Bank advances in the Special Account will be made based on the 

Annual Work Programme and Budget (AWPB) previously approved by the Bank. The State’s counterpart 

funding will be provided for in the State budget. 

4.2 Project Monitoring/Evaluation  

4.2.1 Technical and financial monitoring: the PIU will be responsible for collecting, analysing and 

compiling information on physical achievements and financial execution. To this end, it will have a scorecard 

with technical and financial indicators on the progress of the project. Such monitoring will serve to obtain 

the following information for each activity and with a half-yearly periodicity: physical target, level of 

achievement, expected costs, actual costs, gaps and explanations of any gaps. This information will be used 

for preparing the half-yearly project progress reports. Furthermore, in addition to the review work of the 

Steering Committee, the Bank will field two supervision missions per year, to which should be added a mid-

term review mission. 



 

19 

 

4.2.2  Impact assessment: the project impact assessment will be conducted through participatory surveys 

under the supervision of BOS/PSE. The baseline survey will determine the level of the following indicators 

in project year zero: (i) current average household income; (ii) annual production of key crops; (iv) industrial 

processing rate; (v) access to inputs, agricultural services and farmer financing; (vi) marketing performance; 

and (vii) volume of financing mobilised by SMEs/SMIs. The same survey will be conducted at project 

completion. 

4.3  Governance  

4.3.1  Senegal has enjoyed long-standing political stability supported by solid democratic institutions and 

demonstrated by the three peaceful democratic regime changes. Senegal ranks 66th out of 180 countries on 

Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index 2018 and 8th in Africa in the indicators "Safety and Rule 

of Law", "Participation and Human Rights" and "Transparency and Accountability" of the Mo Ibrahim Index of 

African Governance (IIAG) 2017. This good performance reflects the efforts of the various regimes towards 

establishing or strengthening key institutions such as the Court of Auditors, the State General Inspectorate (IGIE), the 

National Financial Information Processing Unit (CENTIF), the National Bureau for the Fight against Fraud and 

Corruption (OFNAC) and the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (ARMP), and the introduction of a 

requirement that senior officials must declare assets (2014). The business environment has improved significantly as 

reflected by its 18-place jump in the Doing Business 2020 rankings. However, progress is needed in terms of 

registering property, paying taxes, trading across borders and ease of access to these facilities outside of the capital.  

4.3.2  In view of the project area’s sensitivity and the project’s complexity, the governance of the South Agricultural 

Hub is of special interest to the Bank and the Senegalese authorities, both in its design/ development and operation 

phases. While promoting private sector interest in the area, such sensitivity to the low-intensity conflict that has affected 

Casamance1 is important. Therefore, the project design adopted a highly participatory process in line with the strategic 

thrusts of PSE. Applying the Big Fast Results (BFR) methodology enabled the involvement of all project stakeholders, 

including private companies, financing institutions, research centres, civil society and the administration, to agree on 

partnership arrangements for successful its implementation. 

4.3.3  This process resulted in the selection of the following options (technical annex): 

 The management of the agricultural hub is entrusted to a dedicated company. After an in-depth analysis of different 

PPP approaches, it was decided that a mandate will be granted to FONSIS to create a Construction and Operation 

Company (SCE). The composition of the capital of SCE will unify the stakeholders’ commitment and will include 

a public sector minority (FONSIS, regional authorities, etc.), and a private sector majority (strategic and financial 

investors, including major agribusinesses and producer federations).  

 The establishment of an ecosystem enabling the agricultural hub to have access to all the administrative and 

facilitation services in the South zone. In this regard, the project will establish close collaboration with the 

Ziguinchor Regional Investment Platform (PRI) so that its services can meet the needs of the hub’s investors. The 

Adeane central module will also include a specific one-stop shop for the agricultural hub, offering high-end 

services, complementary to those of the South PRI.   

4.4  Sustainability  

4.4.1 The project was designed in a participatory and integrated manner to ensure sustainability, thanks 

to the active involvement of the relevant State services in project implementation (ISRA, ITA, ANCAR, 

DRDR, FNDASP, etc.). Besides, the sectors identified by an analysis of the market potential were confirmed 

during stakeholder consultations (surveys, missions, workshops, Labs, etc.) among which, the private sector, 

producer organisations (POs) and the technical services of the State. In addition, the project was designed to 

                                                 
1  Rather than exacerbating the underlying causes of conflict, this should contribute towards consolidating the factors that foster peace and the economic and 

social inclusion of all parties. 



 

20 

consolidate the State in its facilitation role, the private sector in investment and POs in sustainably increasing 

agricultural productivity. Lastly, the project’s design takes into account the requisite conditions to ensure its 

sustainability, through the following measures : (i) inclusion of measures to improve the agro-industrial 

sector’s business ecosystem at the project area level (one-stop shop, support services, quality control services, 

financial services, agricultural insurance, etc.); (ii) establishment of basic infrastructure (site development, 

administrative buildings, social services, common areas, etc.) in the central module (acting as an agro-

industrial park), the three (3) regional modules and the five (5) aggregation platforms and services; (iii) the 

involvement of the private sector (leader) once the project is formulated, thus ensuring easier access to 

markets (domestic, regional and international), technologies and financing (particularly for POs and SMEs); 

(iv) support for the structuring and professionalisation of agro-industrial sectors by strengthening the 

technical and business management capacity of beneficiary groups (including those run by women and 

youth); (v) facilitating access to efficient plant material for the sustainable increase in productivity and 

agricultural production of the main sectors (mango, cashew and maize). 

4.5  Risk Management  

4.5.1 Potential risks and mitigation measures have been identified and taken into consideration (see table 

and logical framework). They will be refined and finalised during the appraisal mission. 

Risks Risk Level Mitigation Measures/Actions  

Risk 1: Lack of interest by the 

private sector could limit 

investment  

  

High Mitigation 1: (i) the private sector will be regularly consulted; 

(ii) the PIU will put in place basic infrastructure (including one-

stop shop); (iii) SCE will facilitate the implementation of 

private sub-projects; (iv) access to credit facilities will be put 

in place; and (v) non-tariff barriers will be applied as needed.  

Risk 2: Climate change, discharges 

from industrial units and harmful 

practices of the population may 

degrade natural resources  

Moderate Mitigation 2: The use of resilient technologies, planned 

environmental and social safeguards, access to markets and 

agricultural insurance will mitigate climate change impacts and 

industrial risks. 

Risk 3: The expected benefits 

(including land) could be hijacked 

by a minority 

Moderate Mitigation 3: The measures included in the SESA (including 

the ESFMP), the ESFMP/RAP, and the project’s IEC 

programme should mitigate this risk. 

Risk 4: Delays in project 

implementation due to inadequate 

understanding of Bank procedures 

High Mitigation 4: Institutional support and regular training will be 

provided to the PIU, AGEX, and the Borrower (Ministries of 

Finance, Economy)  

 

4.6  Knowledge Building  

4.6.1 PZTA-Sud differs from the value chain projects usually financed by the Bank in the country, mainly 

in view of the following innovations: the targeting of value chains with market potential, the promotion of 

private investment in agribusiness (facilities, incentives, etc.), and support to actors in targeted sectors. These 

innovations will be subject to documented monitoring/evaluation and leveraged to determine the lessons 

learned by the State, the private sector and other priority sector actors. The State and the Bank will take into 

account the lessons learned during the exchange of experiences with regional member countries. The lessons 

learned will be consolidated in the project completion report.
