B.   Introduction and Context

Country Context
Djibouti is extremely water scarce with conditions set to be exacerbated by population growth and 
climate change. As a consequence, access to safe drinking water is a daily challenge for the 
majority of the population, particularly for people living in rural areas. Poverty and food 
insecurity affect more or less the entire country and both are recognized to be highly correlated 
with water access issues. The extreme aspect of the geo-climatic profile leads to low erratic 
annual rainfall that averages hardly 150 mm, to the absence of perennial surface freshwater flow, 
and to the slow renewing of its aquifers. The current situation shows that more than 70 percent of 
the rural population and its herds do not have access to water within a reasonable distance. During 
the three-to four-month dry season, pastoral households are subject to the lack of access to water 
that represents a major constraint to human and livestock mobility, and to the proper use of the 
limited and sparsely distributed agro-pastoral resources.
Sectoral and institutional Context
Climate change impacts are projected to exacerbate these already precarious water resource 
challenges. Climate change is expected to induce an increase of the temperatures by 1.7-2.1 C by 
2050, while precipitation is set to decrease by 4-11 percent . This could lead to an increase of both 
severity of dry spells and intensity of wet extremes, thus accelerating land degradation, floods and 
erosion. Sea level rise is also projected to further exacerbate these impacts through saltwater 
intrusion of coastal aquifers. 
 
The Government of Djibouti (GoD) considers securing access to water and energy as the foremost 
major challenges that are prerequisites to reducing poverty and ensuring a nation-wide sustainable 
socio-economic development. To tackle the country’s structural gap in water resources demand 
and supply, the GoD is in quest of support from key partners for the development of non-
conventional water resources mobilization facilities including desalination plants, sewage water 
treatment plants and transboundary water transfer from Ethiopia.

C.  Proposed Development Objective(s)

Original Project Development Objective(s) - Parent
The objective of the Project is to increase access of rural communities to water and enhance their 
capacity to manage water and agro-pastoral resources in the project areas using a participatory 
approach to community-based development.

Key Results 
� Increase in the number of rural households with access to drinking water within a 
reasonable travel time (two hours round trip) in the project areas   
� Increase in the number of heads of livestock with access to water within a reasonable 
distance (20 km radius) in the project areas; 
� Increase in available grazing biomass  in the targeted rangelands in the project areas.  
� Communities in the project areas are organized in community-based structures (CPLs, 
CGEPs and women/fishermen associations) that actively prepare and implement SAAHPs

� Beneficiaries that feel project investments reflect their needs

D.  Project Description

The AF-2 investments will aim to upscale up activities under the parent project to surrounding 
naturally and socially linked pastoral areas, including (i) Community investments (water 
mobilization and soil conservation; agriculture, livestock and Fisheries development; and income-
generating activities), (ii) capacity building and technical assistance and (iii) Project management 
and coordination.

Component Name
Priority Community Investment Subprojects
Comments (optional)
The proposed AF-2 would finance US$4.0 million (57%), to scale-up existing activities, e.g. 
priority community investment sub-projects. The funding covers consultant services for carrying 
out the detailed design and supervision, as well as goods and civil works for the implementation 
and the operation of the community sub-projects. Community investments will be demand-driven 
and will comprise the following sub-projects: (i) water mobilization and soil conservation; (ii) 
agriculture, livestock and Fisheries; and (iii) income-generating activities.

Component Name
Capacity Building and  Provision of Technical Assistance
Comments (optional)
A total of US$1.6 million (23%) will be allocated to scale-up existing activities, e.g. capacity-
building activities and the provision of technical assistance. the AF-2 will finance capacity-
building activities for the PMU, the grassroots organizations such as Water Users Associations 
(WUA) and community groups to support the formulation and the implementation of 
participatory schemes, while improving local contingency planning to better face the impact and 
challenges in the aftermath of extreme events. The component will sensitize and mobilize 
beneficiary communities and other stakeholders to facilitate effective involvement in the planning 
and the project implementation process as well as their awareness on nutrition, sanitary and water 
quality issues. The use of ICT.

Component Name
Project Coordination and Management
Comments (optional)
A total of US$1.1 million (15.7%) will be allocated to further support project coordination and 
management activities. This component will support the PMU through the provision of goods, 
works, consultant services, training and incremental operating costs associated with project 
management, implementation, monitoring and evaluation, and audits. Incremental costs to be 
financed include incremental contractual staff costs, office rehabilitation works, equipment and 
operations, transportation equipment and operations, and domestic travel, to name a few.

E.  Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis (if known)

The geographic targeting principles of the proposed AF-2 area of interventions consist mainly in 
scaling-up the activities of the parent project in the neighbor pastoral areas and new fishing areas, 



Page 4 of 8

while consolidating current achievements in the already covered areas. The unit of project 
intervention is based on traditionally recognized local communal grazing areas or "parcours", 
shared by a particular group of localities and communities who possess traditional grazing rights 
over a common area of rangeland. In total, the project area will cover in addition to the 12 
"parcours" already covered by the parent project, six additional with the AF-2 financing: three in 
Obock, (Fididiss-Allaylou, Moulhoulé-Andoli, and Saday-Waddi), one in Tadjoura (Garabtissam-
Balho) and two in Dikhil (Kori-Gagadé and Dawdaya-Der Ela). Two additional fisheries sites will 
also be included in the project areas, e.g. Goubet and Arta-Plage. The extension of PRODERMO 
project activities to the socially linked neighbor pastoral routes  and new fishing areas through 
additional financing will not require additional environmental assessment beyond that which is 
already provided in the current Environmental and Social Impact Assessment Framework 
(ESIAF) prepared for PRODERMO. The existing Environmental and Social Management 
Framework (ESMF) will be updated to address issues related to agricultural inputs, to ensure 
proper management and minimize any adverse impacts.

II. Implementation
Institutional and Implementation Arrangements
No changes are introduced to the institutional, implementation, procurement, or financial 
management arrangements. The Ministry of Agriculture, Water, Fisheries, Livestock and Halieutic 
Resources (MAEPERH) through its existing PMU will continue to be the implementing agency 
responsible for the AF-2 implementation. As indicated previously, the PMU’s Regional Office 
located in Obock, Tadjourah and Dikhil will be reinforced with Staff and vehicles in order to support 
the implementation of the AF-2 activities in the new and additional project area. The other entities 
involved in the AF-2 implementation include the beneficiary communities organized into 
Community Management Committees (CGEPs); the Local Development Committee (CPLs); and 
other community groups, as well as the existing National Steering Committee which was established 
under the original project.

IV. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify 

and describe any potential large scale,  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
While the project might not have significant or irreversible negative impacts, the main risks can be 
controlled by the design and the operation of sub-projects. Groundwater depletion through 
increased used of boreholes can be mitigated through close groundwater monitoring and strict 
adherence to defined recharge regimes.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities 
in the project area:
There are no expected long-term negative social impacts.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse 
impacts.
N/A

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
Under the parent project and the AF-1, the recipient has satisfactorily implemented the 
requirements of the existing ESMF. The project has designated focal points for the Environmental 
and Social Management Plan (ESMP) implementation in the regions where the project is being 



Page 6 of 8

implemented. Beneficiary communities have also received training on Environmental and Social 
requirements in order to ensure that implementation continues along the various levels of the 
project. Environmental and social screening is carried out regularly with the requisite 
documentation. The PMU prepares monthly reports on the implementation of the Environmental 
and Social Management Framework (ESMF) requirements and shares these with the Bank for 
review. 
 
The project triggers OP/BP 4.01. To meet the requirements of the policy, the recipient has 
prepared an ESMF. The ESMF outlines the screening procedures for the sub-projects, as well as 
the institutional implementation arrangements. 
The project does not trigger OP/BP 4.12. For the parent and the AF-1 operations, the recipient 
prepared documentation tools to ensure that choice and mobilization of land parcels are voluntary 
and participatory.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure 
on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The revised ESMF was consulted upon in 18 localities, one for each pasture, including women.

Appraisal Review Decision 
(from Decision Note)

I. Project Context
Country Context
With GNI per capita of US$1,269 (2014), the Kyrgyz Republic is one of the low income economies 
of the Europe and Central Asia Region. In 2014, approximately 30.6% of the population lived 
below the poverty line, with the incidence of poverty slightly higher in rural area than in urban 
areas (32.6% vs. 26.9%). Economic growth in the country has been quite volatile. GDP growth was 
6% in 2011 but contracted to 0.9% in 2012, owing to a sharp drop in gold output. In 2013, the 
economy grew at a whopping 10.9%, but slowed to 3.6% in 2014 and remained at 3.5% at the end 
of 2015. The narrow export base is dominated by gold, with agricultural products representing on 
average 16% of total exports from 2009 to 2013. The economy is highly vulnerable to external 
shocks, in particular many households depend on remittances from the energy-based economies of 
Russia and Kazakhstan. It is partially dependent on wheat imports from Kazakhstan and the past 
global food price shocks quickly transmitted to the country. The official unemployment rate in the 
country has hovered below 10% for the past decade, however mostly on account of significant

outmigration of labor force (predominantly men, a majority from rural areas) to Russia and 
Kazakhstan. The recent economic difficulties of Russia and the strong devaluation of the ruble have 
negatively affected the earnings of the migrants and their remittances to their families in 
Kyrgyzstan.

  

Sectoral and institutional Context
Agriculture is an important sector for the Kyrgyz Republic’s economy and livestock production is a 
major livelihood support system for rural people. Agriculture represents about 15% of GDP, and it 
is still a major employer, providing more than a third of jobs. The sector’s growth rate in 2015 was 
a relatively high 6.2%. Agriculture is a key priority for the government because of its contribution 
to poverty reduction and rural employment. Livestock production, which accounts for about 50% of 
the agricultural GDP, is dominated by household and small farm production. It is important for 
rural household food security, nutrition, regular income generation, and acts as a social safety net 
with animals sold in times of hardship and economic distress. The primary land use of the country 
is native pasture production (87% of the total land is under pastures), which provides an advantage 
for livestock-based livelihood and food security for the rural population.  
 
With the accession of the Kyrgyz Republic to the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), the country’s 
agriculture sector is facing new challenges, and also new opportunities. The Kyrgyz Republic 
became a full member of the EAEU in May 2015. The EAEU includes Russia and Kazakhstan, 
which are the Kyrgyz Republic’s main export markets. However, since 2012, a partial dairy export 
ban has been in force, limiting the number of dairy exporters to seven (more information in 
paragraph 7 below). The Kyrgyz dairy producers and processors may be unable to capitalize on new 
market opportunities due to their inability to meet the animal health, food safety and quality 
standards of the EAEU. However, Kyrgyz dairy products benefit from a reputation of better taste 
due to the production model based on natural pastures. Addressing current constraints in the Kyrgyz 
dairy sector would allow to capitalize on new market opportunities, as well as on the achievements 
and initiatives of the previous and ongoing projects in the agriculture sector.  
 
Market opportunities for Kyrgyz milk and dairy products. The demand for Kyrgyz dairy products, 
in particular in Kazakhstan, is significant. Even though the border is closed to most of the official 
dairy exports (only seven companies can export dairy products to Kazakhstan), informal trade is 
booming. While the official value of exports of milk/dairy products in 2012 was US$30 million 
(equivalent to 4% of the annual milk production volume), the unofficial export revenues were 
closer to US$ 100 million (14% of the milk production volume). Russia is also considered a 
potentially large export market for dairy products (in particular, cheese). Once milk quality is 
upgraded, exporting to other countries (such as China, Afghanistan and Pakistan) should be 
possible.  
 
The Kyrgyz dairy sector is primarily dependent on smallholder private dairy units with an average 
herd size of 3-5 heads of cattle. Around 60% of the rural population own livestock, but the average 
herd size tends to be small. Milk is an important part of the diet and around 90% of the population 
consume dairy products regularly. In value terms, milk is one of the top five agricultural products of 
the country. Per capita availability of milk is around 193 kg and 25% of the milk produced is 
surplus, for processing and export. It should be noted, however, that farmers who keep animals do 
not consider themselves dairy farmers (animals are rather considered a subsistence livelihood 
source), and the animal breeding and management practices are poor, which accounts for low dairy

sector productivity. 
 
Livestock productivity is low compared to countries with similar production conditions. 
Furthermore, productivity has been declining from 2,041 kg in 2009, to 2023 kg in 2012 and 2, 013 
kg in 2013.  Many factors cause this low productivity at the farm level: inadequate on-farm animal 
health management, poorly equipped laboratories and disease diagnostic services, irregular and 
incomplete vaccinations, low breed stock (genetic) quality, absence of sustainable breeding policies 
and practices, inadequate feeding, improper shed maintenance, and farm hygiene issues, overall 
poor knowledge of animal husbandry techniques, low level of investments into production and 
marketing infrastructure. Addressing these issues can significantly increase both the productivity 
and total output of milk, which would contribute to increasing producers’ incomes and help address 
the sourcing problems faced by dairy processors. Processors experience a shortage of clean and 
high quality milk, and as a result underutilize their processing capacities and forego additional 
incomes that could come from exporting to other countries, and primarily, to the neighboring 
Kazakhstan. Export bans have a multiplier effect, as they affect not only the processors but also the 
milk-selling farmers and households and other players in the value chain.  
 
The Kyrgyz Dairy Sector Development Program (KDSDP) was initiated with support from IFC’s 
advisory program in 2015, to help the country capitalize on market opportunities presented by the 
EAEU. The Program is designed to help ensure steady milk exports to Kazakhstan (and other 
countries) through a dairy value chain approach, which would enable farmers to receive steady and 
increased incomes for the milk. It has already started working by supporting dairy processors in 
Issyk-kul Region. However, issues related to animal health and low productivity continue to persist. 
To make value chain development successful, it is imperative that on-farm improvements as well as 
necessary public sector investments are supported to ensure high quality and increased volume of 
milk. Thus, the KDSDP has grown into a comprehensive program addressing the various 
bottlenecks affecting the dairy value chain. The program covers all aspects of the dairy value chain: 
cattle breed improvement, animal feed improvement, improvements of animal productivity and 
milk quality, extension education and outreach services, animal health and hygiene, milk collection 
upgrades, laboratory, disease diagnosis and testing capacity (animal disease control, food safety and 
milk quality) upgrades, processing capacity upgrades, food safety standard upgrades, enabling 
regulatory framework, and export promotion.

II. Proposed Development Objectives
The Development Objective of the Project is to enhance dairy animal productivity and milk quality 
on beneficiary farms.

III. Project Description
Component Name
Component 1: Strengthening Public and Private Services in the Dairy Sector
Comments (optional)
This component would contribute to the program development objective by improving the public-
private dialogue on private sector development issues, and by supporting the improvements in the 
breed stock (genetic quality) of the dairy cows. This component would focus on the following 
activities: (i) Improving the Public-Private Dialogue; (ii) cattle identification and registration in 
Issyk-kul Region; (iii) Establishment of a World Organization for Animal Health-certified Zone

Islamic Development Bank); and (iv) Support to Artificial Insemination (AI) Service Providers.
Component Name
Component 2: On-farm Productivity Enhancement
Comments (optional)
During Phase I, the Model Dairy Village (MDV) concept would be introduced, determining the 
locations of the MDV service points, and providing the initial support to these services. The 
component would start with the most-needed services (which could be a veterinarian, an AI office, a 
milking center, a milk collection point, etc.). It would work predominantly with groups of 
beneficiaries. It would provide training, demonstrations and advice to farmers on good animal 
breeding practices, including: (i) fodder production and feeding management; (ii) animal husbandry 
and farm management, including (a) animal housing, general management and handling; (b) animal 
health, farm hygiene & clean milk production; (c) breeding management; and (d) manure 
management; and (iii) milk cooling and handling.

Component Name
Component 3: Farm-level Investments
Comments (optional)
Phase I would finance: (i) a US$ 1.2 million Revolving Fund to facilitate access to finance for small 
farmer for the purchase of inputs and small equipment; and (ii) technical assistance and capacity 
building to project beneficiaries to enable them to access existing financing programs.

Component Name
Component 4: Project Management
Comments (optional)
The component would cover the costs associated with project management, including Monitoring 
and Evaluation for the project implementation, as well as the establishment and maintenance of the

V. Implementation
The Ministry of Agriculture and Melioration (MOAM) and the Ministry of Finance (MOF) would 
be the Implementing Agencies for the project. Both Ministries have prior extensive experience with 
implementation of Bank-financed projects.  
 
The Agribusiness Competitiveness Center (ABCC) reporting to MOAM, and the Credit Line 
Management Unit (CLMU) at MOF would be responsible for implementation of the technical 
assistance and credit line activities, respectively. Both implementing units have extensive

experience in implementing Bank-financed projects. The technical assistance activities 
(Components 1 and 2) would be implemented through the ABCC, which has been successfully 
implementing technical assistance activities in the agriculture sector in three Bank-financed projects 
(Agribusiness and Marketing Project, Agricultural Productivity Assistance Project, and the JSDF-
financed Support to the Community Seed Funds Project). The Revolving Fund for farmers, farmer 
associations, agro-processors and traders would be managed by the CLMU which has successfully 
managed credit lines in three previous Bank-financed projects (Rural Finance II Project, 
Agribusiness and Marketing Project, and Agricultural Productivity Assistance Project).  Similar to 
the previous projects, procurement functions for the proposed project would be carried out by 
ABCC and the overall Financial Management would be the responsibility of CLMU. Safeguards 
support would be the responsibility of the ABCC. ABCC would also open a regional office in Issyk-
kul, where the technical staff and Environmental Specialist would be located. Both PMUs, but, in 
particular, ABCC would closely liaise with the other projects under the KDSDP, to ensure that all 
necessary activities are implemented, and no duplications occur.  
 
A Steering Committee would be set up to provide strategic guidance for project implementation, as 
well as ensure that key issues that need to be resolved are brought to the attention of the 
Government and their resolution facilitated. The Steering Committee would consist of 
representatives of the Prime Minister’s Office, MOAM, Ministry of Economic Regulation, MOF, 
Issyk-kul Oblast Governor’s Office, and private sector representatives. 
 
A consulting firm with international experience in dairy sector development, in particular, in 
working with farmers to improve on-farm productivity and milk quality, would be contracted under 
the project to support project implementation. The consultants would have the following main 
responsibilities: (i) identify the locations for the service points for the Dairy Model Villages 
(Component 2); (ii) provide training-of-trainers to local consulting companies that would train 
farmers in the project area (Component 2); (iii) provide advisory services to individual larger 
farmers; or groups of farmers, on specific areas related to the improvement of milk quality and 
quantity on beneficiary farms (Component 2); and (iv) assist ABCC in coordinating the project 
activities with other activities of the program, in particular, those financed by IsDB and other donors 
(Component 1 and Component 4).  
 
In addition, local consulting companies and/or NGOs would be hired under the project to ensure 
outreach to farmers, training and advisory services on the ground (under Component 2).  
 
Finally, a local consulting company or NGO experienced in group mobilization and group lending 
arrangements would be hired under the project to provide the necessary training to the groups of 
beneficiaries of the Revolving Fund, as well as help with ensuring collection of repayments due to 
the Revolving Fund (Component 3).

 Country and Sector Background 

Moldova has experienced rapid growth and poverty reduction over the past decade, 

although deterioration in external conditions and increased governance challenges since 

2014 have led to slower growth. Since the early 2000s, the economy has expanded by an 

average of 5 percent a year. Poverty declined substantially to 11 percent in 2014 from 26 

percent in 2007 (using the national poverty line) and from much higher levels earlier in the 

decade. Consumption growth among the bottom 40 percent of the population w as consistently 

higher than average consumption growth. Since 2014, however, external conditions have 

deteriorated significantly with the slowdown in the European Union (EU) and the Russian 

Federation on which Moldova is dependent for trade and remittances. This, together with a 

series of summer droughts and increased governance challenges, particularly in the financial 

sector, have resulted in slower growth in Moldova. The economy contracted by 0.5 percent in 

2015 and public and guaranteed debt increased to 46.6 percent of gross domestic product 

(GDP) from 38.2 percent a year earlier. A rebound in agriculture, in 2016, together with recent 

reforms are helping Moldova respond to adversity. Growth is projected to improve modestly to 

2.2 percent in 2016. 

Progress in poverty reduction has been driven largely by remittances and pensions, with 

the reform program supported by DPO-2 taking initial steps toward addressing the 

medium-term challenge of shifting toward greater sustainability. Remittances have made a 

significant contribution to domestic income, which has fueled private consumption and, 

together with exports, driven economic growth. Remittances, mainly going to rural areas where 

many of the poor are, have also contributed to poverty reduction and the welfa re improvement 

of the bottom 40. Pensions have also played an important role in raising incomes among the

population, although mainly in urban areas. At the same time, employment has declined, led by 

falling labor force participation rates among both men and women which have reached very 

low levels compared to other countries. This declining labor supply is largely explained by a 

combination of greater emigration flows, the segment of the inactive labor force who have 

future migration plans, and informal workers who drop out of the labor force, all symptoms of 

low labor demand and limited availability of productive jobs. In fact, the lack of jobs and the 

wage differential with richer neighboring countries continue to motivate emigration. Going 

forward, the reforms to improve the business climate, enhance financial sector stability, and 

improve expenditure efficiency should help Moldova move toward a more sustainable model 

of growth and poverty reduction driven by private sector job creation. 

European integration has anchored the government’s policy reform agenda since 2009, 

but political instability and governance challenges have slowed the pace of reform.  
Negotiations between Moldova and the EU on an Association Agreement and a Deep and 

Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement began in 2010 and were concluded on June 27, 2014, 

with the signing of both documents. Visa-free access for Moldovan citizens travelling to the 

Schengen area went into effect in April 2014. However, periodic breakdowns in pro -European 

coalitions made progress uneven. Governance challenges have continued to take the center 

stage, as exemplified by the banking fraud revealed in 2014 that involved the loss of the 

equivalent of over 10 percent of the country’s GDP. After a period of short -lived governments, 

the Government of Mr. Filip was appointed in January 2016, dedicating policy efforts on 

stabilizing the macroeconomic situation, increasing transparency, and addressing identified 

weaknesses in the financial sector. 

The proposed operation supports the efforts of the Moldovan authorities to address key 

constraints to inclusive and sustainable growth by consolidating reform efforts in three 

areas. Accordingly, the proposed operation is built around three pillars, which are also the 

program development objectives. The first pillar of the operation seeks to strengthen the 

regulatory framework to improve predictability of the business environment, fac ilitate 

competition, and reduce regulatory compliance costs. The second pillar aims at strengthening 

financial sector stability, promoting transparency of shareholding, and easing conditions for 

access to finance. The third pillar, focusing on the quality of public spending, seeks to improve 

the public investment management (PIM) framework, make investment subsidies in agriculture 

more efficient and equitable, and improve the coverage of well-targeted social assistance 

programs. The reform program builds on strong complementarity with other World Bank 

Group instruments in Moldova, including investment projects and analytical and advisory 

activities. In addition, although not a formal continuation of the previous program, the first two 

pillars of this series support the implementation of select laws supported by the 

Competitiveness DPO (approved in FY2013). 

 Operation Objectives 

The proposed DPL series supports the Government of Moldova's to improve the business 

climate, promote financial sector stability and development, and improve the equity and 

efficiency of public expenditure. The proposed operation is the second in a planned 

programmatic series of two single-tranche operations supporting key policy and institutional 

reforms with three development objectives: 



 Pillar A: Strengthen the regulatory framework to improve predictability of the business 
environment, facilitate competition and reduce regulatory compliance costs. 

 Pillar B: Strengthen financial sector stability, promote transparency of shareholding and ease 
conditions for access to finance. 

 Pillar C: Improve the public investment management framework, make investment subsidies 
in agriculture more efficient and equitable and improve the coverage of well-targeted social 

assistance programs. 

The Pillar A seeks to improve the business environment facing Moldovan companies and 

farms. Supported measures aim to reduce the burden of regulatory and compliance costs of state 

inspections and to enhance competition and to set up an institutional mechanism for information 

collection on all state aid to increase transparency on how state aid is granted and contribute to a 

more efficient use of state budget resources. 

The objective of the Pillar B is to support the Moldovan authorities to build a more 

sustainable, resilient, and transparent financial sector that can prudently expand access 

to financial services. The policy actions address priority reforms in the areas of the corporate 

shares registry, the integrity of shareholders’ ownership rights, corporate gover nance 

standards, shareholder transparency, and proper supervision by NBM and NCFM. Reforms 

under this pillar are also aimed at enhancing access to finance, which continues to constrain 

private sector development, especially for SMEs and entrepreneurs. 

Pillar C focuses on improving the public investment management framework, making 

investment subsidies in agriculture more efficient and equitable and improving the 

coverage of well-targeted social assistance programs. Existing inefficiencies and inequities 

in the allocation and implementation of public investment resources, including in the 

agriculture sector, and the erosion of coverage in well-targeted social assistance programs 

reduce the effectiveness of public spending for reaching national strategic objec tives, poverty 

reduction and promoting shared prosperity. Transforming the economy will require significant 

upgrades in infrastructure through public investments. Moreover, adequate appraisal of 

investment projects ensures cost effectiveness. Agricultural support to small or individual 

farmers is still modest, and does not reflect their current and potential role in high -value 

agricultural production. 

 Rationale for Bank Involvement 

This operation (second in a programmatic series of two) supports efforts of the 

Government to improve the business climate, promote financial sector stability and 

development, and improve the equity and efficiency of public expenditure, and is aligned 

with the National Development Strategy “Moldova 2020” (NDS). The three pillars of the 

operation directly support three of the eight national priorities in the NDS: “improving the 

business climate” (supported by Pillar A), “reducing financing costs” (supported by Pillar B), 

and “ensuring competitiveness of agro-food products” (supported by Pillar A and C). In 

addition, improving the public investment management framework is expected to contribute to 

efficiency of public spending, and ultimately, to growth. Increasing the coverage of well -

targeted social assistance programs is expected to contribute to poverty reduction and to 

increase shared prosperity, while maintaining fiscal sustainability. The reforms supported in 

this DPL series are informed by substantial technical assistance and analytical work. This 



includes both recently completed and ongoing activities, with strong collaboration with other 

development partners. 

This operation is a key component of the CPS for FY14-17. The CPS discussed by the 

Board in September 2013 includes three pillars: (i) Increasing competitiveness; (ii) En hancing 

human capital and minimizing social risks; (iii) Promoting a green, clean, and resilient 

Moldova. The DPO operation will directly support the first pillar of the CPS, improving 

economic competitiveness. It will also contribute to the second pillar (minimizing social risks) 

by strengthening the efficiency of the social assistance system. In addition, reforms aiming at 

making public expenditure more efficient and equitable support the cross -cutting governance 

theme of the CPS.

 Institutional and Implementation Arrangements 

The reform program supported by this operation builds on strong complementarily with 

other World Bank Group instruments in Moldova, including investment projects and 

analytical and advisory activities. The operation is complemented in each area by technical 

assistance and investment lending. TA in investment climate reform and competition policy 

has strongly informed the policy reforms in these areas. On the investment side, the 

Competitiveness Enhancement Project II, complements the DPO series with Regulatory 

Reform, SME Development and Access to Finance components. The World Bank Group’s 

Competition Policy Team provided technical assistance to the Competition Council to help 

implement the state aid registry. Reforms in the financial sector are also supported by the 

programmatic technical assistance. Reforms in public investment management are supported 

by technical assistance under the programmatic Public Expenditure Review and the Trust Fund 

for Strengthening Public Investment Management. In social assistance, the DPO complements 

the on-going Strengthening the Effectiveness of the Social Safety Net results-based SIL.  

 Risks and Risk Mitigation 

The overall risks to this operation are substantial. Key risks are: (i) political and 

governance; (ii) macroeconomic; (iii) sector policies and institutions and (iv) institutional 

capacity for implementation and sustainability. The overall risk rating level of the proposed 

DPO is substantial. To partially mitigate these risks, the Bank team has consulted with 

Parliamentarians as many proposed policy measures require parliamentary passage. In 

addition, the policy actions across all three pillars of this operation help increase transparency 

and promote good governance. Finally, development partners, including the International 

Monetary Fund and the European Commission remain engaged in policy dialogue, technical 

assistance, awareness campaigns and financing (including three-year IMF EEF program  

 Poverty and Social Impacts (PSI) and Environmental Aspects 

The policies and reforms supported by the operation are expected to have positive 

distributional and gender impacts and thus help reduce poverty and promote shared 



prosperity. Pillar C will make fiscal policy more equitable and efficient and therefore have a 

direct effect on poverty reduction and the promotion of shared prosperity. Pillars A and B will 

contribute to the twin goals indirectly by helping provide opportunities for business growth, 

supporting fair and transparent institutions and improving the functioning of financial markets, 

thereby enabling higher growth. No measure is expected to have negative distributional or 

gender impacts. Measures under pillar A are expected to promote employment growth in 

sectors that have a high share of women’s employment such as agriculture (which accounts for 

27.3 percent of women’s employment) and services, where the largest share of employed 

women works. 

Among the measures expected to have a direct positive impact on poverty, the measures 

to increase the inclusion of small farms in the agriculture support program are expected 

to be pro-poor and to contribute to strengthen the livelihoods of the rural poor.  According 

to the 2011 agricultural census overall most corporate subsidy recipients are large farms, with 

30 percent of all corporate farms receiving subsidies against 7 percent of individual farms. For 

both individual and corporate farms, the share of subsidy recipients is slightly lower among 

female-headed than male-headed farms. Redirecting resources to small farmers is the more 

important considering the high incidence of poverty in rural areas vis a vis urban ones (14.5 

percent versus 1 percent in big cities and 5.7 percent in small towns), and the particularly high 

incidence of poverty among farmers and agricultural workers (12.5 and 13.9 percent 

respectively).  

The measures aimed at facilitating the use of movable collateral, based on international 

experience, can be expected to benefit smaller firms in the service sector which have 

limited fixed assets, and therefore have a positive (if small) distributional impact.  The 

cogency of the constraints faced by smaller firms in accessing credit is illustrated by the 20 13 

Enterprise Survey which indicates that over a third of firms with fewer than 20 employees, and 

in particular those managed by women, that applied for a loan were rejected. To the extent that 

these measures extent to agricultural enterprises the poverty reducing impact of these measures 

will be amplified (about 6.5 percent of the poor lives in households engaged in entrepreneurial 

activities outside of agriculture, but the share rises to 23 percent when agriculture is included). 

The parametric changes in the Ajutor Social social assistance program of last resort have 

explicit positive pro-poor and gender impact. Indeed, the rationale for the changes is to stop 

the erosion of the potential beneficiary base of the program. By directly supporting the income 

of a significant proportion of the poorest households in the country, these measures were 

estimated to reduce poverty by as much as 0.5 percentage points, with additional 

improvements in the livelihoods of the poor not captured by a decrease in poverty incidence  

(but in lower depth and severity of poverty). The proposed policy action is not expected to 

substantially modify the gender incidence of these programs, but as 57 percent of adult 

recipients of Ajutor social in 2015 were women, this measure is expected to have a positive 

gender impact.  

The withdrawal of the licenses from BEM, Banca Sociala, and Unibank and their 

liquidation has affected negatively the workers who lost their jobs and were not absorbed 

by other banks. The country’s regime of severance packages (growing with years of tenure in 

the job so that for example it would provide 9.6 weeks of salary for those employed for one 

year, and 18.6 weeks of salary for those with 10 years of tenure) was applied to cushion the 

shock on those who lost their job. Given wage levels in the banking sector (almost twice as 



high as the average for the economy) those severance packages were quite generous (the 

equivalent of 6.3 times the poverty line for those with one year of tenure in the job and of 27 

times the poverty line for those with ten years of tenure). In addition, because of their higher 

than average wages, workers in this group were not among the most poor and vulnerable (in 

2015 only 9 percent of workers in the financial sector were among the bottom 40 percent). 

Finally, there is at least anecdotal evidence that several employees from the banks that were 

liquidated were reabsorbed elsewhere in the sector. Other negative impacts of the bank 

liquidations, such as the losses for the depositors were fully compensated for during the 

liquidation process. 

The DPO environmental assessment (EA) and of the proposed priority actions shows most 

of them are either neutral or beneficial for the environment (see Annex 4). Measures in 

Pillar C to improve the public investment management framework and make investment 

subsidies in agriculture more efficient and equitable would eventually lead to better natural 

resource management, promotion of organic agriculture, energy efficiency and climate change 

adaptation technologies. Existing EA legal and administrative frameworks in the country is 

overall well developed and in compliance with good international practices. The PIM regulation 

requires environmental assessment for projects, and as such would help mitigate the potential 

environmental impacts.

 Country Context 
 

Rwanda is a small (26,000 km2) landlocked country with few natural resources and a population 

of 10.7 million (2012) and projected population of 13 million by 2020.  Its hilly terrain covers 85 

percent of the land mass and the country has the highest population density in Africa with 416 

people per square kilometer, with 53 percent of them female. Rwanda has made a remarkable 

transition from genocide to peace and development. Between 2000 and 2012, GDP growth 

averaged 8.1 percent per year. Development efforts and results have been significant. Rwanda 

experienced 14 percentage points reduction in the poverty headcount, from 59 percent in 2001 to 

45 percent in 2011 and with the remaining poor on average much closer to the poverty line in 

2011 than in 2001. Developments in agriculture were key drivers of this poverty reduction 

accounting for more than 45 percent in total due to increased agriculture production (35 percent) 

and increased agriculture commercialization (10 percent). Self-employment in small off-farm 

non-agriculture business accounted for an additional 13 percent of poverty reduction. Part of this 

self-employment was associated with agriculture value chain employment. 

 

Despite this impressive performance in the last decade and particularly in the last 5 years, 

significant challenges remain. While improving, Rwanda remains a low income country with 

annual per capita income of US$644 in 2012 (with more than 45 percent below the national 

poverty line). About one in four rural households live in extreme poverty. Poverty is still mostly 

a rural phenomenon with 49 percent of the poor in rural areas compared to 22 percent in urban 

areas. Poverty is highest (76.6 percent) among households (often landless) who obtain more than 

half of their income from working on other people’s farms. The land distribution is skewed – 36 

percent of households own 6 percent of farm land, with an average of 0.1 ha per household 

(compared to the national average of .33 ha per household). Women are more likely to fall into 

this category.  In addition, women provide the bulk of labor in the crop sector, but function

mainly at subsistence level with insufficient skills, access to markets and control over land and 

other agricultural services. If Rwanda is to achieve its targets to reduce the number of people 

living below the national poverty line to less than 20 percent and eliminate extreme poverty by 

the year 2020, continuation of the past strong growth performance will not be sufficient. A 

further acceleration of inclusive growth would be needed, on top of further reductions in 

inequality. 

 

The strategy for stimulating rapid and sustainable economic growth and reducing poverty is 

articulated in Rwanda’s Vision 2020. Vision 2020 is the national vision and policy framework 

which articulates key priorities for the country’s development by the year 2020. This vision is 

further laid out in the Second Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper 

(EDPRS 2) which delineates the agriculture sector as a key sector and a significant engine of 

inclusive growth for the country. Likewise, in the recent report Rwanda Economic Update, 

Maintaining Momentum it states that increasing agriculture productivity is the main driver of 

poverty reduction in Rwanda. Agricultural transformation, especially through competitive value 

chain development, is expected to boost growth in both the formal and informal sectors, with the 

effect of reducing the proportion of the population dependent on agriculture from the present 73 

percent (2009) to less than 50 percent in 2020. In addition, while agricultural productivity is 

increasing, there is considerable potential to accelerate and continue to raise productivity, 

increase commercialization of agriculture production, increase self-employment in small on and 

off-farm business and achieve significant poverty reduction, income gains and increased 

prosperity.  Gender equity and equality has also been highlighted as a foundational and cross-

cutting issue under EDPRS 2 and the Third Phase of the Transformation of Agriculture Sector 

Program (known by its French acronym, PSTA 3) building on a solid foundation with the highest 

percent of women in parliament in the world at 64 percent and 32 percent women's participation 

in all decision-making local government bodies. Accordingly, the Government of Rwanda (GoR) 

has made a strong commitment to continue to increase gender equity and equality particularly at 

the local level, and is determined to see it well integrated in government policies and programs at 

all levels. 
 

 

 Sectoral (or multi-sectoral) and Institutional Context 
 

Accounting for 32.7 percent of the GDP (2015), agriculture is a critical driver of economic 

growth (7.6 percent, 2000-15) and poverty reduction, contributing to 35 percent of the total 

decline in poverty rates over the past decade. A well-established policy framework, facilitating 

enhanced access to better agricultural inputs, has greatly contributed to the positive agriculture 

sector performance.  As a result, the total production of cassava and maize, as well as milk, meat, 

fish and eggs, more than doubled between 2005 and 2015. 

 

Despite these positive developments, Rwanda has yet to meet its production potential. Although 

key agricultural yields have greatly increased since 2000 (e.g. cereal and cassava yields have 

trebled, sweet potato yields have doubled etc.), they reached a plateau in 2011. At their current 

levels, they are estimated to be at 40-50 percent of their productivity potential, resulting from 

suboptimal use of production factors. Similarly, livestock yields have remained consistently low 

over time. 

 

A contributing factor is small farm size – a rural household, on average, cultivates 0.6 ha, and 

http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2015/05/14/090224b082c25de1/1_0/Rendered/PDF/Rwanda0economi0nd0Poverty0Reduction.pdf

has 2-5 animals – and 96 percent of rural households are directly reliant on agriculture as their 

main or only source of income. The projected increase in the rural population, an estimated 

additional 2.5-3.5 million people by 2032, is likely to add more pressure on land resources and 

farm incomes, unless alternative employment opportunities become available. 

 

In addition, Rwanda remains challenged by malnutrition, with a stunting rate of 37.9 percent, 

while its food security index lies below the average of the Sub-Saharan African countries. Some 

20 percent (2015) of Rwandan households remain food insecure, and most of them are located in 

the western and northern parts of the country. 

 

 

 Program Scope 
 

The proposed operation supports the Government of Rwanda’s strategic objectives of the 

Transformation of Agriculture Sector Program Phase 3 with aims to enhance food security and 

nutrition contributing to a reduction in poverty and inclusive economic growth. The operation 

supports four broad program areas: (i) agriculture and animal resource intensification; (ii) 

research, technology transfer and professionalization of farmers; (iii) value chain development 

and private sector investment; and (iv) institutional development and agricultural cross-cutting 

issues. 
 

 

 Program Development Objective(s) 
 

The program development objective (PDO) is to increase and intensify the productivity of the 

Rwandan agricultural and livestock sectors and expand the development of value chains. 
 

 

 Environmental and Social Effects 
 

The Additional Financing (AF) will introduce a new disbursement-linked indicator (DLI) on the 

development of an updated National Agricultural Policy (NAP) and increase several of the 

existing DLI targets. Increasing the DLI targets and incorporating a new DLI will support GoR’s 

on-going efforts to maximize the productivity of the agriculture sector while transforming the 

overarching policy environment. 

 

The updated NAP will provide an overarching vision for the agriculture sector. It will place 

significant emphasis on sustainable production and food security. However, the policy will not 

include specific policy instruments. Individual policy instruments for all sub sectors will be 

reviewed, revised, or developed. All policies will need to be compliant with the principles 

outlined in the NAP (including those of protecting the environment while maintain food 

security). This approach ensures that sustainable practices will be mainstreamed throughout all 

sub sectoral policies. 

 

The assessment of these adjustments to the Program is as follows: 

 

a) DLIs that are focused on improving the productivity of land and increasing the 
productivity of key crops (DLI 1, 2, 3 and 4) will not induce new environmental and

social risks but may request to pay more attention to potential direct, indirect or 

cumulative risk generated from activities such as expansion of irrigation, as some 

irrigation structures will include canals, as well as small dams. As with any irrigation 

structure, these dams may have safety-related risks, which were effectively managed by 

the GoR during RSSP investment projects. Other potential impacts include water quality 

and quantity degradation (both surface and ground water), surface water sedimentation, 

and spread of waterborne diseases. 

b) Inclusion of DLI 8 focusing on the production of an updated NAP which will integrate 
new initiatives, such as the climate smart Agriculture and Information Communication 

Strategy, which could benefit environmental management.  

 

The level of risk remains moderate and can be addressed through: (i) the existing GoR 

Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS) including the small dam safety 

guidelines and the Environmental and Social Implementation Manual (ESIM). The process for 

rolling out the ESIM to all Districts is part of the on-going decentralization process. The rollout 

to 30 Districts is expected to be concluded by September 2017; and (ii) exclusion of high-risk 

interventions which include activities that are judged likely to have significant adverse impacts 

on the environment and/or affected people. Among these high-risks interventions are dam 

construction/irrigation or drainage infrastructures on transboundary water resources. 

 

While the existing ESMS is adequate, it will be strengthened to further benefit and improve the 

GoR’s understanding of social issues in the following areas by: 

 

 Strengthening measures to enhance GoR’s capacity to implement the ESMS Program. As 
a result, this new action includes a “capacity building program based on the ESIM, and 

the small dam safety guidelines” to benefit the District officers. This program will ensure 

that: (a) the ESIM has sufficient guidelines on small dams; and (b) all relevant staff are 

trained in the ESIM. The manual and training program will be prepared by involving the 

relevant MINAGRI SPIU teams which are already conversant with the safeguards 

policies; and implemented before the end of the Program. 

 

 The Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM) database will be fully functional (including 
relevant staff training) within MINAGRI by July, 2017. This will be supported by the 

development of a communication strategy (included in the updated PAP) to ensure there 

is awareness of the database and that the outcomes of grievances are made public.

 Program Institutional and Implementation Arrangements 
 

The Public Sector 

 

The lead government ministry for the agriculture sector is MINAGRI.  Organizationally, it is 

composed of four main entities as follows: 

 

MINAGRI Central guides policy, strategy and key programs for the Ministry. It comprises the 

Minister and Principal Secretary, and four departments/directorates: Planning, Inspection, Crop 

Production, and Animal Resources. 

 

Rwanda Agricultural Board (RAB) is a semi-autonomous implementation agency of MINAGRI 

that is responsible for promoting food crop production. It has a national network of research 

stations, projects and staff that focus on improved production and yields of food staple crops. It 

has agronomists based in four zones corresponding to the four provinces, and who are 

responsible for expanding farmer access to enhanced extension services. The RAB is also 

responsible for all research and certification of seeds and houses two Task Forces (Irrigation and 

Post-Harvest Infrastructure) which will be assimilated within MINAGRI’s structure as of July 1, 

                                                                                                                                                             
resources, but would mean switching modalities from either sector budget support or project financing to programmatic 

financing (PforR). Apart from DfID, no other donors are providing programmatic support through co-financing of the PforR or 

participation in the MDTF.

2014 as they have completed their mandates; 

 

National Agricultural Export Board (NAEB) is similarly a semi-autonomous implementation 

agency of MINAGRI that is responsible for export crop production. It has concentrated in the 

past on coffee and tea, but is broadening its mandate to cover and expand horticulture and non-

traditional export crops. It also has a national network of projects and staff focusing on improved 

production, yields and competitiveness of export crops. It also has agronomists based in some 

districts and on plantations responsible for expanding farmer access to improved extension 

services in support of increasing export crops. 

 

Single Project Implementation Units (SPIUs) were established to ensure efficient and timely 

implementation of a large portfolio of donor funded projects and are headquartered at MINAGRI 

Central.  Most of the projects being implemented by the SPIUs cover most of the 24 SPs. Three 

SPIUs are responsible for managing projects/operations funded by three key DPs: (i) IFAD 

funded projects: the Kirehe District Water Management Programme; Project for Rural Income 

Through Exports; Climate Resilent Post-harvest and Agribusiness Support Project (PASP); (ii) 

AfDB-funded Projects: Bugesera Natural Rural Region Infrastructure Support Project; Livestock 

Infrastructure Support Project; and (iii) World Bank funded projects: LWH (basket fund), RSSP 

3, and the FRDP. 

 

In addition to MINAGRI, six additional government ministries have significant responsibilities 

in the agriculture sector, as follows: 

 

The Ministry of Local Government (MINALOC) is responsible for 30 Districts, which in turn, 

are responsible for expanding local level service delivery. They promote agriculture development 

as part of their responsibility for local economic development. Funds are earmarked in District 

budgets for implementation of MINAGRI priorities as defined in PSTA 3 (currently 10 percent 

of MINAGRI’s total budget). Although these resources pass directly to the Districts from 

MINECOFIN, they form part of MINAGRI’s overall budget ceiling and programs. Each District 

and sector has an agronomist that is responsible for local level implementation of agriculture 

activities. These agronomists work closely with RAB and NAEB agronomists who work in the 

Districts. The on-going local government restructuring exercise is expected to further expand 

fiscal decentralization, including expanded earmarking of funds from MINAGRI and other 

central ministries, and strengthen local government implementation capacities. The 

implementation of the ASIP, as well as PforR program will involve expanded roles of the local 

government actors, while also restructuring central government organizational and staffing 

structures to be more supportive of these decentralization changes/reforms. MINALOC also 

collaborates on implementation of the National Nutrition policy with MINAGRI, ensuring 

community training and service provisions to improve nutrition outcomes. 

 

The Ministry of Natural Resources (MINIRENA) is responsible for state forests around the 

country, although MINAGRI is responsible for on-farm agroforestry. MINIRENA is also 

responsible for environmental protection and in this capacity has its own programs of hillside 

terrace construction, which reinforce the land conservation terracing that MINAGRI undertakes. 

MINIRENA is also responsible for the RNRA water resources department, and seeks closer 

collaboration with MINAGRI. 

 

The Ministry of Trade and Industry (MINICOM) has the key responsibility of promoting 



7 

 

business and trade growth and development, including expanded agribusiness. It leads the 

development of policy and strategy to accomplish Rwanda’s goal of an expanding, competitive 

and healthy private sector. 

 

The Ministry of Infrastructure’s (MININFRA) Rwanda Transport Development Agency (RTDA) 

has the responsibility of supporting Districts and monitoring implementation of feeder roads 

rehabilitation, upgrading and maintenance. RTDA works closely with the Districts in 

procurement, contract management and management of social and environmental systems.  In 

addition, MININFRA/RTDA provides guidance on technical standards and specifications.   

 

The Rwanda Development Board (RDB) is responsible for investment promotion in Rwanda. 

Although it concentrates on foreign direct investment (FDI), it also promotes local investment. It 

brings together all the government agencies responsible for investment under one roof. This 

includes key agencies responsible for business registration, investment promotion, environmental 

clearances, privatization and specialist agencies which support the priority sectors of 

Information, Communication and Technology (ICT) and tourism as well as Small and Medium 

Enterprises (SMEs) and human capacity development in the private sector. RDB has a 

substantial portfolio of agriculture and agri-business investment projects which it is promoting 

for private sector-driven investment, including expanding the public and private partnerships. 

 

The Rwanda Development Bank (RDB) is the government’s main investment arm and offers 

long and medium-term loans. The GoR is pursuing privatization of the Bank and has signed an 

MOU with a prospective investor. In April 2014 the RDB had an agriculture and agri-business 

loan portfolio of RWF 33.3 billion accounting for a significant proportion of the Bank’s total 

lending. Most agricultural loans were for coffee and tea production and processing and the 

import of fertilizer. On May 16, 2014 the International Finance Corporation (IFC) issued its first 

bond denominated in Rwandan francs, raising RWF 15 billion (about US$22 million) to expand 

the availability of long-term local-currency finance for local businesses through the RDB. 

 

The Private Sector 

 

In addition to the public sector agriculture entities, there are two organizations dedicated to 

supporting private sector actors in agriculture as follows: 

 

The Private Sector Federation (PSF) is the representative umbrella body for the private sector in 

Rwanda and advocates and dialogues with government for policies and programs which will 

promote the growth of the private sector. Amongst its objectives are business promotion and 

development, building private sector capacity and effective private sector advocacy. It is 

composed of nine chambers, including the Chamber of Rwanda Farmers. The Chamber conducts 

a program to train farmers and build entrepreneurship. The member associations of the Chamber 

cover most of the major agricultural commodities produced in Rwanda. 

 

The Rwanda Cooperative Agency (RCA) is the representative body for the cooperative 

movement in Rwanda. There are 1,953 agricultural and 1,307 livestock cooperatives operating as 

farmer associations involved in crop production, agricultural savings and credit, livestock 

development and processing and marketing of outputs. RCA promotes the interests of the 

cooperative movement and runs support and training programs in helping cooperatives function 

and perform as private sector entities

B.   Introduction and Context

Country Context
African agricultural development acquired new momentum when, in January 2014, the African 
Union adopted the Malabo Declaration on Accelerated Agricultural Growth and 
Transformational➢❬¢ in which African Heads of States and Governments recommitted 
themselves to the Comprehensive Africa Agricultural Development Program (CAADP) principles 
and values to uphold the 10 percent target for public spending on agriculture, to double 
agricultural productivity, and thus to sustain annual growth in agricultural GDP at 6 percent or 
higher. 
 
During the same period, there was a renewed commitment of development partners to engage and 
invest in the agricultural sector. Several initiatives are being launched, including from the United 
Nations, the African Development Bank and the World Bank. The United Nation adopted the new 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), and the second of the seventeen proposed SDGs is to end 
hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agricultural. The 
African Development Bank launched (Feed Africa: Strategy for Agricultural Transformation in 
Africa, 2016-2025) which aims to end hunger and rural poverty in Africa in the next decade. 
Also, the World Bank has committed itself to twin goals: eliminating extreme poverty by 2030 
and boosting shared prosperity, measured as the income of the bottom 40 percent in any given 
country.
Sectoral and institutional Context
One of the main challenges in West Africa is satisfying the demands of a rapidly growing 
population that is expected to increase from 300 million in 2011 to about 500 million by 2030. 
The 2008 food, fuel, and financial crisis has demonstrated the need to base food security in West 
Africa on the utilization of the region's huge agricultural potential, as this option would 
simultaneously contribute to economic growth and reduction of poverty. Moreover, meta-analyses 
conducted by International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) have shown that the benefits 
from productivity growth attributed to agricultural research exceed their costs by a factor of 10 or 
more whereas high rates of return on investments in science for agriculture, to the order of 40-60 
per cent, have also been consistently proven. 
 
Gains from smart investments in agricultural R&D were amply demonstrated by WAAPP impact 
analysis completed under the first phase of WAAPP in Mali, Senegal, Ghana, Cote d➢❨ Ivoire 
and Guinea. The analysis found that: (i) WAAPP beneficiaries have increased their yields and 
income by at least 30 percent over the control group; (ii) most of these gains resulted from the 
adoption of new varieties, improved crop management practices and improved small scale food 
processing technologies; and (iii) the immediate pathways exist to achieve rapid growth in 
agriculture through greater focus on productivity enhancement using a regional integration 
approach. The analysis also showed that program beneficiaries experienced a reduction in hunger 
by half and also improved their nutrition standards.

C.  Proposed Development Objective(s)

Original Project Development Objective(s) - Parent
To generate and accelerate the adoption of improved technologies in the participating countries' 
top agricultural commodity priority areas that are aligned with the sub-region's top agricultural 
commodity priorities, as outlined in the ECOWAP.



Page 3 of 11

Key Results 
As it concerns the achievement of the WAAPP in the targeted countries, as of October 2016, the 
project has reached in the four countries a total of more than 1 million direct beneficiaries 
(1,153,000), about 26 technologies have been generated by the NCOS in Benin and Niger and the 
rice research system in Guinea, close to 1.1 million hectares (1,083,000) have been covered by the 
new technologies and more than 650,000 producers/processors have adopted at least one new 
technology. The disbursement performance of the project is also satisfactory; more than 96 
percent of the parent project (WAAPP-1C) financing is disbursed, and an action plan is being 
implemented which will ensure full disbursement by the current closing date of December 2016.

D.  Project Description

The AF will build upon the achievements of the original project to complete, consolidate and 
expand project activities. Therefore there will not be change in the project development objective 
and component structure as well as or safeguard category. The proposed AF will also continue to 
use the implementation arrangements and technical design of the original project. 
However, the primary focus of the AF will be to scale up the adoption the innovations and 
technologies generated by the WAAPP (more than 174 technologies have been released by the 
Program to improve agricultural production, post harvest, processing and mechanization). Thus 
the AF will add a particular focus on marketing of these technologies and innovations in order to 
scale up their adoption and to increase food availability in the sub region, and thereby contribute 
to poverty alleviation and agricultural growth. And since some of these technologies have 
different level of marketability and their scope for adoption also varies markedly the AF will 
among others, include the contracting of a private firm/NGO by CORAF/WECARD to design a 
technology marketing strategy and a technology marketing specialists in each country to 
implement an action plan for the commercialization of the technologies. In this framework the AF 
will finance incubation centers and seed money for job creation for greater citizen engagement, 
youth and women, and provide incentives and mechanisms to actively involve the private sector 
and mobilize some of their resources for the development of the targeted value chains. 
 
And in order to take the above scaled-up activities of the AF into account, the project➢❨ s Results 
Framework will be updated to review the targets of the indicators and also include the new 
indicators on job creation/employment, nutrition, citizen engagement and private sector 
participation. In addition the closing date of the original project will be extended to correspond to 
the duration of the AF. The Risk ratings have been updated to reflect experience gained during 
implementation of the original project.

Component Name
(a) Component 1: Enabling Conditions for Sub-regional Cooperation in the Generation, 
Dissemination, and Adoption of Agricultural Technologies.

with a much greater emphasis on nutrition-sensitive and climate smart agriculture technologies 
that have high potential for accelerating job creation for youth and women (iii) implementing  an 
action plan to scale-up commercialization of the promising technologies to facilitate private sector 
investment and create more jobs for young agro-entrepreneurs; and (iv) strengthen the regional 
seed market and upscale the p

Component Name
(d) Component 4: Project Coordination, Management and Monitoring and Evaluation.
Comments (optional)
The Project will continue to finance the existing Project Coordination Unit (PCUs) in Togo, 
Niger, Benin and Guinea selected additional staffs and specifically a technology marketing 
specialist in each country.

E.  Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis (if known)

The project in each of these fours countries has a national coverage. Although it would be mainly 
developed in R&D centers, newly availed WAAPP technologies will also be expanded to new 
farmers own lands to ensure technologies contribute indeed to alleviate poverty and shared 
prosperity. These technologies would be gender sensitive and youth-driven as the project seeks at 
engaiging more women and youth as citizen for sustainable development.

II. Implementation
Institutional and Implementation Arrangements
Institutional and Implementation Arrangements 
 
The proposed AF does not foresee any changes in terms of implementation arrangements. The AF 
will be placed under the technical responsibility of the Ministry in charge of Agriculture in each of 
the participating countries and under the responsibility of CORAF for the regional level activities. 
The PCUs in each country and CORAF will therefore continue to coordinate project activities, 
prepare the Annual Work Program and Budgets (AWPB), organize the Implementation Support 
Missions (ISM) and ensure project Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E). The PCUs and CORAF have 
a solid track record for Social and Environmental Safeguards, procurement, financial management 
and M&E, which have consistently been rated satisfactory or moderately satisfactory throughout the 
parent project implementation. CORAF and each PCU will be strengthened with an additional staff 
who will be specialized in Technology Marketing and Commercialization. The Guinea PCU will be 
reinforced with additional staffs including two social and Environmental specialists (each with 
specific responsibilities), a financial management specialist, a procurement specialist and a technical 
expert. Implementation of the AF activities will also be supported by strategic institutional and 
technical partners, as well as service providers (other agencies, NGOs, CSO, etc.) who will be 
contracted through the: i) result-based MOUs for public service providers and other Projects and ii) 
result- based contracts for private service providers and NGOs.

III. Safeguard Policies that might apply

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional)
Environmental Assessment 
OP/BP 4.01

Yes The AF is a Category-B project due to the fact that 
potential social and environmental impacts are 
expected to be local, site-specific and easily 
manageable. Because it is a continuation of 
WAAPP-1C the ESMF has been updated, revised 
and adapted within the context of the focus of the AF 
on scaling up technology adoption which follows the 
same line of intervention of the parent project. The 
ESMF includes further provisions for capacity 
strengthening at all levels for the successful 
implementation of the project safeguard measures, in 
compliance with national and Bank safeguard 
policies. The updated version of the ESMF was 
reviewed, cleared by both CORAF and World Bank 
and then disclosed simultaneously both in CORAF 
websites and at the InfoShop on November 18, 2016.

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 No The AF is not supporting any agricultural sites near 
wetlands, mangroves, or other critical habitats . It 
will work on improving productivity on existing 
developed land.

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No The AF is not supporting any extension of cropping 
area and therefore no damage of forests is expected. 



Page 6 of 11

It will develop its activities on land already under 
exploitation.

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes The AF will scale up the parent project 
achievements. The initial PMP was revised, updated 
and adapted to reflect the AF interventions and set 
forth the basic principles each member-country 
would follow to adequately handle the possible usage 
of pesticides, particularly as the AF will focus on 
dissemination of agriculture technologies. Upon 
completion, the updated version of the  PMP was 
reviewed, cleared by both CORAF and World Bank 
and then disclosed simultaneously both in CORAF 
websites and at the InfoShop on November 18, 2016.

Physical Cultural Resources 
OP/BP 4.11

No The project will not finance activities that threaten 
culturral ressources.

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 
4.10

No There are no indigenous peoples in the project area.

Involuntary Resettlement OP/
BP 4.12

Yes The AF is a category B project due to the fact that 
foreseen social and environmental impacts are 
expected to be local, sites specific and easily 
manageable.  OP/BP 4.12 is triggered for Guinea 
only because  of the expected land acquisition, loss 
of assets or loss of access to livelihoods support 
means upon which local beneficiary communities 
depend. To comply with OP/BP 4.12 policy 
principles and guidelines Guinea prepared a 
Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) on how to 
comply with the above mentioned land use/right 
issues. Upon completion, the RPF was reviewed, 
cleared by both CORAF and World Bank and then 
disclosed simultaneously both in CORAF websites 
and at the InfoShop on November 18, 2016.

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 No The AF is not involving any construction or 
rehabilitation of dams.

Projects on International 
Waterways OP/BP 7.50

No The AF does not affect or involve international 
waterways.

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/
BP 7.60

No The AF is not in a disputed area.

IV. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify 

and describe any potential large scale,  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
Social (including Safeguards). The AF is expected to have no significant negative social impacts. 
Project beneficiaries are mainly small-scale farmers  in food crop production for national, regional 
and international markets - in which women play a critical role.The Project will work to ensure 



Page 7 of 11

that the circumstances of small-scale farmers, particularly women and youth, are accounted for in 
setting priorities. Adaptive research will be conducted in farmers➢❨  fields. Competitive grants to 
implement R&D will be open to producers➢❨  organizations and agribusiness associations and not 
only to research organizations. The Project will work with development operations and public/
private partnerships to scale up producers➢❨  use of technologies. 
 
As a Category B Project, the foreseen social impacts are expected to be local, mostly sites specific 
and easily manageable. The Involuntary Resettlement operational policy (OP/BP 4.12) has been 
triggered only or Guinea - where the project will cover new commodities and new intervention 
areas, because of the expected land acquisition, loss of assets or loss of access to livelihoods 
support means upon which local beneficiary communities depend. To comply with WB OP/BP 
4.12 policy principles and guidelines, Guinea has prepared a Resettlement Policy Framework 
(RPF) on how to comply with the above mentioned land use/right issues. The RPF was amply 
consulted upon and stakeholders feedback provided in the annexes of the documents. 
 
Environment (including Safeguards). The AF is expected to have a positive environmental impact 
through its support for agricultural technologies that promote better use of land and water 
resources. Potential environmental risks could include point and non-point pollution of water 
sources, other issues associated with the use of agricultural chemicals, and negative environmental 
impacts associated with the rehabilitation of irrigation or small-scale civil works on research 
stations. Research on transgenic crops is neither explicitly planned nor excluded. If it becomes part 
of the research agenda supported under the Project, it will proceed with social and environmental 
safeguards consultants with international good practice and the regulatory framework of the host 
country. In particular, such research must be done in accordance with the obligation of each 
country under international treaties to which it is a party, including the Cartagena Protocol on 
Biosafety (for Burkina Faso and Nigeria). Potential adverse environmental impacts associated with 
the NCoS activities will be of low intensity, minor, site specific, and handled under safeguard 
measures already in place for ongoing activities.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities 
in the project area:
NA

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse 
impacts.
NA

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
This is an additional financing to a project which was implemented during a 5 year period. During 
the parent project phase a close supervision of the implementation of safeguards measures were 
conducted by the social and environmental safeguards specialists of the World Bank. In addition 
each country and CORAF appointed social and environmental safeguard focal points in charge of 
ensuring that the social and environmental safeguards are well implemented and mitigation 
measures are also identified and implemented. A capacity building plan was also implemented 
including two regional training workshops and several country level workshops for all safeguard 
focal points. The recent ISM in June 2016 rated compliance with safeguards policies as 
satisfactory for the 4 recipient countries and indicates that both the safeguards focal points have 
the required knowledge and are playing a key role in ensuring that safeguards measures are well 
implemented. However, it was convened that each PIU will recruit/appoint one qualified 



Page 8 of 11

environmental safeguards specialist and one qualified social safeguards specialist, to improve the 
safeguards performance. The ESMF and the PMP have been updated, including a better 
clarification of roles and responsibilities for safeguards implementation among the PIU staff; this 
role distribution will be inserted in the Project implementation manual (PIM). An RPF has been 
developed for Guinea as recommended by the policy, since Guinea will be developing a variety of 
new crops which would probably need additional lands acquisition or encroachment of which. in 
public domain, would need a proper handing and payment of compensation to the recipient 
communities. All these documents include measures to ensure that safeguard requirements are 
being properly complied with.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure 
on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
A comprehensive set of stakeholder were consulted during the preparation of the safeguards 
documents for the original project. Similarly, consultations were done during the preparation of 
the AF that included various beneficiaries, agricultural, social, and environmental, health agencies 
as well as some NGOs and other civil society agencies. Producers/processors and their 
organizations at the sub region levels (ROPPA) and at national levels were also consulted. 
Following the consultations the original safeguard documents were updated for the AF and each 
country organized a national stakeholder workshop to disseminate and validate the documents. 
Key issues and recommendations of the workshops were used to improve the safeguards 
documents. Recommendations from both the client and the Bank and from the stakeholders 
workshop have been reflected in the final draft of the ESMP, PMP and RPF.

Appraisal Review Decision 
(from Decision Note)

I. Project Context
Country Context
Tanzania has been experiencing high rates of economic growth. This growth has been driven by 
economic liberalization, sound macroeconomic policy management, and expanding public sector 
spending. Growth accelerated from an average of 3.5 percent during the 1990s to around 7 percent 
over the past decade.  Improvements in tax administration and provision of foreign aid created 
space for a significant expansion in public spending, which increased from less than 16 percent of 
GDP in 2000 to almost 28 percent in 2011. Inflation was low from 2000 to 2005, but picked up 
pace from 2006 to 2011. It was briefly in double digits, and has now settled back to around 7 
percent. Fiscal policy has been largely prudent accompanied by strong growth in tax revenues.  
However, the government needs to keep its debt and debt service to reasonable levels, reduce the 
growing deficits of certain parastatals, and manage the commitments under the public pension 
scheme. There are a number of recent developments (including discovery of natural gas) that are 
expected to contribute to Tanzania’s positive economic performance. Looking forward, the 
economy is likely to remain on its current growth trajectory in the near future.

Notwithstanding the country’s solid economic growth record, poverty rates have not declined 
significantly. In November 2013, the government announced the new official poverty figures. The 
basic needs poverty level in Tanzania mainland has fallen from 33.34 percent in 2007 to 28.2 
percent in 2012. Rural poverty has declined from 39.4 percent to 33.4 percent over the same period. 
Despite impressive macro-fiscal performance, and decades of concerted efforts to lift rural masses 
out of poverty, agricultural incomes have grown slowly. Economic growth has been concentrated in 
urban areas and in capital-intensive sectors, such as the mining, communication, construction, and 
banking sectors. In comparison, the growth in agricultural value added has been less than two 
percent per worker. This growth in the agriculture sector has not been high enough to reduce 
poverty in rural areas, where more than 80 percent the country’s poor reside.  
Limited opportunities for commercialization are at the heart of small farmers’ problems in 
Tanzania. The majority of smallholder farmers sell little of their production. Approximately three 
quarters of all maize, and approximately half of all paddy, is consumed within the village in which 
it is produced. The expansion of smallholder production of these food crops, as well as a range of 
cash crops such as cotton, tea and coffee is undermined by low productivity, and high transport and 
marketing costs. New strategies for agricultural commercialization are needed. 
The top leadership of the country is strongly committed to share prosperity more widely, and 
recognizes the economic importance of agriculture for rural growth and poverty alleviation. The 
government at the highest levels has made transformation of agriculture a major national priority. 
Learning from the experience of other countries, the Tanzanian government has embarked on an 
ambitious program to strengthen agriculture value chains and integrate larger numbers of small-
scale farmers into these competitive trade partnerships. These initiatives target the transformation of 
large numbers of semi-subsistence producers to become successful commercial farmers. There is a 
market failure in service provision to these smallholders to enable them to link up with modern 
agriculture value chains (which enables them to acquire modern technologies and markets; and 
learn by doing); hence government is committed to correcting this market failure by incentivizing 
agribusinesses through matching grants. The matching grants would help underwrite the risks 
agribusinesses face in bringing in more smallholders into their value chains, and smallholders 
would gain from the experience of more targeted modern services and improved markets for their 
output.

  

Sectoral and institutional Context
Tanzania has witnessed an expansion in agribusiness investment with supply chain links with 
smallholder farming. A growing number of these agribusinesses are pursuing contract or out-
grower farming with smallholders. These include investments in out-grower sugar, tobacco cotton, 
sorghum, barley, cocoa, dairy and horticultural crops. Agribusinesses are experimenting with 
alternative strategies for strengthening this co-investment. 
 
The Government of Tanzania (GoT) recognizes that the private sector is a critical partner in 
delivering development benefits. Particularly when it is linked to smallholder production potential, 
it can provide an important engine of agricultural growth. In 2001, the government adopted a new 
Agricultural Sector Development Strategy (ASDS) targeting achievement of a green revolution in 
agriculture. To better implement this strategy, the government then prepared the Agricultural Sector 
Development Program (ASDP), highlighting the need for stronger public-private partnership to 
promote the commercialization of smallholder production. This commitment was reinforced in 
2009 with the signing of the Kilimo Kwanza (Agriculture First) resolution calling for greater 
investment in agriculture, and inclusive commercialization.

The Southern Agricultural Growth Corridor of Tanzania (SAGCOT) Program was developed by the 
GoT to operationalize the Kilimo Kwanza. The SAGCOT Program, as articulated in its core 
document, the Investment Blueprint, highlights commitment to a strategy of joint public-private 
investment targeting the development of agribusiness value chains across the country’s southern 
corridor. In aggregate, the Blueprint proposes that a public investment of USD1.3bn can leverage 
an additional USD2.1bn in private investment in order to bring 350,000ha of agricultural land into 
commercial production over the next twenty years. Tens of thousands of smallholders are expected 
to become successful commercial farmers, more than two million people are to be lifted out of 
poverty and food security will improve. The primary emphasis of the SAGCOT Program is to 
expand partnerships between agribusinesses and smallholder farmers in building larger and more 
competitive value chains.   Agribusiness investors are sought who are willing to work 
collaboratively with smallholder communities to raise productivity and incomes. Early successes 
have been highlighted for sugar and rice, where out-growers have achieved higher levels of 
productivity and income compared with smallholders in neighboring regions. Similar examples are 
cited for tea and horticultural crop farmers.

II. Proposed Development Objectives
To support the adoption of new technologies and improved market access by small-holder farmers 
through expanding and creating partnerships between small-holder farmers and agribusinesses in the 
Southern Corridor of Tanzania.

million were provided by two Project Preparation Advances, IDA USD8.41 million)Comments (optional)
The component will establish project management and M&E systems and provide financing for 
salaries, office equipment, transportation and technical assistance services. Complementarities will 
particularly be sought with other IDA funded programs such as the Private Sector Competitiveness 
Project and the Agricultural Sector Development Program.

Total 75.00

V. Implementation
The Project will be overseen by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO). A Project Steering Committee 
(PSC) meeting quarterly and on specific demand has been established. It is chaired by the 
Permanent Secretary (PS) of the PMO, and amongst others comprises PS from key line ministries, 
the Chief Executive Officers of the TIC, SAGCOT Centre, SAGCOT Catalytic Trust Fund (CTF), 
Rufiji Basin Development Authority (RUBADA), and representatives from smallholder farmers. 
The PSC will: (a) ensure coordination and cooperation among all participating agencies; and (b) 
endorse annual work plans and budgets for all project-related activities. 
 
The PMO has proposed that the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) originally created for the IDA 
funded Private Sector Competitiveness Project be expanded to also coordinate the SAGCOT 
Investment Project. This PCU will have management oversight and reporting responsibilities for all 
components of the Project. This entity will integrate the financial and technical progress reports 
from each of the agencies being funded, and carry out the overall M&E for the Project. The PCU 
will also take overall procurement and financial management responsibility during the first six to 12 
months of the Project implementation until sufficient capacity has been built in the other 
implementing agencies (an assessment will be undertaken to assess the agencies capacity). The full 
staffing of this PCU as set out in the Operational Manual. All participating institutions will prepare 
annual work plans and budgets to be submitted to the PCU for approval by the PSC. 
 
IDA financing agreed with the Ministry of Finance that will flow to agencies other than the PCU, 
will be governed by subsidiary agreements acceptable to IDA (these agencies are the SAGCOT 
Centre and the SAGCOT Catalytic Trust Fund). These subsidiary agreements lay out the fund flow, 
implementation and reporting requirements of the two entities. Direct funding to these entities may 
only begin once these subsidiary agreements, and an associated set of fiduciary systems including 
financial management and procurement systems acceptable to IDA, are in place. It is estimated that 
this will take place in the first year of implementation. 
 
The SAGCOT Centre will be the responsible implementing agency for sub-component 1.1 activities. 
Funding for the SAGCOT Centre will be committed in parallel with other Development Partners 
(initially DfID and USAID) to support the operations of the Centre as a whole. A Memorandum of

Understanding (MoU) has been signed on September 30, 2014 between the SAGCOT Centre, GoT, 
DfID, the World Bank, Norway, EU, and UNDP. The MoU states that the funding will be 
committed against an indicative five year budget, and against an approved annual budget agreed by 
the SAGCOT Centre Board.  
 
TIC will be the responsible implementing agency for sub-component 1.2 activities.  The TIC will 
directly implement these activities and be responsible for procurement, financial management, 
input/output and progress reporting.  In the first instance, procurement under the Project will be 
implemented by the PCU until such time as TIC has reinforced its procurement capacity. 
 
Component 2 will be implemented through the SAGCOT Catalytic Trust Fund. The institutional 
structure of the catalytic fund management is designed and specified in a Trust Deed. A Board 
comprising five members has been established. The Board has recruited an Executive Secretary and 
initiated recruitment of a Fund Manager, estimated to be selected soon after the approval of the 
Project.   
 
The grant application process under the Matching Grant Fund (MGF) will be managed by a 
professional and competitively recruited Fund Manager. The Fund Manager will periodically (at 
least twice a year) invite applications from eligible partnership between smallholders and 
established agribusinesses, and through a two phased process select those applications which satisfy 
the core criteria (benefits to smallholders, safeguard compliance, sustainability, etc.). The Fund 
Manager will have a specific duty to provide support to applicants, in particular to help ensure 
benefit flows to smallholders, and that smallholder interests are well represented in the application 
and the partnership. The final applications will be submitted to the independent Investment 
Committee to be appointed by the Board to review all grant proposals and make recommendations 
to the Board on those that warrant funding. The eligibility, selection process and implementation 
arrangements are detailed in the Trust Deed and further specified in the MGF Operational Manual. 
Grants will be funded on a reimbursement basis with expenses pre-financed by the investors and 
may be tranched. Grants payments made through the agribusiness may be allocated to the 
agribusiness investor, smallholders or some combination thereof, as requested in the application, 
and set out in the grant agreement.

Decision

I. Project Context
Country Context
In spite of Vietnam’s impressive achievements in poverty reduction – poverty declined from 58 
percent in 1993 to 14 percent in 2010 according to official statistics, and to 20 percent according to 
GSO-WB – poverty remains high at 60 percent in the West Northern Mountains Region and at 38 
percent in the East Northern Mountains Region (GSO-WB methodology). Limited access to basic 
services, markets, and financial, land, and information resources are the most important constraints 
for the poor in the Northern Mountains. Addressing these constraints is hampered by weaknesses in 
institutional capacity and public sector management: Vietnam has moved from a highly centralized, 
hierarchical, central planning system, to one where many decisions are decentralized. However, 
capacity building at the local level has not kept pace with decentralization. A five-year (national) 
Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP 2011-2015) which responds directly to these 
development challenges was approved by the National Assembly in November, 2011.

Poverty is increasingly concentrated among Vietnam’s ethnic minority populations. While ethnic 
minorities account for only 15 percent of the country’s population, they make up for half of the 
poor in Vietnam and have experienced a much slower pace of poverty reduction compared to the 
majority of Vietnam’s population. Poverty among ethnic minorities remains at 66 percent.   Most of 
these ethnic minority groups live in highland or upland areas, in particular in the North-West and 
North-East as well as in the Central Highland regions. The Northern Mountains region has the 
highest rate of poverty and is home to almost one-third of Vietnam’s poor. 
 
Improvements in both the delivery and accessibility of basic public services in the Northern 
Mountains region are especially needed to reach the twin goals of eliminating poverty and fostering 
shared prosperity in Vietnam. Over the last fifteen years, the GoV has launched a number of 
programs through the Ministry of Labor, Invalids, and Social Affairs (MoLISA), the MPI, the 
Committee for Ethnic Minority Affairs (CEMA), the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural 
Development (MARD) and other line Ministries to address this poverty challenge. Among others, 
these include: (a) the Program for Socio-Economic Development in Communes Facing Extreme 
Hardship in Ethnic Minority and Mountainous Areas (referred to as P135) to finance the commune 
and inter-commune level infrastructures and strengthen planning and implementation capacity; (b) a 
follow-up program (P135-2) designed to reduce poverty among disadvantaged groups; and (c) 
Program 30-A (Support for Fast and Sustainable Poverty Reduction in Poor Districts)  financing the 
development plans for the 62 poorest districts in the country. More recently, the GoV decided to (a) 
continue the series of poverty programs with the newly launched P135-3 under the CEMA; and (b) 
launch a New Rural Area Program (NRAP) under the MARD. In total, Vietnam currently has 16 
different NTPs implemented through various ministries. The consequence of this evolution is a 
degree of institutional fragmentation (and resulting contestation) across major Government 
agencies. 
 
The World Bank has supported Vietnam’s poverty alleviation efforts through two community-
driven development (CDD) operations – the Community Based Rural Infrastructure Project 
(CBRIP) and the Northern Mountains Poverty Reduction Project (NMPRP-1) – which introduced 
participatory approaches and promoted decision making at the commune level; three Development 
Policy Credits (DPCs); and the ongoing CDD operation (NMPRP-2) which focused on 
infrastructure support, livelihood activities, market linkages and further devolution of investment 
ownership to communities. There is evidence that the positive lessons from the Bank’s support are 
being mainstreamed leading to a wider menu of community projects, a stronger focus on 
participatory planning, transparency, devolution of decision making, and institutional capacity 
building at the local level.  
 
In spite of the positive results of various poverty programs, both the GoV and donor agencies are 
concerned about the inefficiencies, administrative requirements and associated costs resulting from 
the high level of fragmentation in Vietnam’s poverty alleviation efforts. Although a clear consensus 
on the consolidation of poverty programs has not yet emerged, various GoV stakeholders at the 
national and provincial levels, as well as donor agencies are taking initiatives to address this 
situation. These efforts focus on (a) the consolidation of existing poverty programs and NTPs in 
possibly two overarching national poverty programs;  and (b) the integration of the planning efforts 
at the local level in one common SEDP.       
 
Alignment with Government Strategy. The NMPRP-2 supports the Government’s Resolution 80/



Page 3 of 6

NQ-CP on Direction of Sustainable Poverty Reduction which aims at accelerating poverty 
reduction in the poorest districts, communes and villages of the country, by setting poverty 
reduction targets of 4 percent per annum over the 2011 – 2020 period (compared to a national target 
of 2 percent) and by prioritizing the mobilization of resources and support to these areas.  
 
The GoV is moving towards medium term planning (3 years planning cycle with a multi-year 
budget allocation rather than annual budgeting as is currently the case). Fully implemented, this will 
give more predictability, flexibility, and discretion to the commune level to plan their investment 
priorities in a more integrated manner. The GoV is also moving towards greater consolidation of its 
various poverty alleviation efforts. The SEDP approach developed under the NMPRP-2 fits very 
well both in this medium-term planning context and in the efforts to integrate various NTPs.

II. Proposed Development Objectives
A. Current Project Development Objectives – Parent
The development objective for the proposed project is to Enhance the living standards of the project 
beneficiaries by improving: (i) their access to productive infrastructures; (ii) the productive and 
institutional capacity of local governments and communities; and (iii) market linkages and business 
innovations. The key outcome indicators to assess achievement of the PDO are as follows:  
 # At least 60% of the project beneficiaries report satisfaction on the selection, design, and 
implementation of project activities.  
 # The project beneficiaries report an improvement in on- and off- farm income of at least 10% over 
the life of the project.

B. Proposed Project Development Objectives – Additional Financing (AF)
The AF focuses on institutionalizing and mainstreaming the socio-economic development planning 
approach in the broader planning and budget allocation processes in the project area. The PDO will, 
therefore, be revised to capture this important element of the AF.  
 
Project Development Objective for the AF is revised to read: The Project Development Objective 
(PDO) is to enhance the living standards of the Project Beneficiaries by improving: (i) their access 
to productive infrastructure; (ii) the productive and institutional capacity of local governments and 
communities; (iii) commune integrated investment planning and (iv) market linkages and business 
innovations.

III. Project Description
Component Name
Component 1: District Economic Development
Comments (optional)
(about 30% of total allocated provincial project funds, equivalent to US$28.8 million). The objective 
of this component is to provide investment support to the District Socio-Economic Development 
Plans, focusing on productive and economic infrastructure for increased agriculture productivity, 
direct local employment and income generation, and facilitation of business innovation. This 
component supports specific efforts to link the supply side, namely the market and business 
institutions, with the poor.

Component Name
Component 2: Commune Development Budget
Comments (optional)



Page 4 of 6

(about 58% of total allocated provincial project budget, equivalent to US$55.68 million). This 
component will provide block grants to communes to finance small-scale sub-projects at the village 
level for productive infrastructure and livelihood improvement activities that are identified through 
participatory planning processes. Livelihood support will assist the poor with strengthening the 
operations of Common Interest Groups (CIGs), develop necessary skills and the further 
development of market linkages and ensure that women participate in and benefit from the project 
through targeted support to village level women’s groups.

Component Name
Component 3: Capacity Building and Communication
Comments (optional)
(about 6% of the total project provincial allocation budget and CPO’s component, equivalent to US
$6.76million). Under the AF, this component will mostly focus on the farmers and other 
beneficiaries to help sustain their capacity for implementing project activities during the AF period 
and beyond. This component will continue to help improve the capacity of project implementation 
agencies at all levels, especially of the local governments and the communities to plan, manage, 
implement, supervise, and maintain productive infrastructure and livelihood improvement programs, 
communication and information sharing and learning. This component will also support the scaling 
up and institutionalization of the participatory local development planning through the Socio-
Economic Development Plan (SEDP)

Component Name
Component 4: Project Management
Comments (optional)
(about 6% of total allocated provincial project budget and CPO’s component, equivalent to US$8.76 
million). This component is to ensure effective and efficient project management through 
facilitation of various implementation, monitoring and evaluation (M&E), reporting, coordination, 
and quality enhancement efforts.

V. Implementation
MPI will take charge of overall project coordination at the central level, while provinces will be 
responsible for project implementation. At the central level, Central Project Coordination Office 
(CPO) will be established at the Department of Agricultural Economics in the MPI, and facilitate 
overall coordination with provinces, as well as serve as the focal point vis-a-vis the World Bank and 
relevant central government agencies. At each project province, a Provincial Project Management 
Unit (PPMU) will be established at Department of Planning and Investment (DPI). At the district 
level, District Project Management Unit (DPMU) will be created. Community Facilitators (CFs) 
who will provide vital support to the communes in particular in the process of CDBC planning and 



Page 5 of 6

implementation will be competitively selected, and hired under the project as members of DPMU. 
At the commune level, a Commune Development Board (CDB) will be established under Commune 
People’s Committee (CPC) to oversee the implementation of Component 2. Each unit will be staffed 
with appropriate experts as required (see Annex 6 for proposed staffing and key responsibilities).

I. Introduction and Context
Country Context
The countries of West Africa belong to the Economic Community of West Africa States 
(ECOWAS), which comprises 15 countries and is home to more than 310 million people. ECOWAS 
is a regional organization that serves to promote economic integration across the West Africa 
region. The region is very heterogeneous in terms of cultural, economic and human development. 
Overall, member states rank low on the United Nations Development Programme’s (UNDP) human 
development index; as of 2014, life expectancy at birth and gross national income per capita of 
countries in the region ranged from 45.6 to 75.1 and 873 to 6,365 respectively.

Sectoral and Institutional Context
Over the last four decades, the world has witnessed one to three newly emerging infectious diseases

annually. The West Africa region is both a hotspot for emerging infectious diseases and a region 
where the burden of zoonotic diseases is particularly high. In this region, emerging and re-emerging 
diseases at the human-animal-ecosystems interface are occurring with increased frequency. As 
evidenced by the recent Ebola epidemics in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, highly contagious 
diseases in this region cross borders easily and have the potential to turn into pandemics. These add 
to the ongoing burden of neglected and endemic human and animal diseases, including zoonosis.  
 
Pandemics and epidemics have potential catastrophic effects on human and animal life, ecosystems, 
and on national economies. From 1997-2009, major outbreaks of fatal infectious diseases such as 
the human pandemic influenza (H1N1), highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1), Creutzfeld-
Jakob disease, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and EVD caused an estimated US$80 
billion in economic losses. Additionally, a recent analysis by the World Bank (WB) shows that a 
severe pandemic such as the 1918 Spanish Flu could cost approximately US$3 trillion globally, an 
estimate comparable to the impact of the 2008 global financial crisis.  
 
The pandemic of H1N1; epidemics of SARS, H5N1 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome 
Coronavirus (MERS-CoV); and recent outbreaks of EVD are reminders of persistent risk of 
infectious, zoonotic diseases, and the economic losses they cause. Animal losses from zoonotic 
diseases are also high. On average, about half of all annual losses of Livestock Units (LSU) reported 
on average by veterinary services to the OIE-WAHID database from 2006 to 2009 were the result of 
zoonotic diseases. 
 
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) represents an increasing global health threat as resistant pathogens 
can be transmitted across healthcare facilities, in communities, and across international borders. A 
review of some disease control and prevention measures adopted in the human health sector shows 
that resistance to inexpensive and effective antimicrobial drugs has emerged at an alarming rate, 
increasing the likelihood that many common diseases and pathogens (such as tuberculosis, malaria, 
HIV, gonorrhea, MRSA, CRE and Salmonella Typhi infections) could become difficult and 
expensive to treat. Similarly, challenges with insecticide resistance continues to be on the rise in the 
region and could undermine the significant gains in the control of vector born disease such as 
malaria, dengue, and yellow fever. Detection, monitoring, and responding to AMR relies on having 
strengthened and coordinated laboratory and surveillance capacities in the region. 
 
Control of the accelerating spread of communicable diseases in West Africa is also hampered by the 
limited capacities of individual country health systems for efficient surveillance, early detection and 
rapid response to infectious disease outbreaks that result in significant reversals in human 
development progress in the region including increased cases of morbidity and mortality, threats to 
food security, and substantial economic losses. For many countries in West Africa, years of civil 
conflict and underinvestment have resulted in weak health infrastructure, periodic disruption in 
service delivery, and critical shortages or gaps in the workforce (eg. epidemiologists, laboratorians, 
information technology experts, etc.). Mitigation of the risks posed by diseases with pandemic 
potential, including emerging zoonosis, will have to address these weaknesses in country health 
systems in the region. 
 
The effectiveness of disease surveillance and response systems is currently hampered by:  
lack of appropriate plans and resources to respond to health threats in a timely manner; 
scarcity and non-retention of trained and motivated human and animal health workforce resources, 
at both central and local levels;

overall weakness of  human and animal disease information systems, including insufficient data 
collection and use of data for informing policy decisions and action, as well as for the prevention 
and mitigation of the cross-border spread of diseases; 
insufficient integration of parallel disease- specific surveillance systems;  
insufficient cross-sectorial coordination and collaboration among Ministries, in particular among 
those in charge of public health, animal health and the environment leading to inadequate 
operationalization of the “One Health” concept; 
inadequate human and animal health laboratory capacity, including inadequate specimen 
transportation networks, and low involvement of laboratories in the surveillance and response 
systems; 
disparity in detection and disease management capabilities among countries and insufficient 
regional cooperation. 
 
In June 2007, the WHO set forth a mandate via the International Health Regulation (IHR 2005) that 
requires country governments to develop, strengthen and maintain the core capacities of national 
public health systems to detect, assess, notify, and respond promptly and effectively to health risks 
and public health emergencies of international concern (PHEICs).  In the WHO Africa Region 
(WHO/AFRO), the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) strategy serves as a 
framework to fulfill the mandates of IHR (2005). However, till today, IDSR has not been fully 
implemented in most countries in the region, thus contributing to the limited capacity of the 
countries’ health system for systematic collection, analysis, confirmation, and interpretation of 
disease surveillance data, in addition to insufficient capabilities for preparedness and rapid response. 
Thus, the need to reinforce these capacities in this region as a mitigating risk for potential future 
pandemic outbreaks. 
 
Animal Health Sector 
The animal health sector in the ECOWAS region is characterized by a high incidence and 
prevalence of many contagious diseases, both zoonotic and non-zoonotic, impacting productivity, 
public health, rural development and livelihoods. Since December 2014, West Africa has witnessed 
a reemergence of an H5N1 outbreak.  Important weaknesses in veterinary public health systems 
caused long delays in detecting, reporting and putting other necessary mitigation measures in place 
to reduce the risk of spread and to eventually eradicate the virus. Lack of preparedness, insufficient 
human, physical and financial resources, and the lack of cross-sector collaboration were highlighted 
as key factors by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Organization for 
Animal Health (OIE) in all affected countries. A recent summary of evaluations of the performance 
of Veterinary Services (PVS) done by the OIE within ECOWAS also highlighted the insufficient 
budgetary resources, and a mismatch between human resources and actual requirements.  In terms 
of strategic actions for animal health, all countries identified the need to improve the surveillance 
cover, in line with the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health code, and to control priority animal diseases 
(including through vaccination). 
 
Collaboration between Veterinary and Human Public Health Systems.  
West African countries do not have yet the requisite systems in place and are generally ill-equipped 
to prevent human infections and to mitigate the losses from exposure to diseases of animal origin. In 
addition to strengthening national veterinary and human public health systems and their regional 
cooperation, there is an urgent need to establish or reinforce and maintain strong collaboration 
between systems at national and regional levels in order to better manage risks that arise at the 
animal-human-ecosystem interface (the so called ‘One Heath’(OH) approach.). For that to happen,

particular attention will be given to priority core public functions (veterinary public health and 
human public health) that would reduce these risks. Assessing these core functions, bridging divides 
among systems and ministries and reducing capacity gaps would constitute a critical element of the 
program. Country assessment tools now exist for both systems (Performance of Veterinary Services 
pathway; IHR monitoring framework costing tool) as well as well identified bridges for OH 
competencies. Attention to building systems for core functions and policy dialogue, based on 
credible assessments, rigorous analysis and adequate financing, will ensure sustainability and reduce 
disease risks. These efforts would support specific ongoing national and regional disease-control 
initiatives, already part of system-strengthening country program, and demonstrate the performance 
of collaborative systems in disease surveillance, prevention and control.   
 
Regional Disease Surveillance and Response Network 
The recent EVD epidemic in West Africa has been attributed, not only to environmental factors and 
human behavior, but also to weaknesses in the health systems of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone 
and their inability to detect and respond swiftly to public health threats, and moreover, to the lack of 
a regional surveillance and response network in West Africa. Containment of West Africa’s EVD 
epidemic that initially began in Guinea and spread to neighboring countries was hampered by the 
absence of the systematic collection and reporting and exchange of surveillance and laboratory data 
across country-borders in real time. The EVD epidemic dramatically illustrates the need for a more 
harmonized approach to disease surveillance and response, both within countries and within the 
West Africa region overall. The EVD epidemic highly underscores the importance of regional 
cooperation among West African countries for the prevention and control of potential cross-border 
disease outbreaks, as a key component of the post-Ebola health systems recovery strategy, and 
overall health systems strengthening efforts in the region.

Relationship to CAS
The project is in line with the WB’s mission to end extreme poverty and promote shared prosperity. 
Communicable and non-communicable diseases are a major constraint on the health, education and 
potential earnings of people living in the ECOWAS region and have the greatest impact on the most 
vulnerable population.  Hence, the economic rationale for investing in these interventions is key to 
mitigating the economic burden not only on individuals but also on the country as a whole. The CPS 
for the nine countries targeted by this project emphasize the need to strengthen the capacity of 
health systems of which disease surveillance is a key pillar, in order to improve health outcomes and 
reduce vulnerability (To be updated with CPS for each country). 
 
The project complements both WBG and development partner investments in health systems 
strengthening, disease control and surveillance.  Establishing this complementarity is particularly 
important in the three countries most affected by the EVD epidemic.  For Example, in the context of 
the recent Ebola epidemic, the Government of Sierra Leone is eager to dramatically improve 
national disease surveillance and response capacity. Having experienced first-hand the devastating 
consequences of cross-border spread of Ebola, the government also acknowledges the paramount 
importance of regional disease surveillance and institutions for cross-border and inter-country 
collaboration. On 7-8 September, 2015, the Sierra Leone Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MOHS) 
and multiple partners met in Freetown to discuss the creation of a Sierra Leone's National Public 
Health Institute (NPHI). Core functions of this Institute will include surveillance and response, 
research aimed at answering important questions for policy and program design, and response to 
public health emergencies. The Government of Sierra Leone is acutely aware of its limited financial 
and technical resources and has already begun actively engaging partners to assist in the creation of

the NPHI. US CDC, China CDC and Public Health England have already demonstrated significant 
interest. The proposed project can play a vital role in providing financial and technical assistance to 
the Government of Sierra Leone to create the NPHI, can convene the multiple partners around a 
harmonized agenda, and can ensure that what is created in Sierra Leone is integrated into regional 
systems.

II. Proposed Development Objective(s)
Proposed Development Objective(s) (From PCN)
The project’s development objective (PDO) is to strengthen cross-sectoral and regional capacity for 
collaborative disease surveillance and response in West Africa.

Key Results (From PCN)
i. Percentage of participating countries that improve compliance with IHR (2005) and OIE 
international standards based on independent external evaluations;  
ii. Percentage of outbreaks for which cross-border investigations are undertaken; 
iii. Percentage of surveillance workforce who have been trained; 
iv. Percentage of satellite laboratories awarded 2-star or more status under the regional 
accreditation program based on WHO/AFRO 5-step accreditation process; 
v. Percentage of reported priority communicable diseases outbreaks with laboratory 
confirmation of etiologic agents as defined by IDSR and OIE/FAO; and 
vi. Number of regional rapid response teams set up and equipped, activated and demonstrate 
competency on a quarterly basis

III. Preliminary Description
Concept Description
The project's development objective (PDO) is to strengthen cross-sectoral and regional capacity for 
collaborative disease surveillance and response in West Africa. 
 
The PDO seeks to address systemic weaknesses within the animal and human health sectors that 
hinder effective disease surveillance and response by: (i) strengthening the capacity of selected 
ECOWAS member countries to fulfill their obligations under the WHO IHR (2005) and the OIE 
Terrestrial Animal Health Code; (ii) reinforcing sustainable and effective regional collaboration and 
collective action to detect and respond promptly to priority infectious diseases threats in West 
Africa including zoonotic diseases; and (iii) establishing an efficient linkage of country health 
systems to regional laboratory, surveillance, and response networks. 
 
Ultimately, the project will contribute towards significantly reducing the burden of diseases 
particularly among the poor and vulnerable populations, mitigating the public health and economic 
risks posed by infectious diseases in humans and animals, and decreasing the threats of future 
disease outbreaks thereby promoting global health security.

B.   Introduction and Context

Country Context
Sri Lanka is a lower-middle-income country of 20.5 million people and a per capita GDP of US$ 
3,811 (2014).  Growth over the past decade has been strong, averaging 6-7% per year.  Absolute 
poverty declined from 22.7 to 6.7% from 2002 to 2012.  Despite this progress, roughly one 
quarter of the Sri Lankans remain nearly poor, as defined by living above the national poverty line 
(about US$ 1.5 but below US$ 2.50 per day (2005 PPP terms).  Sri Lanka has comfortably 
surpassed most of the Millennium Development Goals. Primary school enrollment is near 
universal, while secondary and tertiary enrollment has substantially increased.  Maternal and 
infant mortality rates are at very low levels, and life expectancy at 74 years has been above its 
regional peers for over a decade. 
 
With the end of the civil war in 2009, reconstruction, infrastructure investment, and increased 
consumption have delivered a strong economic peace dividend, driven by the non-tradable sectors 
and public sector investments.  Sri Lanka is also undergoing a structural transformation away 
from agriculture, which now accounts for 10% of GDP towards industry (32.5%) and services 
(57.5%) with associated productivity growth and accelerating urbanization.  However, this 
transformation is progressing relatively slowly with 30% of the labor force remaining in 
agriculture.  Notwithstanding the post-conflict environment, Sri Lanka’s economic policies over 
last ten years have been inward-looking with an increasing degree of protectionism and anti-
export bias.  This has prevented the country from capitalizing on comparative advantage and 
exports; attracting domestic and foreign investments to foster technology transfer; and generating 
new sources of innovation driven growth and employment. 
 
The country’s fiscal landscape is challenging.  In 2014, a widened deficit and a slowdown in 
growth increased the fiscal deficit to 5.7% and the public debt 71.8%, as share of GDP, marking a 
slight reversal of the fiscal consolidation path of the post-conflict period.  The fiscal budget for 
2016 presented to Parliament projected a deficit of 6.0% of GDP for the years 2015 and 2016.  
The government presented its economic policy in November 2015 that includes as priorities the 
generation of one million job opportunities, enhancing income levels, developing the rural 
economy, and creating a wide and a strong middle class.  It proposed fiscal consolidation through 
increasing revenue collection, reforms of state owned enterprises, and enhanced trade and foreign 
investment.
Sectoral and institutional Context
Sri Lanka’s agriculture is characterized by a non-plantation sector and a plantation sector.  Of the 
country’s approximately 2.3 million hectares of agricultural land, 80% are used for non-plantation 
foods crops, comprising rice, maize, fruits, vegetables, and other crops that are primarily grown in 
small-holdings.  About 1.65 million smallholder farmers operate on average less than 2 hectares 
and contribute 80% of the total annual food production.  Commercial crops (minor export crops) 
include cinnamon, pepper, cocoa, and coffee and are grown on small and medium land holdings

as well.  Plantation crops—coconut, rubber and tea—are cultivated in large estates and small and 
medium land holdings.  Typically, non-plantation crops are grown under irrigated conditions 
while plantation and minor export crops are grown in the rain-fed areas.  Monsoonal rainfall 
patterns shape the agricultural seasons and irrigation patterns.  Two thirds of the agricultural area 
are located in the dry zone where the bulk of the country’s irrigation infrastructure is located. 
 
Sri Lanka’s has successfully attained self-sufficiency in rice and recently also in maize 
production. Rice production has increased steadily from 2.9 million tons (2002) to 4.8 million 
tons in 2015, in part because previously inaccessible land was reopened for cultivation after the 
end of the war but also through introducing high-yielding varieties, expanding irrigation capacity, 
fertilizer subsidies, restrictions on crop choices, and import substitution.  Achieving self-
sufficiency has meant that the production structure has remained concentrated in the low value 
food crops. In 2013, about 45% of the cultivated area was under rice cultivation (up from 37% in 
1980) but the share of rice in the overall value of crop production was only 18%.  Furthermore, 
average rice yields of 4.06 tons/hectare are relatively low and agricultural productivity, as 
measured by total factor productivity, has only grown by an average of 0.6 percent per year since 
1980, lagging behind other South and East Asian countries. 
 
With rice self-sufficiency secured, there is a need to diversify the production structure out of the 
lower value food crops towards high-value agriculture.  Sector policy to date, however, has 
neglected the domestic fruits and vegetable sectors, despite growing domestic demand and 
potential for export growth.  Demand has instead been met by increased imports.  A broad 
recognition has however emerged recently that the modernization of agriculture is needed if 
agriculture is to realize its potential for greater value generation and as a renewed source of rural 
growth for poverty reduction and job creation. Such modernization will require a structural shift 
towards a more high-value oriented agriculture production structure, agro-processing and value 
addition activities, and increased competitiveness.  It will also involve aligning trade policies to 
become more consistent and conducive for high-value export agriculture; realigning and better 
targeting of public sector support, especially fertilizer subsidies; greater attention to R&D; and 
relaxing the rice self-sufficiency policy and allowing for more demand-driven and market 
oriented production.  This will require differentiated strategies for different parts and production 
arrangements across the country.  In the northern and eastern parts of the country, comprising 
primarily the dry zone, there is significant scope for agricultural productivity growth and potential 
for better linkages to domestic and export markets, including value-added production.  In other 
parts of the country, more robust and scaled-up private commercial investment and innovation 
through agri-enterprises and agri-enterprise-farmer partnerships is needed for value addition and 
farmer integration into high value chains through scaling up and diversification into more 
commercial crops.   
 
The proposed project provides a broad framework for Sri Lanka to experiment with innovative 
approaches to address the above mentioned sector issues, overcome the low productivity 
equilibrium, and strengthen agriculture’s contribution to the economy and employment creation.  
The strategic thrust reflected in the project design is to support overall agriculture sector 
development and addressing the longstanding constraints through: (a) developing an incentive 
structure for small, medium, and large enterprises, including farmer producer organizations, to 
invest in commercial agriculture and value chains; (b) promoting partnership arrangements 
between private sector partners and smallholder pro ducers for better linkages; (c) demonstrating 
new agriculture technologies and innovations at sufficient scale to enhance productivity,

resilience, and diversification in selected prioritized lagging regions; (d) promoting technology 
diffusion through capacity building and training and new models for extension service delivery; 
and (e) supporting sector policy analysis and research for reform.

C.  Proposed Development Objective(s)

Development Objective(s)
The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to support increasing agriculture productivity, 
improving market access, and enhancing value addition of smallholder farmers and agribusinesses 
in the project areas.

Key Results 
The achievement of the PDO will be measured using the following results indicators: (a) number 
of direct project beneficiaries, disaggregated by gender; (b) number and share of participating 
farm households adopting improved technology packages and production practices supported 
under the project; (c) number and share of project-supported farmer producer organizations and 
farmer – agribusiness partnerships making a profit; (d) percentage increase in average value of 
sales of agriculture products due to project interventions; and (e) the number of new jobs created 
through small and medium enterprise investments under the project.

D.  Project Description

The project comprises four components, as follows: 
 
Component 1: Agriculture Value Chain Development (Total US$102.7 million; IDA US$58.6 
million). The component would promote commercial and export-oriented agriculture through 
attracting and leveraging investments from farmer producer organizations and agribusinesses for 
high value agriculture production and value addition. Component 1 comprises the following sub-
components: 
 
Sub-component 1.1: Investment Preparation Support, supporting: a training program on principles 
and procedures of the Matching Grants Program under sub-component 2; public advertisements 
and information workshops at national, provincial and district levels for prospective grant 
applicants; support to the project’s Technical Review Group and Board; international advisory 
support to operationalize the Matching Grants Program; staffing support and equipment and 
operation cost for the Matching Grants Secretariat and three regional support offices; technical 
assistance support to assist applicants in the preparation of quality investment proposals; and 
technical assistance support to support the environmental and social safeguards requirements 
within the Matching Grants Program. 
 
Sub-component 1.2: Matching Grants to Producer Organizations and Agribusinesses, supporting a 
Matching Grants Program to support investments from farmer producer organizations and 
agribusinesses in agriculture. Matching Grants would be provided under two windows.  Matching 
Grants of US$5,000 up to US$75,000 would be provided for investments to be developed and 
implemented by farmer producer organizations.  Eligibility criteria for farmer producer 
organizations to participate in the program would include: formal registration; appointment of an 
accountant; a cash contribution of 10 percent of the total investment; and availability of 
commercial financing of 40 percent of the total investment.  Matching Grants of US$75,000 up to 
US$500,000 would be provided to agribusiness for agriculture value chain investments.

Applications for grant support would be evaluated on criteria, such as outreach and capacity 
building to smallholder farmers, including women headed producer groups; focus on lagging 
regions; as well as technical quality, innovation, business rationale and others. 
 
Sub-component 1.3: Partial Credit Guarantee (PCG), supporting a PCG to share financial risk 
with participating financial institutions that have expressed interest in lending to beneficiaries of 
the Matching Grant Program.  The PCG would be administered by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka 
(CBSL) and operate on the basis of the World Bank Group Principles on Partial Credit Guarantee 
Schemes, published in December 2014, covering the governance, management, administration, 
sustainability, and monitoring of PCG. 
 
Component 2: Productivity Enhancement and Diversification Demonstrations (US$ 58.63 million, 
IDA US$ 58.63 million).  The component would support smallholder farmers to produce 
competitive and marketable commodities, improve their ability to respond to market 
requirements, and move towards increased commercialization.  Component 2 comprises three 
sub-components: 
 
Sub-component 2.1:  Farmer Training and Capacity Building, supporting knowledge building and 
capability improvements of smallholder farmers and the establishment of farmer organizations to 
help them to respond better to market opportunities.  Individual farmer capacity building and 
farmer producer organization training will be implemented through training programs reaching 
out to approximately 600 villages and approximately 500 farmer producers groups.  The trained 
and established farmer producer organizations would become eligible for participation in the 
Matching Grants Program under Component 1. 
 
Sub-component 2.2:  Modern Agriculture Technology Parks, supporting the introduction, 
demonstration, and scale-up of innovative agriculture technology packages to support 
productivity improvements, diversification, commercialization, more sustainable and climate 
resilient production patterns.  The sub-component would support 7 agriculture technology 
demonstration parks in the selected districts of Jaffna, Mullaitivu, Anuradhapura (Northern 
Province), Batticaloa, (Eastern Province), Matale (North-Central Province), Moneragala (Uva 
Province), and Polonnaruwa (Central Province) which have been identified based on high poverty 
headcounts and agriculture potential.  The agriculture parks would be established to demonstrate 
entire value chain approaches, involving farmer mobilization and training, production, post-
harvest handling and/or processing, and marketing. 
 
Sub-component 2.3: Up-grading Production and Marketing Infrastructure, supporting: (i) the up-
grading and rehabilitation of small-scale irrigation infrastructure and existing water tanks in 
selected areas and linked to the agriculture technology demonstrations parks; (ii) the improvement 
of existing production and market access roads and construction of new field access tracks to 
improve transportation, access to markets and accessibility for agricultural machinery; and (iii) 
village level storage and product handling facilities, including drying platforms and sheds, 
composting facilities of crop residues, storage facilities and others. Infrastructure investment 
would focus on public infrastructure and would be linked to gaps identified under the technology 
parks development (sub-component 2.2). 
 
Sub-component 2.4:  Analytical and Policy Advisory Support, supporting the CPCU, MOPI and 
MOA in addressing knowledge gaps; developing an evidence-based policy, legal and regulatory

framework; and formulating sector and sub-sectoral strategies to provide an enabling environment 
for a sustainable and competitive modern agriculture and food system.  The component would 
provide support to evaluate policies and regulations and recommend adjustments, reforms or new 
policies to promote competitiveness, responsiveness to market demand, sustainability, and 
resilience; undertake market analyses for new exports, and analyze policy, regulatory and 
institutional constraints, and identify public investments to address these constraints; and evaluate 
the social and economic impact of policies and public expenditures and make recommendations to 
improve the efficiency and effectiveness of public expenditures.  The sub-component would also 
provide some technical support the MOA, including the design of a National Agriculture 
Information System and others. 
 
Component 3: Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation (Total Cost US$ 7.74 million, US
$ 7.7 million IDA).  The component would support the PMOs at MOPI and MOA at the central, 
provincial and district levels in project management and coordination, technical supervision, 
financial management, procurement, social and environmental safeguards, and monitoring and 
evaluation (M&E).

E.  Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis (if known)

The project is national in scope and designed as framework approach.  Specific project locations 
and their characteristics are not yet known and would be identified during implementation as part 
of the project’s demand-driven Matching Grants Program approach. Itis expected that project sites 
would be located in all three major agro-ecological zones, including the wet zone (average annual 
rainfall above 2500 mm); the intermediate zone (annual rainfall between 1750-2500 mm); and the 
dry zone (annual rainfall less than 1750 mm).  The dry and intermediate zones cover about 66% 
of the agriculture land area and receive about 30% of the country’s annual surface water yield.  
They are extensively used for agriculture and require irrigation water to be productive.  The bulk 
of the country’s irrigation infrastructure is hence located in the dry zone.   The wet zone, on the 
other hand, comprises 34% of the agricultural land area and receives 70% of the country’s annual 
surface water yield.  The three major plantation crops, most other export crops and various types 
of fruits are grown here under rain-fed conditions.

The project’s proposed agriculture technology demonstrations parks included under Component 2 
and the complementing production infrastructure investments will be located in the 7 priority 
districts of Jaffna, Mullaitivu, Anuradhapura, Batticaloa, Matale, Polonnaruwa, and Moneragala.  
While exact project sites are not yet known and will be determined as part of a detailed feasibility 
study process during implementation, the districts are located in the dry zone (except for 
Moneragala, which is located in the intermediate zone) and have been identified based on high 
poverty rates and high absolute numbers of poor.  The majority of these districts are located in the 
former conflict affected areas and are characterized by poor or dilapidated public infrastructure, 
lack of productive infrastructure at the farm level, and poor access to markets, as well as limited 
livelihood and employment opportunities.

policies across various parts of the government; develop an annual program of studies and analytical 
work, and monitor implementation during the year through periodic activity progress updates.

III. Safeguard Policies that might apply

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional)
Environmental Assessment 
OP/BP 4.01

Yes To mitigate potential environmental and social 
impacts that may be caused due to physical project 
interventions and ensure all negative impacts 
associated with project investments are avoided and/
or mitigated, an Environmental Assessment and 
Management Framework (EAMF) and a 
Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) have been 
prepared.  These will provide detailed guidance on 
the specific due diligence requirements as well as on 
the specific environmental and social safeguards 
instruments required for sub-projects, including 
screening, environmental management plans, 
resettlement action plans etc.) to mitigate any 
potential negative project impacts.

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 Yes The project will support agriculture activities on 
existing farmland.  Expansion of farmland into 
fragile habitats is not foreseen. The project will 
improve agricultural practices and is expected to 
reduce the pressure on farmland and surrounding 
natural habitats.  Some activities might impact 
natural habitats because of their proximity to such 
habitats (construction and/or upgrading of rural 
infrastructure).  The EAMF prescribes a due 
diligence mechanism under OP 4.01 to ensure 
impacts are mitigated.  Preventive and mitigation 
measures will be included in sub-project EMPs, as 
needed.

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No Project-supported agricultural activities will take 
place on existing agricultural areas and there will be 
no expansion into forest areas.  No activities in 
commercial forests or in close proximity to forest 
areas are expected.

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes The project promotes Integrated Pest Management as 
a key thematic area,  however, the intensification and 
diversification of agriculture could to lead to changes 
in the application of pesticides for pest and disease 
control.  A Pest Management Plans (PMP) has been 
prepared based on Integrated Pest Management 
(IPM) principles, describing the national regulatory 
framework, current status of pest and disease control, 
monitoring and supervision mechanism, major

experience and problems, and lessons learned from 
past projects.  It specifies a range of actions to 
strengthen integrated pest management practices and 
awareness and includes capacity building and 
monitoring program to facilitate implementation.

Physical Cultural Resources 
OP/BP 4.11

No No project-support activities are expected in the 
vicinity of or to affect physical cultural resources, as 
defined by OP/BP4.11. Measures on safeguard 
chance finds are  included as part of mitigation 
measures defined in EAMF OP/BP 4.01.

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 
4.10

No No conclusive evidence or data exist yet on the 
possible presence of indigenous peoples 
communities in the country.  In general, "forest 
dwellers" who live in remote locations and close to 
commercial forests and national forest reserves are 
considered native communities.  Their livelihood is 
dependent on forest resources.  Project supported 
agricultural activities will take place on existing 
agricultural areas and there will be no expansion into 
forest areas.  No activities in commercial forests or in 
close proximity to forest areas are expected and 
therefore forest dweller communities will not be 
affected through proposed investments under the 
project.

Involuntary Resettlement OP/
BP 4.12

Yes The project will not involve involuntary resettlement 
or physical displacement.  Small-scale land 
alignment or acquisition for village-level civil works 
may be necessary.  Where the need for land 
acquisition may arise, the project’s RPF will apply.  
The RPF provides the guidelines and procedures for 
land acquisition; describes provisions for 
compensation and mitigation measures, includes a 
grievance redress mechanism, and set up safeguards 
monitoring and institutional arrangements in the 
event of land acquisition and livelihood losses.

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 Yes The project may include the up-grading and 
rehabilitation of small-scale irrigation facilities   and 
water tanks.  OP/BP4.37 applies because of the 
dependence on water conveyance and control via 
irrigation systems and the links of smaller tanks with 
the storage and operation of upstream medium/ large 
dams, which is typical for Sri Lanka’s cascading tank 
and irrigation infrastructure.  The rehabilitation of 
small irrigation schemes and tanks will not include 
dams and embankments more than 15 meters high 
and will not include medium to large scale dams.

The EAMF includes generic dam safety measures to 
be adopted in the design and implementation of 
rehabilitation/ improvement of irrigation structures.  
It also includes guidance on the preparation of 
operation and maintenance (O&M) plans and dam 
safety plans in accordance with OP/BP4.37.

Projects on International 
Waterways OP/BP 7.50

No The proposed project activities do not have any 
impacts to the international waterways and therefore 
this policy is not triggered.

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/
BP 7.60

No There are no disputed areas where project 
interventions are undertaken and therefore this policy 
is not triggered.

IV. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify 

and describe any potential large scale,  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
The project is expected to bring positive environmental benefits to the project areas through the 
introduction and expansion of modern technology applications that help improve current cropping 
patterns and farming methods, increase efficiency in the management of water resources, protect 
agriculture soils, and roll out integrated pest management. However, two components under the 
project may involve activities that could have significant environmental impacts if not mitigated 
properly, especially during the construction phase.   Component 1 will support commercial 
agriculture and agro-products processing. Component 2 would finance the establishment of 
agriculture technology demonstration parks and improvements of rural infrastructure, including 
access roads and tracks, rehabilitation of small irrigation schemes, land preparation, market 
facilities, and others. The project’s process-oriented and demand-driven framework approach does 
not allow to determine project investments and specific project locations for investments under 
these components at appraisal. However it is known that these will be conducted in existing 
agricultural areas. 
 
Sub-component 1.2: Matching Grants to Producer Organizations and Agribusinesses:  
 
The agricultural sector faces a number of challenges in managing land productivity which often 
results in encroachment of forest areas for search of new land for cultivation. Soil erosion, crop 
disease management, water use efficiency, water pollution from excessive use of chemicals, and 
cultivation of unsuitable crop varieties are among the key areas where focus in terms of 
environmental management are a priority.   
 
Supporting the commercial agriculture and agro-products processing will require that stringent 
environmental screening, identification of potential environmental and impacts and management 
in terms of set up and operations of the activity. Among other best practices would be organic 
cultivation and at the same time careful soil management needs to be taken care of to prevent soil 
erosion and top soil degradation.  As specific sites and nature of the agro-business activities are 
not yet known, best practices that need to be employed and general recommendations cannot be 
employed as the nature of the activity varies and depend upon the soil type, area of cultivation ,i.e. 
dry zone or wet zone, and topography, crop type and the specific agriculture sector.  A site-

specific Environmental Management Planning approach plays a key role and has been 
incorporated in to the Matching Grants Program.  In addition, via strengthening technical 
knowledge and extension services focusing on the careful and minimal use of chemical fertilizer 
and pesticides/herbicides through good practices such as Integrated Pest Management and 
Integrated Plant Nutrition Management via the project’s Pest Management Plan, activities that 
facilitate sustainable agricultural development should be essentially promoted. 
 
Sub-component 2.2: Establishment of Modern Agriculture Technology Parks: The sub-component 
would support 7 agriculture technology demonstration parks in selected districts in the Northern, 
Eastern, Central, North-Central and Uva Provinces, which have been identified based on high 
poverty headcounts and agriculture potential. The exact location of where these interventions will 
be taking places will only be deduced during the project implementation stage. Environmental 
screening will be an essential part of the site selection process in order to ensure project-supported 
agriculture-related activities would take place on existing farmland and no expansion or creation 
of new farmland into fragile habitats is foreseen. The project will bring improvements to 
agricultural practices that are expected to reduce the pressure on these areas and the likelihood of 
encroachment into sensitive natural habitats. 
 
Sub-component 2.3: Up-grading Production and Marketing Infrastructure:  This component will 
entail physical interventions under the following purview; (i) the up-grading and rehabilitation of 
small-scale irrigation infrastructure and existing water tanks and irrigation systems in selected 
priority areas, linked to the agriculture technology demonstrations parks; (ii) the improvement of 
existing production and market access roads and construction of new field access tracks to 
improve transportation, access to markets and accessibility for agricultural machinery; and (iii) 
village level storage and product handling facilities, including drying platforms and sheds, 
composting facilities of crop residues, storage facilities and others. Infrastructure investment 
would focus on public infrastructure and would be linked to gaps identified under the technology 
parks development.  Impacts to physical and ecological environments during the construction 
phase of physical interventions outlined under Sub-component will be predominantly during the 
construction phase and consist of impacts such as the stress of natural resources such as sand, 
water and spil, removal of productive topsoil, solid waste generation in the form of construction 
waste, localized dust and noise and safety and occupational health to laborers. These impacts will 
be management via mitigation measures that will be implements via sub-project specific 
environmental management plans. 
 
The project is expected to generate positive social benefits and provide sustainable poverty 
reduction opportunities into lagging rural areas. Improved agriculture productivity and value chain 
development are expected to create additional economic returns for farmer households.  Expected 
benefits include employment opportunities for poorer households, individual and collective 
empowerment through membership in formal farmer producer organizations and in partnership 
arrangements with agribusinesses, improved access to finance, technology, and markets, as well as 
technical and management skills. Attention to more equitable sharing of economic gains from 
investments in commercial agriculture modernized value chains will be paid during the process of 
farmer producer organization establishment. Investments in local infrastructure will have positive 
impacts if infrastructure is targeted to serve both agricultural production needs and the needs of 
local communities.  A mandatory social screening is specified in the Operations Manual and RPF 
and will allow for the detailed assessment of potential social impacts and risks and relevant 
mitigation measures of all sub-projects.  Land acquisition is expected to be small-scale and to be 
manageable through the RPF and Resettlement Action Plans.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities 
in the project area:
No potential indirect negative environmental or social impacts are expected under the project.  It is 
worthwhile to note that women producer organizations will receive priority in the matching grant 
facility and other project-supported activities. However, a number of issues deserve attention and 
monitoring from a social development perspective during implementation:  Women-headed and 
poor households may be especially vulnerable and their participation in project activities might be 
limited resulting in inequitable production arrangements within farmer producer organizations or 
in partnership arrangements with agribusinesses. Market risks will remain substantial, and timely 
access to market information will remain challenging.  This may result in producer organizations 
not being able to assess market and demand conditions adequately.   Modern agriculture requires 
more investment while some of the proposed commodities may provide returns only with some 
time lags.  Poorer households may therefore face increased risk of indebtedness because of their 
motivation to participate in the project.  Producer arrangements will require the organization and 
streamlining of large numbers of smallholder producers under unified production and land 
management arrangements, requiring special attention to ensuring voluntary and fully informed 
participation.  Complex land tenure and land ownership patterns in Sri Lanka’s smallholder 
agriculture might hinder the introduction of modern agriculture practices and new technologies.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse 
impacts.
Alternative design consideration included a three pronged approach that included major 
investment components on climate smart agriculture, value chain development for higher value 
agricultural products, and on reforms to the country’s research and development and extension 
systems.   This scope was considered to broad and complex, including from an environmental and 
social safeguards perspective and the project design was simplified as described above.

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
An Environmental Assessment and Management Framework (EAMF) in lieu of an overall project-
specific Environmental Assessment (EA) and a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) have been 
prepared as details of specific sites and related activities and interventions are not yet available. 
The EAMF primarily includes an assessment of generic issues that are typically associated with 
anticipated interventions under the project, measures for environmental risk mitigation and 
institutional arrangements for conducting environmental assessment, instruction to the preparation 
of Environmental Management Plans (EMPs), implementation and monitoring. The RPF provides 
guidance on the land acquisition process and  the preparation of site-specific Resettlement Action 
Plans where needed. 
 
To ensure that project interventions supported under the Matching Grant Program are 
environmentally sound, the EAMF includes environmental screening and evaluation criteria which 
will be part of the screening process for matching grant applications under Component 1.   MOPI 
will be responsible for ensuring the environmental screening of all project concept notes and full 
proposals submitted by applicants to the matching grant program.  The environmental screening 
process and evaluation criteria presented in the EAMF are reflected in the Operational Manuel of 
the Matching Grant Program as well and built in to the eligibility assessment criteria of matching 
grant applications.  
 
All interventions (excepting those that obviously are environmentally benign or low impact) under

Component 2 will be subject to an environmental screening with the objective to: (a) determine the 
anticipated environmental impacts, risks and opportunities of sub-project; and (ii) determine if the 
anticipated impacts and public concern warrant further environmental analysis, and if so to 
recommend the appropriate type and extent of Environmental Assessment needed as per the set 
criteria in the EAMF.   
 
The EAMF is taking the applicable safeguard policies into account as well as the national 
environmental requirements and will serve as a guide to the level of environmental analysis and 
mitigation required for all interventions supported by the project which will have the potential to 
trigger negative environmental impacts and thereby ensure compliance with the World Bank’s 
environmental safeguard policies and the relevant national Environmental regulations during 
implementation. As a category B project, all physical activities financed under the project in 
general will be required to prepare an EMP and follow the World Banks Environmental Health 
and Safety Guidelines and agriculture sector guidelines as defined in the EAMF. 
 
Interventions under Component 2, sub-component 2.3 may include the rehabilitation and up-
grading of small-scale irrigation infrastructure and existing water tanks (managed by the Agrarian 
Services Departments) linked to the agriculture technology demonstrations parks under sub-
component 2.2.  OP/BP4.37 applies because of the dependence on water conveyance and control 
via the irrigation systems and the links of smaller tanks with the water storage and operation of 
upstream medium/large dams, which is typical for Sri Lanka’s historical cascading tank and 
irrigation infrastructure.  There is an ongoing and effective dam safety program in Sri Lanka 
targeting all large to medium scale dams (upstream of small irrigation structures) and smaller 
dams along cascading irrigation systems.  Full-level inspections, dam safety assessments, and 
safety remedial measures have already been conducted and details are documented by the 
Government satisfactorily to the Bank and in compliance with the provisions of OP/BP4.37 on 
Dam Safety.   
 
Typical interventions under this project would include repairs and improvements, such as 
protection of downstream slopes of dam embankments, providing toe-filters and toe drains to 
improve downstream drainage and arresting excessive seepage flows, upstream slope protection 
strengthening of the structural stability of  spillways and sluice structures etc.  The anticipated 
project activities will result in an overall enhancement of the safety of dams (tank bunds) against 
the risk of failure.  The project, however, will not finance construction of new tanks (new dams/
tank bunds).  Small dams i ncluded under the project would be less than 5 meters in height. 
 
All irrigation infrastructure related interventions will require a screening, as per the EAMF to 
verify whether upstream medium to large scale dams are present and connected hydrologically, 
and to assess their dam safety status and, if needed outline follow-up actions.  If the presence of 
upstream and hydrologically connected dams is confirmed and these have not been rehabilitated or 
strengthened and thus have Dam Safety implications, the following will be conducted: an 
inspection and evaluation of the safety status of the dam, its appurtenances, and its performance 
history; and a review and evaluation of the mandated dam owners operation and maintenance 
procedures.  A report will be provided on the findings of the review, including recommendations 
for any remedial work or safety-related measures necessary to upgrade the existing dam to an 
acceptable standard of safety.  Necessary additional dam safety measures or remedial work may be 
financed under the project. When substantial remedial work is needed, these will be undertaken 
using the following procedures: a competent professional will be recruited to design and supervise 
the work.  Because the size of dams would be less than 5 meters in height, qualified professionals

will be hired by MOA to design and supervise the work. 
 
The MOA and MOPI have limited prior experience with Bank-funded projects respectively and 
the capacity to manage environmental and social safeguards in project implementation is limited 
as well.  MOPI is a new entity.  MOA has been long established, however, does not partake in the 
implementation of national level environmental regulations and institutional capacity is weak.  
MOA has however sufficient capacity and technical expertise in pest management because MOA 
is implementing national programs in pest control and pesticide management.  To address capacity 
weaknesses, the PMUs under MOA and MOPI will both recruit full-time qualified environmental 
and social specialists prior to the commencement of field implementation to be responsible for the 
implementation of the project’s environmental and social regulations, including the EAMF, PMP, 
EMPs, and RPF and RAPs.  In addition, the project will provide training in environmental 
management and on environmental and social management to improve institutional capacity. The 
cost for monitoring and supervising the implementation of environmental and social project 
regulations have been integrated into the overall project investment cost.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure 
on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Consultations with direct and indirect project beneficiaries, government stakeholders at various 
administrative levels and farmers will be conducted as part of the participatory process for 
designing and implementing sub-projects.  Consultation will aim at: sharing information, listening 
to feedback, engaging citizens in decision making, and involving stakeholders in participation in 
the implementation process.  Consultations will also enable the project team to hold joint 
discussions with the beneficiary communities, share ideas about planning and implementation, and 
benefit from local knowledge to take more informed decisions. Consultation will take place inform 
of public meetings, focus group discussions, sub-project specific community consultations as part 
of the social screening process and direct one-to-one consultations.  A Public Information Booklet 
will be used as an information dissemination technique to promote competition and innovation in 
technology development and advocate for poor framer groups, including women farmer groups, to 
take part in project activities.  Following review by the Bank, the safeguards instruments including 
RAPs, EMPs have been disclosed through the Infoshop and locally on the ministries’ websites, 
and through the PMUs and at Divisional Secretariats of project areas. 
 
The project will adopt following as citizen engagement mechanisms: (a) continuous community 
consultations as social preparation and screening of  subprojects; (b) social audit committees at 
local level to monitor subproject implementation; and (c) third party monitoring of project 
implementation to ensure projects benefits are distributed  equally and efficiently across different 
social groups and geographical regions.  The outcome of the citizen engagement exercises will be 
documented and reviewed during implementation support missions.

I. Introduction and Context
Country Context
Although poverty rates in Kenya seem to have fallen, formidable challenges at reducing poverty, in 
particular in rural areas, remain.  Kenya’s poverty reduction from 47 percent in 2005/6 to about 39 
percent based on best estimates in 2012/13 , has been driven by solid growth across most of the 
economy, but improvements in income are not evenly shared amongst people but also amongst 
regions and inequality appears to be rising .  The scale of consumption poverty in Kenya is 
staggering, and is concentrated in rural areas.  Based on the last national household budget survey, 
close to half of the population (nearly 17 million Kenyans) was poor in 2005, the vast majority of 
the poor lived in rural areas, and were more likely to depend on income and consumption from 
crops and livestock, as a source of livelihood. Revised poverty estimates indicate that nearly 4 in 10 
Kenyans continue to live in extreme poverty. Poverty levels are highest in arid and semi-arid areas,

with roughly 70 percent the population living in the “small share” (about 12 percent) of the more 
agriculturally productive regions of the country (source: CPS FY2014-18). Tackling poverty must 
address the difficulties of low-income rural communities as well as the distinct problems of urban 
poverty that also encompass secondary cities.  
 
Income inequality levels are not likely to have decreased in recent years, and achieving inclusive 
growth remains Kenya’s key development objective. Kenya’s Gini coefficient of 47.7 is above that 
of neighboring comparators, including Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Uganda. The richest 10 percent of 
the population garner 40 percent of the nation’s income, whereas the poorest 10 percent receive 
only 2 percent of national income. While fostering income growth of the bottom 40 is not currently 
a target set explicitly by the national authorities, in practice it is currently equivalent to fostering 
income growth of the extreme poor. Significant investment and economic reform must be part of the 
effort to cut the poverty rate by 2 percentage points each year from now to 2030 if extreme poverty 
is to be ended in that timeframe (source: CPS, FY2014-18).

Sectoral and Institutional Context
Agriculture is the mainstay of Kenya’s economy, but is not reaching its potential to fully contribute 
to poverty reduction and shared prosperity. The sector directly accounts for 25 percent of GDP, and 
provides 62 percent of formal employment, and 45 percent of government revenue.  However, 
although specific high-value sub-sectors like horticulture and tea have performed well, small-scale 
agriculture – the main livelihood for most of Kenya’s poor – has performed very poorly.  Despite 
demographic changes and urbanization, the majority of the rural population still derives their 
livelihoods from agricultural and related activities, at low levels of productivity. There is therefore a 
very strong linkage between agriculture and the overall performance of the economy as well as the 
wellbeing of the Kenyans (both rural and urban). 
 
Vulnerable groups in rural areas bear the highest incidence of poverty depending on how well they 
have been prepositioned to face shocks.  Social exclusion creates vulnerability particularly among 
women and youth.  Lack of stable income, secure shelter, isolation from markets, jobs scarcity, lack 
of access to information and technologies and knowledge, education etc. all act as drivers to social 
exclusion and lack of prosperity that is being experienced by rural families. In agriculture, women 
comprise more than 70 percent of the labor force, yet they own only 1-5 percent of agricultural land 
titles. In terms of non-agricultural employment, only 29 percent of those earning a formal wage are 
women and female youths are twice as likely to be unemployed as adult females. 
 
Management of natural resources and water catchments is critical to the well-being of the most 
vulnerable and to improving prosperity of rural communities. Kenya's growth prospects and main 
economic activities, especially agriculture, hydro-power generation and water supply are strongly 
linked to the country's environment and natural resource base.  However, such catchment areas in 
Kenya have undergone intensive environmental degradation resulting in the siltation of rivers, 
reservoirs and irrigation canals, which in turn exacerbates flooding and vulnerability.  Kenya 
already is one of the most degraded areas in the region with about 70 percent of the population 
living in the 12 percent of total land area that is classified as being of medium to high potential for 
agriculture and livestock production. Further, Kenya is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate 
change. Many of the economic activities and livelihoods rely on natural resources will be impacted 
by climate change related occurences, such erratic weather patterns, floods and droughts. Proper 
management and conservation of key catchment areas, as well as actions to respond to climate 
change (such as the adoption of climate-smart agriculture practices, or strengthening the adaptive

capacity of communities through improved access to information and services) are key strategic 
requirements for increasing for increasing agricultural productivity, poverty reduction and economic 
growth. 
   
The 2010 Constitution gives hope in addressing some of the exclusion witnessed in the past.  
Devolution to 47 Counties paves way for a more equal distribution of resources and better service 
delivery. The Constitution Bill of Rights emphasizes the need to protect the vulnerable and 
marginalized members of Kenyan communities. Much needs to be done in practice to ensure that it 
rectifies the unequal distribution of investments and services and does not instead cause service 
delivery to deteriorate. The Constitution also recognizes improved governance, transparency and 
citizen participation as essential to realize Kenyan aspirations.  
 
The Constitution and the Government’s ambitious devolution process bring major new 
opportunities, as well as near-term challenges, for enhancing poverty reduction, citizen 
participation, agricultural productivity, as well as governance. Counties now play the primary on-
the-ground role in delivering agriculture services that previously were managed by the national 
government.  Key functions related to these services were transferred to the Counties in August 
2013, and the “Equitable Share” includes significant resources that had formerly been allocated to 
national ministries to carry out these services, with national government retaining a policy making 
role. There is a major need, and window of opportunity, to support Counties to put in place 
institutional structures, mechanisms and staffing to deliver on their mandates. Many Counties are 
looking for mechanisms, such as community-led development programs, that can help to mobilize 
their citizens to take an active role in delivery of services.  
 
Kenya has significant experience supporting community-led development, agriculture and citizen-
centered governance, specifically gained from the Western Kenya Community-Driven Development 
and Flood Mitigation (WKCDD/FM) Project and the Kenya Agricultural Productivity and 
Agribusiness Project (KAPAP) .  Both projects are delivering on their development objectives and 
have demonstrated new approaches to mobilizing communities and small-scale agriculturalists, 
while facing implementation and governance challenges that have afflicted multiple projects in the 
Bank’s Kenya portfolio. These types of operations have demonstrated results in mobilizing poor 
communities to undertake initiatives that improve local livelihoods, and have progressively sought 
to incorporate lessons learned from similar community-led initiatives in South Asia and other 
regions. Experience thus far suggests that unlike top-down approaches, effective community-level 
planning and execution encourages innovative development solutions that reflect local priorities.   
 
Rural transformation in an inclusive and sustainable manner is the long-term vision of the 
Government of Kenya (GoK).  To achieve this inclusive transformation, a series of multi-sector 
programs will be required over the next 5 to 15 years. The Bank, in response to the GoK’s request to 
scale up community-led and market-driven approaches in the agricultural sector as the first program 
in the series, proposes a Kenya National Agricultural and Rural Inclusive Growth Project (P153349) 
to be implemented over five years with an approximate IDA envelope of US$200 million.

Relationship to CAS
The Government, as well as the World Bank’s new Kenya Country Partnership Strategy (CPS/
FY2014-18), places a strong priority on supporting agriculture and the devolution process to 
enhance poverty reduction and shared prosperity. Enhancing the role of agriculture in generating 
shared prosperity and poverty reduction, as well as in supporting national and County governments

to provide effective decentralized service delivery are key priorities.  The agricultural sector is 
identified as one of the key sectors of the economic pillar in the “Kenya Vision 2030” which is 
operationalized by the Second Medium Term Plan (2013-2017), as well as other key policies such 
as the Agriculture Sector Development Policy aiming to achieve 5 – 7 percent annual agriculture 
sector growth. The CPS identifies agriculture as the sector with the most potential to make a 
significant difference to Kenya’s rural poor, including women, who make up 70 percent of the rural 
labor force; and to deliver on national objectives for shared prosperity.   
 
Alignment with Country Partnership Strategy. The proposed program is fully aligned with the focus 
areas of the CPS and will contribute to its objectives through the Bank’s three key domains of 
engagement in Kenya.  First, under Domain 1 – “Competitiveness and sustainability: growth to 
eradicate poverty”, the proposed project would help achieve the high level objective of improving 
agriculture productivity and sustainability . Second, the proposed project would directly contribute 
to Domain 2 – “Protection and potential: delivering shared prosperity”, where the focus is to protect 
the vulnerable and help them develop their potential. The CPS recognizes that agriculture is one of 
the high priority areas interventions to target support for the poor that directly links with helping 
farmers in rural areas. Engaging communities and supporting especially women and youth are also 
recognized to be important. Third, the proposed project would also assist in achieving the two high 
level objectives of operationalizing the devolution framework for local decision making and smooth 
delivery of decentralized services under Domain 3 – “Consistency and equity: delivering a 
devolution dividend”.

II. Proposed Development Objective(s)
Proposed Development Objective(s) (From PCN)
The proposed development objective is to reduce vulnerabilities and promote inclusive agricultural 
and other livelihoods of the small-scale and marginal farmers in the targeted communities.

Key Results (From PCN)
Achievement of the PDO and key results are proposed to be measured by the following  indicators: 
(a) Direct project beneficiaries (number) of which female (percentage)- this core indicator will 
essentially measure the number of vulnerable and poor/small and marginal farmers (bottom 40 
percent, disaggregated by gender) benefitting from project interventions both in terms of 
infrastructure and livelihoods; (b) Communities and Counties, through their own institutions, 
implementing, operating, and managing their development activities (number); and (c) Increase of 
household incomes and assets of small and marginal farmers (less than 2 acres) (percentage).  A 
detailed results monitoring framework and indicators will be developed during the project 
preparation.

III. Preliminary Description
Concept Description
Project Approach and Scope: To promote inclusive and sustainable agricultural and livelihood 
development, the proposed project interventions will use a three-pronged approach along the key 
guiding principles of: participation, inclusion, poverty targeting, transparency, accountability, value-
for-money, and self-help. First, to address key aspects of rural development that cut across cultural, 
ecological, and socioeconomic areas , the project design will use a holistic, integrated landscape 
approach that looks at all resources (natural capital (land, water, and other natural resources), 
physical capital (infrastructure, etc.) and social capital (communities, institutions, etc.) to develop

strong horizontal and vertical collaboration with stakeholders to managing competing demands. 
Second, to effectively identify and address distinct local needs, the project will use a community-led 
approach that has been successfully providing services to rural populations in Kenya. Participation 
of the beneficiary population and County governments in all stages of the process would be 
essential for ensuring ownership and sustainability of the investments. Third, the project will adopt 
a market-driven approach to ensure that agricultural development and livelihood promotion are 
linked to markets/private sector thereby contributing to increased economic transformation and 
improved livelihoods of the target population. With focused support, a sizeable group of small 
farmers and other vulnerable groups can be a source of much needed employment and growth in the 
rural areas. The project will also place a strong emphasis on sustainability – how to build and 
sustain community-led institutions and farmer-led market associations that can raise adequate 
revenues to sustain and expand operations, and are incentivized to deliver tangible benefits for poor 
and vulnerable populations.  
 
Project Area.  Selection of the proposed project area will be defined during preparation recognizing 
that some degree of geographical concentration will be needed in order to provide widely shared 
benefits.  Roughly, the project will cover about 10 to 15 counties, benefitting about 500,000 farm-
families, about 2. 5 million population . Selection of the project area will be in done following an 
overall holistic/landscape approach, ensuring close collaboration and coordination with proposed 
IDA-supported rural roads, rural energy and devolution projects currently under preparation. The 
selection criteria could include: (i) agricultural and livestock potential areas; (ii) number of poor 
people living in rural areas; (iii) human development indicators such as malnutrition, food 
insecurity, sanitation coverage, etc.; (iv) willingness of County governments and communities to 
commit to the program’s objectives/principles and provide cash/labore or in-kind support, and; (v) 
clustering approach – in terms of both physical/biological clustering as in case of watershed, and 
economic clustering.  
 
Project Components: The project will comprise 4 components:  
 
Component 1: Support to Farmer/Community Institutions and Agricultural/Rural Livelihoods 
(roughly US$100 million of IDA Credit): This component will provide support and resources to 
communities for building and strengthening their institutions (farmer/producer groups, cooperatives, 
etc), improving agriculture and rural livelihoods (extension, technology, irrigation, natural resource 
management, finance, etc), reducing vulnerabilities such as unemployment (especially youth), 
disability, food insecurity and malnutrition, and improving quality of life (small access roads/
bridges, water, etc). This component could provide support through two windows aimed at: (a) 
providing financing for public goods, and; (b) promoting agricultural and rural livelihoods as 
private goods. The funds will be released directly to the communities in tranches based on their 
performance, and will be managed at the community level. Investments would need to be made in 
land rehabilitation and land conservation measures also to arrest erosion-induced declining land 
productivity, and connecting the farmers as well as community to roads and markets.   
 
Component 2: Strengthening Inter-community/Producer Cooperatives and Investments for 
Agricultural Value Chains (roughly US$60 million of IDA Credit): This component will support the 
strengthening of higher level farmer institutions (cooperatives, producer federations, natural 
resource users associations, etc) that help farmers and communities work together to improve 
productivity and value-addition, and to achieve efficiency and economies of scale of local activities. 
The component will also support activities that require cooperation within and across multiple

communities. Key activities proposed under this component include: (i) strengthening producer 
federations and cooperatives; (ii) developing value-chains and commercial agriculture; (iii) 
improving catchment management practices; (iv) promoting innovative technology, farming 
methods, and good agricultural practices that help target beneficiaries to improve efficiency and 
quality of their production; and (v) complementing existing subsistence strategies that promote 
climate resilience with new measures such as efficient irrigation, new crop varieties (e.g., drought 
and disease tolerant, quicker-growing), and erosion controls. These climate smart techniques and 
dissemination of climate information (e.g., seasonal forecasts and long-term trends) can address 
more intense rainfall events and water conservation measures. Component 2 will build synergies 
with other initiatives at the national level and in the project area such as feeder roads development, 
rural electrification and devolution, etc., in order to have a multiplier effect on achieving sustainable 
results.   
 
Component 3: Building Capacity of County Governments and Other Partners to Support 
Community-Led Development (roughly US$30 million of IDA Credit): This component will 
support County governments and other partners (including communities) to strengthen their roles 
and capacity as enablers of community-led initiatives for farmers and vulnerable populations. 
Proposed activities to be supported will include: (i) integrating community-led initiatives in County 
Integrated Development Planning and Budgeting processes; (ii) building County capacity including 
policies, staff, processes/systems, and monitoring; (iii) identifying and monitoring progress and 
needs of poor and marginalized communities, and; (iv) developing platforms to share information 
on ongoing initiatives, identifying and disseminating good practices, and enhancing coordination 
among different actors.   
 
Component 4: Coordination, Facilitation and Monitoring (roughly US$10 million of IDA Credit): 
This component will support overall national level coordination, facilitation, management, technical 
support, and monitoring, learning and evaluation.

(as needed):

B. Introduction and Context

Country Context
1.      During the last decade, India’s economy expanded at an average annual rate of 7.6 percent, 
and projections are for the high growth rate to continue.  Despite the headline figures on growth, 
concerns linger about the pattern of growth. India continues to face daunting challenges in 
reducing the number of poor, creating jobs, and achieving shared prosperity. Long term 
agricultural growth remains volatile, fluctuating around 3 percent per year.  With India’s labor 
force predominantly in rural areas, and about 68 percent employed in agriculture, the political, 
social and economic importance of agriculture continues. 
 
2.      The Government of India (GoI) recognizes the important role of agriculture in the ongoing 
rural-urban transformation process and the potential it represents as an important source of growth 
and job creation.  The GoI also recognizes the necessity of strategic shifts for structural 
transformation of Indian agriculture to tap into this potential of growth and job creation.  These 
shifts reflect underlying trends in demand for food and factors affecting the supply of agriculture 
produce, and include:  (i) a shift away from a focus on foodgrain production towards 
diversification into high value agriculture production of fruits, vegetables, dairy, etc.; (ii) a shift 
away from a focus on on-farm production towards value addition in the post-harvest segments of 
agriculture value chains; (iii) a shift away from a focus on productivity towards resilience of 
agriculture production systems for addressing the effects of climate change; and (iv) a shift away 
from a focus on agriculture production towards nutrition sensitive agriculture. 
 
3.       To facilitate these four shifts, GoI has launched a number of policies and initiatives since 
2014. These include, among others, a technology driven second green revolution with a focus on 
higher productivity and diversification; a “National Adaptation Fund” to meet the challenges on 
climate change; a nationwide District Level Incubation and Accelerator Programme” focusing on 
micro, small and medium enterprise (MSME) sector; and a scheme for promotion of a National 
Agricultural Market to accelerate the integrated development of agriculture marketing and trade. 
 
4. Consumer demand for food commodities in India is rapidly changing, fueled by strong 
economic growth.  The structural shift in consumption pattern away from cereals to high value 
agricultural commodities is seen both in rural and urban areas.  This in turn is generating growing 
domestic demand for higher quality/value agricultural commodities (including animal proteins) as 
the share of cereals and staples in food expenditure declines, whilst that of animal proteins, fruits 
and vegetables increases.  This provides opportunities for farmers to obtain higher incomes from 
increasingly smaller holdings. 
 
5. Signaled by changes in consumers’ food baskets, India’s agriculture and agri-food marketing 
system is poised for a profound transformation.  The agri-food marketing system is changing from 
ad hoc transactions towards coordinated systems like cooperatives, producers’ associations and 
contract farming.  Public policy has been proactive in facilitating this transformation.  The central 
and state governments have taken important policy initiatives, such as de-regulation of food 
industry, enactment of an integrated food law, de-monopolization of agricultural markets, 
reduction in excise duties on manufactured food products, and priority sector lending to food 
industry to strengthen agriculture-industry linkages.

6. Food processing is a “sunrise sector” and its share in GDP is on a continuous rise, with a 
compound annual growth rate of 8.4 percent. According to the Annual Survey of Industries 
2012-13 the food processing sector ranks first amongst all industry groups, both in terms of total 
number of factories (16%) and  number of factories in operation (16%), and third in terms of total 
output (12%), next only to ‘coke and refined petroleum products’ and ‘basic metals’.  More 
importantly, this sector is the largest employer amongst all industry groups, accounting for 11.59 
per cent of industry employment in India.  Its employment intensity can be seen by the fact that 
for every INR 1 million invested, 18 direct jobs and 64 indirect jobs are created in organized food 
processing industry.  Furthermore, food in India has an economic multiplier of 2-2.5, thus 
implying that not only the food products industry can be the antidote for India’s jobless growth, 
but that such a scenario may come at a relatively low (fixed capital) cost. 
 
7. Transition to high value commodities and opportunities in agro-food processing underscores 
the enormous potential for commercialization and income growth in agriculture (including small 
holder) as production, consumption and trade shift from traditional food crops to horticulture and 
other non-traditional (high value) commodities.  Moreover, relative to other countries, India has 
considerable comparative advantages in having a very large (growing and largely un-tapped) 
domestic market, which reduces reliance on exports as the principal driver for near term 
agriculture growth.  Nonetheless, beyond the domestic market there are also strong comparative 
and competitive advantages in developing high value agricultural trade, which is currently 
negligible.
Sectoral and Institutional Context
8. In Assam, agriculture and related sectors are the principal occupation of the vast majority of 
rural population in terms of employment and livelihood. About 90 percent of state’s population 
lives in rural areas and is mostly dependent on agriculture for their livelihoods.  Agriculture and 
the allied sectors directly or indirectly support more than 75 percent of the population, providing 
employment to about 50 percent of the total workforce.  While the average operational holding in 
India is 1.10 hectare, Assam’s farmer families are predominantly small and marginal (85%) with 
an average land holding of only 0.63 hectare. 
 
9.      The recently concluded the Assam Agricultural Competitiveness Project (AACP) was 
instrumental in increasing cropping intensity, on-farm productivity and diversification of 
agriculture in the state. Supported by AACP and other Government of Assam (GoA) initiatives, 
high value horticulture has seen a significant growth in production - the annual growth rate of 
production of fruits, spices and vegetables was 19.2, 6.4 and 72.2 percent respectively in the last 
decade, with Assam contributing significantly to national production in commodities like ginger, 
banana, pineapple, litchi, etc. As such AACP has laid the foundations for long term agriculture 
transformation in the state by shifting the focus from rice production towards diversification into 
high value agriculture production (vegetables, spices, fish, dairy etc.).  This move towards higher 
value products offers opportunities to increase contribution of agriculture to Assam’s growth. 
 
10. Diversification to higher value commodities and opportunities in specialized commodities 
reflect significant opportunities and challenges for farming communities in Assam:  growing 
specialized commodities would need adoption of rapidly changing technologies and quality 
standards.  Smallholder farmers face significant challenges in learning about and adopting rapidly 
changing agriculture technologies.  The Bank supported AACP has successfully introduced the 
Agricultural Technology Management Agency (ATMA) model, a participatory, decentralized

planning, funding and implementation of technology dissemination to district, block and village 
levels in partnerships with farmer groups, and different line departments.  While the ATMA 
platform has introduced improvements in technology transfer and demand driven extension, the 
current approach focuses mainly on production related issues.  Its capacity needs to be 
strengthened to enhance the ability of farmers to adopt efficient and market led production and 
post-harvest practices for meeting the volume, timing and quality requirements of different 
markets. 
 
11. The key constraints in structural transformation of agriculture in Assam are limited market 
access, poor post-harvest handling infrastructure and fragmented supply chains:  agriculture 
marketing in Assam is characterized by a multiplicity of regulatory authorities in the state (viz., 
local panchayats, municipalities and state agriculture marketing board).  Reforms would be 
needed not only to harmonize the regulatory regime in the state, but also for the development of 
alternative marketing options for farmers.  The supply chain is characterized by the dominance of 
middlemen at different levels, involving pre-harvest contractors, forwarding agents, commission 
agents, wholesalers, sub-wholesalers and retailers.  The existence of multiple intermediaries 
causes prices to snowball with each transaction.  Despite the comparative production advantage in 
agriculture and allied commodities, and emerging marketing opportunities, conversion of this 
advantage into competitive food processing industries has proved to be a challenge in the state.  
There is low investment in assets and limited technology penetration across the food processing 
sector in the state, even though this sector contributes about 22 percent of the industrial output 
and represents 26 percent of gross value add of the state.  The food processing sector is largely 
unorganized and operates on a small scale.  Facilitating the development of organized Micro, 
Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) both for value addition and job creation, would require 
handholding, business facilitation services, and facilitation of access to financing, along with 
critical regulatory changes for agro and allied MSMEs to flourish in the state. 
 
12.     GoA recognizes that creating conditions for agriculture based rural transformation in the 
long term would require:  (i) a shift away from a focus on on-farm production towards value 
addition in the post-harvest segments of agriculture value-chains; (ii) a focus on productivity 
towards resilience of agriculture production systems in order to deal with the effects of climate 
change; and (iii) creating the necessary conditions for the emergence of a dynamic agri-business 
and enterprise sector in Assam.  Furthermore, GoA at the highest level is committed to 
transforming the agriculture and allied sector to a more commercial and market oriented 
production; promoting MSMEs and implementing necessary reforms for realizing the project 
goals. GoA has also stated its intention that this project will form the nucleus of a much larger 
government agribusiness and rural transformation program. Fundamentally this will involve 
mainstreaming of project’s initiatives in government programs and policies as well as 
convergence of various public programs to deliver along the objectives enshrined in this project. 
Especially the government will oversee the refocusing and strengthening of training and human 
resources program to support (agriculture) enterprise development activities in Assam.
Relationship to CAS/CPS/CPF
13.   The proposed World Bank support to this project is consistent with the current Country 
Partnership Strategy (CPS) for India (2013-2017). The CPS outlines Bank support to India under 
the three pillars of integration, transformation and inclusion with a cross-cutting focus on 
improving governance, environmental sustainability and gender equality.  The proposed project is 
aligned along at least two of these three pillars – transformation, and integration.  Under 
transformation, the project will directly help achieve one of the intended outcomes of the CPS,

which is increase investor confidence and inward financial flows into the agriculture sector (CPS 
para 43).  The broader objective would be to instill a collective entrepreneurial spirit where 
producers shift from being “price takers” of primary produce, with no or very little influence over 
the market to being more business and value focused.  A key project thrust will be on enhancing 
agglomeration of producers to improve economies of scale in producing, processing and 
marketing.  In parallel with this, the project will support agriculture and livestock productivity 
(including value and incomes) through essential technology transfer in production and improved 
post-harvest and market operations, and also explore and pilot possible financing modalities to 
support entrepreneurship and agri-business (CPS outcome 2.4 para 86 and 89).  Overall, the 
support of the project to the development of higher value commodities and more efficient supply 
chains will underpin ongoing structural transformation of the economy (CPS para 34).  Under 
integration, the project offers the opportunity to increase gross state domestic product (GSDP) 
growth by stimulating private sector investment and agri-enterprise development in Assam, a 
special category state. (CPS, Outcome 1.4).  
 
14.   The project will also leverage the pent-up demand and natural resource advantages of the 
state as well as improve the investment climate (CPS para 72).  In particular, the focus will be on 
processed food, agribusiness, logistics and infrastructure, and MSME finance and insurance. The 
project will establish a new standard of excellence for entrepreneurship and business skills 
training by improving skills and knowledge transfer from trainers to MSMEs (CPS, Outcome 
1.3). Furthermore, the proposed project is aligned with the WBG’s goal of promoting shared 
prosperity.

C.  Proposed Development Objective(s)

Proposed Development Objective(s) (From PCN)
15. The proposed Project Development Objective (PDO) is to “increase value-added and 
improve resilience in the production and processing of selected agriculture commodities, focusing 
on small farmers and agro-entrepreneurs in targeted districts”.  
 
16. Project beneficiaries will include farmers and entrepreneurs especially in the MSME 
segment.  Others would include farmer producer organizations, sector management companies, 
and other value chain participants.  During preparation, specific attention would be given to 
gender inclusion in project design and implementation arrangements. The methodology followed 
to identify targeted districts is elaborated in the Annex 3, attached to the PCN.

Key Results (From PCN)
17. The Key Project Indicators (KPI) will be:  
 
a) Increase in value addition by agri-enterprises; 
b) New agri-enterprises established in the targeted districts; 
c) Number of jobs created, including for women (percent); 
d) Increase in value of agricultural marketed output per farm (in formal partnership);  
e) Increase in market oriented production – (% of farmer and area under cultivation); and  
f) Direct project beneficiaries (number), of which female (percentage).

D.  Concept Description

18.   The proposed project would support, value addition in the production and post-harvest 
segments of selected agriculture value-chains; facilitate agribusiness investments through

inclusive business models that provide opportunities to small farmers as well as stimulate the 
establishment of new small and medium agribusiness enterprises; and support resilience of 
agriculture production systems in order to better manage increasing production and commercial 
risks associated with climate change, in the targeted districts . The project would adopt a cluster 
strategy within the targeted districts to generate economies of scale; promote vertical and 
horizontal links between local agricultural enterprises; enable diffusion of innovations; leverage 
network externalities; and channel public support for services and infrastructure. By adopting a 
cluster approach, the project would enable all the value chain participants to develop competitive 
and innovative products that meet market demands rapidly and successfully. 
 
19.    The project would achieve the PDO by:  (i) promoting investments in agri-enterprises, 
reducing the business and transaction costs, facilitating access to finance for agribusiness 
entrepreneurs, and, where appropriate, push for process, regulatory and/or policy change; (ii) 
supporting the development of a modern supply chain; improved information communication 
technologies (ICT) based farm information and intelligence services, and alternative marketing 
channels; and (iii) improving producer’s access to knowledge, technologies and infrastructure so 
that they are able to respond to market opportunities and climate variability. 
 
20.    By simultaneously intervening along multiple dimensions of the growth nexus (business 
environment, key infrastructure, access to basic services, local governance), the proposed project 
aims to remove key constraints to business development and strengthen the platform for growth in 
agriculture and allied sectors within targeted districts.  By doing so, it will contribute to the key 
aspects of the GoI, GoA and the Bank’s CPS strategic objectives related to faster and broader 
agriculture sector growth and inclusive development. In line with the PDO, the project will have 
the following components. 
 
Component A: Support to Agri Enterprise Development 
 
21. The focus of this component to enhance the pace of agricultural enterprise growth and 
employment in the targeted districts.  This would be done by establishing a cohesive institutional 
platform, and securing increased private sector investment in the development of value chains, 
processing and marketing in the targeted districts. 
 
Component B: Farm - Market Infrastructure Development 
 
22. The focus of this component is to establish a modern supply chain from farm to market that 
would enable farmers and other value chain participants to access new markets. This would be 
done by enabling secondary and tertiary processing that creates higher value for the produce; 
improving value realization at the farm level through improved sorting, grading and packing of 
produce that enhances the average price realized; supporting a supply chain infrastructure that 
prevents wastage and value erosion in transportation, and allows access to more distant markets; 
and supporting the development and up-gradation of basic and agriculture-specific infrastructure, 
including transportation linkages, warehousing capacity and wholesale market facilities. 
 
Component C: Market-led Production and Resilience Enhancement 
 
23.  The focus of this component is to enable farmers in the targeted districts to take advantage of 
the rapidly changing consumer demand and ensuring resilience of agriculture production systems

in order to better manage increasing production and risks associated with climate change.  This 
would be done by diversification of their farm production; and introduction of climate resilient 
solutions. 
 
Component D: Project Management, Monitoring and Learning 
 
24. This component will ensure effective implementation of the project activities and monitor and 
evaluate project implementation progress, outputs and outcomes, building on implementation 
experience of AACP.  The component will support: (i) establishment and operations of a Project 
Coordination Unit (PCU), which will oversee and coordinate activities of the implementing 
agencies of the project; (ii) establishment and operations of Project Implementation Units in the 
respective implementing agencies; and (iii) setting up of a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) 
system for the project, including a project management information system, and contracting an 
external M&E agency to monitor project activities and impact. This component will also finance 
dedicated staffing for the project activities, consultancies, training and related material, office 
equipment, and incremental operational costs. The Project will provide investment and technical 
support for the establishment of a sound management information system and information and 
communication technology (ICT) systems and accompanying capacity strengthening of key 
personnel. 
 
25.      Green House Gas (GHG) Accounting: In accordance with guidelines for IDA 17 projects, 
GHG accounting for the proposed Project will be undertaken during the preparation phase. This 
analysis will help to measure the impact of the project on the GHG footprint and also guide 
investments that contribute to climate mitigation, given that world-over agriculture investments 
account of 25% of the GHG emissions. The conceptual framework of the proposed project 
indicates there could be reduced GHG emissions and carbon sequestration benefits as a result of 
interventions such as adoption of improved cropland management, plant nutrient management and 
conservation farming practices, soil health/fertility enhancement, whereas increased emissions 
and decreased carbon stocks could result from cropland expansion and increased electricity and 
fuel consumption during past harvest management, processing and transportation.  There is a 
paucity of specific carbon accounting data for the agri-horticulture sector.  The implementing 
agency will coordinate with the relevant departments to collect the relevant data for these 
analyses.  Furthermore, the recently concluded AACP and other government and donor-aided 
projects will provide a basis for developing carbon balance estimates for the proposed project.  
This accounting exercise will be undertaken using established methodologies that are consistent 
with the international best practice to measure GHG emissions in the proposed project.  The ex-
ante carbon balance tool developed by FAO has been selected as the primary tool for GHG 
accounting in agriculture. The analysis will be carried out by a World Bank team during the 
project preparation phase in close collaboration with state government counterparts and will be 
finalized by project appraisal.

II. SAFEGUARDS
A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis (if known)
Though the project location and boundaries are yet to be established, it is expected to cover most of 
the state, and would comprise of critical landscape features, ranging from hills and mountains on the 
one hand and floodplains and wetlands on the other. Water quality in Assam has often come under 
scrutiny for presence of natural fluorides, iron and arsenic. Assam is also endowed with a good forest

cover and rich biodiversity that is well protected with several designated Protected Areas. The 
project will support small infrastructure development including rural roads that may require land and 
leading to minimal adverse impact on people including those who belong to Schedule Tribe, 
Schedule Caste and other vulnerable groups. Proposed agri-infrastructure development under the 
project could have adverse impacts on natural features, such as, wetlands, if not sited and built 
appropriately. Disposal of construction waste would require monitoring, as it could block natural 
drainage channels if dumped casually. Such impacts would necessitate an Environmental and Social 
Assessment (ESA) and management plans and/or framework for managing adverse environmental 
and social impacts and risks.

B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
The state is well versed with the Bank’s safeguard policies, as it has, over the past several years, 
implemented the World Bank funded projects including the recently concluded Assam Agricultural 
Competitiveness Project (AACP) wherein the safeguards have been rated as Highly Satisfactory in 
the Implementation Completion and Results Report. The ARIAS society, earlier supported under 
AACP would be responsible for implementing the project’s environmental and social safeguards. 
ARIAS Society would be suitably staffed for this purpose. An ESA will be undertaken that would 
identify the potential adverse environmental and social impacts and risks. The ESA would develop 
and include an Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) that would have 
appropriate mitigation guidance for complying with the Bank’s safeguard polices. The proposed 
ESMF would draw from the experience of implementing the existing one for AACP and build upon 
new activities that would be supported under this project, including wider dissemination and use of 
the Integrated Pest Management Plan developed under AACP. A good reporting mechanism on 
safeguards already exists in AACP and will be continued. At present all project locations are not 
known, therefore the use of framework is proposed. The ESA would be undertaken based on a 
sample of locations covering most of the proposed investment activities under the project. Therefore, 
even though the nature and scope of investment activities would be known, it may so happen that 
actual physical locations may not be known until an advanced stage of preparation. Therefore, an 
ESA will be done during preparation but an ESMF would be used during implementation. As far as 
possible and as the project design evolves, the borrower would ensure that some of the sampling 
locations and sites for the ESA are actual locations/sites proposed for project interventions. In 
addition, the proposed ESMF would include a screening mechanism that would allow for preparation 
of specific EMPs to mitigate adverse impacts of infrastructure investments, once exact location and 
design of infrastructure activities are identified. These would be particularly required for rural feeder 
roads, rural markets and supply chain infrastructure. At this stage, neither the scope and nature of 
infrastructure investments nor the locations are known. By appraisal, the borrower will develop site-
specific EMPs for infrastructure whose locations have been determined and detailed technical 
designs completed.

OP/BP 4.01 completed AACP.

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 Yes The State has a widespread network of naturally 
occurring wetlands (beels) and would require 
mapping of potential impacts through project 
supported infrastructure and other agricultural 
investments.

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No The project is unlikely to bring any management 
changes to the State’s forest resources that are 
governed under a robust national law.

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes There is likelihood of use of pesticides and other 
agrochemicals once project investments are realized. 
The project would promote the wider use of the Pest 
Management Plan and Integrated Pest Management 
Plan that was developed under AACP.

Physical Cultural Resources 
OP/BP 4.11

No The project will not impact any physical, cultural 
and/or religious sites and will be implemented in 
areas where agriculture is already practiced.

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 
4.10

Yes The policy is triggered, accordingly a Tribal 
Development Framework will be prepared to address 
impact. It will also include an action plan to ensure 
that equal opportunities are provided to access 
benefits.

Involuntary Resettlement OP/
BP 4.12

Yes The policy is triggered as land may be required for 
the small infrastructure and rural roads. Resettlement 
Policy Framework including Social Management 
Framework will be prepared.

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 No The project will not support construction, 
refurbishment and replacement of equipment etc. of 
any dams. It also does not support rehabilitation of 
existing or building any new irrigation schemes 
originating from existing dams in the State.

Projects on International 
Waterways OP/BP 7.50

TBD During project preparation applicability of this policy 
would be determined based on a technical analysis.

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/
BP 7.60

No Project activities do not fall in any disputed areas.

E. Safeguard Preparation Plan
1. Tentative target date for preparing the PAD Stage ISDS
01-Sep-2016
2. Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be 
needed. The specific studies and their timing should be specified in the PAD-stage 
ISDS.
The safeguards documentation would require four to six months for completion from the time it is 
started. We expect it to be ready by September 2016.
