PROJECT SUMMARY 

1. Project Overview: 
 

1.1 The Sierra Leone Agribusiness and Rice Value Chain Support Project (SLARiS) aims 

to stimulate a viable upstream agribusiness sector in Sierra Leone in order to promote economic 

diversification, food security, sustainable employment opportunities and improved livelihoods. 

These are all key identified priorities of the New Direction Agenda and the Medium Term 

National Development Plan of the Government of Sierra Leone. The development goal of the 

project is to promote domestic agribusiness focusing on priority agricultural value chains which 

will serve as sustainable and inclusive business opportunities targeted at enhancing production 

and productivity to improve the livelihoods of men and women beneficiaries. The project will 

primarily focus on the rice value chain which is the staple food in Sierra Leone. It will also 

support the emergence of maize and livestock as secondary value chains which have the strong 

potential of meeting domestic food demands, import substitution, improving nutrition and 

farmers’ income. The SLARiS project which will be executed in the identified high potential 

agro-ecological zones in the country (specifically Kambia, Kenema and Moyamba) will be 

implemented over a period of five (5) years (2019 – 2024). The project comprises three (3) 

components namely: a) Support to Enhancement of Agricultural Input Production & 

Distribution Systems; b) Support to Agribusiness Development; and c) Institutional capacity 

development and Project Management. The total project cost is UA 8.52 million with an ADF 

Grant of UA 7.99 million (93.8%) and Government of Sierra Leone (GoSL) contribution of 

UA 0.53 million (6.2%). The project benefits from parallel co-financing from the Islamic 

Development Bank (USD 34.12 million) and the International Fund for Agricultural 

Development (USD 11.2 million) 

  

2. Needs Assessment:  
 

2.1. Sierra Leone is food insecure, with over half the population (i.e. more than 3.5 million 
people) lacking access to sufficient amounts of safe and nutritious food. The Global Hunger 

Index 2018 ranked Sierra Leone as the sixth hungriest country in the world, with an estimated 

35.7% of the population undernourished. These households are exposed to acute fragility and 

unable to cope with socio-economic and environmental shocks such as drought, floods and 

fluctuating food prices. Importation of staple foods such as rice and maize are high due to the 

inability to meet market demand through domestic production. According to the Ministry of 

Agriculture and Forestry, the total rice demand was 1,600,000 metric tons in 2018. In contrast, 

local production was only 700,000 metric tons, with the balance imported from international 

markets. The annual cost of rice imports (including seeds and grains) alone stands at about 

USD 250 million. Similarly about 20,000 metric tons (40 % of total demand) of maize is 

imported into Sierra Leone annually, which is closely associated with equally high importation 

of poultry products as the main ingredient in animal feed is maize.  

 

2.2 Despite the huge potentials of the country’s agriculture, the sector has not been able to 

attain national food and nutritional security, and generate of decent employment opportunities 

for the country’s bulging youth population. The seemingly lacklustre performance of the 

agricultural sector in Sierra Leone is the result of a combination of weak public policy and 

institutions, limited infrastructure, and failures in both the input and output markets. These 

greatly impede the sector’s productivity growth, and its capacity to support the country’s 

poverty reduction and youth employment generation efforts. Specifically production and 

productivity are constrained by low use of improved technologies particularly agricultural 

inputs (e.g. improved seed varieties, fertilizers and pesticides), low levels of value chain 

integration mainly due to inefficient systems that undercut competitiveness, limited access to 



 

v 

 

agricultural finance and a weak enabling environment. Sierra Leone’s dependency on food 

imports and food aid exacts dire socio-economic consequences on the economy and is 

unsustainable. Economic diversification to promote domestic agricultural production and 

productivity is therefore imperative. This is critical to ending hunger and enhancing food 

security as per the Sustainable Development Goals, improving economic growth, social 

welfare, livelihoods and job creation as well as building resilience to shocks.  

 

2.3 The rationale for this project is premised on the fact that Sierra Leone is endowed with 
agro-ecological conditions and water resources to support a vibrant agricultural sector. There 

is significant opportunity for growth in the agribusiness sector across the value chain. 

Furthermore, Sierra Leone’s Medium Term National Development Plan (2019-2023), the 

National Strategic Agriculture Development Plan (NSADP) (2010-2030) which is Sierra 

Leone’s in-country version of the Comprehensive African Agriculture Development 

Programme (CAADP) and the recently launched National Agriculture Transformation Strategy 

(NATS) (2019-2023) evidence clear commitment by the Government of Sierra Leone to 

diversify its economy from its dependence on mining through promoting investments to 

strengthen the agriculture sector and thereby increase its contribution to the national economy. 

Expanding the agribusiness sector will also assist the Government of Sierra Leone to tackle the 

major challenge of youth unemployment in the country (estimated at 60%) which remains an 

important source of fragility. The project will seek to create new jobs to ensure socio-economic 

empowerment, particularly amongst the youth and women by supporting them along the value 

chain. 

 

3. Bank’s Value Added: 
 

3.1 The Bank’s comparative advantage and added value in the project are derived from its 

accumulated expertise and experience in funding agriculture and agribusiness projects in 

various Regional Member Countries (RMCs). The SLARiS project will provide opportunities 

to capitalize on the Bank’s experience in supporting public sector enabled and private sector 

led growth of agricultural value chains and on the gains of past projects in the Mano-River 

Union region, other ECOWAS countries and across the continent. Lessons were drawn from 

extensive continent-wide analysis carried out under the Technologies for African Agricultural 

Transformation (TAAT) and its associated TAAT-Savanah, the Continental Investment 

Program on Rice Self Sufficiency in Africa (CiPRISSA) and the African Agricultural Seed 

Index (TASAI) program as well as various investment operations in Gambia, Ghana, Guinea-

Bissau, Senegal and Zambia. 

 

4. Knowledge Management:  
 

4.1 The project will support research and knowledge development in collaboration with the 
Sierra Leone Agricultural Research Institute (SLARI), AfricaRice and Njala University to 

develop: i) an effective agricultural input system; (ii) innovative crop production techniques 

for rice and maize in the presence of soil challenges; (iii) the emergence of a robust maize value 

chain with strong linkages to the livestock industry; and (iv) support the growth of horticulture. 

The knowledge generated from the research will be disseminated amongst farmers for better 

productivity at the farm level, agro-dealers and agribusiness actors. Additionally, this project 

will implement the ENABLE-Njala Youth Empowerment Model which is an innovative 

initiative combining research, integrated farming systems with business incubator and 

accelerator systems. These experiences will be documented and could be useful in the design 

of other youth in agribusiness development projects. Finally, collaborative knowledge 

development will enhance the systemic development of capacity in agriculture university 

faculties in Sierra Leone.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF MANAGEMENT TO THE BOARD OF 

DIRECTORS ON THE PROPOSED ADF GRANT TO THE REPUBLIC OF SIERRA 

LEONE FOR THE SIERRA LEONE AGRIBUSINESS AND RICE VALUE CHAIN 

SUPPORT PROJECT (SLARIS) 

 

Management hereby submits this Report and Recommendation for an ADF grant of UA7.99 million 

from the African Development Fund to the Government of Sierra Leone to finance the Sierra Leone 

Agribusiness and Rice Value Chain Support Project. 

I. STRATEGIC THRUST & RATIONALE 

1.1 Project linkages with Country Strategy and Objectives 

1.1.1 Rice is by far the most important crop in the food economy of Sierra Leone. With an average 
annual per capita consumption of about 131 kg which is one of the highest in the world, rice is 

synonymous with food and constitutes a larger portion of total food intake than any other cereal. In 

fact, in rural areas of Sierra Leone, rice provides up to 75% of total calorie intake. Sierra Leone was 

a net rice exporter in the 1970s and the country still retains its agro-ecological competitive advantage 

to satisfy domestic requirements for food and to increase incomes for smallholders. However, 

limitation to domestic production continue to exist principally as a result of unfavourable policies 

and insufficient access to (i) quality agricultural inputs (seed, fertilizer and pesticides) (ii) improved 

production technology and capabilities and (iii) affordable finance. The total area under rice 

cultivated in Sierra Leone is about 530,000 hectares produces an average of 700,000 metric tons/year 

(compared to an estimated annual milled-rice requirement of 1,600,000 metric tons), which 

corresponds to a very low yield of 1.3 tons/ha. Presently, there is a sharp decline in the incomes of 

farmers due to importation of rice which puts heavy stress on the country’s foreign exchanges (annual 

rice import bill averages about USD 250 million). Rapid population growth, coupled with the 

escalating rural-urban migration, and environmental degradation pose serious threats to food security 

in the country.  

 

1.1.2 The proposed project is well aligned with Sierra Leone’s Medium Term National 
Development Plan (MTNDP) (2019 – 2023). The MTNDP articulates agriculture as one of the 

primary drivers of economic diversification and inclusive economic development. At the sector level, 

the project is in accordance the National Strategic Agriculture Development Plan (NSADP) (2010-

2030) which is Sierra Leone’s in-country version of the Comprehensive African Agriculture 

Development Programme (CAADP). It is also consistent with the recently launched National 

Agricultural Transformation Strategy NATS (2018- 2023) which focuses on developing agricultural 

value chains, making available improved inputs (seeds, fertilizers, pesticides and machinery), 

increasing productivity and production, and establishing crops and livestock processing zones across 

the country. The Strategy prioritises four components, namely: rice self-sufficiency, livestock 

development, crop diversification and bio-diversity management. It strengthens three enablers that 

include: improvement of the policy environment, promoting women and youth in agriculture, and 

setting up of private-sector-led mechanisation. Implementation of the NATS is expected to address 

low productivity, improve linkages with industry and access to financial services and markets. The 

approach also targets urban, peri-urban and rural communities particularly women and the youth as 

well as improved institutions and infrastructure aimed at revitalising rural communities.  

 

 

1.1.3 The project is consistent with the Bank’s Country Strategy Paper (CSP) for Sierra Leone 
(2013 – 2017, extended to 2019) through its Pillar 1: Enhancing Economic Governance and 

Transparent Management of Natural Resources Revenue. During the CSP Mid-Term Review in July 

2016 it was decided to place more emphasis on sub-pillar 3 of Pillar 1 which deals with enabling 

business environment and private sector development, in order to enhance pay-off in deepening the 



 

2 

 

inclusive growth agenda of the strategy. Pillar 1 was specifically re-focused to emphasize private 

sector development, agribusiness and agro-processing.  The project is well aligned to sub-pillar 3 of 

pillar I of the strategy. 

1.2 Rationale for Fund’s involvement 

1.2.1 The agriculture sector in Sierra Leone is important for employment (70% of the national 

labour force), income (more than 40% of GDP) and as a source of food and nutrition. The climate 

and ecological conditions are highly favourable for agriculture. Rice is the single most important 

commodity in Sierra Leonean agriculture mainly because it is the staple food of the local diet. Nearly 

85% of Sierra Leonean farmers grow rice and it is also dominant in terms of cultivated area, volume 

produced and contribution to farm income. More than 5.4 million hectares of arable bolilands, 

mangroves, inland valley swamps, and riverine grasslands are suitable for growing rice and other 

crops. Yet only 10% of these fertile, diverse lowlands are under cultivation. Rice farming is 

dominated by smallholder farmers with average land holdings of 0.5-2.0 hectares and a few medium 

to large scale producers. 

1.2.2 Sierra Leone was self-sufficient in rice production in the 1950s and even exported rice within 

the Mano River Union region in the 1970s. However the onset of the civil war in the 1980s dealt a 

heavy blow to all sectors of the economy. In the case of agriculture, production was seriously 

undermined, agricultural extension services were handicapped and distribution of food disrupted by 

insecurity and lack of mobility resulting in severe food shortages. With the exception of the decline 

caused by the outbreak of the Ebola Virus Epidemic in 2014/2015, the Sierra Leonean economy has 

exhibited strong post-civil war recovery. Yet despite these gains in the agriculture sector continue to 

lag in performance. Over the years Sierra Leone unable to meet local demand through domestic 

production has become a net importer of food and major importer of rice, wheat flour, sugar and 

poultry. Importation of these four commodities consumes an average of $ 700 million of the country’s 

foreign exchange annually. Rice imports alone account for 14.3% and has been on the increase over 

the past decade. Current domestic rice output is 700,000 metric tons compared to total domestic 

demand of 1,600,000 metric tons (approximately 42.9% rice self-sufficiency). The national demand 

for rice is expected to increase to an estimated 2,130,000 metric tons by 2025. Locally produced rice 

is not only more nutritious but also attracts a 15% to 20% premium over comparable grades of 

imported rice. Rising population and domestic demand for local rice presents a viable opportunity 

for investment in domestic rice production. 

1.2.3 Three critical constraints to on-farm productivity in Sierra Leone were identified as access to 

inputs including finance, improved technologies and access to markets. The supply of improved seeds 

fertilizer, agrochemicals and animal feeds is below current demand and far below potential demand. 

According to data collected in the 2015 Comprehensive Food Security and Vulnerability Assessment, 

the most commonly constraint cited by farmers to increasing agricultural production was the 

unavailability of improved seeds. The continuous involvement of Government in the production, 

procurement and distribution of seeds, fertilizers and other agro-inputs to the farmers at non-

competitive market prices is a major disincentive to private sector involvement in agricultural 

transformation that ought to be government-enabled and private sector-led. It is estimated that only 

5% of farmers in Sierra Leone have access to improved seeds varieties. Furthermore, agricultural 

input distribution systems are weak with a ratio of 1 agro-dealer for every 17,033 agricultural 

households in Sierra Leone. Addressing these constraints will improve production and productivity, 

and the latter will lead to better incentives for producing improved food availability, employment 

(particularly for the youth and women) and higher household incomes. 

1.2.4 With the recent volatility in iron prices, the need to diversify the economic base of Sierra 

Leone becomes ever more compelling. Sustainable reductions in poverty will depend on key sectors, 

particularly agriculture, which employs the majority of the population, especially in rural areas. The 



 

3 

 

renewed focus will be to transform the largely subsistence low-input, low-output agriculture into a 

more productive and commercialized system capable of creating gainful employment as a basis for 

broad-based poverty reduction. The project will promote agricultural transformation by supporting 

the emergence of competitive agribusinesses in the agricultural input supply sector.  It will incite the 

development of a private sector driven agricultural input (seeds, fertilizer and pesticides) production 

and distribution which is key to ensuring the timely availability of high-quality of improved, 

appropriate products at affordable prices for commercial and smallholder farmers in Sierra Leone. 

Furthermore, the project will provide support to national institutions and policymakers to create and 

maintain enabling environments that will accelerate the development of competitive formal input 

systems to adequately farmers. 

 

1.2.5 Rice has been selected as the initial crop that this project will focus on because there is strong 

domestic demand for it along with consumer preference. While maize will be the secondary crop due 

its market potential and linkage to the livestock and fisheries industries through its use in the 

production of animal feed.  The project will therefore promote inclusive economic development by 

targeting areas where rice and maize farming is already being practiced but has not been taken to its 

full economic and business potentials. To this end, the project will serve as a bridge between the 

existing major players and medium to small scale producers through supporting out-growers scheme 

with technical assistance. The project seeks to ensure socio economic empowerment, increase the 

involvement of both genders in the advancement of the agribusiness sector in Sierra Leone; create 

conditions for equitable access by men and women to project resources and increase decision-making 

for women along the agricultural value chain. Project interventions will thus deliberately target 

women and youth as beneficiaries and provide opportunities to increasing household income levels. 

 

1.2.6 The project activities are closely aligned to the Bank’s Country Strategy Paper as it will 

induce a great level of private sector participation in the sector’s development and overall economy 

at large. Furthermore, the project is consistent with the Bank Group’s policies and strategies including 

the Ten Year Strategy (2013-22) and the High Five Priority Areas particularly Feed Africa, and 

Improve the Quality of Life of Africans. It supports the Bank’s Strategies for African Agricultural 

Transformation (2016-2025) and Jobs for Youth in Africa (2016-2025) as well as the Strategy for 

Addressing Fragility and Building Resilience in Africa (2014-2019). The project is also firmly rooted 

in the Bank’s main agriculture flagship programs focused improving agricultural productivity 

through technology dissemination and scaling (TAAT, TAAT-S and PHAP), enhancing resilience to 

climate change through climate-smart agriculture and promoting youth empowerment (ENABLE 

Youth). Finally, the proposed project is line with the Bank’s Regional Integration Strategy 

Framework 2018-2025 (Pillar 2: Trade and Investment, which also includes the “Agricultural 

Transformation”) and the CCAP of the Bank for promoting climate-resilient agriculture. 

1.3 Donor Coordination 

1.3.1 Sierra Leone continues to be highly dependent on external development assistance. The Bank 

engages in dialogue with Development Partners under the guidance of the aid effectiveness principles 

embodied in the Paris Declaration, Accra Agenda for Action and Sustainable Development Goal No. 

17 - strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable 

development. The main DPs active in the agriculture sector include the AfDB, the World Bank (WB), 

the IsDB, the IFAD, the FAO and WFP. The Presidential Taskforce on Agriculture chaired by the 

President of the Republic of Sierra Leone and comprised of the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, 

other relevant Ministers and heads of DPs active in the agricultural sector is the main decision-

making body and coordination mechanism in the sector. In addition, an Agriculture Advisory Group, 

comprising DPs, private sector and others, provides technical support to program implementation. 

The Bank is an active participant in the DP Group and other diverse micro and thematic advisory 

groups including the National Rice Working Group.

1.3.2 This project is the outcome of extensive consultations with DPs in the agricultural sector. It 

benefits from parallel co-financing from the IsDB (USD 34.12 million) and IFAD (USD 11.8 

million). The SLARiS project will focus on optimizing the agricultural input supply system which 

would feed into the IsDB financed Rice Value Chain Development Project (RVCDP) and the IFAD 

financed Agricultural Value Chain Development Project (AVDP) both of which target upstream 

production and value addition. 

II. PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
 

2.1 Project Components 
2.1.1 The overall goal of the project is to stimulate a viable upstream agribusiness sector in Sierra 

Leone in order to promote economic diversification, food security, sustainable employment 

opportunities and improved livelihoods.  The specific project objective is to transform the agricultural 

input supply sub-sector as a viable and inclusive business opportunity, in order to promote enhanced 

production and productivity required to improve the livelihoods of beneficiaries along priority value 

chains (rice and maize).  
 

2.1.2 This objective would be achieved through: a) support and promotion of reliable access to 

quality input markets (seeds, fertilizers and pesticides) through liberalisation, adequate regulation 

and certification of the sub-sector sector which in turn is expected to facilitate the entry of new actors 

and expansion of business opportunities by the existing players; b) creation of an enabling 

environment for private sector led agribusiness growth upstream in the value chain through support 

to the emergence and growth of private seed producers and agri-input (seeds, fertilizers and 

pesticides) agro-dealers;  c) empowering young men and women to engage in the agriculture sector; 

d) supporting growth in farmer efficiency, productivity and income through providing improved 

technologies, climate-smart farming techniques, innovations and good agricultural practices; and e) 

increasing reliable output market through strengthening outgrower farming models. 
 

2.1.3 The project consists of the following components: (1) Support to Enhancement of 

Agricultural Input Production & Distribution Systems; (2) Support to Agribusiness Development; 

and (3) Project Management and Institutional Capacity Development.

2.2 Technical solutions retained and other alternatives explored  

2.2.1 The technical solutions which were retained comprises of a multipronged approach based on 

government creating an enabling environment to drive domestic private sector production and 

distribution of agricultural input supply for farmers in order to increase production and productivity 

in the targeted value chains. In addition, the youth empowerment scheme under the project 

encapsulates technical training as well as practical skills in agriculture and agribusiness activities. 

Two alternatives to the investment approach were considered and rejected are as follows: 
 

Table 2.2: Project Alternatives Considered and Reasons for Rejection 

 

2.3 Project Type 

2.3.1 This intervention is designed in the form of a stand-alone Investment Project with the main 

aim of up-scaling production and productivity and reducing imports of rice and maize through 

provision of agribusiness development, technical assistance and capacity building. 

2.4 Project cost and financing arrangements  

2.4.1 Project Costs: The total cost of the project is estimated at UA 8.52 million (USD 11.93 

million), net of taxes and customs duties, and based on 2019 prices, comprising  36.29% of the total 

cost in foreign cost, and 63.71 % in local costs. The project cost comprises an ADF grant of UA 7.99 

million (USD 11.19 million) (93.8 %) and GoSL in-kind contribution of UA 0.53 million (USD 0.74 

million) (6.2%). This cost is inclusive of physical and price contingencies estimated at average rates 

of 6% and 7% respectively. The price contingencies were estimated on the basis of actual and 

projected levels of local and foreign inflation rates of about 5.5% and 2.2% per annum, respectively. 

The physical contingencies are estimated from 0 to 15%. The ADF grant contribution to the project 

cost exceeds the threshold of 90% stipulated by the Policy on Expenditures Eligible for Bank Group 
Financing. This is justified by evident commitment to the project exhibited by the GOSL which is a 

transition state confronted with budget constraints in the face of significant development challenges.  

A summary of the project cost estimates by components and expenditure accounts is shown in Tables 

2.3, 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6 below, while details are provided in the Technical Annexes – Volume II of the 

appraisal report. 
  

Alternative name Brief description Reasons for rejection 

Alternative 1 Support the development of 

special agro-industrial 

processing zones in Sierra Leone  

Currently the level of agricultural productivity and 

production of priority crops is too low to sustain a 

viable SAPZ. This could be considered for future 

projects. 

 

Alternative 2 Focus AfDB financing on 

infrastructure development of 

feeder roads in the same area at 

the IsDB project 

Better value for money would be derived from 

available AfDB allocation by financing the 

establishment of a viable private sector led 

agricultural input supply system, agribusiness 

enhancement and youth development compared to 

a purely infrastructure investment in feeder roads.

2.5 Project’s target area and population  

2.5.1 Project Areas: The project interventions will be implemented in the high agricultural 

production potential zones of Kobia and Rokupr (Kambia), Kenema (Kenema) and Njala (Moyamba) 

Districts. These areas were selected following initial technical recommendations and also after the 

stakeholder consultations based on the criteria of: (i) potential for successful rice and maize 

production; (ii) market proximity; (iii) population and poverty incidence; and (iv)ability to build 

synergies with parallel co-financed investments of other development partners particularly the IsDB 

and IFAD. 

 

2.5.2 Project Beneficiaries: The estimated number of direct beneficiaries is about 32,000 farmers 

in the high potential targeted regions/zones. In addition, 1000 young agri-preneurs and 4000 young 

graduates (disaggregated by age and gender) will benefit from the incubation program and the new 

agribusiness training curriculum respectively. The project will create approximately 50,000 direct 

jobs and improve the lives of 150,000 indirect beneficiaries. 

2.6 Participatory process for project identification, design and implementation 

2.6.1 The Project was conceived following GoSL request to the AfDB to support a Rice Value 

Chain Development Project in 2018. On the strength of this formal request, the Bank fielded a project 

identification mission between 21 and 26 September 2018, followed subsequently by a preparation 

mission from 21 to 30 January 2019. An appraisal mission was mounted between 18 and 29 March 

2019 to fine-tune the project. The proposed project is the result of wide and detailed consultations 

with the various stakeholders including the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Ministry of Trade 

and Industry, Ministry of Youth, National Youth Commission, Ministry of Social Welfare, Gender

and Children’s Affairs, Ministry of Technical and Higher Education, Sierra Leone Agricultural 

Research Institute, Sierra Leone Seed Certification Agency, the Seed Multiplication Program, private 

sector actors including seed companies, animal feed millers, the Sierra Leone Chamber for 

Agribusiness Development, the Environmental Protection Agency, various Commercial Banks, and 

wide range of Development Partners (IFAD, IsDB, FAO, EU, WFP and WB). Apart from bilateral 

and focus-group meetings, a stakeholder consultative workshop which brought together 

representatives of the various stakeholders of the project was also organised during the appraisal 

mission. 

2.6.2 In effect, the project design and its listed activities were the outcome of broad-based 

consultations (meetings, discussions and workshops) with all the stakeholders who expressed their 

views on what the project should aimed at achieving. This participatory and consultative process 

clearly identified lack of quality inputs (particularly seeds), technologies and finance as three key 

challenges to the development of the agriculture sector. The components of the project were therefore 

designed to address the problems identified during consultations. The participatory process will 
continue throughout program implementation to ensure ownership and sustainability. 

2.7 Bank Group experience, lessons reflected in project design  

2.7.1 The Bank’s ongoing portfolio comprised a total of 18 operations, with a total commitment of 

UA 129.49 million (Annex 1). In terms of sector distribution, infrastructure accounts for 89.12% of 

the total portfolio, of which energy, transport, water and sanitation account for 45.14%, 20.48% and 

34.38% respectively. Although the Bank was previously active in the agriculture sector having 

funded 8 operations and studies since inception, there is currently no active agriculture project in the 

portfolio. The 2018 Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR) assessed the overall performance 

of the portfolio as satisfactory, with a rating of 2.96 on a scale from 1 to 4. Implementation progress 

(IP) was rated 2.93, while average development objective (DO) was rated 3.0 indicating that the 

ongoing operations have high likelihood of meeting their development objectives. There is no project 

at risk. The overall supervision rating is Non-PP/Non-PPP. The Country Policy and Institutional 

Assessment (CPIA) rating is 3.2 for 2014 (3rd Quintile). There is no Project Completion Report (PCR) 

backlog for closed Projects. Nevertheless, the CPPR highlighted challenges in existing project 

implementation including procurement, contract and financial management and results monitoring 

and evaluation. The CPPR recommended that the Bank should continue improving portfolio quality 

ensuring higher quality at entry of project, providing regular fiduciary clinics to project management 

agencies and increasing the use of country systems where possible.  

 

2.7.2 The Bank has accumulated notable experience in the implementation of agriculture sector 

projects in Sierra Leone. Although the last agriculture project closed in 2013, previous agricultural 

projects funded by the Bank include the Torma Bum Rice Development Project, the Moyamba 

Integrated Rural Development Project, the Northern Integrated Agricultural Development Project, 

the Artisanal Fisheries Development Project, the NERICA Rice Dissemination Project and the 

Agricultural Sector Rehabilitation Project. The Bank has gained useful experiences from its on-going 

and previous operations across various sectors in the country. The lessons garnered from these design 

and implementation experiences as well as the CPPR have been duly incorporated into this project.

2.8 Key performance indicators  

2.8.1. The project’s key performance indicators to be measured throughout the project life are 

presented in the Results Based Logical Framework. The M&E expert of the PMU will carry out 

internal project monitoring and evaluation in collaboration with MAF to monitor performance. 

Regular implementation progress will be measured through Quarterly Progress Reports, bi-annual 

Bank supervision missions (by Headquarters and CoSL), and annual technical and financial audits. 

The main indicators defined for monitoring the program outputs, outcomes and impact include: (i) 

poverty reduction; (ii) improved incomes; (iii) reduction in food imports; (iv) improvement in seed 

quantity and quality; (v) number of young men and women agripreneurs trained; (vi) number of youth 

and women led agribusinesses established; (vii) improvement in market linkages; and (viii) number 

of beneficiaries (males and females) trained. 

 

Various supervision missions and periodic progress reports will systematically render an account on 

the achievement level of the indicators. These will be regularly presented to decision and policy 

makers to guide project mid-term review and to facilitate project management after completion. 

III - PROJECT FEASIBILITY 

3.1 Economic and financial performance  

3.1.1 A financial assessment of the project was undertaken using activity models, and on the basis 

of prevailing market prices. The key assumptions underlying the analyses include: (i) Additional 

quantity of foundation seeds (rice- 9500 metric tons and 2600 metric tons maize) will be produced at 

full capacity of the project; (ii) production of certified improved seed varieties; (iii) a 10-year time 

period was used to measure the incremental benefits from the project. Farm gate prices were used in 

estimating the total revenue from the project; (iv) the opportunity cost of capital (OCC) used for 

discounting future benefits was estimated to be 12%. For the economic analysis; (v) hired labour 

value was adjusted by a conversion factor of 0.75. These analyses were carried-out with financial 

and economic costs generated using Costab 32. Summary of financial and economic analysis is in 

Annex VII and further elaborated in Annex B6 in Volume II of the appraisal report. 

 

3.1.2 On the basis of the above-captured assumptions, the project is expected to generate the 

following benefits: (i) Increase rice production and productivity resulting in total annual rice of 

1,600,000 metric tons; (ii) Increase maize production and productivity resulting in total annual rice; 

of 150,000 metric tons; (iii) improve market linkage and value chain for rice and maize production; 

(iv) improve average household income of beneficiaries to USD 800; and (v) provide employment 

for 20,000 farmers and entrepreneurs.

FIRR, NPV (base case) 19%         USD  12,105,388.14 

EIRR (base case) 20%         USD  16,325,400.25 

NB: detailed calculations are available in Annex B6 

 

 

3.1.3 Financial analysis: Based on the above assumptions, the financial analysis generated Net 

Present Value (NPV) of USD 12,105,388.14 and internal rate of return (IRR) of 19%, as captured in 

the technical annexes (B6). Based on the above analysis, the project is deemed financially feasible. 

The FIRR of 19% is higher than the opportunity cost of capital (12%). 

 

3.1.4 Economic analysis: The economic analysis was conducted using the same approach as the 

financial analysis, on the basis of shadow prices (prices in conditions of the efficient market 

operation) of tradable goods and total cost of project. In addition, other indirect benefits were also 

expected, such as, easy access to markets through market linkages; provision of agro-service centre, 

reliable market information system and business developments from the incubation trainings. 

However, these additional benefits were difficult to value in monetary terms due to the limited scope 

of this report, hence they could not be adequately captured in the analysis. In these conditions, the 

economic analysis yielded an NPV of USD 16,325,400.25 and EIRR of 20% as captured in the 

technical annexes. 

 

3.1.5 Sensitivity Analysis: The results of the sensitivity analysis indicate that with 5%, 10% and 

15% decrease in production the FIRR decreases to 18%, 17% and 16% respectively. The same 

exercise was carried out for successive decrease in prices by 5, 10, and 20% with a combination of 

yield decline. A decrease in output prices by 20% (switching values) would have to occur before the 

project’s economic benefits reduces to break-even point at 12%, the opportunity cost of capital. A 

combined 10% decrease in output price and 15% decrease in output will break-even at 12%, the 

opportunity cost of capital. 

3.2 Environmental and Social Impacts  

3.2.1 Environment: Based on the proposed project scope the environmental and social (E&S) 

classification is Category 2 according to the African Development Bank’s Environmental and Social 

Assessment Procedures (ESAP). There are parallel co-financed investments from the Islamic 

Development Bank, the World Bank and IFAD and these donors had earlier prepared Environmental 

and Social Management Framework, and Pest Management Plan for the project. These documents 

were reviewed and found to have followed the African Development Bank Environmental and Social 

Assessment Procedures (ESAP). Hence these safeguards documents were adopted and their 

Executive Summaries disclosed on the Bank’s website on 22nd May 2019.  

 

3.2.2 The classification and attendant requirement is commensurate with the project classification 

stipulated by the Sierra Leone Environmental Protection Regulations. The principal objectives of 

conducting this environmental and social assessment and planning was to ensure that the project 

integrates mechanisms to reduce environmental impacts along the entire value chain, from 

production, marketing to product value addition/manufacture, usage and disposal.  

 

3.2.3  Environmental and Social Management Framework indicate that although the project will 

have some site specific negative impacts, it is also posed to have numerous positive impacts among 

them, notably: (i) improved production and competitiveness of selected agriculture commodities that 

will contribute to increased income opportunities for value chain actors, and support the local 

economy of the provinces; (ii)  reduced food imports; (iii) improved agronomic practices and 

technologies for rice and maize improved varieties that are adapted to the local conditions; (iv)  

improved agricultural production, productivity and market linkages that will foster job creation along 



 

12 

 

the value chains (improve quality and quantities of seeds; (v) improved incomes for women and men;  

(vi) increased  number of private sector input producers and distributors; (vii) increased training of 

Youth (disaggregated by gender); (ix) established youth-led agribusinesses ; and (x) improved market 

linkages. 

 

 3.2.4 The negative impacts will stem from a number of rehabilitation activities in the infrastructure 

development and value chain components of the project. The potential negative impacts of the project 

include those associated with the rehabilitation and equipping of two Seed Multiplication Centers, 

agriculture production and value chain activities. Rehabilitation activities may result in; (i) noise, 

vibration and emissions from operation of machinery that may impair air quality and induce health 

implications; (ii) generation of wastes (including rehabilitation waste and construction wastes); (iii) 

occupational health and safety of the rehabilitation crew. During operation phase, agriculture 

activities of value chain actors may lead to: (i) increased use of agrochemicals including pesticides 

and fertilizers, which may contribute to soil and water (surface and groundwater) contamination, and 

increase health-risks of people exposed to pesticides; and (ii) waste and effluents from processing 

and marketing facilities. These impacts are site specific and can be readily managed with the 

application of well-defined measures elaborated in the detailed site specific ESMPs. Some of the 

mitigation measures to be implemented include: (i) refilling the exposed or excavated soil soon after 

completion of works and avoiding or minimizing compaction of soils; and (ii) capacity building of 

value chain actors to promote good agriculture practices, improved agriculture technologies such as 

integrated soil fertility management (ISFM), integrated pest management (IPM) and sustainable land 

and water management practices.  

 

3.2.5 Climate Change: Agriculture production in Sierra Leone is vulnerable to the impacts of 

climate variability and change. Drought and floods are increasing in frequency and intensity, while 

average temperatures during the growing season are rising. Crop failures, reduction in productivity 

and outbreaks of pest and diseases are exacerbated by extreme climatic events. Cognizant of the 

national commitment to combat climate change, the project is being prepared taking into 

consideration the various National Strategies, Plans and Institutions relevant to Climate Change 

Overall, the project will facilitate climate resilience along the selected value chains by promoting 

climate smart agriculture and improved agriculture technologies. 

 

3.2.6 Gender: Women make up more than half of Sierra Leone’s agricultural labor force yet they 

are under-represented in land ownership and income. Discussions during the appraisal mission 

identified four major constraints that limit women’s productivity (as compared to men) and their full 

inclusion in the domestic agricultural economy namely: lack of access to assets, lack of access to 

financing, limited training and time constraints. To alleviate these constraints, the project will seek 

to: (i) increase the number of female entrepreneurs in agribusiness by providing training and 

improving access to financing; (ii) increase income by improving productivity and training women 

in core business skills; (iii) increase access to niche markets by marketing products from women-led 

value chains; and (iv) reduce women time constraints by providing them with improved technologies 

and adequate agro processing equipment’s and trainings.  

 

3.2.7 Five actions and interventions will foster these expected results: trainings and sensitization 

campaigns, financing, enhancing market links, strengthening women’s business groups and 

increasing their access to farm inputs. To implement these actions and monitor them efficiently, the 

Project Management Team will include a Youth and Gender expert to work closely with the Gender 

in agriculture and Nutrition Unit of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry as well as the Ministry 

of Social welfare, Gender and Children’s Affairs. Based on the above expected outcome, activities 

and strategy, the project is classified as Category 2, in accordance with the Bank’s Gender Marker 

System.

3.2.8 Human Capital, Youth Employment and Jobs: The rapidly growing youth population and 

youth unemployment was a major root cause of the outbreak of civil conflict. According to the 

National Youth Commission of Sierra Leone, the problem of youth unemployment is very complex 

as there are three categories of unemployed youth: uneducated, semi-skilled, and educated youth. 

Approximately 60% of youth are underemployed or unemployed and an estimated 800,000 youth 

today are actively searching for employment. Furthermore, illiteracy remains a persistent challenge 

and youth that lack the skills and education find it extremely difficult to compete for the limited jobs 

available. The main reasons for this high level of unemployment are lack of financial or other 

resources to start businesses, family responsibilities and the lack of skill requirements or experience. 

This frequently causes feelings of hopelessness and despair among young people pushing them to 

migrate from rural to urban areas .As young people move to the urban areas in search of better 

opportunities, urban migration is exerting more pressure on the limited infrastructure. The need to 

address youth unemployment and its underlying causes cannot be over-emphasized, given that large 

numbers of unemployed youths are a potential source of insecurity in view of their vulnerability to 

recruitment into criminal and violent activities. Youth unemployment in Sierra Leone has been 

recognized as a potential trigger for social instability, the prolonged state of underdevelopment and 

economic stagnation. 

 

3.2.9 Agricultural transformation is one of the key enablers for employment and job creation 

especially for young people in Sierra Leone and Africa at large. This project will support agribusiness 

training/incubation, entrepreneurship development through establishing an Enable Youth 

Agribusiness Centre of Excellence in partnership with Njala University of Agriculture.  In an 

integrated model the Agribusiness centre will offer multi-purpose training to meet the needs of Njala 

university students, rural youth and farmers including women. It will offer trainees an 

integrated/holistic practical training opportunity to gain experience from the units that will be 

established at the university (sequenced from production, harvesting, agro-processing, packaging, 

sales and marketing). This practical experience is expected to prepare the trainees for both 

employment and agripreneurship. A tracer study will also be carried out to monitor the progress 

achieved by youth supported by the project. It is estimated that 1,000 young promising agripreneurs 

will be supported to establish their own businesses while 4,000 will be equipped with technical skills 

to access employment. The project will create approximately 50,000 direct jobs and further 150,000 

jobs indirectly. 

 

3.2.10 Social Impact: The project will increase farmer incomes, improve livelihoods and 

consequently support better health, education and well-being indicators among project beneficiaries. 

Youth (both male and female) employment has a positive social impact on economic growth and 

productivity that cannot be ignored. When a great amount of skilled youth and university graduates 

(including young women) in Sierra Leone are able to find jobs and put their knowledge and 

capabilities into innovation and contributing to economic growth. Furthermore, having a large share 

of the workforce mainly youth employed will lead to increase productivity and gross domestic 

product (GDP). Increased capacity of youth (including women) through skill development and job 

creation under the Project will strengthen community cohesion and empowerment thus making it less 

likely for youth to engage in violence crime. 

 

3.2.11 Addressing Fragility: Sierra Leone has made significant progress in consolidating peace and 

security country-wide and in rebuilding its economy that was nearly destroyed by the decade long 

conflict. While Sierra Leone has not fully recovered from the twin shocks of the 2014-2016 Ebola 

crisis and slump in global commodity prices that severely affected the economy and created political 

uncertainties, it has been able to maintain security in the aftermath of the drawdown of the UN 

Mission and conducted peaceful political transition between parties. Rapid urbanization fuelled by 

migration of mainly youth from rural localities into the city of Freetown in search of opportunities is 

posing serious development challenge for the Government of Sierra Leone. In post conflict country 



 

14 

 

of such with major infrastructural deficits, the mass movement of people into Freetown increases 

more pressures on the Government and slow development of the city. Urban migration rate is 

currently 4.20% (about 46,000 people per annum) of the existing 1.1 million people living in 

Freetown which is exerting more pressure on the city limited infrastructure as estimated 15% of the 

country population lives in Freetown and environs alone. This has resulted to creating unsafe 

settlements around the city especially protected enclaves.  

 

3.2.12 Sierra Leone continues to experience some challenges stemming from the root causes and 

drivers of fragility which manifested itself over the decade-long conflict. The underlying drivers of 

fragility continue to pose significant downside risks for the country’s development. The root causes 

of fragility persist in all their political, economic, social and environmental dimensions and 

expressions. Intermediate drivers of fragility, such as limited national cohesion, food insecurity, high 

rates of youth unemployment, gender inequality, high levels of perceived and real corruption, weak 

human and institutional capacities and poor economic governance systems, especially public 

financial management (PFM) and limited revenue management systems are prevalent. With the 

above, the country has more pressures compared to capacity to withstand it. Increasing the Sierra 

Leone capacity and at the same time reducing these pressures through meaningful interventions will 

assist build resilience. 

 

3.2.13 Involuntary resettlement: There will be no resettlement as a result of the project. Any 

proposed activity will be located in areas which have no land disputes. No land acquisition is 

envisaged under this Project. 

IV.    IMPLEMENTATION 

4.1 Implementation Arrangements  

4.1.1 Executing and Implementing Agencies: The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry will be 

executing agency and will execute the project through a project management team to be established. 

The Sierra Leone Agricultural Research Institute (SLARI), Njala University and SLESCA will be 

implementing entities of certain activities of the project. 

 

4.1.2 A National Project Steering Committee (NPSC): The National Project Steering Committee 

will be constituted   of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (Chair), Ministry of Finance, Ministry 

of Planning and Economic Development, Ministry of Youth/ National Youth Commission, SLARI, 

SLESCA, SLECAD, Farmers Federation, Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development, 

Ministry of Social Welfare, Gender and Children’s Affairs, Environmental Protection Agency, Njala 

University, Civil Society Representative as well as the Chairperson of the each of the District 

Councils . The NPSC will be convened by the Chair on a semi-annual basis. The NPSC will be mainly 

responsible for: (i) policy and strategic guidance on all issues relating to the project; (ii) approval of 

project investments; (iii) approval and monitoring of project annual work plans and budgets; and (iv) 

resolving implementation bottlenecks and providing positive impetus to facilitate achievement of the 

project’s development objectives (results/outcomes). The Project Core Team on behalf of the 

Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, will convene the NPSC meetings and act as its Secretariat. The 

NPSC will provide guidance and general oversight functions, including policy and strategic 

orientation of the program. 

 

4.1.3 Project Management Team (PMT). The project management team will include: (i) Project 

Manager, Internationally recognised Seed Expert, Agribusiness Specialist, Social/Gender Expert, 

Crop/Extension Expert and Youth Coordinator, M&E Specialist, Procurement Specialist and an 

Accountant. The Project Manager, Seed Expert and the Fiduciary Team would be advertised and 

recruitment done on a competitive basis, while the other experts will be designated by the Ministry 

of Agriculture and Forestry. The team will report to the Permanent Secretary through the Chief 



 

15 

 

Agriculture Officer in the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and would be charged with the 

management and coordination of the Project’s activities. All team members will be subject to annual 

performance-based contracts and (ii) the project will also fund the necessary IT and office equipment 

as well as field vehicles to facilitate supervision and coordination activities. The project management 

team will be based in Moyamba District. 

 

4.2 Procurement and Financial Management Arrangements  

4.2.1 Procurement Arrangements: The Procurement of goods, works and consultancy services 

financed by the Fund will be carried out in accordance with the “Procurement Framework for Bank 

Group Funded Operations” dated October 2015 for high value contracts and the Recipient’s 

Procurement System for low value contracts.  The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Food 

Security will serve as the executing agency for this project and a Project Management Team (PMT) 

will be established that will be charged with the responsibility of implementing the project.  The 

Project Management Team will comprise a Procurement Specialist who will be recruited on a 

competitive basis to provide support on procurement related activities and also mentor the existing 

Procurement Officers managing the procurement unit of the ministry.  The PMU will carry out the 

procurement of goods, works, and consultancy services including preparation of procurement plan, 

standard bidding documents, open and evaluate bids, contracting and management of contract 

execution.  

 

4.2.2 Procurement Risks and Capacity Assessment (PRCA): The procurement capacity of the 

Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry was assessed and it was noted that the Procurement Officers are 

University graduates and they have acquired some experience on the Recipient’s procurement 

system. However, they have limited knowledge and experience on the Bank’s Procurement 

framework and will require further procurement training and mentoring on the use of donor 

procurement policies in readiness to assume procurement function of the a National Development 

Partners Program Coordination Office (NDPPCO).The procurement plan for the project will be 

prepared for the entire project duration and included in Section B5 of the Technical Annexes to this 

report. 

 

4.2.3 Financial Management: The financial management of the project will be handled an 

experienced qualified Project Accountant (PA) with hands-on experience on use of accounting 

software and practical application of International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS, 

Adopted by the GoSL for financial reporting). The Project Accountant (PA) will be competitively 

recruited. The PA will use the Tompro Accounting package (in harmony with other projects under 

MAF) for accounting and financial reporting. On a quarterly basis the PA will generate interim 

financial reports (IFRs) from Tompro, for the benefit of MAF and transmit copies to the Fund within 

30 days after the end of each calendar quarter. The project financial statement at end of the year shall 

be audited and certified copies together with the related management letter submitted to the Fund 

within 6 months after the end of each financial year. A  Financial Management Manual (FMM) and 

Project Implementation Manual (PIM) will be customised from the existing manuals and adopted to 

codify FM practices and guide project implementation. The internal auditor responsible for MAF 

will provide internal checks and periodically review project operations. The internal auditor will 

report to the NPSC through the Director of Technical Services and the NPSC ensure that all audit 

recommendations implemented and monitored. 

 

4.2.4 Disbursement Arrangement: Four disbursement methods are used by the Fund in disbursing 

funds to projects. The assessment recommends: (i) Direct payments; and (ii) Payments through 

Special Account (SA) under this project. The other 2 methods –reimbursement and reimbursement 

by guarantee shall be available to the project, if desired. Direct payments will be used for the 

payments against larger contracts signed between project management and contractors/suppliers/ 

service providers. The SA method will be used for meeting recurrent/ administrative expenses and 



 

16 

 

smaller contracts under the project. Here, a United States Dollar denominated Special Account will 

be opened at a Commercial Bank acceptable to the Fund, to receive funds from the Fund. A local 

currency account will be opened at same Bank to receive transfers from the SA for making payments 

in local currency. A second local currency account will be opened at the same bank for project 

operations.. All disbursements will follow with the disbursements procedures outlined in the Bank’s 

Disbursement Handbook. 

 

4.2.5  External Audit: The Auditor General (AG) of Sierra Leone will be responsible for the audit 

of the project on an annual basis in line with the Constitution of Sierra Leone, and use of country 

systems. Whilst the project will not pay related audit fees from its resources for audits performed by 

the AG, it shall bear reasonable incidental audit expenses duly submitted by the AG and cleared by 

the Fund. However, in instances of workload, where the AG cannot perform the audit, MAF and the 

Fund will be notified in time for an independent audit firm to be competitively recruited. The auditor 

terms of reference (TOR) will be agreed with the Fund. Certified copies of the audit reports, together 

with the accompanying management letter, must be submitted to the Fund within six (6) months at 

the end of each financial year.  

4.3 Monitoring and Evaluation  

4.3.1 The M&E system will be developed and managed by the M&E Officer, within the framework 

of the project Results Based Logical Framework. The M&E Officer will regularly track, document 

and report the project’s results and progress, facilitate knowledge building, and share knowledge with 

key stakeholders. The monitoring and reporting plans will be developed based on gender 

disaggregated indicators in the log frame. It will be part of the obligation of all project implementers 

to provide reports in prescribed format on outputs and outcomes achieved within the implementation 

agreements. The Project will provide financial resources to facilitate training, proper data gathering, 

processing and reporting. 

 

4.3.2 The project’s reports and key milestones are indicated in the table below. The Fund will 

supervise the implementation of the project through regular Supervision Missions which will be 

undertaken at least twice a year. These missions will verify implementation progress to ensure that 

key verifiable indicators, including gender specific indicators, related to the outputs, outcomes and 

impacts are being monitored. The M&E activities, including implementation progress and 

expenditure will therefore be an integral part of the project implementing agency, as a regular 

management function through the PMU’s M&E Specialist. The PMU will submit to the Fund 

progress reports, annual work plans and budgets, and annual procurement plans using Fund’s format. 

The quarterly progress report will be submitted to the Fund within 45 days after the end of the 

reporting period, whilst the annual progress report will be submitted within three months after the 

end of reporting period.

4.4 Governance 

4.4.1 According to the 2018 Mo Ibrahim Index on African Governance (IIAG), Sierra Leone ranked 

26th out of the 54 African countries assessed with a score of 50.9 which is slightly higher than the 

continental average of 49.9. Sierra Leone’s performance across four categories of governance namely 

(a) Safety & Rule of Law (20th out of 54), (b) Participation & Human Rights (15th out of 54), (c) 

Sustainable Economic Opportunity (39th out of 54), and (d) Human Development (44th out of 54). 

With regard to corruption perception, the 2018 Transparency International Report ranks Sierra Leone 

129th out of 180 with a Corruption Perception Index (CPI) of 30, on a scale of 0 (high corruption) to 

100 (very low corruption). 

 

4.4.2 In order to support the ongoing reform momentum in the country and foster good governance, 

the Fund, in close collaboration with the IMF and other partners, has regularly maintained sustained 

policy dialogue with the Sierra Leonean authorities through reform and institutional support 

operations. The government’s recent reform to operationalize the Treasury Single Account is a 

welcome step, as are policies to ensure that spending commitments are in line with the available 

financing envelope. More broadly, these efforts will lead to better governance, helping promote 

macroeconomic stability and inclusive growth. 

 

4.5 Sustainability 

4.5.1 One of the key aspects of the project is commercial orientation. This implies bringing out the 

business opportunities in the agriculture sector. The project activities will lead to the emergence of 

business oriented agripreneurs who are expected to run their businesses as a going-concern with the 

enhanced capacity they will receive from the project. This will lead to economic sustainability of the 

project. Also, the participatory approach adopted during the design stage of project will continue 

even at implementation in order to enhance ownership by beneficiaries thus ensuring sustainability. 

Implementation through government line ministries will ensure that project activities are in line with 

broader government programmes. All the critical enabling infrastructure that the project would invest 

in under the SMP, SLESCA and the ENABLE-Njala Youth Program will have in place, a 

management arrangement that would ensure that they are run on commercial basis by private 

operators under special management agreement with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. 

4.6 Risk management 

4.6.1 Risks to the successful implementation of the project and attainment of targeted outcomes 

and impact will stem primarily from the uncertainty in Government’s commitment to liberalize the 

domestic seed sector. The mitigation is that the National Seed Act was promulgated in 2017, which 

clearly depicts a publicly enabled but private sector driven seed sector.  

 

4.6.2 A related risk is the ability of private sector agro-input producers and agro-dealers to 

effectively fill the market void that would be created from Government’s withdrawal from 

procurement and distribution of seeds and other agro-input. The mitigation is that the project will 

support the provision of incentives including training and capacity building to provide a conducive 

enabling environment for private sector growth during the gradual withdrawal of Government from 

the sub-sector. 

 

4.6.3 Another risk relates to the novelty in the implementation of a commercially oriented youth in 

agribusiness empowerment project within an existing national university in Sierra Leone. The 

mitigation here is that they would not offer the service free but the project will pay for the incubation 

of the identified entrepreneurs who will form satellite farms for the anchor investors. The mitigation 

is that Funds will be managed by a carefully selected funds manager and also the risk for default by 

borrowers limited as the cost Potential risks are summarized below. The overall risks are rated 

moderate as they are manageable and mitigation measures will be in place.

Table 4.6: Potential Risks and Mitigation Measures 

 

No. Potential Risk Rating Mitigation Measures 

1. Government commitment to deregulating 

the agricultural input supply sector. 

Low Project is aligned to the MTNDP & 

NATS’s focus of economic 

diversification and private sector led 

supply systems 

2. Political influences of SMP, ENABLE-

Njala & SLeSCA  

Low SLESCA, SMP & ENABLE-Njala 

will be run as PPP outfits to ensure 

autonomy, efficiency and 

sustainability. 

3. Young agripreneurs are unable to establish 

viable businesses on their own. 

Medium Incubation training, business 

development, competitive seed grant 

and linkage to markets are provided to 

increase probability of success 

4.7 Knowledge building  

4.7.1 The project will support research through providing support to the Sierra Leone Agricultural 

Research Institute (SLARI) which has a long standing cooperation with the Consultative Group for 

International Agricultural Research Agencies. This research will support the development of 

improved breeder and foundation seeds for rice and maize as well as the varietal maintenance of these 

varieties. The project also includes collaborative knowledge development through Njala University, 

the foremost agricultural university in Sierra Leone. The knowledge generated through these research 

avenues will be disseminated to farmers through strengthened extension services to support better 

productivity at the farm level and youth to promote agribusiness development.
